Among the patients with mycotic aneurysm, 57 % had subarachnoid hemorrhage without warning. Forty-three percent had a neurolo-gic prodrome 2 days to 18 months (median 17 days) prior to {{discovery of the}} mycotic aneurysm. A <b>focal</b> <b>deficit</b> consistent with embolism {{was the most common}} prodrome (23 %). However, {{there was no significant difference}} in the frequency of neurologic symptoms between patients with and without mycotic aneurysm. During an average follow-up of 40 months, there were no instances of subarach-noid hemorrhage/mycotic aneurysm among 121 patients discharged after a full course of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, the risk of rupture of an unsuspected mycotic aneurysm following a full course of antibiotics is low. When a prodrome does precede a mycotic aneurysm, it most often is a <b>focal</b> <b>deficit</b> consistent with embolism.

30|$|ICMA are {{relatively}} rare, accounting {{for less than}} 10 % of neurologic complications of IE. They usually result from septic embolization to the vasa vasorum or to the intraluminal space of the vessel itself. Septic emboli are responsible for an inflammatory lesion starting on the adventice surface and ultimately destroying the intima. ICMA are multiple in 25 % of the cases and are mostly located in the distal branches of the middle artery. Streptococci {{and to a lesser}} extent S. aureus are responsible for most ICMA. Nonruptured ICMA are responsible for fever, headache, seizures, and <b>focal</b> <b>deficit.</b> Patients with ruptured ICMA have sudden arachnoid or intracerebral bleeding, associating decreased level of consciousness, intracranial hypertension, and <b>focal</b> <b>deficit.</b> Rupture generally occurs at the early phase of IE, but in some patients, especially those with streptococcal IE, rupture may observed during antibiotic course of even after the end of therapy. CT-scan angiography and MR angiography are of equal value to detect ICMA > 5 mm. Although conventional angiography may still be useful for the detection of very small ICMA, two-dimensional and three-dimensional helical CT also have high sensitivity [21].|$|E

The frequency of symptoms was: <b>focal</b> <b>deficit</b> 61 %, sensory disturbance 17 % and seizures 2 %, while 20 % remain asymptomatic. The most prevailing lesion was cerebral ischemia (76 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Foreign accent {{syndrome}} (FAS) {{is a rare}} {{speech disorder}} characterized {{by the appearance of}} a new accent, different from the speaker's native language and perceived as foreign by the speaker and the listener. In most of the reported cases, FAS follows stroke but has also been found following traumatic brain injury, cerebral haemorrhage and multiple sclerosis. In very few cases, FAS was reported in patients presenting with psychiatric disorders but the link between this condition and FAS was confirmed in only one case. Case presentation In this report, we present the case of FG, a bipolar patient presenting with language disorders characterized by a foreign accent and agrammatism, initially categorized as being of psychogenic origin. The patient had an extensive neuropsychological and language evaluation as well as brain imaging exams. In addition to FAS and agrammatism, FG also showed a working memory deficit and executive dysfunction. Moreover, these clinical signs were related to altered cerebral activity on an FDG-PET scan that showed diffuse hypometabolism in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes bilaterally as well as a <b>focal</b> <b>deficit</b> {{in the area of the}} anterior left temporal lobe. When compared to the MRI, these deficits were related to asymmetric atrophy, which was retrospectively seen in the left temporal and frontal opercular/insular region without a focal lesion. Discussion To our knowledge, FG is the first case of FAS imaged with an 18 F-FDG-PET scan. The nature and type of neuropsychological and linguistic deficits, supported by neuroimaging data, exclude a neurotoxic or neurodegenerative origin for this patient's clinical manifestations. For similar reasons, a psychogenic etiology is also highly improbable. Conclusion To account for the FAS and agrammatism in FG, various explanations have been ruled out. Because of the <b>focal</b> <b>deficit</b> seen on the brain imaging, involving the left insular and anterior temporal cortex, two brain regions frequently involved in aphasic syndrome but also in FAS, a cerebrovascular origin must be considered the best explanation to account for FG's language deficits. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Brain abscess still poses {{a public}} health {{challenge}} {{in spite of the}} advent of modern neurosurgical techniques and antibiotics. Here, we present our surgical experiences and ultimate outcome in the management of brain abscess. Methods: Totally, 162 patients with proved brain abscess who underwent surgical treatment were included in this study. The prospectively recorded data of surgical management of brain abscess and the ultimate outcome (by Glasgow outcome scale) were studied retrospectively. Results: Total number of cases was 162, of which 113 were acute pyogenic abscess while 49 were chronic abscess. Among the chronic abscess, 29 were chronic pyogenic abscess, 14 were tubercular, 3 aspergillus, and 3 abscesses were in malignant brain metastases. In acute cases, common clinical features were headache, fever, vomiting, <b>focal</b> <b>deficit</b> and seizure. In chronic abscesses, common clinical features were mild to moderate headache and progressive <b>focal</b> <b>deficit.</b> Seventy-three (45. 06 %) patients had adjacent localized sinus, middle ear or cranial infection. The common predisposing factors included postneurosurgery, postpenetrating injury to brain, chronic suppurative otitis media, and congenital heart disease, infective endocarditis, sinusitis and sub optimum immuno-status. Frontal lobe involved in 30. 2 % cases, temporal lobe is next to involved. Single time burr hole aspiration in 111 (68. 5 %) cases, two or more times burr hole aspiration were done in 34 (21 %) cases. Pus culture was negative in 129 (79. 62 %) cases. Total number of death was 22 (13. 58 %) cases. Complete resolution of abscess with complete recovery of preoperative neuro-deficit was seen in 80. 86 % cases and recovery with major neuro-deficit was observed in 5. 55 % cases. There is a significant association between Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on admission and mortality in brain abscess. Conclusion: In most of the cases, pus culture did not yield growth of any causative organism. Mortality was not directly related to surgical intervention, but GCS on admission has a significant association with mortality. Early diagnosis, optimum follow-up and timely surgical interventions are the keys in the proper management of brain abscess...|$|E
