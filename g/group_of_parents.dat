40|$|Previous mother-infant {{interaction}} research generally characterized {{mothers of}} Down syndrome infants as a homogeneous group, with uniform and specific styles of interaction. This strategy <b>of</b> comparing <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> mentally retarded children with <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> nonretarded ones, ignoring {{the wide range}} of interactive patterns that characterizes both groups, seems to be based on unidirectional models, assuming that a behavior of Down syndrome's mothers can be explained according to the major psychological and biological variables of these children. The present research, focusing its analysis on the study of the variability of dyadic behaviors allowed the organization (construction) of homogeneous classes, defined by different interactive patterns, that integrate dyads of normal and retarded groups. The findings confirm the existence of patterns of association between interaction and symbolic activity. These results, agreeing with the transactional approach of the development, indicate that the variability of dyadic transactions, can not be exclusively explained based on maternal (socio-economic status, schooling, etc.) or children's variables (presence or absence of pathology), showing how necessary {{a deeper understanding of the}} factors that determine the nature of the interactive process is.

Research Questions: There are significant differences in the results of stress and social support among <b>parents</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> children with different disabilities, in order to improve intervention strategies with families? Purpose of Study: Parental adjustment to disability relates to the effectiveness with which families use the resources of their social network. We intend to analyze stress and social support differences among <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with different disabilities and clarify relationships between the variables in order to suit family intervention strategies. Research Methods: A comparative research of descriptive correlational nature was undertaken.
