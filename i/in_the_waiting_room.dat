5|$|Until {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, Giffnock had no church buildings, and {{religious}} meetings took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> of Giffnock Railway Station and, later, in the clubhouse at Eastwood Golf Course. Orchardhill Parish Church, designed by HE Clifford and completed in 1899, was the first church built within Giffnock.

Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E
5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 {{hours a day for}} the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E

5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E

25|$|Enclosed garden patios are {{on either}} side of the waiting room, and {{passengers}} exiting the trains were originally directed through the southern garden. The lower parts of the interior walls are covered in travertine marble; the upper parts have an early form of acoustical tile.

The signs and magazines in the waiting rooms were in English. The ABCC did not actually treat the survivors they studied, they just studied them over periods of time. They had them come for examination during weekday working hours, causing the person to lose a day of pay, and they offered little compensation to the survivors.|$|E

25|$|Before {{his next}} session with Melfi, Tony rips out {{a page from}} a cooking {{magazine}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room.</b> Melfi exhibits hostility towards Tony throughout the session, sarcastically suggesting aggressiveness for his problems. Tony takes offense, which prompts Melfi to suggest referring him to a different therapist. Tony attempts to defuse the argument, but Melfi insists they are done and uses Tony's action of ripping out the magazine page {{as an example of}} his disrespect and lack of seriousness to therapy. Although he recently said he wanted to quit therapy himself, Tony is still aghast that Melfi would end their sessions not long after his son attempted suicide. Before leaving, Tony demonstratively puts the page back into the magazine and leaves. Melfi closes the door, symbolically ending her professional relationship with Tony.|$|E

How would you react to that?" [...] He imagined the character Jigsaw having been given one or two years to live and combined that with the idea of Jigsaw putting others in a literal version of the situation, but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate.|$|E

Andy sends Darryl a text that only reads [...] "Megan Fox", a reference to the actress. Creed notes that he understands, but cannot speak, Pirate slang. Andy attempts to motivate Michael with a pep talk taken from the 1979 movie Rocky II. During Michael and Oscar's discussion {{in the lobby of the}} office building, a copy of Call of Duty can be seen behind the counter.

500|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{heads down}} to Florida {{to meet with}} Robert California at the Sabre {{headquarters}} to discuss a possible manager position. While sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> Dwight talks to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), {{who describes himself as}} the [...] "toilet of the company" [...] who flushes all the unwanted items away. Robert then tells Dwight that he cannot meet with him but will have him meet with Bill, another executive, much to Dwight's frustration. However, Robert manipulates the situation by secretly calling Gabe and instructing him to not let Dwight speak with Bill either, but to have Gabe listen to Dwight's pitch and then reject him. Dwight, after being told by Gabe that he is not wanted as a manager, grabs and twists Gabe's arm and forces him to be taken to Robert's Florida condo. Initially, Robert tries to spare Dwight's feelings, but eventually turns him down by telling him he is a better salesman and his drive and energy would be wasted in a manager's position. Dwight then returns to Scranton.|$|E
500|$|In the hospital, as Buffy {{listens to}} the doctor confirm how Joyce died, the doctor says something, but the words [...] "I have to lie to you {{to make you feel}} better" [...] are spoken discordantly, as though, {{according}} to cinema scholar Katy Stevens, Buffy [...] "constructs what she believes to be an unmentionable truth—her culpability in her mother's death". In the same scene, Dawn is shot with a hand-held camera that drifts, giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe, unlike what Buffy already knows, that her mother's body is down the hall on a steel table. The scene with Buffy and Tara sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> was noted by Rhonda Wilcox for its reality in showing Gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous, particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for Maybelline while Buffy aired. Buffy sits with circles under her eyes, unflattering hair, and slumped posture next to Tara, who had been criticized for being too heavy, despite her body type being more typical of women her age.|$|E
500|$|Writing for AllMovie, Andrea LeVasseur {{rated the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars, called it [...] "memorable and pivotal", and {{described}} the Red Room dream as [...] "unforgettable". Jen Chaney, writing for The Washington Post, has called the episode [...] "the best in the series". Chaney described it, and the dream sequence specifically, as having [...] "turned Twin Peaks into a water-cooler phenomenon", and noted that it may have inspired later series such as The Sopranos and Lost to [...] "feel comfortable taking risks with their audience". The Washington Post Tom Shales has described the dream sequence as [...] "the scene that separated the men from the boys", noting that it further polarized the series' audience, attracting loyal viewers and putting off others. The sequence, and the episode as a whole, attracted negative criticism from The Boston Globe Ed Siegel, who felt that the series [...] "lost its magic" [...] by this point. Siegel added that [...] "anyone with less than a semester's worth of either Postminimalism101 or Absurdism102 can come up with dancing dwarves, one-armed men, psychic detectives, psycho killers, llamas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> and hints of incest and necrophilia", and felt that a reliance on surrealism made Lynch seem to be a [...] "one trick pony".|$|E
