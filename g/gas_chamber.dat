5|$|About 120 SS {{personnel}} {{were assigned to}} the gas chambers and lived on site at the crematoria. Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each <b>gas</b> <b>chamber,</b> while the bulk of the work was done by the mostly Jewish prisoners known as Sonderkommandos (special squads). Sonderkommando responsibilities included guiding victims to the gas chambers and removing, looting, and cremating the corpses.|$|E
5|$|According to Slovak filmmaker Juraj Herz, {{the scene}} in which {{a group of women}} confuse an actual shower with a <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film Zastihla mě noc (Night Caught Up with Me, 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.|$|E
50|$|Lyotard {{uses the}} example of Auschwitz and the revisionist {{historian}} Faurisson’s demands for proof of the Holocaust {{to show how the}} differend operates as a double bind (a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions). Faurisson will only accept proof of the existence of <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> from eyewitnesses who were themselves victims of the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers.</b> However, any such eyewitnesses are dead and are not able to testify. Either there were no <b>gas</b> <b>chambers,</b> in which case there would be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, or there were <b>gas</b> <b>chambers,</b> in which case there would still be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, because they would be dead. Since Faurisson will accept no evidence for the existence of <b>gas</b> <b>chambers,</b> except the testimony of actual victims, he will conclude from both possibilities (<b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> existed and <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> did not exist) that <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> did not exist. This presents a double bind. There are two alternatives, either there were <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> or there were not, which lead to the same conclusion: there were no <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> (and no final solution). The case is a differend because the harm done to the victims cannot be presented in the standard of judgement upheld by Faurisson.|$|R

5000|$|In September 1942, Stangl {{supervised}} {{the building of}} new, larger <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> to augment the existing <b>gas</b> <b>chambers.</b> The new <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> became operational in early autumn 1942. It is believed that these death chambers were capable of killing 3,000 people in two hours, and 12,000 to 15,000 victims easily every day, with a maximum capacity of 22,000 deaths in 24 hours. According to Jankiel Wiernik: [...] "When the new <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> were completed, the Hauptsturmführer Stangl came and remarked to the SS men who were with him: 'Finally the Jewish city is ready' (Endlich ist die Judenstadt fertig)".|$|R
5|$|The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz {{took place}} in early September 1941, when 900 inmates were killed by {{gathering}} them {{in the basement of}} Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B. This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing. They were ordered to undress outside and then were locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a <b>gas</b> <b>chamber,</b> the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an air raid shelter for the SS. The <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis began {{shipping}} {{large numbers}} of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz {{in the middle of}} 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were told they were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, three SS {{guards were}} killed — {{one of whom}} was burned alive by the prisoners in the oven of Crematorium II — and 451 Sonderkommandos were killed. Hundreds of prisoners escaped, but were all soon {{captured}} and executed, along with an additional group who participated in the revolt. Crematorium IV was destroyed in the fighting, and a group of prisoners in the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> of Crematorium V was spared in the chaos.|$|E
5000|$|At a joint {{press conference}} with Mordechai Vanunu in Jerusalem in December 2004, Maguire {{compared}} Israel's {{nuclear weapons to}} the Nazi <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> in Auschwitz.

[...] She added, [...] "Nuclear weapons are only <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> perfected ... and for a people who already know what <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> are, how can you even think of building perfect gas chambers." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order for}} Leuchter or Rudolf to {{demonstrate}} the significance of their findings, {{it is necessary for}} them to prove the necessity of Prussian blue formation under the conditions that the homicidal <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> were operated. Showing that the delousing chambers have Prussian blue and that the homicidal <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> do not, proves nothing, if it cannot be shown that conditions in the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> were such as to produce Prussian blue.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber.</b> The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, but with all the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> selections.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and <b>gas</b> <b>chamber.</b> Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E

50|$|Several {{passengers}} {{believed the}} showers {{would turn out}} to be <b>gas</b> <b>chambers,</b> something that Löb writes one of the SS guards confirmed with a grin. Bauer cites this fear as evidence that the Hungarian-Jewish community was well aware of the information about the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> inside Auschwitz. Between August 1943 and May 1944, Rudolf Vrba and three other Auschwitz escapees had passed information about the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> to Jewish and other officials; it was this information that Vrba believed Kastner had access to but did not distribute widely enough.|$|R
5000|$|Defenders of Mayer {{argue that}} his {{statement}} that [...] "Sources {{for the study}} of the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> are at once rare and unreliable" [...] has been taken out of context, particularly by Holocaust deniers. Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman observe that the paragraph from which the statement is taken asserts that the SS destroyed the majority of the documentation relating to the operation of the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> are [...] "rare" [...] and [...] "unreliable".|$|R
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber,</b> which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, {{lying on the}} floor of a <b>gas</b> <b>chamber.</b> Three men, dressed in black uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to a dimly lit room in which Rihanna sits at a table with her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, they take it turns holding to their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night standing in the middle of a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat. The video ends with her lover apparently committing suicide with the revolver placed between them.|$|E

5000|$|If Leuchter {{had gone}} to the archives, if he had spent time in the archives, he would've found {{evidence}} about ventilation systems, evidence about ways to introduce Zyklon B into these buildings, evidence of <b>gas</b> <b>chambers,</b> undressing rooms. Robert Jan van Pelt Leuchter incorrectly assumed that the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> were not ventilated. The basement <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> of Crematoria II and III were mechanically ventilated via motors in the roof space of the main crematorium structure capable of extracting the remaining gas and renewing the air every three to four minutes.|$|R
50|$|In February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, Director of the Forensic Institute of Cracow, redid the analysis. Markiewicz {{decided that}} the Prussian blue test was {{unreliable}} because it depended on the acidity of the environment, which was low in the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers.</b> Markiewicz and his team used microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers,</b> from delousing chambers, and from living areas elsewhere within Auschwitz. The negative control samples from the living quarters tested negative, while cyanide residue was found in both the delousing <b>chambers</b> and the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers.</b> The amount of cyanide found had a great variability, possibly due to 50 years {{of exposure to the}} elements to varying degrees, but even so, the categorical results were that cyanide was found where expected in both the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> and the delousing facilities, and not found in the living quarters, supporting the hypothesis that the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> were exposed to high levels of cyanide like the delousing facilities, and not low levels for routine fumigation, like the living quarters.|$|R
5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E
25|$|Most gas {{chambers}} were dismantled {{or destroyed}} as the Soviet troops approached, {{except for those}} at Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Majdanek. The <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> at Auschwitz I was amongst those blown up. It was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial, albeit with the entry door and the wall that originally separated the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> from a washroom removed. The door that had been added when the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> was converted into an air raid shelter was left intact.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, {{the last}} person to be {{executed}} in the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> was German national Walter LaGrand, sentenced to death before 1992, who was executed in Arizona on March 3, 1999. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled that he could not be executed by <b>gas</b> <b>chamber,</b> but the decision was overturned by the United States Supreme Court. The <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> was formerly used in Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina and Oregon. Six states, Arizona, California, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri and Wyoming, authorize lethal gas if lethal injection cannot be administered, the condemned committed their crime before a certain date, or the condemned chooses to die in the <b>gas</b> <b>chamber.</b> In October 2010, New York governor David Paterson signed a bill rendering gas chambers illegal for use by humane societies and other animal shelters.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} claims by Holocaust deniers that the <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> which {{mainstream}} historians believe {{were for the}} massacre of civilians never existed, but rather that the structures identified as <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> actually served other purposes. These other purposes include cadaver storage, delousing, and disinfection. A similar argument is sometimes used that claims gas {{was not used to}} murder Jews and other victims, and that many <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> were also built after the war just for show. A document advancing this theory is the Leuchter report by Fred A. Leuchter, a paper stating that only traces of cyanide were found when he examined samples taken from one of the Auschwitz <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> in 1988. This is often cited as evidence that gas was not used in the chambers, as no trace amounts remain. Despite the difficulty of finding traces of this material 50 years later, in February, 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, Director of the Institute of Forensic Research in Kraków, redid the analysis. Markiewicz and his team used microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the suspected <b>gas</b> <b>chambers,</b> from delousing chambers, and from control areas elsewhere within Auschwitz. The control samples tested negative, while cyanide residue was found in high concentrations in the delousing chambers, and lower concentrations in the homicidal <b>gas</b> <b>chambers.</b> This is consistent with the amounts required to kill lice and humans.|$|R
