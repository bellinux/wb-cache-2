50|$|Ubiquitous robot (Ubibot) is a robot {{incorporating}} {{three components}} including virtual software robot or avatar, real-world mobile robot and embedded sensor system in surroundings. Software robot within a virtual world can control a real-world robot as a brain {{and interact with}} human beings. Researchers of KAIST, Korea describe these three components as a Sobot (Software robot), Mobot (Mobile robot), and <b>Embot</b> (Embedded robot).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the components and overall {{architecture of the}} ubiquitous robot (Ubibot) system developed to demonstrate ubiquitous robotics, a new paradigm for integrated services. The system has been developed {{on the basis of}} the definition of the ubiquitous robot as that of encompassing the Software robot Sobot, Embedded Robot <b>Embot</b> and the Mobile Robot Mobot. This tripartite partition, which independently manifests Intelligence, Perception and Action, enables the abstraction of intelligence through the standardization of sensory data and motor or action commands. The Ubibot system itself is introduced along with its component subsystems of Embots, the Position <b>Embot,</b> Vision <b>Embot</b> and Sound <b>Embot,</b> the Mobots of Mybot and HSR, the Sobot, Rity, a virtual pet modeled as an artificial creature, and finally the Middleware which seamlessly enables interconnection between other components. Three kinds of experiments are devised to demonstrate the fundamental features, of calm sensing, context awareness and seamless service transcending the spatial limitations in the abilities of earlier generation personal robots. The experiments demonstrate the proof of concept of this powerful new paradigm which shows great promise. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—One {{of the key}} {{components}} of an ubiquitous robot (Ubibot) is the software robot (Sobot), which can communicate with embedded robot (<b>Embot)</b> and mobile robot (Mobot). Sobot is a virtual robot, which {{has the ability to}} move to any place or to connect to any device through a network without any spatial limi-tation. <b>Embot</b> has the capability to sense the surroundings and to interpret the context of the environment and can communicate with Mobot and Sobot. Mobot provides an integrated mobile services. To incorporate Sobot, <b>Embot,</b> and Mobot reliably as an Ubibot, a middle layer is needed to arbitrate different protocols among them. This paper focuses on incorporating Sobot and Mobot to overcome physical limitations of Sobot for physical behaviors in real situa-tions. To implement the incorporation of them, the basic concept and structure of the middle layer are proposed. The effectiveness of the middle layer for Sobot and Mobot is demonstrated through real experiments. Index Terms—Middle layer, mobile robot, software robot, ubiq-uitous robot...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{ubiquitous}} robot (Ubibot), a 3 rd {{generation of}} robotics, is introduced as a robot incorporating three forms of robots: software robot (Sobot), embeded robot (<b>Embot)</b> and mobile robot (Mobot), which can {{provide us with}} various services by any device through any network, at any place anytime in a ubiquitous space. Sobot is a virtual robot, which {{has the ability to}} move to any place through a network. <b>Embot</b> is embedded within the environment or in the Mobot. Mobot provides integrated mobile services, which are seamless, calm and context-aware. Following its definition, the basic concepts of Ubibot are presented. A Sobot, called Rity, developed at the RIT Lab., KAIST, is introduced to investigate the usability of the proposed concepts. Rity is a 3 D synthetic character which exists in the virtual world, has a unique IP address and interacts with human beings through an <b>Embot</b> implemented by a face recognition system using a USB camera. To show the possibility of realization of Ubibot by using {{the current state of the}} art technologies, two kinds of successful demonstrations are presented...|$|E

Also robot genome is proposed to implement a genetic robot, which is to investigate ”The Origin of Artificial Species. ” To implement the robot genome, artificial chromosome is introduced. This paper shows the personality of genetic robots is decided by their genome. 1...|$|E
