5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{activities}} are fostered by the lowest personal and corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> in the EU, and the third-lowest public debt of {{all member states}} at 28.7% of GDP in 2016. In 2016, GDP (PPP) was estimated at $143.1billion, with a per capita value of $20,116. Sofia and the surrounding Yugozapaden planning area are the most developed {{region of the country}} with a per capita PPS GDP of €20,600 ($27,400) in 2014. Bulgaria is a net receiver of funds from the EU. The absolute amount of received funds was €589 million in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on {{domestic}} issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{effective}} <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> {{of the company and}} its comparison with the statutory corporate <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> The theoretical part includes general definition of effective <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> and describes its classification. Furthermore it describes Czech Republic's tax system with a detailed focus on corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> and its calculation. The practical part analyses the effective <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of the company chosen. The ex-post evaluation method has been used to calculate the company's effective <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> This index has been compared with the statutory <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> via distortion ratio. The conclusion involves determination of the average effective <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of the related industry and its comparison with the effective taxation indicator calculated...|$|R

The situation concerning the personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> is pretty similar to that concerning <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> on corporate <b>income.</b> Countries which have reduced their corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> have similar levels for the personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> but, as far as the personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> is concerned, there has not been the same accentuated reduction, as compared to the decreasing trend for corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R
50|$|Taxpayers {{with middle}} and higher income who mainly receive {{income from capital}} gains have usually an {{advantage}} from this new method of taxation. The reason is the low flat rate of 25% instead of being taxed with the personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> In Germany the highest personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> is 45%. Taxpayers with a small income have no disadvantage because of the alternative of being taxed with their personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> (see above). The lowest <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> starts at 14%.|$|R

The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.|$|E
5|$|During Reagan's presidency, federal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> were lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of}} the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. Other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period of 1970–2010. Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of state <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation}} in per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

He said he aims to create a “strong middle class” by promoting higher education and lowering <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> He was also endorsed by Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who won the presidential election. Romulo, however, didn't win the race and was ranked 22nd on the tally.
