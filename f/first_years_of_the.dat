5|$|At the Grey Cup level, the Argonauts {{have faced}} an {{assortment}} of teams in recent decades rather than any one team regularly. The Edmonton Eskimos, for years a dominant team in the league, became a rival. The two teams' five Grey Cup match-ups include an epic 38–36 Toronto loss in 1987 and most recently, the Snow Bowl victory in 1996 led by the arm of Doug Flutie. In the pre-CFL days, the Argos had a Grey Cup rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and a cross-town rivalry with the University of Toronto in the <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grey Cup championship, including the Argonauts' first win in 1914.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{occupation}} of Norway by Nazi Germany, Ull continued to host private parties.

Ull instead used the Grand Hotel for its sixtieth anniversary in 1943 and the annual convention of 1944. Two new members were admitted during the war; Sverre Martens and Einar Poulsson.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, {{a degree}} of tension existed between the {{government}} and the army, which divided its allegiance between government and King. The Free Belgian forces, particular the infantry who had been training since 1940, held the government responsible for not being allowed to fight. In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their inactivity. By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, {{the states}} in the Great Lakes region created the LMCT {{as part of a larger}} program of tourist routes in the region; US141 carries the LMCT between the {{northern}} I-43 junction in the Green Bay area north to the split with US41 at Abrams. In the <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, US141 was expanded to a four-lane expressway northward from Abrams to Oconto Falls. A further upgrade in 2006 expanded the highway to four-lanes northward to Beaver. On April 7, 2015, the segment of US141 that runs concurrently with US41 on the west side of Green Bay designated a part of I-41 by the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} 19th century, however, most of these train runs had to terminate at their old destination stations again due to the increasing local traffic on the Stadtbahn.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, {{the tide}} was in favour of the regency, until, {{in the summer of}} 1342, Kantakouzenos was forced to flee to the court of Stefan Dušan of Serbia. However, from 1343 onwards, with the aid of his friend, Umur Beg of Aydin, Kantakouzenos began to reverse the situation. With the initial support of Stefan Dušan, Kantakouzenos regained much of Macedonia, and despite his failure to take Thessalonica, his Turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of Didymoteicho in Thrace. Gradually, Apokaukos's {{supporters}} abandoned him, including his son Manuel, who deserted his post at Adrianople and went over to the Kantakouzenos camp.|$|E

The first US units arrived in Australia in early 1942 and almost 1million US personnel passed through Australia during the war. Many US military bases were constructed in northern Australia during 1942 and 1943, and Australia remained {{an important source}} of supplies to US forces in the Pacific {{until the end of the}} war. Though relations between Australians and Americans were generally good, there was some conflict between US and Australian soldiers, such as the Battle of Brisbane, and the Australian Government only reluctantly accepted the presence of African American troops.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{inspired}} {{the establishment of}} a conservative women's organization known as Königin-Luise-Bund, often shortened to Luisenbund ("Queen Louise League") in which her person achieved an almost cult-like status. The group's main purpose was to promote patriotic feelings among German women, and it emphasized the family and German morality. The Königin-Luise-Bund was active {{during the time of the}} Weimar Republic and the <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Reich. Despite having actively supported the National Socialist movement since its early stages all through their accession to power in 1933, the Queen Louise League was nonetheless disbanded by the Nazis in 1934, as they viewed it as a hostile organization.|$|E

His family was closely related to the Temple family of Stowe House. The family belonged to the gentry, having a reasonable income, without being members of the aristocracy. His father had been knighted at the Tower of London by James I following the King's accession to the English throne - one of many members of the gentry who were knighted during the <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King's reign.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th {{century were}} marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reign of}} the minor Ladislaus IV were {{characterized}} by armed conflicts between parties of the leading noble families. Although Roland Borsa, voivode in 1282 and between 1284 and 1294, was initially among the nobles assisting the king in consolidating royal power, he himself became the source of new conflicts. First he prevented the canons of the Gyulafehérvár Chapter from collecting their income in 1289. Next he unlawfully compelled noblemen and Saxon landowners in Transylvania to accommodate him and his retinue. Later Borsa fought the bishop of Várad (Oradea) and even resisted King Andrew III who besieged him in the fortress of Adorján (Adrian) at Szalárd (Sălard) for three months in 1294.|$|E
