25|$|In 1994 the Toyota Curren came in two models, the ST206 and the ST207. The ST206 {{had four}} {{different}} trim levels. The FS, XS, ZS and the ZS Sport Selection. The FS and XS models were both {{powered by the}} 140hp 3S-FE engine, whereas the ZS models were powered by the 170-180hp 3S-GE engine. The ZS Sport Selection had {{the added benefit of}} a limited slip differential and a leather steering wheel. The ST207 only came in the XS Touring Selection, which was powered by the 3S-FE and came equipped with <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and Toyota's active suspension package called TACS.|$|E
25|$|Guests board an Enhanced Motion Vehicle (EMV) {{intended}} {{to appear as}} a battered military troop transport. EMVs ride on neoprene filled tires (for operational precision) driven by hydraulic rotors that provide forward motion, hydraulic pressure is applied on-board each vehicle at 3,000 psi using DC pressurizers. The vehicle has <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> atop {{the surface of a}} slotted roadbed. The track has only three switches: a left/right split switch just before loading/unloading, a left/right combine switch just after safety check station/dispatch and a compound switch to swap vehicles in/out of the maintenance bay, behind the mirrors. Beneath the slot a tubular guideway guides the front wheelset and a damper for the rear wheelset, and three electrical buss bars provide the EMV 480 volts AC. The power is divided among the two motion systems, control, safety and audio systems. Each transport can accommodate twelve guests with three rows of seats, four across, with the front left seat behind a non-operational steering wheel.|$|E
500|$|On August 26, 2011, at PAX Prime it was {{announced}} that Turn 10 would include the UNSC Warthog from Microsoft Studios' Halo series in Forza Motorsport 4s Autovista mode. The model of Warthog used in Forza Motorsport 4 is identical to the version in the then-upcoming Halo 4, although the vehicle is not drivable. Turn 10 has cited the vehicle's exaggerated <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system, fictional futuristic technology and excessive height as reasons for its exclusion, stating [...] "One, it's got some technology that's built into Halo {{that would have been a}} big investment for us to then build into the game only to support one vehicle.

2500|$|Before Honda {{unveiled}} Acura in 1986, Japanese automobiles exports {{were primarily}} economical {{in design and}} largely targeted at low-cost consumers. The Japanese big three created their luxury marques to challenge the established brands. Following Honda's lead, Toyota launched the Lexus name with the LS 400 which debuted at $38,000 in the U.S. (in some markets being priced against mid-sized six cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models), and was rated by Car and Driver magazine as better than both the $63,000 Mercedes-Benz W126 and the $55,000 BMW E32 in terms of ride, handling and performance. It was generally regarded as a major shock to the European marques; BMW and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29% and 19%, respectively, with the then-BMW chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim accusing Lexus of dumping in that market. Nissan's Infiniti became a player on the luxury market mostly thanks to its popular Q45. [...] The vehicle included a class-leading (at the time) 278hp (207kW) V8 engine, <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> the first active suspension system offered on a motor vehicle, and numerous interior luxury appointments. [...] These made it competitive against the German imports like Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which {{by the time of}} Infiniti's release had overtaken Cadillac and Lincoln in dominating the luxury segment of the American market. In 1990, four years after the debut of the Legend and Integra, Acura introduced the NSX, a midship V6 powered, rear-wheel-drive sports car. [...] The NSX, an acronym for [...] "New Sports eXperimental", was billed as the first Japanese car capable of competing with Ferrari and Porsche. This vehicle served as a halo car for the Acura brand. The NSX was the world's first all-aluminum production car, and was also marketed and viewed by some as the [...] "Everyday Supercar" [...] thanks in part to its ease of use, quality and reliability, traits that were unheard of in the supercar segment at the time.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} new {{results on}} the design of decoupling control in <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> active <b>steering</b> vehicles. Linear controllers are derived from a linearised single track car model for <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> active <b>steering</b> vehicles: yaw rate and lateral speed are the output to be decoupled while the front and rear steering angles are the control inputs. It is shown that the lateral speed dynamics can be decoupled by feeding back longitudinal speed, yaw rate and lateral acceleration measurements: lateral speed measurements or observers are not required. The yaw rate controlled dynamics are independent from lateral speed and can be described by an inputoutput model. Simulations on nonlinear single track third order model and on a higher order vehicle model provided by the CarSimr are carried out to illustrate the improvements in handling and driver subjective rating on the vehicle dynamics. These results show that the proposed methods involve advantages over previous designs with respect to vehicle handling, performance, robustness with respect to unmodelled dynamics and vehicle parameters...|$|R

50|$|The P34 was {{reasonably}} {{successful with}} the two cars taking a memorable 1-2 in the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix. The Tyrrell team also finished 3rd and 4th overall in the championship. The car was less successful in 1977 however and the idea was dropped. Reasons given were that although Goodyear had manufactured special tyres for the car, the tyre company had failed to match the development work on them compared to the normal sized tyres used by other teams. With all <b>four</b> front <b>wheels</b> <b>steering</b> the car, Tyrrell {{also found that the}} P34's complex four-wheel front suspension assembly added a lot of weight to the car.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modelling and simulation {{of a stable}} angle-based instability threat indicator for articulated off-road vehicles. First, a stable angle {{is represented by the}} vertical forces of <b>four</b> <b>wheels</b> and <b>steering</b> angle of an off-road articulated steer vehicle. Then a vehicle prototype model is built based on a specific wheel loader type and a tyre/terrain model. Finally, the prototype model and tyre/terrain model are imported to the multi-body dynamics analysis software-ADAMS to conduct a number of simulations using the stable angle-based instability threat indicator. Simulation results indicate that a stable angle of 80. 5 ¬∞ is the threshold angle for lateral instability, and a stable angle of 90 ¬∞ is the threshold angle for longitudinal instability of this model. Compared with the traditional instability indicating methods for off-road vehicles, the proposed stable angle-based method is more efficient and can deal with both lateral and longitudinal instability of an articulated vehicle effectively.

40|$|An {{approach}} for fault detection and isolation (FDI) of sensors in chassis control systems is presented. This approach {{makes use of}} the analytical redundancy in the non-linear kinematic relationships between <b>wheel</b> speeds, <b>steering</b> angles and the vehicle body motion, which is valid when negligible tyre slip can be assumed. Using a bounded-in-bounded-out approach, bounds for sensor values are computed from {{a subset of the}} remaining sensor values and their tolerances. A sensor value lying outside these bounds indicates a fault candidate. The tolerance propagation is achieved by solving a linear programming problem. By estimating a variety of output signals using different combinations of input signals, each residual generator is sensitive to a different subset of sensor faults, thus permitting fault isolation through structured residuals. The effectiveness of this FDI approach is demonstrated using simulation results and experimental test drive measurements from the DLR‚Äôs highly manoeuvrable ROboMObil research platform with <b>four</b> <b>wheel</b> individual large-range <b>steering.</b> Because of the latter, state-of-the-art methods cannot be applied...|$|R
