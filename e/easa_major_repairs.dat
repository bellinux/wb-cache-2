5000|$|The biggest {{distinction}} from a cost standpoint is if {{a repair}} {{is classified as}} a <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> or a minor <b>repair.</b> A <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> can change the depreciable equipment value due to an extension in service life, while a minor repair is normal maintenance. How a firm chooses to cost <b>major</b> and minor <b>repairs</b> vary from firm to firm depending on the costing strategies being used. Some firms will charge only <b>major</b> <b>repairs</b> to the equipment while minor repairs are costed to a project. Another common costing strategy is to cost all repairs to the equipment and only frequently replaced wear items are excluded from the equipment cost. Many firms keep their costing structure closely guarded as it can impact the bidding strategies of their competition. In a company with multiple semi-independent divisions, the equipment department often wants to classify all repairs as [...] "minor" [...] and charge the work to a job - therefore improving their 'profit' from the equipment.|$|R
