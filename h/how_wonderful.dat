It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? <b>How</b> <b>wonderful</b> that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E

500|$|Relations {{between the}} two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and {{by the fact that the}} Chinese had not been {{consulted}} in advance about it. Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority. When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation. Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at détente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, describing the Taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as [...] "batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that.

The series debuted on Australian TV screens in 1996, and made its way onto North American television the following year. The Crocodile Hunter became successful in the United States, the UK, and over 130 other countries, reaching 500 million people.

500|$|Despite her obligations, Hańska was a {{beautiful}} unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night before last I laughed as I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851. [...] "Oh, <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> it is not to know anyone or have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!" ...|$|E
500|$|Media {{and public}} opinion was more hostile. The Sydney Morning Herald ran the {{headline}} [...] "Baggy Green Shame" [...] while The Australian wrote of the [...] "$11,000 price of disgrace". Many newspaper columns and {{letters to the editor}} attacked the players. The editorial of The Australian stated that [...] "Waugh and Warne said yesterday they had been naïve and stupid. Put the emphasis on the second adjective—and add greedy." [...] Readers called for the players to be banned from playing for Australia as well as the sacking of the ACB officials who had kept the matter secret; some said that the players should never be appointed to leadership roles in the cricket community. In the Weekend Australian of 12 December, Warwick Hadfield and Brian Woodley editorialised that [...] "Warne is in need of some good advice, but not from business managers and PR folk too happy to tell him <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> he is in order to flog a few more videos, books, pairs of duds, sports shoes or anti-smoking ads". Warne's major sponsors reviewed their partnerships with him, and three newspapers, the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom, The Age of Melbourne and the Sydney Morning Herald severed their ties with him.|$|E

500|$|The comedy The Careless Husband (1704), {{generally}} considered to be Cibber's best play, is another example of the retrieval of a straying husband by means of outstanding wifely tact, this time in a more domestic and genteel register. The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both ladies of quality and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as [...] "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, [...] "as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage". His periwig has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy's tact. Soliloquizing to herself about how sad it would be if he caught cold, she [...] "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays it gently on his Head" [...] (V.i.21). (A [...] "steinkirk" [...] was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in Love's Last Shift, without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy's lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist's goal of [...] "ecstatic self-approval".|$|E

2500|$|In Cántico, {{there were}} many poems about {{awakening}} and <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> it is to return into consciousness.

[...] He then clings to the present but cannot avoid the sense of a future that is shrinking every day.|$|E
