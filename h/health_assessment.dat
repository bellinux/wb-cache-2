25|$|An oral <b>health</b> <b>assessment</b> {{carried out}} before a child reaches {{the age of}} one may help with {{management}} of caries. The oral <b>health</b> <b>assessment</b> should include checking the child’s history, a clinical examination, checking the risk of caries in the child including the state of their occlusion and assessing how well equipped the child’s parent or carer {{is to help the}} child prevent caries. In order to further increase a child’s cooperation in caries management, good communication by the dentist {{and the rest of the}} staff of a dental practice should be used. This communication can be improved by calling the child by their name, using eye contact and including them in any conversation about their treatment.|$|E

25|$|One of ATSDR’s primary {{responsibilities}} {{is conducting}} public <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> and <b>health</b> consultations. The agency conducts public <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> for all current or proposed {{sites on the}} National Priorities List (commonly known as Superfund sites). The purpose of public <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> is to examine whether hazardous substances at a site pose a human health hazard and to issue recommendations about limiting or stopping exposure to those substances. ATSDR also conducts health consultations, often in response to requests from EPA {{and state and local}} agencies. Health consultations examine specific health questions, such as the health effects of exposure to a specific chemical at a site. Health consultations are more limited in scope than public <b>health</b> <b>assessments.</b> ATSDR also conducts public <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> and <b>health</b> consultations in response to petitions from members of the public. To conduct public <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> and <b>health</b> consultations, ATSDR relies on its own scientists or establishes cooperative agreements with states, providing technical assistance to state health departments. ATSDR issued more than 200 public <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> in 2009 and provides about 1,000 health consultations each year.|$|R

25|$|The Tier 4 engines produce {{substantially}} lower emissions {{than most}} other diesel vehicles in Toronto. The Environmental Impact Assessment for the UP Express of 2009 was carried out assuming that trains would be Tier 3 standard rather than Tier 4, and showed that at peak frequency the air quality effect of the additional trains would not raise any pollution level above the provincial criterion levels. The 2010 Metrolinx electrification study, which did assume the use of Tier 4 emissions technologies for diesel propulsion options, found that the Georgetown/UP Express diesel service would contribute {{on the order of}} 0.2% to local air pollution, and that electrification would result in only a small improvement to local air quality. In an additional review of human <b>health</b> <b>assessment</b> in 2011, GO Transit examined the current plan for Tier 4 emission controls on both the UP Express trains and conversion of existing GO locomotives to Tier 4 and found that the human health risks of the diesel UP Express service are negligible, but that current background air quality (from other pollution sources in Toronto) is an issue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract / Summary <b>Health</b> impact <b>assessment</b> (HIA) is {{a process}} that aims to predict {{potential}} positive and negative effects of project, programme or policy proposals on health and health inequalities. It is recommended by national government and internationally. Supporting <b>health</b> impact <b>assessment</b> is one of the roles of English Public Health Observatories. The few centres in England with accredited health impact training centres have inadequate resources to meet demand. Currently, the London Health Observatory is providing the bulk of the training nationally. Some Public Health Observatories are currently investigating the preferences for support of those commissioning or conducting <b>health</b> impact <b>assessment</b> within their regions. The availability of published guidance on how to conduct <b>health</b> impact <b>assessments</b> has increased substantially over the past few years. The Department of Health has funded a research project led by the London Health Observatory to develop advice for reviewing evidence for use in <b>health</b> impact <b>assessment.</b> Completed <b>health</b> impact <b>assessments</b> can be useful resources. Evaluation of the process and impact of <b>health</b> impact <b>assessment</b> is important in order to demonstrate its usefulness and to learn lessons for the future. The focus for Public Health Observatories is to train and support others to conduct <b>health</b> impact <b>assessment</b> according to good practice, rather than undertaking <b>health</b> impact <b>assessments</b> themselves. The aim is to create sufficient skilled capacity around the country to undertake <b>health</b> impact <b>assessments.</b> The London <b>Health</b> Observatory plans to share its support models and to roll out a train the trainer programme nationally to enable effective local delivery of their national <b>health</b> impact <b>assessment</b> programme.

2500|$|The new {{frontier}} in manatee research pivots on population <b>health</b> <b>assessment</b> and habitat use {{through the use}} of radio-telemetry. Thus, in the coming years, the PRMCC will focus its research on manatees through a cooperative project titled [...] "Puerto Rico Manatee <b>Health</b> <b>Assessment</b> and Telemetry Project". This research will be led by the PRMCC together with the Inter American University, PRDNER, USFWS, USGS Sirenia Project, Puerto Rico’s Environmental Quality Board (PREQB), San Juan Bay Estuary Program (SJBEP), University of Florida’s Veterinary School, and the Georgia Aquarium. Since detrimental activities that have led to the manatee endangerment include habitat degradation, which in turn influences manatee health and the particular use of specific habitats, the PRMCC seeks to ascertain the effects of these two factors in the survival of the manatee in Puerto Rico. The study will be conducted in two important estuarine habitats for the species: Jobos Bay and San Juan Bay. Health assessments are a valuable tool to determine the fitness, specifically related to environmental and medical issues of any population of wildlife. Telemetry studies provide hard evidence on the preference and use of any wildlife to a specific habitat and its use of the resources (food, water, shelter, etc.) needed for survival. Wild manatees will be medically examined and tested for signs of health issues. Once examined and samples are collected for analysis, the manatees will be fitted with a satellite tag to monitor their movement and habitat preference for a year.|$|E

[...] After determining the health of the person undergoing anesthetic and the endpoints that are required to complete the procedure, the type of anesthetic can be selected. Choice of surgical method and anaesthetic technique aims to reduce risk of complications, shorten time needed for recovery and minimise the surgical stress response.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of statutory <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> in identifying existing mental health disorders in pre-school foster children. It was examined whether a foster carer completed screening instrument could enhance accuracy. A representative sample of 43 pre-schoolers under the care of one inner-city local authority underwent comprehensive multidimensional mental <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> as the reference standard. Statutory <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> gave false negative results for 65 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 44 - 82 %) of children diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder according to the reference standard and 18 % (95 % CI 3 - 52 %) of children with developmental delay. The Ages & Stages Questionnaire completed by the foster carers failed to identify 65 % (95 % CI 44 - 82 %) of the children with diagnosed mental health disorders. There was no evidence of selective underreporting by foster carers in relation to specific diagnostic categories. In conclusion, statutory <b>health</b> <b>assessments</b> in their current form may fail to identify the majority of pre-school foster children with mental health disorders. Adding a screening instrument to the assessment process may not be adequate to improve diagnostic accuracy...|$|R
