40|$|<b>Hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> is the {{cheapest}} type of {{electric power generation}} in all world, if the cost of dam {{is not included in}} the capital cost. (Sometimes dams is constructed for irrigation then <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power).</b> <b>Hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> is also considered to be also the easiest in installation and operation with almost negligible operation and maintenance cost. In this dissertation, because of the above advantages, an investigation to all technical features of <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> (Types of turbines, generators [...] etc) and also economical features (taking Roseires <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> station, as one of the major hydro-electic power station in Sudan, as a model). Also Comfar software, computer model of feasibility studies analysis and reporting, is introduced in this dissertation and an attempt was done so as to make economic analysis for three <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> projects in Sudan using this software (Roseires, Jebl Aulia and Merawi) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{greatest}} {{natural resources}} of the municipality are the Drina River and Tara Mountain. The Drina is especially significant for its water <b>power</b> <b>potentials.</b> Specialists have estimated {{that it is possible}} to erect several hydroelectric power plants on this river. The annual flow of the Drina River is about 12.5 cubic kilometers of water. The Bajina Bašta Hydroelectric power plant was built on the Drina to harness that energy. The dam is located 12 km west of Bajina Bašta, near Perućac. Its average annual production amounts to 1,625 GWh of electric power. For the sake of better utilization of water <b>power</b> <b>potential,</b> the first reversible <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> plant in Europe was built in Zaovine, near the top of Tara Mountain.|$|R

The Grand Inga project, if completed, would be the largest <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> generating facility on Earth. The current project scope calls for the use of a flow rate ~26,400 cubic metres per second at a net head of ~150 metres; this is equivalent to a generating capacity of ~38.9 GW. This hydro-electric generator would be more than double the current world record holder, which is the Three Gorges facility on the Yangtze River in China.|$|R
