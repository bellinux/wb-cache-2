5|$|Early in his career, Rosenthal {{learned the}} Transcendental Meditation {{technique}} while in South Africa, {{but found that}} as a medical student and a medical resident he didn't have time to practice. Then 35 years later, after one of <b>his</b> <b>patients</b> had a dramatic improvement {{as a result of}} TM, he began practicing again and then began recommending it to <b>his</b> <b>patients.</b> In 2011, he published , which debuted at number seven on the New York Times' Best Sellers: Hardcover Advice, How-To And Miscellaneous list. Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.|$|E

The physician is required to disclose whatever would be material to <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> decision, including the nature and purpose of the procedure, and the risks and alternatives. The disclosures should be made by the physician to <b>his</b> <b>patient,</b> and not through use of consent forms which are not particular to individual patients. To minimize any subsequent claim by the patient that {{there was a lack of}} adequate disclosures, the physician should record in the patient's chart the circumstances of the patient's consent, and should not rely on the patient's unreliable ability to recall those circumstances...|$|R

5|$|As a teenager, Landy {{aspired to}} show business, briefly {{serving as an}} early manager for George Benson.

5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into <b>his</b> <b>patients,</b> was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the psychoanalytically-oriented therapist's experience of identifying, differentiating and processing the patient's transference-based and reality-oriented reactions. In order to investigate the therapist's lived experience of being receptive to the total communication of the patient in the analytic situation, the researcher adopted the empirical phenomenological method. This descriptive and intuitive method grounded the researcher in the concreteness of the everyday life-world of the therapist, and enabled him to explicate the therapist's immediate, pre-theoretical experiences of <b>his</b> <b>patient.</b> The appropriate central research question, formulated to elicit the experience of this phenomenon, emerged through the process of enquiry during the pilot study. Thirteen experienced, psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapists were interviewed and the five protocols considered most revelatory of the phenomenon under investigation were analyzed in detail. The remaining eight protocols were used to illuminate central themes and to clarify areas of uncertainty during the phase of formal explication. The central findings revealed that the oscillating process of the therapist as he shifts from being immersed in the world of <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> to being in a position of observation and self reflection is the fulcrum around which he evaluates the nature of <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> communications. During this ongoing process of discrimination, living in duality, the therapist comes to experience himself as a <b>patient</b> scrutinized by <b>his</b> own and <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> confrontations. <b>His</b> journey of disentanglement, the endeavour to differentiate his responses from <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> actions, is dependent on his ability to engage in honest selfreflection and to access his pre-theoretical and articulated cognitions of <b>his</b> <b>patient.</b> This allows him to acknowledge his own role in what has unfolded interpersonally and to appropriate his previously denied feelings for and attitudes towards <b>his</b> <b>patient,</b> a prerequisite for the accurate and full appraisal of the nature of <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> communications. Forsaking fixed judgements, the therapist becomes open to the confluence between the reality-oriented responses and transference-based reactions of <b>his</b> <b>patient.</b> This salient discovery, when dialogued with the literature, reinforced the theories of Greenson and Langs that not all the interactions between the patient and the analyst/therapist are transference-based and that it is therefore imperative that the analyst/therapist reflect on his participation in the analytic situation. ...|$|R
5000|$|..[...] the law draws {{a crucial}} {{distinction}} between {{cases in which}} a doctor decides not to provide, or to continue to provide, for <b>his</b> <b>patient</b> treatment or care which could or might prolong his life, and those in which he decides, for example by administering a lethal drug, actively to bring <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> life to an end [...] [...] [...] the former may be lawful, either because the doctor is giving effect to <b>his</b> <b>patient's</b> wishes [...] [...] [...] or even in certain circumstances in which [...] [...] [...] the patient is incapacitated from stating {{whether or not he}} gives his consent.

5|$|The {{charges against}} Galle were dropped before her case went to trial. Mitchell's case was tried by county {{attorney}} Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts {{and the personal}} attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby Andrews County discouraged Tidwell from trying the case. At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to <b>his</b> <b>patients.</b> Roberts sold the supplements, {{but he said that}} his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with the nurses and {{that he did not have}} a business relationship with Arafiles.|$|E

In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her little time to deal with household work.

5|$|When {{he learned}} of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of Winkler County, who was his friend and one of <b>his</b> <b>patients.</b> Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board {{constituted}} harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.|$|E

5|$|Still {{in charge}} of the Constantinople hospital, he {{attempted}} to elope with one of <b>his</b> <b>patients,</b> but was captured and tried for breach of conduct, as the female patient was in fact the wife of a Turkish officer. While being deported to Canada, Harrison escaped while his ship was docked in Morocco. Making his way to Ireland, Harrison posed as a Catholic and joined the Free State Army. After he was discovered, he quickly crossed to Wales to treat the coal miners there for silicosis. In 1923 Harrison married his fourth wife, Eva Olwen Bowen in Cardiff, still without divorcing his three previous wives, and set off with her on an adventure in the Caribbean. It is thought that Harrison deserted her sometime in the mid-1920s. During the 1930s Harrison worked in 15 countries and dependencies across Latin America and the Middle East. For one year, he served as the physician for a guerrilla army fighting the Japanese, who were then engaged in the Second Sino-Japanese War with China. After 1938, Harrison traveled to Shanghai using borrowed funds from a medical school classmate in Jamaica and from his own brother in Ontario, and set up a private medical practice, assisting the Chinese Red Cross wherever possible.|$|E

A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent <b>his</b> <b>patients</b> to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment.

Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E
