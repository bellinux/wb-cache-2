Kodachrome was [...] "replaced" [...] by a new ISO 64 Ektachrome, which used the simpler E-6 process. The last roll of Kodachrome was processed on January 18, 2011, (although announced last <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> was December 30, 2010) in Parsons, Kansas, by the sole remaining lab capable of processing it. In December 2012, Kodak discontinued color reversal stock in all formats including 35mm and Super 8.Today {{there is still a}} variety of Super 8 film stocks. Kodak has three Super 8 color negative stocks cut from their Vision 3 film series, ISO 50, ISO 200 and ISO 500 which can be used in very low light. Kodak reformulated the emulsions for the B&W reversal stocks and made Tri-X (ISO 200) in order to give it more sharpness. Film cut to Super 8 from other manufactured raw stock such as Fuji, Orwo, Adox, Agfa and Foma are also available. Pro8mm offers 7 color negative stocks made from Kodak and Fuji film. Color Reversal film for Super 8 is still available from several Super 8 specialty companies. Wittner Kinotechnik offers Super 8 made from a batch of Agfa Aviphot 200D which was perforated and slit for Super 8, 8mm and 16mm formats. This film is loaded into Super 8 and Single cartridges by several of the specialty companies. Other stocks, such as the new Fuji reversal film, and existing supplies of Kodak 35mm 100D are often made available in Super 8 by these specialty companies. Here is a sample of New Provia in Super 8. Kodak does not offer processing for any Super-8 films. There are other labs that offer processing including: Pro8mm in Los Angeles, US and Andec in Berlin, Germany. Regional labs that do Super 8 processing services include: Cinelab in Massachusetts, US, Movie & Sound in Florence, Italy; Retro 8 in Japan; Spectra Film & Video in Los Angeles; Reversal Lab in the Netherlands; Dwayne photo in the US; and Film Rescue in Canada just to name a few.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how {{standard}} statistical methods can be used with a new objective: detecting in a manufacturing process the stage involved in a drift. The drift can only be observed after the fabrication and the only available information is the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> of the lots at the different process stages. Both parametric and non-parametric methods are used: logistic regression and spline smoothing are applied on two examples taken from the semiconductor industry. For a given stage, the goodness of fit of the final parameter as a function of the time indicates the likelihood to be involded in the drift. This works because the lots are mixed during the fabrication: the goodness of fit will be lower for the stages far from the guilty stage.

40|$|We present {{here the}} most {{comprehensive}} analysis to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> neuroaesthetic <b>processing</b> by reporting the results of voxel-based meta-analyses of 93 neuroimaging studies of positive-valence aesthetic appraisal across four sensory modalities. The results demonstrate that the most concordant area of activation across all four modalities is the right anterior insula, an area typically associated with visceral perception, especially of negative valence (disgust, pain, etc.). We argue that aesthetic processing is, at its core, the appraisal of the valence of perceived objects. This appraisal {{is in no way}} limited to artworks but is instead applicable to all types of perceived objects. Therefore, one way to naturalize aesthetics is to argue that such a system evolved first for the appraisal of objects of survival advantage, such as food sources, and was later co-opted in humans for the experience of artworks for the satisfaction of social needs...|$|R
40|$|Prepregs {{of carbon}} fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) {{composites}} containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{have been successfully}} produced based on a solventless prepregging process. This work provides {{one of the most}} comprehensive evaluation to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>processing</b> and cure parameters affected by the incorporation of CNTs in CFRP prepreg manufacturing. The results confirmed that high-speed shear mixing and functionalisation of CNT are effective in lowering the viscosity of the CNT-epoxy nanocomposites. Based on the findings obtained from the rheological studies, suitable processing parameters are chosen for lab-scale production of CFRP composite prepregs. The effects of surfactant-treated CNTs on cure behaviour of epoxy and CFRP prepreg are evaluated. The catalytic activity of CNTs is negligible for a 0. 5 wt% filler content whereas it becomes prominent when the CNT content is increased to 1. 0 wt%. The degree of cure is lower for the prepregs containing 0. 5 - 1. 0 wt% CNTs than those without or containing a lower CNT content. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Apart {{from the}} diverse uses of bamboo, the tender shoots, being low in fat, high in dietary fiber and rich in mineral content (good source of potassium) have been {{consumed}} traditionally by the people. The shoots are consumed {{due to their}} exotic taste, flavour, medicinal and nutritive value. Bamboo shoots are available for a limited period and have a short shelf-life, thus, {{they need to be}} processed and utilized immediately after harvest. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine the nutritional value and develop value added edible products from different bamboo species viz., Dendrocalamus strictus, Bambusa bambos and Bambusa tulda, found in central India and Dendrocalamus asper (known edible bamboo species of Thailand) grown in central India. Nutritional analysis revealed that the nutritive value of D. strictus, B. bamboos and B. tulda is at par with D. asper. Thus, these species have a potential for edible shoot production in central India. Different value added products viz., nuggets (bari), pickle and papad (cracker) were made from fresh bamboo shoots. Organoleptic, sensory and chemical evaluation done at monthly intervals, to determine the shelf-life of product, revealed that the products were good in taste, texture and quality for 6 months from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> at ambient conditions (25 - 40 °C) in poly propylene and glass containers.

Implicated and nonimplicated retail product lots were compared for four lot descriptors: lot size, prevalence, mean contamination, and maximum contamination (as characterized by direct rinse plating). For retail product distributed fresh, Mann-Whitney U tests showed that implicated product lots had significantly (P = 0. 0055) higher mean contamination than nonimplicated lots. The corresponding median values were 3. 56 log CFU/carcass for implicated lots and 2. 72 log CFU/carcass for nonimplicated lots.

40|$|Introduction: As the {{importance}} of systematic review (SR) conclusions relies upon the scientific rigor of methods and the currency of evidence, we aimed to investigate the currency of orthodontic SRs using as proxy the time from the initial search to publication. Additionally, SR information regarding reporting guidelines, registration, and literature searches were recorded when available. Materials and methods: A systematic PubMed search was carried out using the Clinical Queries page to identify orthodontic SRs cited between 1 January 2008 and 7 November 2013. Data related to reporting guidelines, review registration, <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> review <b>processing,</b> literature search, and abstract reporting were retrieved and classified by journal type. Survival {{analysis was used to}} assess the time to reach predefined manuscript stages for orthodontic and non-orthodontic journals. Results: One hundred twenty seven of the originally identified 585 SRs were considered eligible. The median interval from search until publication was 13. 2 months (interquartile range: IQR = 9. 7 months) irrespective of the journal type. There was evidence (P = 0. 05) that SRs published by non-orthodontic journals appeared in PubMed faster than in orthodontic journals (non-orthodontic: median = 6. 5 months; IQR = 5. 7 months; orthodontic: median = 10. 2 months; IQR = 5. 6 months) from submission to publication and from acceptance to publication (non-orthodontic: median = 1. 5 months; IQR = 2. 4 months; orthodontic: median = 6. 0 months; IQR = 6. 2 months; P < 0. 001). More than half of these SRs did not cite adherence to any reporting guidelines, whereas all but five studies were not prospectively registered. Search of unpublished research was undertaken in approximately 21 per cent and 29 per cent of the SRs published in non-orthodontic and orthodontic periodicals, respectively. Conclusions: This study indicates that SR users should be aware that median time for orthodontic SRs from search to publication is 13. 2 months. SRs published in non-orthodontic journals {{are likely to be more}} current in terms of submission until time to publication and acceptance until time to publication compared with those published in orthodontic journals...|$|R
