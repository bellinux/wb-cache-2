5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he <b>died</b> <b>by</b> poison only and another view claimed he <b>died</b> <b>by</b> a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E
5|$|His wife having <b>died</b> <b>by</b> October 1441, {{within two}} years he married Katherine Strangways, née Neville, who was dowager duchess of Norfolk and noble in her own right, being sister of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, and thus {{what would have been}} {{considered}} a great marital prize. She brought him further territorial and financial augmentation.|$|E

50|$|In Why People <b>Die</b> <b>by</b> Suicide, Joiner posits the {{interpersonal}} theory of suicide, a three-part explanation of suicide {{which focuses on}} ability and desire. The desire to <b>die</b> <b>by</b> suicide comes {{from a sense of}} disconnection from others and lack of belonging, combined with a belief that one is a burden on others. The ability to <b>die</b> <b>by</b> suicide comes from a gradual desensitization to violence and a decreased fear of pain, combined with technical competence in one or more suicide methods. Under this model, a combination of desire and ability will precede most serious suicide attempts.|$|R

5|$|A {{recipient}} of France's Legion of Honour and Croix de Guerre, and twice mentioned in despatches during the war, Watt was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. He left {{the military to}} pursue business interests in Australia, and was lauded for his generosity to other returned airmen. In 1921, {{at the age of}} forty-three, he <b>died</b> <b>by</b> accidental drowning at Bilgola Beach, New South Wales. He is commemorated by the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for outstanding achievement in Australian aviation, and the Oswald Watt Fund at the University of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had <b>died</b> <b>by</b> the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.|$|E

5|$|Collins {{was born}} in Hazaribagh, India, to Arthur Herbert Collins, a judge in the Indian Civil Service, and Mrs Esther Ida Collins. It had been thought that both of his parents had <b>died</b> <b>by</b> the time he began his {{education}} at Clifton College, Bristol, where he held a scholarship. However, the 1901 census shows that Arthur's mother was actually still alive.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Huntington Civic Arena was {{constructed}} on one parcel. One year later, {{a group of}} entrepreneurs wanted to construct a 350-room hotel and retail stores, however, the plan <b>died</b> <b>by</b> 1980. In 1983, the National Shamrock Development and Investment Company wanted to develop the property and took a two-year lease on the project. By mid-1985, however, the lease ran out and the developers could not receive financial backing due to the failure in their $15 million Urban Development Action Grant request.|$|E
5|$|Jairo Mora Sandoval (March 22, 1987 – May 31, 2013) was a Costa Rican {{environmentalist}} who {{was murdered}} {{while attempting to}} protect leatherback turtle nests.

Mora's bound and beaten body was found on the beach the next morning. An autopsy determined he <b>died</b> <b>by</b> asphyxiation after suffering a blow to the head.|$|E

5|$|Judith Quiney <b>died</b> <b>by</b> 9 February 1662, {{the day of}} her burial and a {{week after}} her 77th birthday. She outlived her last {{surviving}} child by 23years. She was buried in the grounds of Holy Trinity Church, but the exact location of her grave is unknown. Of her husband, the records show little of his later years. It has been speculated that he may have died in 1662 or 1663, when the parish burial records are incomplete, or that he may have left Stratford-upon-Avon. He is known to have had a nephew, living in London, who by this time was holding the lease to The Cage.|$|E
5|$|Natives {{were also}} removed from high {{governmental}} and ecclesiastical office. After 1075 all earldoms were held by Normans, and Englishmen were only occasionally appointed as sheriffs. Likewise in the Church, senior English office-holders were either expelled from their positions or kept {{in place for}} their lifetimes and replaced by foreigners when they <b>died.</b> <b>By</b> 1096 no bishopric was held by any Englishman, and English abbots became uncommon, especially in the larger monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Prometheus– Punished by Zeus {{for giving}} mankind the Fires of Olympus, Prometheus was made mortal, and was {{attacked}} by an eagle that ripped out and ate his liver, which regrew instantly, on a daily basis. Kratos encountered Prometheus near Typhon's lair. Prometheus was eventually freed by Kratos, <b>died</b> <b>by</b> self-immolation in fire, and his ashes empowered Kratos, giving him the ability called the Rage of the Titans. The character was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in God of War II.|$|E

5|$|The Turks, {{based in}} the Caucasus, responded by sending 40,000 of their men to ravage the Persian empire in 626, marking {{the start of the}} Third Perso-Turkic War. Joint Byzantine and Göktürk {{operations}} were then focused on besieging Tiflis, where the Byzantines used traction trebuchets to breach the walls, one of the first known uses by the Byzantines. Khosrow sent 1,000 cavalry under Shahraplakan to reinforce the city, but it nevertheless fell, probably in late 628. Ziebel <b>died</b> <b>by</b> the end of that year, however, saving Epiphania from marriage to a barbarian. Whilst the siege proceeded, Heraclius worked to secure his base in the upper Tigris.|$|E
5|$|This {{ambiguity}} of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, {{and as he}} grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing. Indeed, {{by the age of}} eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had <b>died</b> <b>by</b> war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the civil war of 69, which brought his family to power.|$|E
5|$|When Muñoz Rivera {{was twelve}} years old, his mother fell ill and <b>died.</b> <b>By</b> this time, the family had grown to include nine more siblings, whom he taught. By the age of fourteen, Muñoz Rivera was {{managing}} legal documents, working with the local church clergy, and helping in his father's store. There were no {{institutions of higher learning}} on the island at that time, and most families sent their children to Cuba (University of la Habana, founded in 1728), Spain or North America to complete their university education. Muñoz Rivera wanted to travel to Spain and study law, but his father wanted him {{to take care of the}} family's business.|$|E

5|$|Worst {{affected}} was German Samoa, {{today the}} independent state of Samoa, {{which had been}} occupied by New Zealand in 1914. A crippling 90% {{of the population was}} infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children <b>died.</b> <b>By</b> contrast, the flu was kept away from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen as quite detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, <b>died</b> <b>by</b> crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|Despite Pauline's pleas {{that the}} duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly {{impairing}} his speed and marksmanship. Loco then {{stands in the}} doorway, ready to face the weakened Silence. As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser, Loco reaches for his Colt Single Action Army – but as Silence draws, another wounding shot is fired. Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him. Distraught, Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself, but swiftly dies as well. The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws, massacring the entire group. As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun. A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who <b>died</b> <b>by</b> his greed.|$|E
