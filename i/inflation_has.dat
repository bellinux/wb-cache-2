Its {{discovery}} was reported in June 2011, although it was suspected to be a planet as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this <b>inflation</b> <b>has,</b> as {{with the discovery of}} similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, raised the question of what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large.|$|E
5|$|The reforms, {{combined}} with unprecedented amounts of funding from foreign loans, spurred rapid economic growth; but this growth was punctuated by sharp recessions and financial crises in 1994, 1999 (following the earthquake of that year), and 2001; {{resulting in an}} average of 4 percent GDP growth per annum between 1981 and 2003. Lack of additional fiscal reforms, {{combined with}} large and growing public sector deficits and widespread corruption, resulted in high inflation, a weak banking sector and increased macroeconomic volatility. Since the economic crisis of 2001 and the reforms initiated by the finance minister of the time, Kemal Derviş, <b>inflation</b> <b>has</b> dropped to single-digit figures {{for the first time}} in decades (8% in 2005), investor confidence and foreign investment have soared, and unemployment has fallen (10% in 2005).|$|E
5|$|While <b>inflation</b> <b>has</b> eroded {{away the}} {{achievements}} of most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners {{in an era of}} much higher individual ticket prices. When properly adjusted for inflation, however, on that comparative scale Gone with the Wind—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.|$|E

25|$|Nepal's {{economic}} growth {{continues to be}} adversely affected by the political uncertainty. Nevertheless, real GDP growth was estimated to increase to almost 5 percent for 2011–2012. This is an improvement from the 3.5 percent GDP growth in 2010–2011 and would be the second-highest growth rate in the post-conflict era. Sources of growth include agriculture, construction, financial and other services. The contribution of growth by consumption fuelled by remittances has declined since 2010/2011. While remittance growth slowed to 11 percent (in Nepali Rupee terms) in 2010/2011, it has since increased to 37 percent. Remittances {{are estimated to be}} equivalent to 25–30 percent of GDP. <b>Inflation</b> <b>has</b> been reduced to a three-year low of 7 percent.|$|E
25|$|Most Americans {{under age}} 65 (59.3%) receive their health {{insurance}} coverage through an employer (which includes both private as well as civilian public-sector employers) under group coverage, although this percentage is declining. Costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising rapidly: since 2001, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have risen 19% and <b>inflation</b> <b>has</b> risen 17%, according to a 2007 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers with employer-sponsored insurance also contribute; in 2007, the average percentage of premium paid by covered workers is 16% for single coverage and 28% for family coverage. In addition to their premium contributions, most covered workers face additional payments when they use health care services, {{in the form of}} deductibles and copayments.|$|E
25|$|A typical cycle {{begins with}} a {{relaxation}} of central government credit and industrial policy. This allows local governments to push investment aggressively, both through state-sector entities they control directly and by offering investment-promotion incentives to private investors and enterprises outside their jurisdictions. The resulting boom puts upward pressure on prices and may also result in shortages of key inputs such as coal and electricity (as {{was the case in}} 2003). Once <b>inflation</b> <b>has</b> risen to a level at which it begins to threaten social stability, the central government will intervene by tightening enforcement of industrial and credit policy. Projects that went ahead without required approvals will be halted. Bank lending to particular types of investors will be restricted. Credit then becomes tight and investment growth begins to decline.|$|E

25|$|People are not {{the only}} {{economic}} actors who are required to accept banknotes. In the late 20th century vending machines were designed to recognize banknotes of the smaller values long after they were designed to recognize coins distinct from slugs. This capability has become inescapable in economies where <b>inflation</b> <b>has</b> not been followed by introduction of progressively larger coin denominations (such as the United States, where several attempts to make dollar coins popular in general circulation have largely failed). The existing infrastructure of such machines presents one of the difficulties in changing the design of these banknotes to make them less counterfeitable, that is, by adding additional features so easily discernible by people that they would immediately reject banknotes of inferior quality, for every machine in the country would have to be updated.|$|E
25|$|Persistence {{of hunger}} and {{starvation}} after 2000: After 1990s famine, food and basic supplies {{have continued to}} be in short supply. The government has curtailed market-based efforts for private citizens to find the food they need. These efforts included a botched currency reform aimed at undermining private enterprise and restoring the centrally planned economic system. This effectively resulted in eliminating the savings of many families and creating further starvation. At the same time, the Public Distribution System has failed to regain the level of subsidized services provided before 1990s collapse. <b>Inflation</b> <b>has</b> spiked making food unaffordable; in 20 years the price of rice has risen {{by a factor of}} 500. Poor government policy has been exacerbated by periodical floods that reduce agricultural yields. Deaths from starvation seem to have fallen since 2000, but they continue to occur and spike periodically. The Commission noted that organizations like the World Food Programme and World Health Organization report that large swathes of the population continue to suffer from critical food security; between 36% and 40% of the population suffer from malnutrition, with stunting among children remaining widespread.|$|E
25|$|Since 1961, Turkey {{has signed}} 19 IMF loan accords. Erdoğan's {{government}} satisfied the budgetary and market {{requirements of the}} two during his administration and received every loan installment, the only time any Turkish government has done so. Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey. In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia. In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership, inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004. Since then, Turkish <b>inflation</b> <b>has</b> continued to fluctuate around 9% and {{is still one of}} the highest inflation rates in the world. The Turkish public debt as a percentage of annual GDP declined from 74% in 2002 to 39% in 2009. In 2012, Turkey had a lower ratio of public debt to GDP than 21 of 27 members of the European Union and a lower budget deficit to GDP ratio than 23 of them.|$|E

25|$|The {{second issue}} confronting the Court was the effect which <b>inflation</b> <b>had</b> {{on the sale}} price of the property. The Court flatly refused to {{overturn}} the contract on grounds of equity simply because the assessed value had exceeded the anticipated rate of <b>inflation.</b> The parties <b>had</b> considered the effect <b>inflation</b> might <b>have,</b> and had agreed on the terms. No objection had been raised at any time by either party prior to agreement, and the contract was (as Field previously noted) fair. But the Court also recognized that forcing Tayloe to accept paper currency valued at one-half that of coin would also be unjust.|$|R
25|$|After World War 1 the {{independent}} Scottish companies were merged into the London Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern companies. A Scottish {{company had been}} considered, but rejected as being probably not financially viable. Since the 1920s and 30s saw a decline in passenger and freight business, this was probably a correct judgement. At this time some lesser-used lines were closed to passenger traffic. After World War 2 the railways were nationalised. Very quickly the Scottish Region moved into a position where revenue was not covering operating expenses and after 1951 closures resumed. The pace of such closures accelerated after the Beeching Report of 1963 {{though some of the}} recommended closures did not take place after Ministers of Transport refused consent on grounds of hardship, a concept which was open to wide interpretation. Freight services were also withdrawn from the majority of stations and concentrated on larger depots and private sidings. At the same time steam traction was replaced by diesel, with most of the Glasgow suburban and commuter network being electrified, in addition to both of the main lines to England. This allowed acceleration of Anglo-Scottish services, with the Edinburgh-London service down from 7–8 hours in the 1950s to 4–5 hours today. However the reduction in the cost of air travel and high rail fares rising above <b>inflation</b> <b>has</b> seen the market share of rail in the Edinburgh/Glasgow to London route down considerably in recent years, as even with the time taken to travel to airports and check in, rail is unable to compete on journey time (unlike on routes such as London to Manchester).|$|E
