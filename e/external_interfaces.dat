25|$|Battle.net was {{the first}} online gaming service {{incorporated}} directly into the games that make use of it, {{in contrast to the}} <b>external</b> <b>interfaces</b> used by the other online services at the time. This feature, along with ease of account creations and the absence of member fees, caused Battle.net to become popular among gamers and became a major selling point for Diablo and subsequent Blizzard games. Since the successful launch of Battle.net, many companies have published online game services mimicking Blizzard's service package and the user interface.|$|E

The Webbased interface is used to administrate the access of multiple controllers to Paramics SNMP <b>external</b> <b>interface</b> during the simulation process, to prevent conflicts among the controllers and to improve the efficiency of the usage of Paramics data input/output. A rule-based system and the connection to the database were developed to arrange the priority of the data to access Paramics. The proposed Web interface has a potential to be applied in on-line simulations to calibrate Paramics microscopic traffic simulation models. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} {{interfaces}} connecting the UTRAN internally or externally to other functional entities: Iu, Uu, Iub and Iur. The Iu <b>interface</b> is an <b>external</b> <b>interface</b> {{that connects the}} RNC to the Core Network (CN). The Uu is also external, connecting the Node B with the User Equipment (UE). The Iub is an internal interface connecting the RNC with the Node B. And at last there is the Iur interface which is an internal interface most of the time, but can, exceptionally be an <b>external</b> <b>interface</b> too for some network architectures. The Iur connects two RNCs with each other.|$|R

50|$|The R4600 had 16 KB two-way set-associative caches for {{instructions}} and data. It supported an L2 cache, {{but has no}} on-die hardware to control it, requiring external logic, {{whether it be a}} custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or chipset, to the cache. The cache resided on the SysAD bus and was shared with the <b>external</b> <b>interface.</b> The SysAD bus is 64 bits wide and can operate at clock rates up to 50 MHz for a peak bandwidth of 400 MB/s. The R4600's <b>external</b> <b>interface</b> did not support multiprocessing. The R4600 needs to be supplied with three clock signals to generate the various clocks.|$|R
