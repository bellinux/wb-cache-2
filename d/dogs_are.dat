5|$|Blackbuck are {{severely}} affected by natural calamities such as floods and droughts, {{from which they}} can {{take as long as}} five years to recover. Wolves are major predators; a study found that old rutting bulls might be vulnerable to wolves. Cheetahs and pariah <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> the other predators. Juveniles are also hunted by jackals. Village <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> reported to kill fawns, but are unlikely to successfully hunt and kill adults.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{that are}} {{employed}} to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, {{and are often}} proposed {{as one of the}} non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves. Shepherd <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviors, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs. However, shepherd <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes killed by wolves.|$|E

5|$|The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is an all-breeds {{conformation}} show. It {{has been}} held in New York City, New York annually since 1877. It was held at Madison Square Garden {{for the first time}} in 1880, and is currently held in the modern arena of the same name. <b>Dogs</b> <b>are</b> first placed in breed specific classes for Best of Breed, with the winners moving on to the respective breed group. Winners from each group then compete for the title of Best in Show. In each class, the individual <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> judged against the breed standard of each dog breed.|$|E

5|$|Both of the Russian Toy {{varieties}} can be {{crossed and}} produce smooth- and long-coated puppies {{from the same}} litter. In addition, when two smooth-coated <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> bred together, they may occasionally bear a long-coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees. However, {{there have been no}} records of two long-coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth-coated offspring.|$|E

5|$|Livestock {{guardian}} <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly used}} to aggressively repel predators and have worked well in both fenced pasture and range operations. A 1986 survey of sheep producers in the USA found that 82% reported the use of dogs represented an economic asset.|$|E
5|$|The Amami rabbit {{also faces}} huge threats from the {{invasive}} predators, being {{a major cause}} for the decline in population size. On the island of Amami, the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its numbers have increased dramatically. This mongoose, along with feral cats and <b>dogs,</b> <b>are</b> outpreying the Amami rabbit.|$|E

50|$|In 2017, over 1,300 <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> {{rescued by}} an {{organization}} called No Dog Left Behind. After a tip, a truck transporting the <b>dogs</b> <b>was</b> blocked.

5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, {{they are able to}} fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|Mushers {{must start}} the race with at most {{fourteen}} dogs and finish with {{no fewer than}} six. <b>Dogs</b> <b>are</b> visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden. Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be {{under the influence of}} performance-enhancing substances such as steroids. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of these rules or substandard dog care.|$|E

5|$|Obesity in pets {{is common}} in many countries. In the United States, 23–41% of <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> overweight, and about 5.1% are obese. The rate of obesity in cats was {{slightly}} higher at 6.4%. In Australia the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting {{has been found to}} be 7.6%. The risk of obesity in dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publishing}} {{of the first}} Swedish ecclesiastical history in 1642, {{the interpretation of the}} painting and the historical details surrounding it found a new path to follow. Relying on a publication from 1620, the sun <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> said to have appeared first to King John III (1537–1592) on his deathbed - the painting subsequently being produced by the papist-friendly king in order to save the souls of the Protestant kingdom - and a second time before King Gustavus Adolphus shortly before his death at the Battle of Lützen in 1632.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, 35 raccoon <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} into Latvia. The population increased rapidly. In 1960, Latvia officially reported {{a total of}} 4,210 raccoon <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> hunted.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Federation of Humane Societies {{accounts}} for the largest amount of dog and cat shelters in Canada. With 172 shelters throughout the country, {{it is estimated that}} 103,000 cats and 46,000 <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> taken in during 2013. Of these, 60% of cats and 49% of <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> strays, 28% of cats and 34% of <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> surrendered by their owners, 2% of cats and 3% of <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> cases of abuse, and the rest were either transferred from neighbouring facilities or born in the shelters themselves.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} {{valuable in}} Babylon, and are mentioned in cuneiform in the 4th century BC. A large Mastiff-like <b>dog</b> <b>is</b> {{shown on the}} ancient terra cotta by Birs Nimrud. The <b>dog</b> <b>is</b> 90 cm tall at the withers, has a stocky head and powerful hind quarters. The <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> used for hunting in ancient Assyria. Archeological digs of the Ashurbanipal palace (7th century BC) revealed pictures of dogs felling wild horses and donkeys. Assyrian Mastiffs were also used for military purposes and for protection.|$|R
5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E
5|$|A large, cranky sow {{escapes from}} its herd and attacks the Mistress after {{she tries to}} shoo {{it out of her}} garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his old age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> able to easily drive her off. While fleeing, the pig runs {{directly}} into the path of one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from joining them at the end, but he quickly forgives her.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most <b>dogs</b> <b>are</b> bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E
