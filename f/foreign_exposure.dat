40|$|The three {{chapters}} in this dissertation use firm-level data from Vietnam, Chile, {{and a set}} of Eastern-European countries to understand the importance of foreign direct investment in technology diffusion and subsequent environmental implications of changes in the production process. Chapter 1 investigates whether increased within-firm or within-industry <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure,</b> or <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure</b> from domestic downstream industry increases technology adoption. Chapters 2 and 3 look beyond technology spillovers of foreign investment, considering whether increased foreign investment affects domestic firm energy intensities. Chapter 2 studies whether domestic Vietnamese firms that become suppliers of domestic foreign-owned firms experience differential technology adoption and changes in energy intensity. Chapter 3 studies whether increased within-firm or within-industry <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure,</b> or <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure</b> from domestic downstream industry in Chile affects firm-level energy intensities. Studying manufacturing and service firms in Eastern-European countries, Chapter 1 finds that technology gains from domestic <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure</b> differ between lower-income and higher-income countries. In higher-income countries, increased within-industry <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure</b> and increased <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure</b> from downstream industries on average increases technology adoption. Studying Vietnamese manufacturing firms, Chapter 2 finds that firms that become suppliers of domestic foreign firms are on average more likely to have innovated than their non-supplier peers. These technology gains are found not to translate into short-run changes in energy intensity. Studying Chilean manufacturing firms, Chapter 3 finds as firms experience increased within-firm foreign investment, they on average increase their electricity intensity. Moreover, increased within-industry <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure</b> on average increases electricity intensity for all firms, and fuel intensity for firms in ``dirty'' industries...|$|E

This study examines a premature aspect of FCTA literature by examining how a firm’s degree of <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure</b> (measured by foreign sales revenue; foreign income (sales revenue plus other income); foreign total assets; foreign non-current and number of foreign segments) may affect the value relevance of FCTAs. Most recently, on the 18 July 2013 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a Discussion Paper {{on the topic of}} reviewing the Conceptual Framework. Despite the fact that the Conceptual Framework does not cover CI, the IASB has raised a specific interest in whether the presentation of information matters, which is precisely one of the issues examined within this study – whether the value relevance of FCTAs are different when presented in the Statement of Changes in Equity and/or notes, of in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. This is the first study conducted from the Australian perspective. The results reveal that there is inconsistent evidence as to whether FCTAs are value relevant for the sample and time period examined. FCTAs are negatively however insignificantly associated with share price in the pooled regression (2006 to 2012). The results support the hypothesis that FCTAs are value relevant when presented on the SCI, due to the more salient display of the FCTA figure.

One {{of the ways to}} mitigate this risk is the use of currency derivatives to hedge this foreign exchange exposure. This research explores the characteristics of South African firms that use currency derivatives in contrast to those that do not. The data is collected and calculated from financial statement of firms listed on the main board of the JSE. The variables are tested using t-tests to accept or reject the hypothesis. There are five characteristics which are tested, level of foreign exchange exposure, firm size, propensity to bankruptcy, underinvestment in growth opportunities and level of managerial ownership. The findings for the theories on bankruptcy costs and managerial ownership affecting a firm’s decision to hedge are consistent with previous literature indicating that these characteristics are not significant in determining a firm’s policy on hedging. The literature also supports the test results for the theory on firm size and level of <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure,</b> stating that the larger firms and those with higher levels of <b>foreign</b> <b>exposure</b> are more likely to hedge their foreign exchange risk with the use of currency derivatives.
