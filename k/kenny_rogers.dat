5|$|In 1991, Brown {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with recording artist <b>Kenny</b> <b>Rogers,</b> co-founding and serving as CEO of <b>Kenny</b> <b>Rogers</b> Roasters, an international chain of wood-roasted chicken restaurants. The founding of <b>Kenny</b> <b>Rogers</b> Roasters {{was part of a}} larger movement in the restaurant industry toward healthier, take-home offerings. Roasters immediately found itself in competition with Boston Chicken (later known as Boston Market) and several smaller roasted chicken chains. Kentucky Fried Chicken also introduced a roasted chicken line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with Roasters and Boston Chicken. In December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in the roasted chicken market, sued <b>Kenny</b> <b>Rogers</b> Roasters, claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until Roasters purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994. Brown then took Roasters public and grew it to a chain of more than 1,000 restaurants before selling his interest in the franchise to the Malaysia-based Berjaya Group in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Despite having {{previously}} {{shown little}} inclination toward politics, Brown surprised political observers by declaring his candidacy {{for governor in}} 1979. With the state and nation facing difficult economic times, Brown promised to run the state government like a business. A strong media campaign funded by his personal fortune allowed him to win the Democratic primary {{and go on to}} defeat former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the general election. Because he owed few favors to established political leaders, he appointed many successful businesspeople to state posts instead of making political appointments. Following through on his campaign promise to make more diverse appointments, he named a woman and an African-American to his cabinet. During his tenure, Brown exerted less influence over the legislature than previous governors and was frequently absent from the state, leaving lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor for more than one quarter of his term. He briefly considered a run for the U.S. Senate after his gubernatorial term, but withdrew from the race after only three weeks, citing health issues. He has continued to invest in business ventures, the most high profile of which was <b>Kenny</b> <b>Rogers</b> Roasters, a wood-roasted chicken restaurant he founded with country music star <b>Kenny</b> <b>Rogers.</b>|$|E

Hani cleaned the studio after them, picked up the garbage and delivered food however, he also learned the basics of House arrangements and mixing [...]While doing so Hani started his remix career working on projects for Artists such asDeee-Lite, Repercussions & Urban Soul. The competition in New York city was very high & Hani had to quickly make a name for himself therefore, he did not follow the rules.

He chose songs he gravitated to & went on to produce his own remixes in his simple little studio without being commissioned or paid to do it. Hani built a long list of Dj friends who admired his talent & consistently played his work around the globe.
