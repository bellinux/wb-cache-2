5|$|<b>Discal</b> Cell (dc) – {{well defined}} in most species.|$|E
25|$|Male: Upperside rich purple-brown or maroon-brown {{with a blue}} gloss. Forewing with <b>discal</b> and postdiscal {{transverse}} fasciae very obscure {{and only}} slightly paler than the ground colour. Hindwing uniform; two inwardly conical small black spots near apex of interspace 1, and single similar but larger black spots near apices of interspaces 5 and 6; all these spots bordered slenderly and somewhat obscurely on the outer side with white. Underside dull maroon brown. Forewing with a broad, slightly curved <b>discal,</b> narrower postdiscal and subterminal transverse pale bands; the <b>discal</b> fascia broadening anteriorly. Hindwing: a slightly curved narrow <b>discal</b> pale fascia; the black spots as on the upperside, but bordered on the inner and on the outer sides by an obscure pale lunular line. Antennae black with scattered pale specks; head, thorax and abdomen maroon-brown; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen paler brown.|$|E
25|$|Hindwing with {{elongate}} white <b>discal</b> markings in interspaces 2–5 {{beyond the}} cell.|$|E
25|$|Underside forewing: basal {{half with}} three black-edged, sinuous, broad, ochraceous-orange {{transverse}} bands, {{followed by the}} pale <b>discal</b> baud; ocelli, preapical short bar, subterminal and terminal markings much as on the upperside; the <b>discal</b> band margined inwardly by a broad black angulated line which follows {{the outline of the}} black area of the upperside. Hindwing irrorated (sprinkled) with dusky scales and transversely crossed by subbasal and <b>discal</b> slender zigzag brown lines and a postdiscal dark shade, on which are placed the two ocelli as on the upperside; subterminal and terminal faint brown lines, and a brownish short streak tipped black at the tornal angle below the lower ocellus.|$|E
25|$|Forewing: a {{transverse}} {{black spot}} in cell, and another irregular, oblique and broader at the discocellulars; a <b>discal</b> series of spots in interspaces 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10, and the apex and termen black. The upper four spots of the <b>discal</b> series inclined obliquely outwards, the lower two obliquely inwards; the black edging to apex and termen narrowing posteriorly, but with slender linear projections inwards in the interspaces.|$|E
25|$|Male and female. Upperside black. Forewings and hindwings with a <b>discal</b> broad {{transverse}} {{area from}} below vein 4 in forewing to vein 2 on hindwing, a moderately large spot in interspace 5, a minute preapical dot beyond in interspace 6 on forewing, and a subterminal row of spots {{with two or}} three spots beyond them on the tornal angle of the hindwing, pale yellow, sometimes with an ochraceous, sometimes with a greenish tinge. The <b>discal</b> area on the forewing nearly as broad in interspace 3 as on the dorsum, on the hindwing narrowing to an acute point on vein 2 at two-thirds of its length from base of wing. Tails touched with bluish grey. Underside with the <b>discal</b> transverse area and spot in interspace 5 as on the upperside; base and costal margin of the forewing to apex, and base and dorsal margin of the hindwing broadly lilacine brown, on forewing with two small black spots near base. Bordering the transverse <b>discal</b> area on the inner side, where it is margined with black lines, and above, is a broad chocolate carved band, continued more narrowly along the outer side of the <b>discal</b> area; beyond this on the forewing is a concave series of dusky black lunules, on the hindwing the band itself is traversed by a line of obscure pale lunules; finally on the hindwing there is a subterminal series of internally white-bordered black spots followed by an obscure ochraceous terminal line, and above the tornal angle a slender transverse black line from vein 1 to the dorsal margin.|$|E
25|$|Race hampsoni, Moore. Very closely allied to {{the typical}} form, but the {{markings}} pure white and broader in both seasonal forms, as in the race clinia. Upperside forewing: the spots of the <b>discal</b> series oval, outwardly rounded. Underside: ground colour dark ferruginous, the markings broad as on the upperside; the spots of the <b>discal</b> series, though closer to each other than in the typical form, still not connate, or forming an upper and lower band as in the race clinia. Recorded from the Nilgiris; Anaimalai Hills and Mysore.|$|E
25|$|The {{subtribe}} Pronophilina can {{be separated}} from other American satyrines by the following three external morphological synapomorphies: eyes always densely hairy; hindwing cross vein m1-m2 always curved or angled basally into the <b>discal</b> cell; maximum length of hindwing <b>discal</b> cell equal to or longer than half the total maximum length of the hindwing (excluding tails). These characters separate the Pronophilina sensu stricto from other Neotropical montane satyrids previously included in the group. This arrangement has been adopted by Lamas, but phylogenetic analysis based on molecular data suggests a larger, more inclusive delimitation of Pronophilina is needed.|$|E
25|$|Female: Upperside black, the {{markings}} {{similar to those}} in the male, but orange-yellow and much broader; on the forewing the <b>discal</b> band complete, the inner subterminal band much broader and better defined.|$|E
25|$|Forewing with well-marked pale adnervular streaks on the <b>discal</b> {{area that}} do not reach the {{terminal}} margin, the latter broadly velvety black; the streaks beyond end of cell extended inwards into its apex.|$|E
25|$|Race clinia, Moore. Differs in {{both the}} dry- and wet-season broods from the typical form as follows: Upperside forewing: {{discoidal}} streak and spot beyond generally much closer together, only separated by a narrow line; <b>discal</b> spots much larger, outwardly truncate. Hindwing: subbasal band on the whole broader- Underside: ground colour paler, almost ochraceous in some specimens; differences in the markings from the typical form similar to those on the upperside; discoidal streak on forewing continuous, only indented above and below; the lower four spots of the <b>discal</b> series by themselves and the upper three by themselves connate; subbasal band on hindwing as a rule very broad. Recorded from the Andamans.|$|E
25|$|Underside: {{the ground}} colour a paler brown {{than in the}} male, the {{markings}} as on the upperside but pinkish white, the dark brown blotches in the interspaces and the series of dark <b>discal</b> spots on the hindwing more prominent.|$|E
25|$|Underside: pale silky brown. Forewing: {{with the}} {{following}} white markings: a short line on {{the inner and outer}} sides of the discocellulars; a transverse, slightly curved, <b>discal</b> series of small, more or less incomplete rings; a transverse postdiscal series of disconnected slender lunules; a subterminal series of similar but more regular lunules and a terminal broken line, followed by a dark unbroken anticiliary line; the ground colour between the two short discocellular lines, that enclosed within each ring of the <b>discal</b> markings, and between the subterminal lunules and the terminal line slightly darker than {{on the rest of the}} wing. Hindwing: two short white lines on the discocellulars; the <b>discal,</b> postdiscal and terminal markings as on the forewing, except that enclosed between the subterminal series of white lunules and the terminal white line is a complete series of dark spots, the posterior three or four jet-black sprinkled outwardly with metallic-green scales and encircled with pale ochraceous. In addition there are a transverse subbasal series of four white-encircled black spots and a similar subcostal spot in middle of interspace 7. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen brown, the shaft of the antenna speckled with white; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white.|$|E
25|$|Male and female. Upperside: ground colour {{a bright}} purple, the subhyaline (almost glass-like) white spots near {{the apex of}} cell in the forewing more opaque, the broad <b>discal</b> band of large white spots proportionately more basal further from the termen and very irregular, the spots, {{especially}} towards the hinder part of the wing, more widely separated, the spot in interspace 5 more acutely triangular and smaller, the two spots above shifted obliquely inwards towards the costa, making the outer margin of the <b>discal</b> band angulate at interspaces 5 and 6. Hindwing: the postdiscal and subterminal markings broader and more diffuse than in P. gambrisius, giving a dark shade to {{the whole of the}} apical half of the wing.|$|E
25|$|Female upperside: the {{markings}} of a somewhat deeper orange-yellow; the <b>discal</b> band on fore and postdiscal band on hindwing distinctly broader; the inner subterminal narrow band on forewing ill-defined posteriorly; the preapical spots much smaller. Underside: ground colour much more ochraceous.|$|E
25|$|Female: Upperside black, the {{markings}} {{similar to those}} in the male, but pale orange-yellow and much broader; on the forewing the <b>discal</b> band complete and very broad, the inner subterminal band reduced to a tornal and two or three preapical spots.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of the population the ocular sinus is yellow, but some melanic males have a black area that reaches the lower margin of sinus. The queen has large black <b>discal</b> spots on terga 4 and 5, and smaller ones on terga 2 and 3.|$|E
25|$|Underside brown, {{the white}} {{markings}} {{as on the}} upperside but somewhat diffuse, the interspaces of the ground colour more or less blotched with darker brown, forming on the hindwing a conspicuous <b>discal</b> transverse series of spots in the interspaces; the dorsal margin of the hindwing broadly bluish white.|$|E
25|$|Underside: {{the ground}} colour bright ochraceous yellow, the {{markings}} pinkish white, but in great part suffused with pale yellow; the dark brown blotches in the interspaces and {{the series of}} dark <b>discal</b> spots on the hindwing more prominent, and on the forewing large, and in strong contrast with the ground colour.|$|E
25|$|Male upperside. Forewing: {{discoidal}} streak {{more clearly}} divided, the preapical portion prominent; <b>discal</b> band broader, the anterior spot composing its posterior half not {{wider than the}} others, not outwardly conical; two conspicuous preapical orange-yellow spots. Hindwing: subbasal band slightly broader. Underside: ground colour a more ochraceous brown; forewing preapically orange-yellow.|$|E
25|$|Upperside ground colour duller; {{the black}} spots on {{forewings}} and hindwings larger, the upper <b>discal</b> spots often coalescing and forming an irregular oblique short band; the black edging to apex and termen on the forewing {{and the black}} terminal band on the hindwing proportionately broader, the spots traversing the latter larger and whitish.|$|E
25|$|Upperside of {{both sexes}} brown of varying depths of colour. Forewing: cell with one pair of subbasal and one pair of apical {{transverse}} sinuous fasciae, the outermost defining the discocellulars; a short, broad, dark, oblique fascia beyond to vein 4, its inner margin diffuse, its outer sinuous but sharply defined; below vein 4 a sinuous, transverse, more faint fascia, followed by a <b>discal</b> blackish fascia, very broad and diffuse, below costa, bordered by a row of faint ocelli, and a postdiscal and a subterminal similar fascia following {{the outline of the}} termen. Hindwing with a slender blackish loop near apex of cellular area; a broad inwardly diffuse, outwardly well-defined short <b>discal</b> fascia in continuation of the one on the forewing; a series of postdiscal somewhat ochraceous ocelli with black pupils minutely centred with white; postdiscal and subterminal broad lines as on the forewing.|$|E
25|$|It {{differs from}} Graphium antiphates chiefly {{in the greater}} width of the black {{markings}} on the upperside, especially of the basal and subbasal bands that cross the forewing, both of which also extend to the dorsum. On the hindwing the black markings of the underside on the basal and <b>discal</b> areas are not only seen by transparency from below, but are actually represented, though only partially, by black scaling; {{the width of the}} dark grey terminal portion is also greater, and it has a tendency to turn to dusky black anteriorly, so that the sub-terminal series of black lunules are obscured anteriorly and are difficult to make out. Underside: markings {{similar to those of the}} typical form, but broader; forewing with the <b>discal</b> transverse band that reaches from costa to vein 1; hindwing: the black bands that cross the cell broader and proportionately closer together.|$|E
25|$|Underside brown, {{with very}} broad darker brown {{transverse}} fasciae, the interspaces between the markings irrorated (sprinkled) with purplish silvery scales. Forewing with two sinuous fasciae on basal half succeeded by a <b>discal</b> fascia, very broad at the costal margin and decreasing in width to the dorsum, bearing on its outer border {{a row of}} obscure ocelli. This is succeeded by a zigzag dark line, and sinuous subterminal and terminal lines; apex and tornal area suffused with purplish silvery. Hindwing: two irregular, very broad, dark brown, curved short fasciae near base; a straight, transverse, prominent, narrow ochreous-brown <b>discal</b> band defined outwardly by a black line; a transverse postdiscal dark brown fascia, widest {{in the middle and}} bearing outwardly a curved row of ochreous-brown white-centred ocelli, followed by a zigzag dark line in continuation of the one on the forewing; a subterminal somewhat diffuse dark fascia and a terminal dark line. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown.|$|E
25|$|Female: Upper {{and under}} sides {{similar to those}} of the wet-season, form but conspicuously paler, the {{contrast}} between the dark basal and pale terminal halves in fore prominent, the <b>discal</b> band on the underside of the forewing very broad, diffuse and pale, often nearly white. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen in both sexes as in the wet-season form but paler.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: ground colour darker {{brownish}} black, deep opaque {{black on}} the costa, apex and termen of the forewing; the medial oval white patch on the forewing smaller, the upper <b>discal</b> white band on the hindwing narrower, the short, broad black streak from base terminates {{in a large}} round spot or patch inwardly merged in the ground colour which fills the whole area of the cell.|$|E
25|$|Hindwing: the <b>discal</b> {{band of the}} forewing {{continued}} as a subbasal transverse white band: a postdiscal, narrower, more or less macular band also white, and a very distinct pale, still narrower, subterminal band. The interspace between the postdiscal and the subterminal bands darker than the general ground colour of the wing, and the postdiscal band {{on the inner side}} margined with similarly coloured cone-shaped marks.|$|E
25|$|Male upperside: {{somewhat}} {{more than half}} the forewing from base velvety black, apical half dull fuliginous; cell-area with or without two short transverse orange bars; a blue patch above, the tornus; the outer margin of the basal black area obliquely zigzag in a line from the middle of costa to apex of vein 2, including a large <b>discal,</b> generally obscure ocellus, which, however, in some specimens is prominently ringed with orange yellow. Beyond this a broad white irregularly oblique <b>discal</b> band followed by a short oblique preapical bar from costa; a small black orange-ringed ocellus beneath the bar, a subterminal continuous line of white spots in the interspaces and a terminal jet-black slender line; cilia alternately dusky black and white. Hindwing blue shaded with velvety black towards base; a postdiscal black white-centred orange and black-ringed ocellus in interspace 2, a round minutely white-centred velvety-black spot (sometimes entirely absent) in interspace 5; the termen narrowly white, traversed by an inner and an outer subterminal and a terminal black line; cilia white.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{specifically}} {{identified and}} confirmed through {{the presence of}} forked sense cones on antennal segments III and IV, antennomeres I-II are pale and III to IX are dark; there are three <b>discal</b> setae on the lateral margins of abdominal tergites, with pronotal posteromarginal seta II nearly {{one and a half}} times the length of I or III, a complete posteromarginal comb on tergite VII; and three ocellar setae with III between posterior ocelli.|$|E
25|$|Male upperside: dark violet with, {{in certain}} lights, a rich blue suffusion. Forewing: no discocellular black spot so {{conspicuous}} as in T. theophrastus; terminal margin {{with a narrow}} edging of fuscous black, widest at the apex, gradually decreasing to the tornus, followed by an inconspicuous anticiliary jet-black line. Hindwing: costal margin slightly but broadly shaded with fuscous, which is continued as a slender anticiliary black line to the tornus. Underside: white. Forewing: with the following brownish-black markings: an irregular edging along the costa to near the apex from which extends downwards a subbasal band, broadened across the cell and below it; an irregular band that extends along the discocellulars and below them to interspace 1 where it ends in a point; an upper <b>discal</b> curved band of more even width but dislocated below vein 4, the lower portion of it shifted inwards forms a large quadrate spot in interspace 3, below vein 3 the band is continued downwards by two small inconspicuous spots, beyond {{this is a very}} short acutely pointed comma-shaped mark; a very regular evenly curved complete transverse lunular line, a transverse series of subterminal spots and an anticiliary slender line. Close {{to the base of the}} wing extended obliquely upwards and outwards from the dorsum is a triangular mark, the edging of white colour left near the base forms above the apex of this mark an acute angle; between the band that crosses the middle of the cell and the transverse discocellular band is a more or less slender, irregular, similarly coloured line; and between the discocellular and upper <b>discal</b> bands another much shorter line that extends from the costa downwards but does not reach vein 4, this is slightly clavate anteriorly and posteriorly. Hindwing: mottled with brownish black that leaves only basal, subbasal, medial and <b>discal</b> transverse lines or bands of the ground colour; the medial and <b>discal</b> bands, which are highly irregular, enclose here and there small brownish markings, the bands themselves coalescing above a very irregularly shaped brown mark that is placed on the posterior half of the middle of the wing; terminal markings as on the forewing but the subterminal spots larger, the apical one especially so, the tornal two spots jet-black and each encircled by a glittering slender ring of metallic green scales. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings, the antennae, head, thorax and abdomen much as in T. theophrastus.|$|E
25|$|Underside pale greenish grey. Forewing: {{the spots}} and {{markings}} {{with the exception}} of the basal black streaks as on the upperside, the ground colour fading to an ashy grey towards the terminal margin. Hindwing similar to the underside of hindwing of P. gambrisius, but the <b>discal</b> transverse sinuous black line very broken and incomplete, the postdiscal, subterminal and terminal black markings somewhat better denned. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen bronze green, barred with black above; beneath whitish.|$|E
25|$|Upperside dark brown, paler in the female, {{with very}} obscure black {{markings}} of transverse lines across {{the cells of}} both forewings and hindwings and an oblique <b>discal</b> fascia on the forewing; an ash-grey continuous band along the termen of both forewings and hindwings, gradually broadening from {{the apex of the}} forewing, where it is very narrow, to the tornus of the hindwing, where it covers about one-third of the wing. In the female this band is outwardly narrowly bordered with brown. Cilia white. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown above; beneath, the antennae ochraceous, the rest dusky white washed with ochraceous. Underside: Male ochraceous brown, female bright ochraceous. In both sexes the colours paler on the hindwing; the forewing somewhat narrowly, the hindwing much more broadly suffused with lilacine-grey on the terminal margins and along the dorsal margin of the hindwing; cells of both wings with dark brown sinuous transverse lines and looplike markings; both forewings and hindwings crossed by somewhat diffuse broad <b>discal</b> and narrower postdiscal dark bands, prominent on the forewing, obscure on the hindwing. Male with a patch of specialized dark scales above vein 4 on the upperside of the hindwing.|$|E
25|$|As in {{some other}} species in the genus Elymnias, the common palmfly has a precostal cell in the hindwings and a tuft of androconial scales on the dorsal <b>discal</b> cell of the hindwings. Some populations of this {{butterfly}} species are sexually dimorphic: males and females do not look alike. In sexually dimorphic populations, males have black upperside forewings with small blue patches and mimic Euploea species, while the females mimic butterfly species of the genus Danaus.|$|E
25|$|Below, the {{butterfly}} has a white <b>discal</b> band which runs across both wings. It has five eyespots {{on the underside}} of the wings. In the forewing, it has two eyespots, with the anterior eyespot slightly smaller. In the hindwing, it has two eyespots on the apical region and a separate ocellus in the tornal (hindmost) region. The uppermost of the eyespots in the hindwing are greatly smaller, while the remaining two are more or less of equal sizes.|$|E
25|$|Upperside black, densely irrorated {{with green}} scales. Forewing: an {{outwardly}} oblique, slightly concave subbasal band and a narrow terminal edging jet-black {{due to the}} ground colour there being devoid of the green scaling; beyond the subbasal band the irroration of scales a much brighter green, especially along {{the outer edge of}} the subbasal band itself; but along obscure, broad and convergent <b>discal</b> and postdiscal transverse bands and along a subterminal much narrower band, the green scaling thins out and the black ground colour of the wing shows through; in some specimens, owing to the transparency of the wings, the rich ochraceous-brown colour of the underside gives the black on these bands a reddish tint. Hindwing: basal area margined outwardly by a narrow irregularly sinuous band devoid of green scaling, succeeded by an upper <b>discal</b> bright chrome-yellow patch that spreads from base of interspace 3 across the apex of the cell and bases of interspaces 4 and 5 to the costa; this patch is bluntly angulated outwards in interspace 5, stained with orange anteriorly and bordered outwardly by black which is widest above; below the patch a white line extends to the dorsum; the postdiscal area is deep dark green, margined inwardly by diffuse dark grey and followed outwardly by a subterminal series of lunular markings, the tornal and upper two or three of which are yellow, the rest bright green; tail tipped with yellow. Underside: basal area of both forewings and hindwings densely covered with green scales. Forewing: terminal two-thirds rich ochraceous brown, the green of the basal area bordered by black; <b>discal</b> and postdiscal bands also black, widened and diffusely coalescent posteriorly; an incomplete, very slender subterminal black line and broader black terminal edging, neither of which reaches to the apex. Hindwing much as on the upperside, but the yellow marking broader. Antennae dark red; head, thorax and abdomen black, covered somewhat densely with green hairs and scales.|$|E
25|$|Underside {{chocolate}} reddish brown, markings {{as on the}} upperside, but {{broader and}} slightly diffuse. Forewing with the discoidal streak and the triangular spot beyond it diffusely connate (united with others), some transverse linear white markings {{on either side of}} the postdiscal series of spots; the wing below vein 1 pale greyish brown. Hindwing: the <b>discal</b> and subterminal pale markings of the upperside represented by more clearly defined, very narrow, white bands, with, in the female, the addition of a terminal white similar band. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen fuliginous black; beneath dusky white.|$|E
