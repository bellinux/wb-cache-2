However, models focusing on <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> in relation to giant panda habitat and seasonal distribution are limited. The research aims to form spatial models of 12 month <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns and to investigate {{the relation between the}} <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns and the monthly distribution patterns of giant pandas. The <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> model of Kumar et al. was adopted for this study in Foping Nature Reserve (NR), China. By comparing twelve monthly <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns and calculating statistics such as maximum, minimum, mean and standard deviation of the <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> diversified <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns over different months were obtained. Maximum <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> occurred in June and July, while minimum <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> occurred in December and January. The annual sum of <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> was 6954 MJ/m 2 in Foping NR. The range in <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> was smaller in hot months and larger in cold months. Radio tracking data of giant pandas were collected for twelve months and the ensuing maps were overlaid with the twelve-month <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> map to analyze the relation between the giant panda's monthly distribution and <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> Our results showed that giant pandas prefer areas with lower <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> in warm months and select areas with higher <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> in cold months, which illustrates that the distribution of giant pandas is indeed affected by <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> To a certain degree, it also explains the behavior of seasonal movement by giant pandas in Foping NR...|$|R

In this study we calibrated three <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> models (Ångström -Prescott, Supit-Van Kappel, and Hargreaves) using a <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> product derived from Meteosat Second Generation data. We demonstrated that the accuracy of daily <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> increases when using satellite data for calibrating model coefficients, as compared to interpolated ground-based model coefficients. The average relative root mean square error for Meteosat Second Generation-based calibrated models was 1. 9 % lower for the Supit-Van Kappel model (p< 0. 001, n= 137), and 1. 8 % lower for the Hargreaves model (p< 0. 001, n= 222).
