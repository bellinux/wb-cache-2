500|$|Countess Barkóczy (1833 - 1887) became {{fascinated by}} her grand-uncle's books on Freemasonry, {{browsing}} through his library after his death. By this time, {{she was married}} to Count Bela Hadik, Emperor Maximilian's aide-de-camp. The Countess' request for initiation into a Masonic lodge was supported by the <b>Johannite</b> [...] Grand Master Ferenc Pulszky, and she was duly initiated in 1875 by a provincial lodge of Grand Orient, Lodge Egyenlőség (Equality) in Unghvár. (In Hungary in that time there were two masonic Grand Lodges, the Grand Lodge of St. John and the Grand Orient worked independently from each other.) Her initiation was then declared void by decision of Grand Orient and the perpetrators were punished, but the lodge wasn't erased, and only one officer was excluded. The countess defended her request and argued its validity in common law. [...] In her reasoning she brought up her knowledge of freemasonry, her legal status as a son (praefectio) and the absence of any mention of candidates' gender in the constitution of the Grand Orient. The Orient, holding to Prussian law, considered the initiation null and void because the usual bureaucratic formalities were not adhered to. The next year, after debating her status, the Grand Orient demanded the return of her certificate, but she never complied. Masonic sources repeat Denslow and Truman (10,000 masons) giving her name as Countess Helene Hadik Barkóczy, while biographical and family sources use the Hungarian name Ilona.|$|E

The <b>Johannite</b> Church received its full name in 1828 after Fabré-Palaprat's claimed discovery of the Levitikon gospels.

In 1907 Bricaud established a church body that combined all of these, becoming patriarch under the name Tau Jean II. The impetus for this was to use the Western Rite. Briefly called the Église Catholique Gnostique (Gnostic Catholic Church), it was renamed the Église Gnostique Universelle (Universal Gnostic Church, EGU) in 1908.

[...] Pearson notes the <b>Johannite</b> Church attracted lapsed Catholic bishops and priests.

5000|$|Most Protestant Christian churches {{practice}} open communion, {{although many}} {{require that the}} communicant be a baptized Christian. Open communion subject to baptism is an official policy of churches in the Anglican Communion. Other churches allowing open communion (with or without the baptism requirement) include the Church of the Nazarene, the Evangelical Free Church, the Church of God, Community Churches, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Presbyterian Church in America, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the United Church of Canada, United Church of Christ, United Methodist Church, the Free Methodist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, Foursquare Gospel Church, Association of Vineyard Churches, [...] Metropolitan Community Church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Assemblies of God, the Reformed Church in America, Seventh-day Adventists, Free Will Baptists, [...] Seventh Day Baptists, and most churches in the Southern Baptist Convention. All bodies in the Liberal Catholic Movement practice open communion {{as a matter of}} policy. The official policy of the Episcopal Church is to only invite baptized persons to receive communion. However, many parishes do not insist on this and practice open communion. Among Gnostic churches, both the Ecclesia Gnostica and the Apostolic <b>Johannite</b> Church practice open communion. The Plymouth Brethren were founded on the basis of an open communion with any baptized Christian: today, following John Nelson Darby, Exclusive Brethren practise closed communion, and Open Brethren practise open communion on the basis of [...] "receiving to the Lord's table those whom He has received, time being allowed for confidence to be established in our minds that those who we receive are the Lord's."Most churches in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America practice their own form of open communion, offering the Eucharist to adults without receiving catechetical instruction, provided they are baptized and believe in the Real Presence. The Christian churches and the Calvary Chapel as well as other nondenominational churches also practice open communion.|$|E
40|$|This study {{begins by}} {{examining}} the evidence for the claim that alongside the early Christian communities there existed a movement committed completely {{to the view that}} John the Baptist was the Messiah. References to John, and to his disciples, in various non-canonical works fail to substantiate absolutely this claim, but they do indicate that extreme views about John were circulating long after his death. On the basis of the New Testament evidence it seems clear that John created at least the nucleus of a <b>Johannite</b> sect, that he saw himself as the precursor of Yahweh and failed to appreciate the significance of Jesus, and that after his death some of his followers held for a time the belief that he had been the eschatological Prophet or Messiah. Eventually, and probably well {{before the end of the}} first century, the great majority of Johannites entered the Christian Church and re-interpreted John's role in the light of their new commitment. They came to recognize that John was Indeed the forerunner of Jesus and the herald of the Kingdom of God. This recognition was entirely in accordance with the way Jesus himself had sought to explain John's mission and to link it with his own. The Fourth Gospel's account of John's ministry reflects indirectly his failure, and the temporary failure of many of his followers, to recognize the importance of Jesus. It seems that the Jewish opposition to the Church attempted to make its own malicious use of the traditions of this early period of <b>Johannite</b> history; and it was the need to combat this phenomenon, and not any Johannites who had remained independent of the Church and perhaps also adopted gnostic views, that explains the obvious polemic in the Fourth Gospel against exaggerated views of John's status...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this {{proposal}} {{the aim is}} to analyse the fortified city of Arezzo from unpublished archival documents. The <b>Johannite</b> Commandery of S. Jacopo, today no longer existing, was part of the urban setting of Arezzo and was located near the Porta Santo Spirito. This ancient fortification survives today. It stands as a very important example of military constructions for its massive polygonal town walls which were built between 1538 and 1560 by Antonio da Sangallo il Giovane {{on the site of the}} old Medieval citadel. The Church of S. Jacopo was destroyed to make way for new urban plans in the post-war period. Still in the urban area traces of the Order of Malta's architecture survive. Our explanation attempts to explore the connection of this commandery with the fortified city. From such perspective it is interesting to analyse the setting up and functioning of the commandery within a fortified-urban framework. In this analysis studying the drawings produced by the land surveyors from the cabrei is of utmost importance. These unpublished documents, part of the ancient archive of the Priory of Pisa, offer in fact an unusual representation of a fortified city, which is now preserved in the Archivio di Stato in Florence...|$|E

The Madonna from Rouchovany is dated to {{first quarter of}} 14 th century. The roots her style lay in Rheims, like Madonna from Strakonice, but we can find roots in Chartres too. Statue of Saint Benigna (Dobrotivá) comes from augustinian convent church at Dobrotivá. We can date this carved work before 1327, because medieval notes are preserved. Saint Benigna was one of companions princess Voršila. They wandered to Rome, but they were killed. The part of her body was transfered to monastery in 1320. Reffering to the iconographic study, we can see reference to Song of Songs from Old Testament. Rouchovany Madonna has got ring on left hand and it's link with motiv of Bridegroom and Bride. The same motiv we can see on Strakonice Madonna. Here Child caress mother's chin with his right hand. Jesus hold in left hand an apple like reference to "second" Adam, who rescues mankind from sins.
