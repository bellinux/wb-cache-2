40|$|We {{report the}} {{observations}} of the magneto-hydrodynamic waves propagating along magnetic flux tubes in the solar photosphere. We identified 20 isolated strong peaks (8 peaks for pores and 12 peaks for inter-granular magnetic structure) in the power spectra of the l. o. s. (line-of-sight) magnetic flux, the l. o. s. velocity, and the intensity for 14 different magnetic concentrations. The observation is performed with the spectro-polarimeter of the Solar Optical Telescope aboard the Hinode satellite. The observed phase relation between the magnetic and the photometric intensity fluctuation would not be consistent with that caused by the opacity effect, if the magnetic field strength decreases with height along the oblique line of sight. We suggest that the observed fluctuations are due to longitudinal (sausage mode) and/or transverse (kink mode) MHD waves. The observed phase relation between the fluctuations in the magnetic flux and the velocity {{is consistent with the}} superposition of the ascending wave and the <b>descending</b> <b>wave</b> reflected at chromosphere/corona boundary (standing wave). Even with such reflected waves, the residual upward Poynting flux is estimated to be 2. 7 × 10 ^ 6 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1 for a case of the kink wave. Seismology of the magnetic flux tubes is possible to obtain various physical parameters from the observed period and amplitude of the oscillations.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the onset of}} convection for chemical-wave propagation in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction based on the two-variable Oregonator model coupled with the fluid dynamic equations. For chemical waves in a vertical slab, two-dimensional convection occurs only for slab widths greater than a critical threshold width. The convective threshold is different for ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>waves.</b> Convectionless waves are flat and propagate with constant speed. Above the onset of convection, the wave velocity increases and the flat wave deforms due to two counterrotating steady rolls. For a horizontal slab, convection is always present and the wave velocity increases with increasing slab width. Our results are compared with experiments...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that low-frequency {{repetitive}} transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) suppresses motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by single pulse TMS. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the central nervous system level at which rTMS produces a suppression of MEP amplitude. We recorded corticospinal volleys evoked by single pulse TMS of the motor cortex before and after 1 Hz rTMS in five conscious subjects who had an electrode implanted in the cervical epidural space for the control of pain. One of the patients had Parkinson's disease and was studied on medication. Repetitive TMS significantly suppressed the amplitude of later I-waves, and reduced the amplitude of concomitantly recorded MEPs. The earliest I-wave was not significantly modified by rTMS. The present results show that 1 Hz rTMS may decrease the amplitude of later <b>descending</b> <b>waves,</b> consistent with a cortical origin of the effect of 1 Hz rTMS on MEPs...|$|R

Cirrus visible optical depth, mean extinction coefficient, and lidar ratio were derived from the 532 –nm elastic–backscatter lidar signals. Temperature information from radiosondes launched frequently at the lidar site was used to characterize the thermal structure of the tropical troposphere and the temperature dependence of the optical and geometrical cirrus properties. <b>Descending</b> stratospheric Kelvin <b>waves</b> were ob-served which seem to influence cirrus formation close to the tropopause.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that internal waves cause frequent vertical migrations (FVM) in fishes. Acoustic data from the Benguela Current revealed that pelagic scattering layers of fish below ~ 140 m moved in opposite phases to internal waves, ascending ~ 20 m towards the <b>wave</b> trough and <b>descending</b> from the <b>wave</b> crest. At the trough, the downward displacement of upper waters and the upward migration of fish created an overlapping zone. Near-bottom fish correspondingly left the benthic boundary zone at the wave trough, ascending into an acoustic scattering layer likely consisting of zooplankton and then descending to the benthic boundary zone at the wave crest. We suggest that this vertical fish migration {{is a response to}} fluctuations in light intensity of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude caused by shading from a turbid surface layer that had chlorophyll a values of 3 to 4 mg m− 3 and varied in thickness from ~ 15 to 50 m at a temporal scale corresponding to the internal wave period (30 min). This migration frequency thus is much higher than that of the common and widespread light-associated diel vertical migration. Vertical movements affect prey encounters, growth, and survival. We hypothesize that FVM increase the likelihood of prey encounters and the time for safe visual foraging among planktivorous fish, thereby contributing to efficient trophic transfer in major upwelling areas...|$|R
5000|$|Most Caucasus Greeks left Kars Oblast {{following}} the cession {{of the area}} back to the Ottoman Empire in 1917 but before the official population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1922-23. They mainly settled in villages in Greek Macedonia previously inhabited by Ottoman Muslims and again generally preferred those situated on grassy plateaux or mountain districts, since these most closely resembled their former home in the South Caucasus. However, like many other Greeks of Pontus and north-eastern Anatolia, significant numbers of Caucasus Greeks who wanted to remain in what was now Turkish territory at any cost chose to convert to Islam and adopt the Turkish language for public purposes {{so as to be}} exempted from the population exchange. According to the terms of the population exchange protocol (which was essentially an appendage to the Treaty of Lausanne) the categories 'Greek' and 'Turk' were defined by religious affiliation rather than ethnicity, resulting in large numbers of Greek Muslims from Macedonia and Crete being categorized as 'Turkish in soul' and so resettled in the Turkish Aegean and parts of Anatolia. Those Caucasus Greeks who had remained in north-eastern Anatolia, like the many other Pontic Greeks who had also converted to Islam and adopted the Turkish language, subsequently became assimilated into the wider Turkish-Muslim population of the provinces of Trabzon, Sivas, Erzurum, Erzinjan, Kars, and Ardahan.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The serious {{disturbances}} in ventriculoarterial coupling after thoracic aorta bypass grafting are addressed through aortic entry impedance {{in the frequency}} domain from flow-pressure waves. We designed a method for synthesizing pressure and flow waves to evaluate opposal to aortic flow along the cardiac cycle, addressing myocardial, brain, and visceral tissue perfusions from pressure-flow hysteresis loops and forward-backward aortic entry impedance in the ascending aorta, transverse aortic arch, and distal descending aorta, respectively, before and after extra-anatomic grafting of the descending aorta in the swine. Methods: Twelve pigs underwent extra-anatomic grafting (woven double-velour prosthesis, 18 -mm diameter), bypassing the descending aorta. Periarterial flow and endovascular pressure signals were mathematically synthesized (error minimization) to yield continuous functions of flow, pressure along the cardiac cycle before treatment for mean hemodynamics, pressure-flow hysteresis loops, and aortic entry impedance. Results: Grafting of the descending aorta overshadowed pressure-flow hysteresis loops in the ascending aorta by shortening maximum pressure delay on maximum flow and diastolic flow reversal. Clamping of the descending aorta substantially restored hemodynamics in the ascending aorta, although the diastolic flow decrease was accelerated. Identical processes developed in the transverse aorta. Subdiaphragmatic descending aortic flow was flattened after grafting and restored, although thickened, after clamping of the <b>descending</b> aorta. Flow <b>wave</b> peak was framed by a diastolic aortic entry impedance peak, which was damped along the transverse aortic arch (aortic entry impedance peak in the ascending aorta, 1700 ± 102 kN · s · m− 5; aortic entry impedance peak in the descending aorta, 292 ± 45 kN · s · m− 5; P <. 05). After grafting, the aortic entry impedance peak was transferred to early systole (aortic entry impedance peak in the transverse aortic arch, 2104 ± 94 kN · s · m− 5; aortic entry impedance peak in the descending aorta, 450 ± 75 kN · s · m− 5; P <. 05). Clamping of the descending aorta attenuated the early systolic aortic entry impedance peak (aortic entry impedance peak in the transverse aortic arch, 1269 ± 104 kN · s · m− 5; aortic entry impedance peak in the descending aorta, 491 ± 75 kN · s · m− 5; P <. 05), although aortic entry impedance in the descending aorta remained higher than before grafting (P <. 05). Specifically, the backward flow ascending aorta to coronary trunks generated a backward aortic entry impedance peak (2234 ± 350 kN · s · m− 5) superimposed onto the forward aortic entry impedance peak with asymptotic boundaries that diminished after grafting and further enlarged after clamping of the descending aorta. Conclusions: Hemodynamic opposition of grafting of the descending aorta are specific to the aortic site and cardiac cycle and are dependent on clamping of the descending aorta. Our approach to thoracic aorta hemodynamics could enable optimization of bypass grafting. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2003; 125 : 699 - 71...|$|R
