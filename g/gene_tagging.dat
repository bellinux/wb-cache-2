We implement seamless tagging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate its application for protein tagging while preserving simultaneously {{upstream and downstream}} gene regulatory elements.

We show that our finite and deterministic combinatorial results are asymptotically—as the length of the gene increases— particular cases of the stochastic Gel’fand and Pinsker capacity formula for communications with side information at the encoder, which lies at the foundations of data hiding theory.

40|$|Background: The complex {{microbiome}} of the ceca {{of chickens}} {{plays an important}} role in nutrient utilization, growth and well-being of these animals. Since we have a very limited understanding of the capabilities of most species present in the cecum, we investigated the role of the microbiome by comparative analyses of both the microbial community structure and functional gene content using random sample pyrosequencing. The overall goal of this study was to characterize the chicken cecal microbiome using a pathogen-free chicken and one that had been challenged with Campylobacter jejuni.

40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>tagging</b> with {{fluorescent}} proteins {{is commonly}} applied {{to investigate the}} localization and dynamics of proteins in their cellular environment. Ideally, a fluorescent tag is genetically inserted at the endogenous locus at the N- or C- terminus of the gene of interest without disrupting regulatory sequences including the 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated region (UTR) and without introducing any extraneous unwanted "scar" sequences, which may create unpredictable transcriptional or translational effects. We present a reliable, low-cost, and highly efficient method {{for the construction of}} such scarless C-terminal and N-terminal fusions with fluorescent proteins in yeast. The method relies on sequential positive and negative selection and uses an integration cassette with long flanking regions, which is assembled by two-step PCR, to increase the homologous recombination frequency. The method also enables scarless tagging of essential genes with no need for a complementing plasmid. To further ease high-throughput strain construction, we have computationally automated design of the primers, applied the primer design code to all open reading frames (ORFs) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe), and provide here the computed sequences. To illustrate the scarless N- and C-terminal <b>gene</b> <b>tagging</b> methods in S. cerevisiae, we tagged various genes including the E 3 ubiquitin ligase RSP 5, the proteasome subunit PRE 1, and the eleven Rab GTPases with yeast codon-optimized mNeonGreen or mCherry; several of these represent essential genes.

40|$|Background: cDNA-Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) is a {{commonly}} used technique for genome-wide expression analysis {{that does not}} require prior sequence knowledge. Typically, quantitative expression data and sequence information are obtained for {{a large number of}} differentially expressed <b>gene</b> <b>tags.</b> However, most of the <b>gene</b> <b>tags</b> do not correspond to full-length (FL) coding sequences, which is a prerequisite for subsequent functional analysis. Methodology: A medium-throughput screening strategy, based on integration of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and colony hybridization, was developed that allows in parallel screening of a cDNA library for FL clones corresponding to incomplete cDNAs. The method was applied to screen for the FL open reading frames of a selection of 163 cDNA-AFLP tags from three different medicinal plants, leading to the identification of 109 (67 %) FL clones. Furthermore, the protocol allows for the use of multiple probes in a single hybridization event, thus significantly increasing the throughput when screening for rare transcripts. Conclusions: The presented strategy offers an efficient method for the conversion of incomplete expressed sequence tags (ESTs), such as cDNA-AFLP tags, to FL-coding sequences...|$|R
40|$|Tandemly arrayed <b>genes</b> (<b>TAGs)</b> are an {{important}} genomic component. However, most previous {{studies have focused on}} individual TAG families, and a broader characterization of their genomic distribution is not yet available. In this study, we examined the distribution of TAGs in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and examined TAG density with relation to recombination rates. Recombination rates along A. thaliana chromosomes were estimated by comparing a genetic map with the genome sequence. Average recombination rates in A. thaliana are high, and rates vary more than threefold among chromosomal regions. Comparisons between TAG density and recombination indicate a positive correlation on chromosomes 1, 2, and 3. Moreover, there is a consistent centromeric effect. Relative to single-copy <b>genes,</b> <b>TAGs</b> are proportionally less frequent in centromeres than on chromosomal arms. We also examined several factors that have been proposed to affect the sequence evolution of TAG members. Sequence divergence is related to the number of members in the TAG, but genomic location has no obvious effect on TAG sequence divergence, nor does the presence of unrelated <b>genes</b> within a <b>TAG.</b> Overall, the distribution of TAGs in the genome is not consistent with theoretical models predicting the accumulation of repeats in regions of low recombination but may be consistent with stabilizing selection models of TAG evolution.

40|$|Tol 2 is a terminal-inverted-repeat {{transposable element}} of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes. It {{is a member of}} the hAT (hobo/Activator/Tam 3) transposable element family that is {{distributed}} in a wide range of organisms. We here document direct evidence for de novo insertion of this element. A Tol 2 clone marked with the bacterial tetracycline-resistance gene was microinjected into fertilized eggs together with a target plasmid, and the plasmid was recovered from embryos. The screening of plasmid molecules after transformation into Escherichia coli demonstrated transposition of tet into the plasmid and, by inference, precise insertion of Tol 2 in medaka fish cells. De novo excision of Tol 2 has previously been demonstrated. The present study provides direct evidence that the Tol 2 element has the entire activity necessary for cut-and-paste transposition.

Of 10 different transgenic bushes carrying a complete Tnt 1 containing T-DNA, eight contained multiple transposed copies of Tnt 1. The number of transposed copies of the element per plant was particularly high, the smallest number being 28. Tnt 1 transposition in lettuce can be induced by a very simple in vitro culture protocol. Tnt 1 insertions were stable in the progeny of the primary transformants and could be segregated genetically. Characterization of the sequences flanking some insertion sites revealed that Tnt 1 often inserted into genes. The progeny of some primary transformants showed phenotypic alterations due to recessive mutations. One of these mutations was due to Tnt 1 insertion in the gibberellin 3 β-hydroxylase gene. Taken together, these results indicate that Tnt 1 is a powerful tool for insertion mutagenesis especially in plants with a large genome...|$|E

Traditionally these methods have utilized auxotrophic markers; however, the availability of auxotrophic markers can be limiting and in some instances their use may also impact on the interpretation of results.

40|$|The new {{unstable}} virescent seedling (vis*) allele of a petunia mutant, {{that has}} green leaves but white cotyledons with green revertant spots, {{was used to}} identify spontaneously occurring haploid petunia lines with active transposable elements. Endogenous transposons were trapped into the single petunia nitrate reductase structural gene (nia) using chlorate selection on haploid protoplasts. In two mutant lines, the dTph 1 -like transposable element dTph 1 - 3 was inserted at almost the same position but in opposite orientations in the first exon of the nia gene. In a third mutant, a different transposable element was integrated into the fourth exon. This element, called dTph 4 is 787 bp long and has 13 bp terminal inverted repeats of which 12 bp are identical to those of dTph 1. Insertion of dTph 1 - 3 and dTph 4 results in an 8 bp duplication of the target site, as already described for dTph 1. In contrast to dTph 1 -like elements, dTph 4 is present at low copy number in the petunia genome. This can facilitate its use for <b>gene</b> <b>tagging</b> in petunia.

The average efficiency of transformation was more than 20 %. Approximately 50 % of the transgenic lines contain a single copy of the Ds element. The single-copy Ds lines have been used as launch pads to develop a population for targeted <b>gene</b> <b>tagging</b> in barley. In order to define Ds launch pads for targeted insertional mutagenesis, 16 T-DNA insertion site and 38 secondary insertion sites of transposed Ds elements were genetically mapped by a sequence-based SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) analysis approach and RFLP analysis. The mapping results showed that Ds elements preferentially transposed into genetically linked sites. Single-copy Ds containing plants lines were crossed with lines expressing the Actransposase gene to activate the Ds element. F 2 plants resulting from these crosses showed an average Ds excision frequency of 52 % with a variation between 33 % and 75 % depending on the Ds starter lines used. A detailed molecular analysis of T-DNA integration sites in barley genome was carried out using single-copy transgenic lines. Sequence analysis of T-DNA flanking regions showed a non-random distribution of T-DNA integration sites in the genome. Approximately 50 % of the T-DNA insertions are found to be in gene-coding regions and 26 % of the T-DNA insertions are in repetitive regions of the barley genome. Likewise, the sequence analysis of isolated Ds flanking DNA showed that Ds preferentially inserted into coding region in the barley genome and is underrepresented in repetitive or non-coding regions. Therefore, the combination of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and the Ac/Ds transposon system takes advantage of the insertion characteristics of the T-DNA and the Ds elements. The T-DNA positions the Ds element preferentially in a gene-rich region from where Ds elements can be activated to transpose into closely linked sites resulting in high <b>gene</b> <b>tagging</b> frequencies.
