50|$|Wash deinking {{consists}} of a washing stage where dispersants are added to wash out the printing inks. When the pulp slurry is dewatered (thickened), the medium to fine particles are washed out. This process is most useful for removing particles smaller than about 30 µm, like water-based inks, fillers, coating particles, fines and micro stickies. This process is more common when making deinked pulp for tissue. The processing equipment are <b>belt</b> <b>filters,</b> pressure <b>belt</b> <b>filters,</b> disk filters and static filters. This stage is much more efficient than normal washing / dewatering stages.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>filters</b> {{are very}} {{versatile}} and {{are made to}} suit the sludges, slurries or mashed fruit to be processed. For a feed or treatment process which produces unpleasant odours, volatile emissions, pathogens and hazardous gases like hydrogen sulphide the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> can include fume hoods or even be completely enclosed in a gas tight housing. [...] Due to the reduced visibility and increased corrosion associated with enclosure, the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> process can also be automated. Large filtration areas, additional rollers and a variable belt speed {{can be found in}} advanced <b>belt</b> press <b>filter</b> designs.|$|R
25|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>filters</b> {{are less}} {{effective}} at processing some feeds. Unless the feed is well mixed from a digester, {{the use of}} <b>belt</b> <b>filters</b> will be more costly when processing a feed with varying solids content as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs. Feeds with high grease and oil content can lower the solids percentage in the cake by blinding the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> and all feeds need to be screened to protect the belt from being damaged by sharp objects. The type of feed may also affect the washing process. The <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> needs to be washed frequently which consumes large amount of water and time. Water and time wastage, {{as well as the}} associated costs can be reduced by automating the washing system and using effluents.|$|R

40|$|Riparian {{areas in}} the Pacific Northwest have {{traditionally}} {{been a source of}} natural resources, such as timber and grazing, and have been used as transportation corridors and homestead sites.

Leaving stream-side buffers is now required by state forest practices regulations on forest lands, but no regulations are in place on agricultural lands, where riparian trees have frequently been removed. In 1995, the Beaver Creek Riparian Buffer Project was established to develop better information about how to establish riparian buffers on coastal pastureland near Newport, Oregon. No riparian trees were present when the trial was begun. A replicated tree <b>filter</b> <b>belt</b> trial was established along the south bank of the creek to compare unplanted pasture (controls) with commercially valued red alder (Alnus rubra) planted at 6 -ft spacing in belts 1 row, 3 rows, and 6 rows wide. Tree survival and height and diameter growth were compared, as well as the amount of shade produced by the three treatments and control. We used a LI-COR LAI- 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer to quantify shade. We found that intensive site preparation, continued vegetation management, and both fencing and tubing of tree seedlings were necessary to gain survival and protect seedlings from small rodents, beaver, and cattle. Fencing out cattle provided stream bank protection within 1 yr. Significant shading of the stream occurred 2 – 6 yr after planting, as trees grew tall enough to intercept a significant amount of light. Single row plantings that take a minimal amount of pasture offer significant shading only after 4 – 7 yr.

The fines concentrate reports onto this Derrick screen directly to avoid over-grinding of the finer portion of this stream. The undersize of the regrind mill sizing screen is pumped via a dewatering cyclone into a conditioning tank. In this tank, several chemicals are added to enable sulphide flotation in three Outotec Denver flotation cells, targeting removal of arsenopyrite.

40|$|Increasing {{volumes of}} waste sludge, an intense {{environmental}} awareness and stringent legislation impose increasing demands upon conventional sludge dewatering equipment. In this study, the electrokinetic dewatering of waste slurries is studied. Full-scale electrokinetic facilities were developed that {{were based on}} a combination of a gravity-driven thickening belt and a belt press. The method was tested at a drinking water production site. By the use of the electrokinetic facility when drying `aluminum-coagulated' drinking water sludge (i. e. coagulated by the addition of Al-ions), the dry solids content increased by electro-osmosis from 17 to 24 % m/m at an additional energy consumption level of 60 kWh per ton dry solids. Additionally, the <b>filter</b> <b>belt</b> fouling was reduced drastically and the loss of solid particles from the cake was almost completely suppressed due to electrophoresis. Corrosion of the anode was effectively suppressed by using Ir 2 O 3 -coated titanium plates. Supplementary laboratory experiments suggest that electrokinetic dewatering is also useful in dewatering `iron-coagulated' drinking water sludge, sewage treatment sludge and fresh water dredging sludge. Theoretical analyses indicate that electro-osmosis will contribute to dewatering significantly, at lower and especially at higher volume fractions of solids, provided the slurry particles are of the order of micrometers or smaller. Under such conditions the conventional dewatering is slow due to excessive hydrodynamic resistance...|$|R

25|$|<b>Belt</b> press <b>filters</b> have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> a three-belt system.

A prototype belt filtration system designed for 50  g dry wt. /L microalgal feed concentration was used for this investigation. The highest concentration of microalgal suspension available for testing on the prototype belt filtration system was 6  g dry wt. /L obtained from biomass settling tanks at the Lawrence, Kansas domestic wastewater treatment plant. For preparation of feed suspension with concentrations below 10  g dry wt. /L, microalgal cultivation was followed by flocculation. A mixed laboratory culture of freshwater species dominated by three eukaryotic green microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus sp., and Kirchneriella sp.) was cultivated in wastewater effluent. This was followed by flocculation which resulted in a microalgal feed suspension concentration of 4  g dry wt. /L. Belt dewatering tests were conducted on microalgal suspensions with feed concentrations of 4  g dry wt. /L and 6  g dry wt. /L. The maximum microalgal recovery with the belt dewatering system was 46 % from the 4  g dry wt. /L, and 84 % from the 6  g dry wt. /L suspensions respectively.
