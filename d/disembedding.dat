40|$|The {{title of}} the project is ”Modernity, time, space and organic food networks”. The {{empirical}} basis for the project is case-studies of four different alternative organic food networks. A fundamental assumption behind the project is that modernity causes <b>disembedding,</b> meaning functional differentiation and distanciation of food networks in time and space, which has potentially negative consequences socially as well as ecologically. The theme of the project can thus be summed up as four questions, which will be adressed in the thesis: 1. Does <b>disembedding</b> take place in alternative organic food networks? 2. If it does, how does <b>disembedding</b> take place? 3. Given that <b>disembedding</b> takes place, what are the driving forces? 4. Regardless if <b>disembedding</b> takes place or not, can the selected alternative organic food networks be said to integrate both social and ecological objectives in the production and consumption of organic food?...|$|E

This paper addresses questions often asked during the 2008 U. S. financial crisis: Why did no one see this coming? Why were all the explanations given afterward, not given before as precautions? Or if they were given before, why did nobody listen? Using Giddens’ idea of <b>disembedded</b> systems [Giddens A (1991 a) The Consequences of Modernity (Polity Press, Cambridge, UK) ], the paper describes and frames the phenomenon of U. S. financial crisis {{and the role of}} rating agencies in particular as a <b>disembedded</b> service system. Hereby it offers an explanation of the crises in contrast to the common incentive-oriented or moralizing perspectives. The paper shows that the U. S. financial crisis emerged from a <b>disembedded</b> service system, a simulacrum of ratings, which after a while was no more connected to the reality of securities. Information-providing service systems are in danger to become simulacra, and with it they can <b>disembed.</b> The paper offers a new insightful perspective on how to analyze and understand information-providing service systems and hence offers a perspective to avoid crises based on <b>disembedded</b> systems. This is the first paper to our knowledge to analyze information-providing service systems based on Giddens’ theory of abstract <b>disembedded</b> systems. It provides a new understanding of information-providing service systems that can help to avoid crises based on <b>disembedded</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Background: Autistic musical savants {{invariably}} possess absolute pitch {{ability and}} are able to disembed individual musical tones from chords. Enhanced pitch discrimination and memory has been found in non-savant individuals with autism who also show superior performance on visual <b>disembedding</b> tasks. These experiments investigate the extent that enhanced <b>disembedding</b> ability will be found within the musical domain in autism. Method: High-functioning children with autism, together with age- and intelligence-matched controls, participated in three experiments testing pitch memory, labelling and chord <b>disembedding.</b> Results: The findings from experiment 1 showed enhanced pitch memory and labelling in the autism group. In experiment 2, when subjects were pre-exposed to labelled individual tones, superior chord segmentation was also found. However, in experiment 3, when <b>disembedding</b> performance was less reliant on pitch memory, no group differences emerged and the children with autism, like controls, perceived musical chords holistically. Conclusion: These findings indicate that pitch memory and labelling is superior in autism and can facilitate performance on musical <b>disembedding</b> tasks. However, when task performance does not rely on long-term pitch memory, autistic children, like controls, succumb to the Gestalt qualities of chords...|$|E
40|$|The <b>disembedding</b> ability (i. e., {{the ability}} to {{identify}} a simple masked figure within a complex one) depends on attentional mechanisms, executive functions and working memory. Recent cognitive models ascribed different levels of <b>disembedding</b> task performance to {{the efficiency of the}} subtended mental processes engaged during visuo-spatial perception. Here we aimed at assessing whether different levels of the <b>disembedding</b> ability were associated to the functional signatures of neural efficiency, defined as a specific modulation in response magnitude and functional connectivity strength in task-related areas. Consequently, brain activity evoked by a visual task involving the <b>disembedding</b> ability was acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of 23 right-handed healthy individuals. Brain activity was analyzed at different levels of information processing, from local responses to connectivity interactions between brain nodes, as far as to network topological properties. All different levels of information processing were significantly modulated by individual behavioral performance. Specifically, single voxel response magnitude, connectivity strength of the right intrahemispheric and interhemispheric edges, and graph measures (i. e., local and global efficiency) were negatively associated to behavioral performance. Altogether, these results indicate that efficiency during a <b>disembedding</b> task cannot be merely attributed to a reduced neural recruitment of task-specific regions, but can be better characterized as an enhanced functional hemispherical asymmetry...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Enterprise Systems {{as a form}} of <b>disembedding</b> (and conversely reembedding) {{technology that}} alters the work relationships in an organization, by altering the power and control bases in such an organization. Enterprise Systems are used to facilitate the seamless integration and data exchange between the various departments within an organization. Their purpose is to automate the exchange of information and streamline the business processes within the organization. Use of an Enterprise System accords to its users responsibilities different from before, and allows for various control mechanisms to take place. Enterprise Systems as (re) embedding and <b>disembedding</b> technologies, lead to different levels of employee empowerment and corresponding managerial control. The results presented here are preliminary and come from an investigation in a single company. These results tend to suggest that Enterprise Systems change the work patterns in a company by <b>disembedding</b> the power bases and reembedding the control mechanisms used. This is accomplished with the empowerment of individuals with increased responsibilities, but also with the better managerial control of employee actions...|$|E

40|$|ABC is a quintessential {{phenomenon}} of modernity. It begins with persons changing their practices in specific local contexts which are penetrated by global change. It is provoked by a reflexivity {{in which a}} disruption of practical consciousness leads to a new discursive consciousness. These practices and discourses are then <b>disembedded</b> {{in the creation of}} an abstract system of symbols and expertise. This changes the nature of the <b>disembedded</b> practices/discourses by translating them into a standardized (global) form. It is this global form which is then reembedded in new localities but this process is reflexively mediated in local contexts so that, again, its form changes. Whilst this is happening epistemological reflexivity works away at the globalized level so that the original expertise is undermined and another globalized discourse emerges. What makes all of this so distinctively modern is the pace at which this happens and the territory it covers. As the binding together of time and space at global and local levels becomes more powerful, so it becomes more fragile. This is the history of ABC we explore in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Polanyi saw {{the economy}} as {{properly}} embedded in society and argued that the capitalist free market, in commodifying social relations of production, seeks to <b>disembed</b> the economy from society. The resulting lack of continuity between society and economy, he maintained, created conflict which necessarily required state intervention. The market economy, therefore, in contrast to neoclassical/neoliberal economics’ vision of an autonomous, self-regulating market, required more, not less, state intervention to sustain it than alternative, more embedded economies. This article explores this conflict {{in the context of}} a specific neoliberal claim: that institutional shareholders are capable of being good “stewards” of the companies in which they invest. Utilising Polanyi’s embeddedness, this article assesses the “stewardship” approach as it is manifested in the US and in the UK. This approach is posited on a vision of a <b>disembedded,</b> self-regulating market. Putting it into practice is thus a retrograde step which will only exacerbate the problems created by the market-based corporate governance strategies which have prevailed since the late 1970 s onwards...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} inquiry of my {{research}} is the socio-economic restructuring of the European Union (EU). The project provides an innovative interdisciplinary intervention that uses the canonical texts of Karl Polanyi and the insights from the burgeoning Polanyian scholarship {{in an attempt to}} explain the morphology of the contradictions that underpin the EU integration project. The starting point of analysis lies in the recent debates instigated by the critical turn in the EU studies scholarship that tries to shift the focus from the causes of the EU integration to its consequences. My original contribution to the scholarship consists of providing a Polanyian critique of the EU political economy. The ever-growing Polanyian scholarship proves a formidable alternative to the already established Gramscian and Marxist routes of critical inquiry. Based on a close reading of Polanyi and the wider Polanyian scholarship the thesis proposes a new take on the established practice of using Polanyi’s concept of dis/embeddedness as an all-or-nothing phenomenon and instead suggests conceptualising the social reality in terms of tendencies. The lenses through which I evaluate the EU predicament consist of the following conceptual vocabulary: a) dis/embedding tendencies b) habitation and improvement, and c) the rate of change. The main puzzle that the project endeavours to explain is the interplay between the <b>disembedding</b> and the embedding tendencies in the EU. The examination of the <b>disembedding</b> tendency consists of excavating the self-regulating market logic inscribed into the EU edifice by analysing the development across three policy fields: competition, finance and education. The findings suggest that the <b>disembedding</b> tendency is manifested not only in the monetary orthodoxy inscribed in the Economic and Monetary Union since the Maastricht Treaty and further reified during the Great Recession, but also in the privatisation, depoliticisation and commodification dynamics evident in the three policy domains discussed in the thesis. Given Polanyi’s observation that the embedding tendency is immanent to the <b>disembedding</b> one, the second empirical endeavour consists of investigating the surge of socio-environmental measures. Notwithstanding the institutional divergences between the social and environmental policy domains, the appraisal of the policy output demonstrates that the embedding tendency is characterised by the same marketisation dynamic that we see in the <b>disembedding</b> one. This thesis recuperates a critical Polanyian reading that highlights the disruptive dialectics between the <b>disembedding</b> tendency and the seemingly protective measures predicated on fictitious commodification. In addition to unearthing the structural bias towards the market form that constitutes the two tendencies, this project develops a normative critique of the market society, based on Polanyi’s ferocious appraisal of neoclassical economics’ formal understanding of the economy, by problematising the extension of the economising rationality within previously unaffected spheres.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a study of the Greenbox, an ecotourism destination, situated in a geographically and economically marginal rural area on the northwest border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The initiative, which existed from 2003 - 2007, was funded primarily from European Union sources and administered by a management board consisting of representatives of local authorities, national tourism bodies, regional and rural development groups, and ecotourism providers. An ecotourism provider network was established which providers could join for a small fee. The International Ecotourism Society definition of ecotourism was adopted and modified slightly for use by the project and the EU Flower was adopted as a method of certification. Representatives of support organisations (21) and ecotourism providers (37) were selected purposively for interview. Four research questions structured the research. These investigated: the relationship between ecotourism as a particular form of rural tourism and the local resource base; how appropriately embedded and <b>disembedded</b> networks and networking among organisations operate to promote ecotourism; how appropriately embedded and <b>disembedded</b> networks and networking among providers operate to promote ecotourism; and, how ecotourism as an appropriately embedded and <b>disembedded</b> phenomenon, operating through networks and networking, contributes to balanced rural development. The Greenbox project was established as a 2 ̆ 7 top down 2 ̆ 7 network led by government rather than growing organically, a circumstance which appears to have contributed to its short lived nature. However, a range of benefits arose in terms of increased awareness of ecotourism and the potential of the selected area for this form of tourism, incorporation of ecotourism into policy documents, awareness of the positive role of networks and networking in promoting and developing ecotourism and the emergence of a provider led promotional group. The experience suggests that even short term networks and networking can have more positive outcomes than is sometimes recognised. 2016 - 09 - 3...|$|R

Central themes to emerge from this analysis are the social forces of internationalization, institutionalization and commodification of judo over this period, each of which contributes to a reflexive modernization process. It is concluded that the evolution of this activity in its now dominant sporting form is taking judo further and further away from the aims, methods and ideas derived from the philosophical principles on which it was originally conceived. Ironically, in spite of this, it appears that many western practitioners are attempting to re-embed the very aspects of eastern movement forms, such as Budo, that have been <b>disembedded,</b> a situation that prompts us to call for further work in this area...|$|R
