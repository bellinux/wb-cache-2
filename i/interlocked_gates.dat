40|$|SummaryStructural {{maintenance}} of chromosome (SMC) complexes are proteinaceous rings that embrace DNA to enable vital chromosomal functions. The ring is formed by two SMC subunits, closed at {{a pair of}} ATPase heads, whose interaction is reinforced by a kleisin subunit. Using biochemical analysis of fission-yeast cohesin, we find that a similar series of events facilitates both topological entrapment and release of DNA. DNA-sensing lysines trigger ATP hydrolysis to open the SMC head interface, whereas the Wapl subunit disengages kleisin, but only after ATP rebinds. This suggests an <b>interlocking</b> <b>gate</b> mechanism for DNA transport both {{into and out of}} the cohesin ring. The entry direction is facilitated by a cohesin loader that appears to fold cohesin to expose the DNA sensor. Our results provide a model for dynamic DNA binding by all members of the SMC family and explain how lysine acetylation of cohesin establishes enduring sister chromatid cohesion...|$|R
50|$|Manually {{controlled}} boom barriers replaced <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the Moreland Road {{level crossing}} in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Boom {{barriers}} replaced <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the Chelsea Road {{level crossing}} in 1977. The interlocked frame was also abolished at this time, {{replaced by a}} control panel.|$|E
50|$|Boom {{barriers}} replaced hand-operated gates at the Bell Street {{level crossing}} in 1962, with boom barriers replacing <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> {{at the nearby}} Munro Street level crossing in 1983.|$|E
50|$|Packaging Equipment or pallet {{wrappers}} have {{a moving}} load and an arm that stretches plastic wrap around the load. Typically a three sided wire partition guard is placed around the wrapper, {{and a light}} curtain controls access to the open side where the wrapper is accessed by a lift truck.Robotic Welding Cells incorporate wire mesh fixed barriers outfitted with vinyl welding curtains and light curtains or pressure sensitive mats. The welding curtains mounted inside of the fixed barrier control exposure to welding flash, sparks and spatter from the welding operation. While the light curtain or pressure sensitive mats prevent welding operations while the operator is loading/unloading the weld fixtures. Robotic Material Handling for pallet pack or de-palletizing could use any of the aforementioned guarding systems. Light curtains or pressure sensitive mats {{around the perimeter of}} the work area that stop the robot when an operator enters. Wire partition could be used around the work area with an <b>interlocked</b> <b>gate</b> which stops the robot when opened.|$|R
25|$|Barker {{station was}} located between the Barkers Road and Hawthorn Grove level crossings. The single {{platform}} was {{located on the}} western side of the line. In the 1940s the Hawthorn Grove gates were permanently closed to road traffic during train running times. Otherwise the <b>interlocked</b> hand <b>gates</b> at each end were opened and closed by station staff. The station also had a single semaphore signal for down trains.|$|R
50|$|It {{opened to}} goods traffic in 1883,with the yard being {{extended}} in 1912 {{at the northern}} end. The overpass at Somerville Road opened in 1970 and the goods yard removed in 1991. <b>Interlocked</b> crossing <b>gates</b> remained at the Anderson Street level crossing until 1995, until fixed away from the road and replaced by boom gates. The signal box was closed in 1996, and in 1997 the pedestrian subway on the station side of Anderson Street was replaced by pedestrian gates.|$|R
50|$|The station {{building}} was provided in 1882, with a signal box provided in 1889, to control <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the Puckle Street level crossing, {{until they were}} replaced with boom barriers in 1969.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} station {{building on}} Platform 1 was provided in 1886, but {{has since been}} replaced. A signal box was opened to control <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the Gaffney Street level crossing, until boom barriers replaced them in 1965.|$|E
50|$|The nearby level {{crossing}} at Charles Street had hand operated gates until 1924, {{when they were}} replaced with <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates,</b> operated from the nearby signal box, following several serious traffic accidents. These gates were replaced with boom barriers in 1986.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} three level crossings where trams and trains cross each other: Glenferrie Road, Kooyong; Glen Huntly Road, Glen Huntly; and Riversdale Road, Camberwell. To accommodate the differing voltages of the 600-volt tram and 1500-volt train systems {{each of these}} level crossings is fitted with an overhead square, which can isolate the section of overhead wiring above the crossing and apply the appropriate voltage. When the signal box adjacent to the crossing <b>interlocks</b> the <b>gates</b> for trains to pass through, 1500 volts is applied, while when the gates are up 600 volts is applied.|$|R
25|$|Electric train {{services}} {{between the}} city and Essendon were inaugurated in 1919, with electrification extended to Broadmeadows in 1921. However, Essendon remained the terminus of most suburban services, with a shuttle service operating beyond until 1925, with all day through services to Broadmeadows not provided until 1941. The station took the layout it has today in 1969, with {{the abolition of the}} centre track, closure of the stand-alone signal box, provision of automatic signalling along the line, and replacement of the Buckley Street <b>interlocked</b> crossing <b>gates</b> with boom barriers.|$|R

50|$|<b>Interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> were {{provided}} at the Melton Highway level crossing in 1926, and were replaced with boom barriers in 1987. The current level crossing was provided in late 2002, {{in conjunction with}} the duplication of the Melton Highway. In 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced the grade separation of the highway and railway line.|$|E
50|$|From 1891 to 1893, Fairfield was the {{junction}} station {{for the northern}} end of the former Outer Circle line, and was later {{the junction}} of the APM Siding, which operated from 1919 to the 1990s, and served the Australian Paper Manufacturers paper mill. Boom barriers replaced <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the Station Street level crossing in 1969.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 {{the station}} was rebuilt, with an island {{platform}} built on the southern side of the level crossing. One side faced the main line, with the other side formed a dock platform for terminating suburban trains. The old westbound platform was removed but the eastbound platform remained for Spencer Street bound regional trains. Boom barriers replace <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at Main Road in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} {{a number of}} sidings were {{provided}} to businesses in the area. In 1914 a branch line was opened {{at the southern end}} of the station to the Newport Power Station, in addition to a number of other sidings serving oil terminals in the area. A siding at the northern end of the station served the Australian Glass Manufacturers factory, with the last sand train from Koala Siding (near Nyora on the South Gippsland line) to Spotswood running on 15 January 1998. The <b>interlocked</b> crossing <b>gates</b> at Hudson Road were replaced by boom barriers in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The {{extensive}} building {{complex is}} of major architectural and historical significance to Ballarat {{with most of}} its original 19th-century features intact. Preserved historic features include the largest surviving <b>interlocking</b> mechanical swing <b>gates</b> in Victoria at Lydiard Street, signal boxes and goods sheds {{and it is one}} of only three stations in Victoria to have had a 19th-century train shed (along with Geelong and St Kilda).|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes at}} Cooroy station {{over the years}} {{included}} the installation of trunkline telephone facilities in 1909, and gas lights in 1920. Post and telegraph services operated from the railway station between 1892 and 1911, and level crossing <b>gates</b> <b>interlocked</b> with signals were installed in 1912 (not extant). The platform was extended in 1913, and in 1915 a new loop siding was added for the Wide Bay Co-Operative Dairy Association Ltd's new butter factory. The current overhead timber footbridge {{to the north of}} the station was built , to replace a 1961 footbridge.|$|R
50|$|A {{signal box}} {{is located on}} Platform 1, which {{controls}} a crossover to allow trains to terminate here. The interlocked frame at this signal box was abolished in 1976, replaced by a control panel, with boom barriers replacing <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the level crossing, at up end of the station, in 1977. Approximately 100 metres south of the station is a stabling yard that can hold a number of trains. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 20 December 1995.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, {{with the}} opening of the New Pier (later Princes Pier), located to the north of the {{existing}} Station Pier (formerly named Railway Pier), Graham became a junction, with a new line diverging from the Up end of the station. The station had two sets of <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the Graham Street level crossing, controlled by a signal box on the western side, as well as a number of goods sidings at the Up end. The Bridge Street level crossing also had its own signal box.|$|E
5000|$|Clifton Hill {{railway station}} opened on 8 May 1888. The station was damaged by fire in December 1981, {{although}} the heritage registered verandah escaped serious damage. The station was renovated in 1990, {{with a matching}} verandah built on the western platform (Platform 2). Boom barriers replaced <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the Ramsden Street level crossing in 1992. Signal boxes [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] were also abolished in May 1992, with semaphore signals replaced by coloured light signals. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 25 June 1996.|$|E

25|$|Over {{its history}} Grand Trunk Western has had rail yards and engine {{terminals}} located in Detroit, Battle Creek, Durand, Flat Rock, Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Port Huron, Blue Island, Illinois and Chicago. In {{each of the}} cities GTW had engine terminals and facilities for locomotive maintenance including roundhouses and turntables. Prior to 1910 the railroad constructed its major locomotive repair shops in Battle Creek and rail car repair and maintenance was handled by GTW's Port Huron car shops. Its major freight yards were Durand Yard and Pontiac Yard in the two Michigan cities that were major GTW junction pointes. There is also Nichols Yard in Battle Creek, Tunnel Yard in Port Huron, Torrey Yard near Flint and East Yard near the Milwaukee Junction area in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. City Yard was the railroad's rail yard on the Detroit riverfront adjacent to Brush Street Station and its ferry slip dock. The yard, dock and station were eventually all removed and redeveloped by 1975 for construction of the Renaissance Center. It also obtained the former Penn Central Winona Yard in Bay City when it acquired that trackage from Conrail in 1976. On Chicago's south side GTW's Elsdon Yard served as its primary yard and locomotive facility there since the railroad laid tracks into {{the city in the}} 1880s. GTW also had a smaller transfer yard south of Chicago near rail junctions Blue Island, Illinois. In 1975 GTW opened an intermodal freight terminal yard in Chicago known as Railport. The facility is in Chicago's Back of the Yards neighborhood and was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad's Levitt Street Yard. GTW also increased intermodal operations in Detroit In 1976 when it expanded its Ferndale, Michigan railyard into an intermodal facility it called GT MoTerm. The Elsdon Yard was closed and abandoned by 1990 and has been redeveloped. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton's former hump classification yard in Flat Rock, which GTW acquired from its 1983 merger with DT still serves as an important freight hub for Canadian National. Several <b>interlocking</b> and crossing <b>gate</b> towers were also maintained by GTW through its history.|$|R
5000|$|The current station {{building}} on the Platform 1 was opened in 1920, with a tile roof in the [...] "Gisborne style", and in 1936, a new waiting shed and ticket office replaced earlier structures on Platform 2. Boom barriers replaced <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> at the Poplar Road level crossing in 1971, when automatic signaling reached the station from Jewell, with automatic signaling extended to Macaulay in 1972. The Inner Circle line (by then a goods-only stub to Fitzroy) was closed in 1981, and the waiting shed on Platform 2 was destroyed by arson in 1989. The signal box on Platform 1 closed in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Diggers Rest {{opened on}} 2 October 1859 with the line, {{and was also}} the terminus, until the line was {{extended}} to Woodend in 1861. A small goods shed and siding were provided at this time. <b>Interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> were provided at the Calder Highway level crossing in 1928, and were replaced with boom barriers in 1982. The goods siding was removed in 1989, and the remaining crossover was removed in 1992. The waiting room and booking lobby inside the building on Platform 1 were provided later in 1992, and, along with the former signal box, were restored in 2002, after it was damaged by fire during the previous year.|$|E
50|$|Albert Park station {{opened in}} 1860, {{not long after}} the line though it was opened in 1857. It was {{originally}} known as Butts, being renamed to Albert Park in 1872. The station had a signal box on the citybound platform, which controlled the <b>interlocked</b> <b>gates</b> the Bridport Street level crossing, located at the Melbourne end of the station. An annett locked crossover also existed at the St Kilda end of the station between the two lines, being used by goods trains serving St Kilda station. The crossover was removed in 1959 when the goods service was withdrawn, and the signal box was abolished on 28 September 1960 when boom barriers were erected at the level crossing.|$|E
