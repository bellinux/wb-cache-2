5000|$|The Latino Community Foundation {{was founded}} in 1989 under the premise of being an {{organization}} that would help <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos help themselves. Founded by Mr. Hugo Morales, because of the rapidly growing population of <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos in the US, the organization is an invaluable resource to the Hispanic/Latino community of California. There are 38.8 million <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos in the U.S., who represent a population growth in excess of 10% in two years. California {{is home to the}} majority of U.S. <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos: 11 million <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos, 1/3 of California's population and 1/3 of the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population. <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos are rapidly immersing themselves into the market economy, housing sector, public education, and health care spheres of the United States. The dynamic growth of the Hispanic population requires leaders that understand the issues affecting U.S. <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos. Therefore, the Hispanic/Latino Community Foundation “endeavors to support <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos in building a strong future though personal, academic, and financial development”.

5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of <b>Hispanic</b> <b>and</b> Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of <b>Hispanic</b> <b>and</b> Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{not until}} the 1980s after years of protest from the Chicano {{movement}} the United States government created the term Hispanic to classify all peoples who come from Spanish-speaking countries.

Due to this racial perception of Hispanics even among Hispanic Americans themselves, white U.S. <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos, black U.S. <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos, <b>and</b> Asian U.S. <b>Hispanics</b> <b>and</b> Latinos are often overlooked in the U.S. mass media and in general American social perceptions.
