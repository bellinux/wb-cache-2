40|$|Mobile {{cellular}} CDMA {{networks for}} tactical applications re-quire mobile base stations {{in order to}} provide communica-tions on the moue. Because of the mobility of the base sta-tions, power balancing among the transmitters at different base stations is more dificult than in commercial cellular CDMA systems. Handoff of mobiles among base stations is also more difficult, primarily due to the mobility and the re-sulting lack of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>wire-line</b> network to interconnect the base stations. One important consequence is a higher likelihood of strong interference in the mobile receivers due to transmissions from neighboring base stations. In this paper the sensitivity to interference from neighboring base stations is investigated for the forward channels of a mobile cellular CDMA network. I...|$|E
