During the garbage collection, wear-leveling, and bad block mapping operations on the SSD, the additional space from over-provisioning helps lower the write amplification when the controller writes to the flash memory.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{advancement}} in 2049 {{is not based}} on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.|$|E
25|$|Size {{refers to}} how tight the {{tolerances}} {{are on the}} size, as measured by two parallel plates {{in contact with the}} ball surface. The starting size is the nominal ball diameter, which is the , or theoretical, ball diameter. The ball size is then determined by measuring the ball diameter variation, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the largest and smallest diameter measurement. For a given lot there is a lot diameter variation, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the mean diameter of the largest ball and the smallest ball of the lot.|$|E

25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E

25|$|Heart rate reserve (HRreserve) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a person's {{measured}} or predicted maximum {{heart rate}} and resting heart rate.

Additionally, as a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest will drop, and the heart rate reserve will increase. Percentage of HRreserve is equivalent to percentage of VO2 reserve.|$|E

25|$|The ETF {{tracking}} error <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the returns of the ETF and its reference index or asset. A non-zero {{tracking error}} therefore represents {{a failure to}} replicate the reference {{as stated in the}} ETF prospectus. The tracking error is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the ETFâ€™s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index. Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the reference asset or index is illiquid. Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX futures market.|$|E
25|$|Five signal {{descriptors}} were considered: RMS power, EBU3341/R128 integrated loudness, crest factor, EBU3342 LRA, {{and density}} of clipped samples. RMS power {{accounts for the}} signal's physical level, EBU3341 loudness for the perceived level. The crest factor, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the signal's peak and its average power, is on occasions considered {{as a basis for}} the measure of micro-dynamics, for instance in the TT Dynamic Range Meter plug-in. Finally, EBU3342 LRA has been repeatedly considered as a measure of macro-dynamics or dynamics in the musical sense.|$|E
25|$|More precisely, both hue and chroma in {{this model}} are defined {{with respect to the}} {{hexagonal}} shape of the projection. The chroma is the proportion of the distance from the origin {{to the edge of the}} hexagon. In the lower part of the adjacent diagram, this is the ratio of lengths , or alternately the ratio of the radii of the two hexagons. This ratio <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the largest and smallest values among R, G, or B in a color. To make our definitions easier to write, weâ€™ll define these maximum, minimum, and chroma component values as M, m, and C, respectively.|$|E

25|$|A {{framework}} is an undirected graph, embedded into d-dimensional Euclidean space {{by providing a}} d-tuple of Cartesian coordinates for each vertex of the graph. From a framework with n vertices and m edges, one can define a matrix with m rows and nd columns, an expanded version of the incidence matrix of the graph called the rigidity matrix. In this matrix, the entry in row e and column (v,i) is zero if v is not an endpoint of edge e. If, on the other hand, edge e has vertices u and v as endpoints, then {{the value of the}} entry <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the ith coordinates of v and u.|$|E
25|$|Roughly, transudates are {{a result}} of {{increased}} pressure in the hepatic portal vein (>8 mmHg, usually around 20 mmHg), e.g. due to cirrhosis, while exudates are actively secreted fluid due to inflammation or malignancy. As a result, exudates are high in protein and lactate dehydrogenase and have a low pH (<7.30), a low glucose level, and more white blood cells. Transudates have low protein (<30 g/L), low LDH, high pH, normal glucose, and fewer than 1 white cell per 1000nbsp&mmÂ³. Clinically, the most useful measure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> ascitic and serum albumin concentrations. A difference of less than 1 g/dl (10 g/L) implies an exudate.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this {{semantic}} dependency <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> possible interpretations in a language that marks inalienable possession (e.g. French) with a language that does not (e.g. English). Inalienable possession is semantically dependent and is defined in reference to another object to which it belongs. (20) is ambiguous and has two possible meanings. In the inalienable possessive interpretation, la main belongs to the subject, les enfants. The second interpretation is that la main is an alienable object that {{does not belong to}} the subject. The English equivalent of this sentence (The children raised the hand) only has the alienable possessive reading in which the hand does not belong to the children.|$|E
