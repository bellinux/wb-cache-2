He has also been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating [...] "I believe that Hank Aaron is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was." [...] Of Alex Rodriguez, whom Jackson has worked alongside as {{special assistant to the}} Yankees, Jackson remarked, [...] "Al's a very good friend. But I think there are real questions about his numbers. As much as I like him, what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers." [...] On July 12, the Yankees released a statement from Jackson after the Sports Illustrated interview had been released. The press release included Jackson saying, [...] "In trying to convey my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate about, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of naming some specific players." [...] It had been reported [...] he had been told by the Yankees to steer clear from the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated he had not been banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and would later be free to interact with the club. After the SI article became known and Jackson's status with the Yankees being talked about, Jackson confirmed in his statement [...] "I continue to have a strong relationship with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team." ...|$|E

He loomed up after the teasers. We had three of these flying-fish out as teasers, all close to the boat. I always wondered why the swordfish appear more attracted to the teasers than to our hooked baits only a few yards back. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> to pull the teasers away from this swordfish.

The first time I started out at seven o'clock in the evening with four shillings in my pocket. Herein I committed two errors. In the first place, the applicant for admission to the casual ward must be destitute, and as he is subjected to a rigorous search, he must really be destitute; and fourpence, much less four shillings, is sufficient affluence to disqualify him. In the second place, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of tardiness. Seven o'clock in the evening is too late in the day for a pauper to get a pauper's bed.|$|E

5000|$|A {{certain number}} of the polyamory people have gotten on my case about it.

Then you've got a {{certain number of}} the more traditional Buddhist crowd, who've never even heard of polyamory, who think I take a much too positive view of it. I feel that if I'm somewhere in the middle of those two sets of opinions, I must be doing something right.|$|R

60|$|In the {{meantime}} I was learning--I shall not say to tool a four-in-hand--but just simply to drive four horses. Now {{it is all}} right enough to begin with four work-horses pulling a load of several tons. But to begin with four light horses, all running, and a light rig that seems to outrun them--well, when things happen they happen quickly. My weakness was total ignorance. In particular, my fingers lacked training, and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of depending on my eyes to handle the reins. This brought me up against a disastrous optical illusion. The bight of the off head-line, being longer and heavier {{than that of the}} off wheel-line, hung lower. In a moment requiring quick action, I invariably mistook the two lines. Pulling on what I thought was the wheel-line, in order to straighten the team, I would see the leaders swing abruptly around into a jack-pole. Now for sensations of sheer impotence, nothing can compare with a jack-pole, when the horrified driver beholds his leaders prancing gaily up the road and his wheelers jogging steadily down the road, {{all at the same time}} and all harnessed together and to the same rig.|$|E

[FN#2] The jubbah is a long outer garment, {{generally}} of cloth, worn by learned and respectable men. The za'abut is a large bag-sleeved black or brown coloured robe made of home-spun woollen, the garb of the peasant, the hedge-priest, and the darwaysh. [FN#3] The mountain which encircles the globe, according to the sacred geography of the Moslems. To [...] "go to Kaf" [...] is equivalent to our [...] "go to Jericho," [...] or-somewhere else. [FN#4] Sir G. Wilkinson, referring his readers to Strabo, remarks that the [...] "troublesome system of passports seems to have been adopted by the Egyptians at a very early period." [...] Its present rigours, which have lasted since the European troubles in 1848 and 1849, have a two-fold object; in the first place, to act as a clog upon the dangerous emigrants which Germany, Italy, and Greece have sent out into the world; and secondly, to confine the subjects of the present Pasha of Egypt to their fatherland and the habit of paying taxes. The enlightened ruler (this was written during the rule of Abbas Pasha) knows his own interests, and never willingly parts with a subject liable to cess, at times objecting even to their obeying pilgrimage law. We, on the other hand, in India, allow a freedom of emigration, in my humble opinion, highly injurious to us. For not only does this exodus thin the population, and tend to impoverish the land, it also serves to bring our rule into disrepute in foreign lands. At another time I shall discuss this subject more fully. [FN#5] The glare of Alexandria has become a matter of fable in the East. The stucco employed in overlaying its walls, erected by Zul-karnayn, was so exquisitely tempered and so beautifully polished, that the inhabitants, in order to protect themselves from blindness, were constrained to wear masks. [FN#6] The word literally means [...] "a bowman, an archer," [...] reminding us of [...] "les archers de la Sainte Hermandade," [...] in the most delicious of modern fictions. Some mis-spell the word [...] "Kawas," [...] "Cavass," [...] and so forth! [FN#7] A whip, a cravache of dried and twisted hippopotamus hide, the ferule, horsewhip, and [...] "cat o' nine tails" [...] of Egypt. [FN#8] For [...] "man anta?" [...] who art thou? [FN#9] An opprobrious name given by the Turks to their Christian converts. The word is derived from burmak, [...] "to twist, to turn." [...] [FN#10] During my journey, and since my return, some Indian papers conducted by jocose editors made merry upon an Englishman [...] "turning Turk." [...] Once for all, I beg leave to point above for the facts of the case; it must serve as a general answer to any pleasant little fictions which may hereafter appear. [FN#11] A stick of soft wood chewed at one end. It is generally used throughout the East, where brushes should be avoided, as the natives always suspect hogs' bristles. [FN#12] Almost all Easterns sleep under a sheet, which becomes a kind of respirator, defending them from the dews and mosquitoes by night and the flies by day. The [...] "rough and ready" [...] traveller will learn to follow the example, remembering that [...] "Nature is founder of Customs in savage countries;" [...] whereas, amongst the soi-disant civilised, Nature has no deadlier enemy than Custom. [FN#13] It is strictly forbidden to carry arms in Egypt. This, however, does not prevent their being as necessary-especially in places like Alexandria, where Greek and Italian ruffians abound-as they ever were in Rome or Leghorn during the glorious times of Italian [...] "liberty." [...] [FN#14] In the Azhar Mosque, immediately after Friday service, a fellow once put his hand into my pocket, which fact alone is ample evidence of [...] "progress." [...] [FN#15] As a general rule, always produce, when travelling, the minutest bit of coin. At present, however, small change is dear in Egypt; the Sarrafs, or money-changers, create the dearth in order to claim a high agio. The traveller must prepare himself for a most unpleasant task in learning the different varieties of currency, which appear all but endless, the result of deficiency in the national circulating medium. There are, however, few copper coins, the pieces of ten or five faddah (or parahs), whereas silver and gold abound. As regards the latter metal, strangers should mistrust all small pieces, Turkish as well as Egyptian. [...] "The greater part are either cut or cracked, or perhaps both, and worn down to mere spangles: after taking them, it will not be possible to pass them without considerable loss." [...] Above all things, the traveller must be careful never to change gold except in large towns, where such a display of wealth would not arouse suspicion or cupidity; and on no occasion when travelling even to pronounce the ill-omened word [...] "Kis" [...] (purse). Many have lost their lives by neglecting these simple precautions. [FN#16] Some prefer a long chain of pure gold divided into links and covered with leather, so as to resemble the twisted girdle which the Arab fastens round his waist. It is a precaution well known to the wandering knights of old. Others, again, in very critical situations, open with a lancet the shoulder, or any other fleshy part of the body, and insert a precious stone, which does not show in its novel purse. [FN#17] Any [...] "Companion to the Medicine Chest" [...] will give, to those that require such information, the names of drugs and instruments necessary for a journey; but it must be borne in mind that hot countries require double quantities of tonics, and half the allowance of cathartics necessary in cold climates. Sonnini, however, is right when he says of the Egyptian fellahs, that their stomachs, accustomed to digest bread badly baked, acrid and raw vegetables, and other green and unwholesome nourishment, require doses fit only for horses. Advisable precautions are, in the first place, to avoid, if travelling as a native, any signs of European manufacture in knives, scissors, weights, scales and other such articles. Secondly, glass bottles are useless: the drugs should be stowed away in tin or wooden boxes, such as the natives of the country use, and when a phial is required, it must be fitted into an etui of some kind. By this means, ground glass stoppers and plentiful cotton stuffing, the most volatile essences may be carried about without great waste. After six months of the driest heat, in Egypt and Arabia, not more than about one-fourth of my Prussic acid and chloroform had evaporated. And, thirdly, if you travel in the East, a few bottles of tincture of cantharides-highly useful as a rubefacient, excitant, et cetera-must never be omitted. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of buying my drugs in England, and had the useless trouble of looking after them during the journey. Both at Alexandria and Cairo they {{are to be found in}} abundance, cheaper than in London, and good enough for all practical purposes.|$|E
