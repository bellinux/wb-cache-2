40|$|Abstract. Assuring {{safety in}} the <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system</b> (HNS) is a crucial issue to {{guarantee}} high quality of life. In this position paper, we first review our previous work, formulating three kinds of safety for the HNS integrated services: local safety, global safety, and environment safety. We then present a method that validates safety for integrated service. Finally, we discuss a perspective in how the safety can be assured when considering the feature interaction problem. 1 Formalizing Safety in <b>Home</b> <b>Network</b> <b>System</b> The <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system</b> (HNS, for short) is comprised of networked home appliances and sensors, {{which is one of}} the most promising applications of the emerging ubiquitous computing technologies. The HNS enables flexible integration (or orchestration) of different home appliances and sensors through the network, which achieves value-added integrated services [5]. In developing and providing the HNS integrated services, the service provider must guarantee that the service is safe for inhabitants, house properties and their surrounding environment.

40|$|One {{trend in}} our homes is {{that more and more}} {{components}} are equipped with "local intelligence", that means intelligence embedded in sensors, actuators and microcontrollers. If the components will be able to communicate together, new functionalities with more safety, comfort and less wasting of energy are possible. Such a system that consists of components communicating together we call an "integrated Home System". While an increasing degree of domestic homes will be equipped with standard communication-infrastructures like EIB, ISDN, RF- and broadcast-networks, alarm systems will even use <b>home</b> <b>system</b> <b>networks</b> in future for a better detection of dangerous situations. Therefore it is necessary to define interface standards between products of different manufacturers and get experiences with reliability of applications that based on different communication systems.

40|$|In the {{emerging}} <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>systems</b> (HNS), household appliances and sensors {{are connected to}} the network to provide various value-added services. However, the cost taken for users to operate the HNS would increase significantly, due to the diversification of appliances and services. Thus, intuitive and simple human interfaces are strongly required. This paper presents a method that operates the networked appliances using user’s voice and gaze information together. The conventional voice command interface cannot achieve high precision, when the number of target operations is large. Therefore, the gaze information is used {{to reduce the number of}} operations, so that the system handles only appliances that the user is currently gazing at.

40|$|Abstract The <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system</b> (HNS, for short) {{provides}} value-added and context-aware {{services for}} home users, by orchestrating networked home appliances and sensors. Although the HNS services {{have been developed}} by system vendors, there exist strong needs that the end-users create their own services according to their convenience. This paper presents a novel service creation environment, called Sensor Service Binder (SSB), which provides a user-friendly interface for creating context-aware services within the HNS. Built {{on top of the}} service-oriented HNS, the SSB allows non-expert users to register contexts using the sensors, and to bind the registered context to any operation of the networked appliances.

40|$|Abstract—Managing a home server within {{individual}} {{house is}} a major obstacle to practical use of <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system</b> (HNS). Delegating the home server to a cloud is a promising approach. However, the conventional multi-tenant SaaS-based solution has the following risks among different households: security/privacy violation, failure propagation and insufficient resource demand. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-based architecture for the <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system</b> that achieves security isolation, fault isolation and resource isolation. Specifically, we first create a virtual home server for every household using IaaS. On top of every virtual home server, we then create additional virtual machines, each of which contains a single service or application. Finally, using dynamic scaling, we allocate resources needed for individual virtual home servers. Based on the idea, we construct the proposed architecture by three layers: HNS Lite, House Cloud and Service Provider.

Each node may be randomly distributed in a monitoring area, reflecting the network event of tracking in ZigBee network applications. This paper presents the development and coverage evaluation of a ZigBee-based wireless network application. A stack structure node available for home service integration is proposed, and all data of sensing nodes with an adaptive weighted fusion (AWF) processing are passed to the gateway and through the gateway to reexecute packet processing and then reported to the monitoring center, which effectively optimize the wireless network to the scale of the data processing efficiency.

The conventional peak shaving {{has been conducted}} in an automatic and system-centric approach, using the emerging <b>home</b> energy management <b>systems</b> (HEMS). However, for more sustainable energy-saving, {{it is also important}} to develop a human-centric approach, which encourages residents to perform energy-saving behaviors by themselves. In this paper, we present a smartphone application, named Peak Cutter, which assists home users to perform spontaneous peak shaving. Cooperating with a <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system,</b> Peak Cutter monitors electricity demand in a house, and notifies the user via a smartphone when the demand exceeds a threshold. The user then checks the current energy consumption of each home appliance, and can remotely turn off some appliances to shave the peak.

To fill the requirement, this paper presents a novel framework that enables Personal Home Controllers (PHC) on smartphones. The proposed framework is designed so that a user can freely design screen layouts with buttons and pictures, and can define favorite HNS operations on the layouts. The first part of our contribution is PHC Framework, which dynamically implements a PHC based on a given user definition. The second part is PHC Creater, a GUI application which supports the user to create the user definition. The proposed framework is implemented for Android mobile devices. We conduct an experimental evaluation, where subjects create PHCs for operating an actual HNS. The experimental result shows that every subject creates a unique PHC with his favorite motif, and that most subjects find usefulness and pleasure in creating their own PHCs.

40|$|Abstract—To achieve {{efficient}} presence sensing within <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system</b> (HNS), {{an inexpensive}} and elastic {{system that can}} be shared by various HNS applications is required. This paper presents Presence Sensor Service Framework, which can uniformly manage presence information in various places using various types of sensors. The framework consists of Presence Sensor Device (PSD), Presence Sensor Terminal (PST) and Presence Sensor Aggregator (PSA). A PST monitors PSDs to detect any changes of presence, and notifies a PSA of the changes. Upon the notifications from PSTs, the PSA estimates human presence around each PSD. The estimation process is deployed as Presence Sensor Service (PSS), which is used by various HNS applications. The proposed framework can dynamically add or change sensing places within a HNS by adding PST and PSD as needed. It can also integrate presences in multiple HNSs by deploying PSA on an external cloud. In this paper, we implement a prototype of the proposed framework by using Phidgets sensors and Java Web service. Moreover, we develop a presence visualization application to conduct a preliminary evaluation.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we suggest}} {{the model for}} the context aware {{computing}} of the <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>systems.</b> Our model uses the Bayesian networks (BNs) and a new approach to structure learning of BNs based on genetic algorithm is proposed. The proposed method explores the wider solution space than the previous method which also uses the genetic algorithm for structure learning of BNs. In the previous method, while the ordering among the nodes of the BNs was fixed their conditional dependencies represented by the connectivity matrix was learned, whereas, in the proposed method, the ordering as well as the conditional dependency among the BN nodes is learned. To implement this method using the genetic algorithm, we represent an individual of the population as a pair of chromosomes: The first one represents the ordering among the BN nodes and the second one represents their conditional dependencies based on the ordering of the first chromosome. To implement proposed method new crossover and mutation operations which are closed in the set of the admissible individuals are introduced. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the given context aware problem of <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system</b> and its effectiveness is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With {{the spread}} of Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) systems and cloud services, various kinds of data are {{available}} through Web services. A context-aware service recognizes a real-world context from such data and behaves autonomously based on the context. However, it has been challenging to manage contexts and services defined on the heterogeneous and distributed Web services. In this paper, we propose a framework, called RuCAS, which systematically creates and manages context-aware service using various Web services (e. g. information services, sensor services, networked appliances, etc.). The framework describes every context-aware service by an ECA (Event-Condition-Action) rule. For this, an event is a context triggering the service, a condition {{is a set of}} contexts to be satisfied for execution, and the action is a set of Web services to be executed by the service. Thus, every context-aware service is simply managed in a uniform manner. Since the RuCAS is published as a Web service, it is easy for various applications to reuse and integrate created contexts and services. As a case study, RuCAS is applied to creating context-aware services in a real <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system.</b> Index Terms—Web services, context-awareness, event-condition-action rule, <b>home</b> <b>network</b> <b>system,</b> sensor services I...|$|R

In the SSF, a context was defined by a condition over a single sensor, or multiple sensors that derived by logical or arithmetic operations. However, the contexts were limited to the ones that can be defined by current values of the sensors, and can not describe the timing constraint relation in context on using multiple sensor web servers such as “after opening the door for 2 seconds, passed the hall ” or “setting on the sofa”, and hindered us from creating high-level timing constraints context...|$|R
