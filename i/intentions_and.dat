5|$|At the Potsdam Conference, {{which started}} in late July after Germany's surrender, serious {{differences}} emerged over the future development of Germany {{and the rest of}} Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, the participants' mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each other's hostile <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> entrench their positions. At this conference Truman informed Stalin that the United States possessed a powerful new weapon.|$|E

He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E

We {{present a}} modal logic called LIA (Logic of <b>Intention</b> <b>and</b> Attempt) {{in which we}} can reason about <b>intention</b> {{dynamics}} <b>and</b> intentional action execution. By exploiting the expressive power of LIA, we provide a formal analysis of the relation between <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> action and highlight the pivotal role of attempt in action execution. Besides, we deal with the problems of instrumental reasoning <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> persistence...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1814, the armies of the French Empire, under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I, were scrambling to defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies. Despite fighting against vastly superior forces, Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and, between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher’s Army of Silesia. On 13 February, reeling from his successive defeats, Blücher looked to disengage from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with {{a part of his}} forces to fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who was defending Napoleon’s rear. The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February. Nevertheless, the Emperor had read into his enemy’s <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> directed powerful forces to support Marmont.|$|E

Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilize assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E

5|$|During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), {{some one}} hundred Russian ciphers were {{broken by a}} sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who {{included}} army Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski and three world-famous professors of mathematics — Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wacław Sierpiński and Stanisław Leśniewski. Russian army staffs were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army staffs during World War I, to the decisive advantage of their German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> operational orders.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the war and the start of the Siege of Boston, British authorities enlisted the assistance of a loyalist merchant, named Ichabod Jones, to aid in the acquisition of needed supplies. Two of Jones' merchant ships arrived in Machias on June 2, 1775, accompanied by a British armed sloop called the Margaretta (sometimes also spelled Margueritta or Marguerite) that was commanded by Midshipman James Moore. The townspeople of Machias disapproved of Jones' <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> arrested him. They also tried to arrest Moore, but he escaped through the harbor. The townspeople seized one of Jones' ships, armed it alongside a second local ship, and sailed out to meet Moore. After a short confrontation, Moore was fatally wounded, and his vessel and crew were captured.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1340s {{relations}} with the Byzantine Empire temporarily deteriorated. Ivan Alexander demanded the extradition of his cousin Šišman, one of the sons of Michael Asen III, threatening the Byzantine government with war. Ivan Alexander's show of force backfired, as the Byzantines managed to see through his <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> sent against him the fleet of their ally, the Turkish emir of Smyrna Umur Beg. Landing in the Danube Delta, they pillaged the countryside and attacked nearby Bulgarian cities. Forced to restrain his demands, Ivan Alexander invaded the Byzantine Empire again {{at the end of}} 1341, claiming that he was summoned by the people of Adrianople. However, Ivan Alexander's troops were defeated twice by Turkish allies of the Byzantines near the city.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen did not record {{any of his}} works. However, three younger {{contemporary}} conductors who {{had worked}} with him, Thomas Jensen, Launy Grøndahl, and Erik Tuxen, did record his symphonies and other orchestral works with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra between 1946 and 1952. Jensen also made the first LP recording of the Fifth Symphony in 1954. Work carried out by the recently published complete Carl Nielsen Edition has revealed that the scores used in these recordings often differ from the composer's original <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> thus the supposed authenticity of these recordings is now debatable.|$|E

40|$|Gender {{differences}} in computer use has been always {{a topic of}} research interest. The understanding of the patterns among gender, including beliefs, <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> use behavior of IT/IS would provide us a better picture {{to the process of}} design and implementation, which gives support to IT/IS success. However, published works explaining why and how beliefs and attitudes varied between different genders are still scarce, yet the topic was of widespread relevance. We direct our empirical work on user’s beliefs, <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> usage behavior. Gender {{differences in}} beliefs would likely make a corresponding impact on the intention to use or not to use computer in the future, and hence, the actual usage pattern. Assumed to be behavioral manifestations of users’ gender differences, we infer these gender differences in the beliefs of computer use from their self-reported <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> usage behavior. Therefore, we aim to explore the factors affecting the <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> usage behavior; and their corresponding strengths in affecting the <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> usage behavior; in order to suggest effective implementation strategies accordingly. The research questions of this empirical study are: 1. What are the emergent constructs that drive the <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> usage behavior of computer use? 2. Do users’ beliefs regarding IT/IS usage differ among genders? 3. To what extent do these effects differ? To address these research questions, we applied technology acceptance model (TAM) to a group of pre-service teachers, and measured their beliefs in using computer to explain the gender differences in their beliefs, <b>intention,</b> <b>and</b> usage of computer. The rest of the article proceeds as follows. The next section starts with a review on gender and technology. The third section explains the model framework TAM. The fourth section describes the instrument construction and validation. The fifth section reports the model testing results. The final section discusses the thrusts of the study and future trends. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, <b>intentions,</b> <b>and</b> limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial {{distinction}} between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E
