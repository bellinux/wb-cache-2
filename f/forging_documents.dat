500|$|Gatlif's quest [...] {{began in}} 1970 when he {{approached}} Matéo Maximoff, a French writer of Romani ethnicity. The two went to Montreuil {{to interview the}} Roman there who refused to discuss the subject. Gatlif was also researching the Justes, the French who attempted to shield the Romani from persecution. Following former French President Jacques Chirac's efforts to honour the Justes, Gatlif came across Yvette Lundy, a former schoolteacher in Gionges, La Marne, who had been deported for <b>forging</b> <b>documents</b> for the Romani. Gatlif came across an anecdote by Jacques Sigot, a historian who has documented the Porajmos, which would later help with the story. The anecdote is about a Romani family saved from {{being sent to the}} camp at Montreuil-Bellay by a French lawyer who sold them his home for a single franc. Unable to adjust to a stationary lifestyle, the family took to the streets, which led to their arrest in northern France and eventual incarceration in the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E
500|$|Harry Horse {{conceived}} the game's ancient planetwide conspiracy. Horse had previously written several children's books {{and received the}} Scottish Arts Council Writer of the Year award for his 1983 book [...] He began <b>forging</b> <b>documents</b> that same year {{as a way to}} earn money. The story which became the basis for Drowned God was originally a phony manuscript Horse wrote in 1983, ostensibly describing events after the destruction of the lost city of Atlantis. The manuscript, dated 1846, was said to have been written by the English poet Richard Horne, who shares Horse's birth name. Horse's initiation into the concept of an alternate history came in the early 1980s, when he first encountered professor Ian Halpke, who explained to him that information from the Kabbalah and ancient Jewish texts [...] "hide and encipher the secret", namely, human evolution was aided by extraterrestrial intelligence. According to Horse, Halpke believed the Ark of the Covenant was a nuclear device, and that humans and pigs share compatible genes.|$|E

500|$|Pleydell's {{political}} and personal life {{is marked by}} legal controversy.

He was alleged {{to be one of}} the ringleaders of a plot to exile Queen Mary of England, and is perhaps best known for his contentious claim of parliamentary privilege after he was found guilty of this offence in 1555, an action which caused serious disagreement between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Legal accusations for most of his political career and imprisonment in Fleet Prison and the Tower of London helped [...] "confirm for Gabriel Pleydell a niche in parliamentary history", according to a modern historian. He died between 19 December 1590 and 3 February 1591.|$|E
500|$|As {{established}} in the EPB's [...] "Organization of the EPB", the organization operates in a systemic and hierarchic structure. The entire organization is overseen by a central committee, which is generally focused on politics and policies. Beneath it lies a military commission, {{which in turn is}} divided by sub commissions specialized in finances, intelligence, transportation, provisions and general services and others as needed. Each commando receives additional salary, with specific exemptions being given to marriages, unemployed individuals and those with dependents. In December 1981, the EPB included benefits similar to those in the American military. The organization agreed to medical services and college education pending commission approval. New recruits may be covertly trained in rural farms or in foreign countries (Cuba being an example) and inconspicuous businesses may be used to provide cover to certain individuals. Training includes skills such as lock picking, handling firearms and explosives, <b>forging</b> <b>documents,</b> scuba diving, photography, concealment using makeup and forging license plates. An exercise regime is expected from commandoes afterwards. Meeting are kept to a minimum and only held when relevant.|$|E
