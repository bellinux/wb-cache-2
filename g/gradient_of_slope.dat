Amongst the soil hydraulic properties, the hydraulic conductivity K and considered as the dominant factor affecting the slope stability. Of less prominent was the effect of water retention characteristics. In this study, a numerical model was developed to estimate the extent of rainwater infiltration into an unsaturated slope, the formation of a saturated zone, and the change in slope stability. This model is then used to analyze the effects of the soil porosity parameters(i. e.,saturated soil water content q, and effective soil porosity (ESP) and slope gradient on the occurrence of slope failure. Results showed that when the surface soil of a slope has a relatively large ESP value, it has agreater capacity for holding rainwater, and therefore delays rainwater infiltration into the subsurface layer. Consequently, the increase in pore water pressure in the subsurface layer is also delayed. In this manner, a relatively large surface layer ESP value contributes to delaying slope failure. In addition,the slope <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> is also a significant parameter in slope stability analysis.

For 1 -m long sensor we obtained 5 -mm measuring range with ± 28 -m uncertainty. 1. PRINCIPLE OF SENSOR OPERATION A {{new kind of}} the elongation sensor exploits the contrast phenomenon in the unbalanced Michelson interferometer (Fig. 1). Light from the source is coupled into monomode fiber and amplitude divided into measuring and reference arm by the 3 × 3 coupler. The two guided beams are reflected by the mirrors, recombined again and mix coherently to produce interference observable at the outputs. The irradiance observed at a detector {{as a function of}} the measurement arm elongation can be written as: I(l) ∝ IO[1 + V (l) · cos(2 (l)) ] (1) whereV is the contrast of the interferometer and is the phase difference between beams. The contrast describes the amplitude of the interference output irradiance and derives from a source spectrum. It is known, that a laser with one frequency mode gives the exponential dependence of the contrast, while for multimode lasers the contrast oscillates within the envelope determined by one mode contrast dependence.

We analyse high-resolution spectra of red giants, obtained from the HIRES@Keck and UVES@VLT archives.

Be 20 also exhibits a peculiar orbit with a large excursion above the plane. The irregular orbits of the three most metal-poor clusters (of which two are located at the edge of the Galactic disk), if confirmed by more robust astrometric measurements such as those of the Gaia mission, are compatible with an inside-out formation scenario for the Milky Way, in which extragalactic material is accreted onto the outer disk.

40|$|During {{the past}} 30 years an {{increase}} in forest damage has been observed in the forest of Baden-Württemberg, a federal state in the Southwest region of Germany. Forest damage has been frequently related to acid rain resulting in accerlerated soil acidification and induced nutritional deficiency. In some of the areas of Baden-Württemberg the soils are already acidic, e. g. in the Black Forest where the geology is mainly siliceous bedrock such granite and gneiss and {{does not have a}} high buffer capacity against the acids. However, it is difficult to make a direct linkage between acidic deposition and forest health because trees are exposed to many diverse stresses. Causes of forest decline can be grouped into two categories. One category posits direct damage to forest canopy that is reversible. The other category posits indirect damage to soil quality changes that may be irreversible and slow to recover. A model for the forest status is proposed which try to take into account of these two different sources of damage. We use the methodology of generalised additive mixed models, also called geoadditive models, to accomplish this task. The available data are from the survey of emission impact and forest nutrition (IWE) carried out by the Forest Research Centre Baden-Württemberg (FVA) in 1994 and the Chemical soil condition survey (BZE) carried out in 1992, which have a different spatial resolution.

40|$|Prediction of CO 2 -consumption by {{chemical}} weathering {{is important to}} understand the global carbon cycle, and island arcs are assumed to contribute significantly to the transfer of atmospheric/soil CO 2 to the oceans. Previous work established empirical functions for bicarbonate-flux and CO 2 -consumption in dependence of runoff for five to six lithological classes. These functions were applied in global studies. However, it has remained uncertain, if improvements can be achieved by considering further factors or by an enhanced lithological classification scheme. This study applies a new lithological map of Japan with an enhanced lithological classification, a hydrochemical data set representing 382 catchments (covering similar to 44. 4 % of the Japanese Archipelago) and a multi-lithological model approach to predict bicarbonate-fluxes and CO 2 -consumption by {{chemical weathering}}. Because of significant carbonate contents in sediments (different from carbonate sedimentary rocks), acid plutonics and metamorphics, firstly a bicarbonate-flux model approach is established and, secondly, silicate and carbonate CO 2 -consumption is estimated, based on the geochemical composition of rocks. In accordance with previous studies on the catchment scale, the most important factors controlling bicarbonate-fluxes are lithology and runoff. The anion ratio HCO 3 -/(SO 42 - + Cl-) is identified as the third most important predictor, because anion sources and anion Composition of river water have a great effect on bicarbonate concentrations. And last but not least, potential predictors such as <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope,</b> temperature and physical erosion explain some part of the observed bicarbonate-flux variation. These potential predictors have been discussed in literature, but quantification of the effects of these factors remains difficult due to their correlation with runoff and lithology. However, all tested models reproduce a total of observed bicarbonate-fluxes within 10 % on the regional scale including the simplest model which recognizes only lithology and runoff as predictors. Model results suggest that bicarbonate-flux from the Japanese Archipelago is about 6. 61 t C km(- 2) a(- 1), and CO 2 -consumption by chemical weathering is about 6. 05 t C km(- 2) a(- 1) (91. 6 % of bicarbonate-flux). This CO 2 -consumption rate is 3. 2 times above the global average rate. The silicate to carbonate CO 2 -consumption ratio is comparatively high. It amounts to 9. 9 which is above the global value. The latter one being 1 to 1. 5. Carbonate sedimentary rocks contribute only 1. 3 % to bicarbonate-fluxes due to their low areal proportion (0. 2 %). Acid volcanic rocks (VA) show the lowest bicarbonate-fluxes, on average, while basic and intermediate volcanics (VB) as well as pyroclastics (PY) are in the range of the Japanese average value. The carbonate weathering contribution to bicarbonate-fluxes from mixed sediments, siliciclastic sediments, metamorphics and acid plutonics is estimated to be 69. 2 %, 23. 3 %, 63. 4 % and 24. 8 %, respectively. Only an average carbonate CO 2 -consumption per lithological class is calculated because no function based on typical predictors could be established to calculate carbonate weathering contribution to silicate-dominated lithological classes. This can be attributed to large spatial differences in carbonate content in rocks and to corresponding contributions to bicarbonatefluxes. In the following, results are compared to bicarbonate-flux models of previous studies and identified differences are discussed. In conclusion, recognition of carbonate abundance in silicate-dominated lithological classes (including trace calcite) is important to calculate silicate/carbonate CO 2 -consumption ratios. Presented results are relevant for studies modelling CO 2 -consumption by chemical weathering in context of the global C-cycle. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLithology is an {{important}} characteristic of the terrestrial surface, whose properties influence chemical weathering rates. Specifically non-silicate minerals may contribute significantly to the weathering derived fluxes from silicate-dominated lithological classes. The Japanese Archipelago consists of predominantly silicate-dominated lithologies with {{a high proportion of}} volcanics. However, the spatially explicit representation of chemical weathering rates remains difficult for such a large region, because many controlling factors on chemical weathering rates are correlated with each other. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of lithology, a multi-lithological model approach to estimate spatially explicit chemical weathering rates for unmonitored areas is applied here. To achieve this, hydrochemical data of 381 catchments are used to train a set of models, recognizing the contribution of a variety of proposed factors influencing chemical silicate rock weathering rates (CSRWR: cations plus dissolved silica flux). The monitored catchments cover ~ 44 % of the Japanese Archipelago. Cation chemical weathering rates (excluding Si) are linearly correlated with CSRWR and show outliers if basic volcanics or pyroclastic flows are present due to increased silica release rates. Lithology and runoff are identified as the strongest predictors for chemical weathering rates. Temperature and <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> are of less relevance for the regional scale prediction while further proposed factors like soil properties or land cover are not identified as major predictors. Latter findings are partly attributed to geodata quality, low variability of parameter values as well as spatial correlations of proposed controlling factors with lithology or runoff. The calculated average CSRWR of the Archipelago is ~ 25 tkm− 2 a− 1 and ranges from 5. 9 to 107 tkm− 2 a− 1 in monitored catchments. Weathering rates per lithological class as a function of runoff can be grouped into three classes: a) pyroclastic flows showing the highest chemical weathering rates; b) alluvial deposits, mixed sediments and basic to intermediate volcanics with medium rates; and c) metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, acid volcanics, acid plutonics and unconsolidated sediments (other than alluvial deposits), showing the lowest rates. The recognition of lithogenic sulfur would add 9. 7 % to CSRWR of considered catchments. Results suggest that the lithological classes acid volcanics and unconsolidated sediments contribute above average to the sulfur fluxes. Possible biases of this observation are discussed. The contribution of Ca-fluxes from non-silicate calcic minerals (named Ca-excess, Ca-fluxes in addition to silicate Ca-fluxes) is about 10 % of the CSRWR on average and is attributed by a wide value range. The calculated ratio “Ca-excess to total Ca-fluxes” from chemical weathering averages around 62 %, 75 %, 56 %, 83 % and 84 % for the lithological classes acid plutonics, metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, mixed sediments and acid volcanics, respectively. This suggests a major Ca-contribution from non-silicate calcic minerals for these lithological classes. Phosphorus release from rocks due to chemical weathering is estimated to be between 1 kg Pkm− 2 a− 1 and 390 kgPkm− 2 a− 1. The P-release patterns in dependence of runoff per lithological class are different from CSRWRs due to differences of applied P-content in rocks. The identified spatial P-release patterns suggest that the consideration of dynamic and spatially resolved P-release rates by chemical weathering might improve ecosystem studies. Later findings may be of importance for analysing the influence of P-release from rocks on the climate system via ecosystem functioning on geological time scales. A first application of the P-release model to the global scale suggests an annual release of 1. 6 Mt P (13. 8 kgPkm− 1 a− 1) by chemical weathering of silicate dominated lithological classes (excluding carbonate sedimentary rocks) ...|$|E

To achieve this, hydrochemical data of 381 catchments are used to train a set of models, recognizing the contribution of a variety of proposed factors influencing chemical silicate rock weathering rates (CSRWR: cations plus dissolved silica flux). The monitored catchments cover similar to 44 % of the Japanese Archipelago. Cation chemical weathering rates (excluding Si) are linearly correlated with CSRWR and show outliers if basic volcanics or pyroclastic flows are present due to increased silica release rates. Lithology and runoff are identified as the strongest predictors for chemical weathering rates. Temperature and <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> are of less relevance for the regional scale prediction while further proposed factors like soil properties or land cover are not identified as major predictors. Latter findings are partly attributed to geodata quality, low variability of parameter values as well as spatial correlations of proposed controlling factors with lithology or runoff. The calculated average CSRWR of the Archipelago is similar to 25 t km(- 2) a(- 1) and ranges from 5. 9 to 107 t km(- 2) a(- 1) in monitored catchments. Weathering rates per lithological class as a function of runoff can be grouped into three classes: a) pyroclastic flows showing the highest chemical weathering rates; b) alluvial deposits, mixed sediments and basic to intermediate volcanics with medium rates; and c) metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, acid volcanics, acid plutonics and unconsolidated sediments (other than alluvial deposits), showing the lowest rates. The recognition of lithogenic sulfur would add 9. 7 % to CSRWR of considered catchments. Results suggest that the lithological classes acid volcanics and unconsolidated sediments contribute above average to the sulfur fluxes. Possible biases of this observation are discussed. The contribution of Ca-fluxes from non-silicate calcic minerals (named Ca-excess, Ca-fluxes in addition to silicate Ca-fluxes) is about 10 % of the CSRWR on average and is attributed by a wide value range. The calculated ratio "Ca-excess to total Ca-fluxes" from chemical weathering averages around 62 %, 75 %, 56 %, 83 % and 84 % for the lithological classes acid plutonics, metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, mixed sediments and acid volcanics, respectively. This suggests a major Ca-contribution from non-silicate calcic minerals for these lithological classes. Phosphorus release from rocks due to chemical weathering is estimated to be between 1 kg P km(- 2) a(- 1) and 390 kg P km(- 2) a(- 1). The P-release patterns in dependence of runoff per lithological class are different from CSRWRs due to differences of applied P-content in rocks. The identified spatial P-release patterns suggest that the consideration of dynamic and spatially resolved P-release rates by chemical weathering might improve ecosystem studies. Later findings may be of importance for analysing the influence of P-release from rocks on the climate system via ecosystem functioning on geological time scales. A first application of the P-release model to the global scale suggests an annual release of 1. 6 Mt P (13. 8 kg P km(- 1) a(- 1)) by chemical weathering of silicate dominated lithological classes (excluding carbonate sedimentary rocks).

40|$|AbstractDelta {{systems are}} {{ubiquitous}} around lacustrine rift basins. Its peripheral geometry, progradation structures and sedimentary successions were controlled by both tectonic settings and climatic changes. Peripheral geometry of a delta was {{strongly influenced by}} depositional gradients which formed the fan-shape delta on the steep slopes and developed the lobe-shape delta on the gentle slopes. Due to the discharge feed rivers can change rapidly driven by climatic variations, and the nearshore area of deltas display considerable facies variability. The rise of annual rainfall, which suggests the rivers feeding deltas are continuous, and result in distributary mouth bars that are prevalent {{in the front of}} deltas since the down-slope flows are greater than the along-slope currents. On the contrary, when the annual rainfall decreases and evaporation increases, the rivers only can feed deltas ephemerally. If the along-slope currents were in a dominant position, the distal bars were deposited. Progradation structure and sedimentary successions of deltas were controlled by the <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> <b>slopes.</b> On gentle depositional slopes, shingle foreset beds predominate with fine sediments and small-scale sedimentary structures or vice versa...|$|R

Their laws {{are determined by}} convex, nearest-neighbor, gradient Gibbs potentials that are invariant under translation by a full-rank sublattice L of Z d; they include many discrete and continuous height function models (e. g., domino tilings, square ice, the harmonic crystal, the Ginzburg-Landau ∇φ interface model, the linear solidon-solid model) as special cases. We prove a variational principle—characterizing <b>gradient</b> phases <b>of</b> a given <b>slope</b> as minimizers <b>of</b> the specific free energy—and an empirical measure large deviations principle (with a unique rate function minimizer) for random surfaces on mesh approximations of bounded domains. We also prove that the surface tension is strictly convex and that if u is {{in the interior of}} the space <b>of</b> finite-surface-tension <b>slopes,</b> then there exists a minimal energy <b>gradient</b> phase µu <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> u.

50|$|A {{pyroclastic}} flow (also known scientifically as a pyroclastic density current) is a fast-moving {{current of}} hot gas and volcanic matter (collectively known as tephra), which reaches speeds {{moving away from}} a volcano of up to 700 km/h (450 mph). The gases can reach temperatures of about 1,000 °C (1,830 °F). Pyroclastic flows normally touch the ground and hurtle downhill, or spread laterally under gravity.

40|$|Given {{the great}} variety of MDE from several sources and with {{different}} spatial resolutions, the question arises: which data are most suitable for the objective and scale of work. The LS factor integrates the <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>slopes</b> and its length, is considered the most critical factor to estimate soil loss. This study evaluated the performance of SRTM, ASTER GDEM and TOPODATA to estimate the USLE in the Environmental Protection Area Gama e Cabeça de Veado in the Distrito Federal. Based on these research results, we observed {{that there was no}} statistically substantial difference in the USLE of the three models. The average of the three factors LS derived from three different MDE presented similar values as well as the average of three USLE generated. This result seems to be associate with the terrain characteristic of the APA, which is flat and gently ondulated, since the influence of spatial resolution in the LS factor is more pronounced in MDE with high spatial resolution and on sloping land. However, the choice of the appropriated DEM for each study is not a great concern, since the three tested DEM showed similar results. Pages: 4435 - 444...|$|R
