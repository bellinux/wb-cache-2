40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of exposing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture to capillary tubing of different materials and lengths, at different contact times and flow rates and the adsorption of major reaction components into the tubing wall. Using 0. 5 mm <b>ID</b> <b>tubing,</b> lengths of 40 cm and residence times up to 45 min, none of the tested polymeric materials was found to affect subsequent PCR amplification. However, after exposure of the mixture to tubing lengths of 3 m or reduction of sample volume, PCR inhibition occurred, increasing with the volume to length ratio. Different flow velocities did not affect PCR yield. When the adsorption of individual PCR components was studied, significant DNA adsorption and even more significant adsorption of the fluorescent dye Sybr Green I was found. The results indicate that PCR inhibition in polymeric tubing results from adsorption of reaction components to wall surfaces, increasing substantially with tubing length or sample volume reduction, but not with contact time or flow velocities typical in dynamic PCR amplification. The data also highlight that chemical compatibility of polymeric capillaries with DNA dyes should be carefully considered {{for the design of}} quantitative microfluidic devices...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol loss in {{air intake}} systems {{potentially}} hampers the application of one-filter systems for progeny-based atmospheric 222 radon (222 Rn) measurements. The artefacts are significant when air has to be collected via long sampling lines, e. g. from elevated heights at tall tower observatories. Here we present results from a study, determining 222 Rn progeny loss from ambient air sampled via 8. 2  mm inner diameter (ID) Decabon tubing in the laboratory and from pre-installed 10  mm <b>ID</b> <b>tubing</b> at the Cabauw meteorological tower in the Netherlands. Progeny loss increased steeply with length of the tubing, decreasing sampling efficiency to 66  % for 8. 2  mm ID rolled-up tubing of 200  m length at a flow rate of ca. 1  m 3  h − 1. Preliminary theoretical estimation of the loss yielded a sampling efficiency of 64  % for the same tubing, when taking into account turbulent inertial deposition of aerosol to the walls as well as loss due to gravitational settling. At Cabauw tower, theoretical estimates of the loss in vertical tubing with 10  mm ID and 200  m lengths with flow rate of 1. 1  m 3  h − 1 yielded a total efficiency of 73  %, the same value as observed. 222 Rn progeny loss increased strongly at activity concentrations below 1  Bq m − 3. Based on our experiments, an empirical correction function for 222 Rn progeny measurements when sampling through long Decabon tubing was developed, allowing correction of respective measurements for this particular experimental setting (tubing type and diameter, flow rate, aerosol size distribution) with an estimated uncertainty of 10 – 20  % for activity concentrations between 1 and 2  Bq m − 3 and less than 10  % for activity concentrations above 2  Bq m − 3...|$|E

50|$|The {{best known}} of Technicon's CFA {{instruments}} are the AutoAnalyzer II (introduced 1970), the Sequential Multiple Analyzer (SMA, 1969), and the Sequential Multiple Analyzer with Computer (SMAC, 1974). The Autoanalyzer II (AAII) is the instrument that most EPA methods were written on and reference. The AAII is a second generation segmented flow analyzer that uses 2 millimeter <b>ID</b> glass <b>tubing</b> and pumps reagent at flow rates of 2 - 3 milliliters per minute. Typical sample throughput for the AAII is 30 - 60 samples per hour. Third generation segmented flow analyzers were proposed in the literature, but not developed commercially until Alpkem introduced the RFA 300 in 1984. The RFA 300 pumps at flow rates less than 1 milliliter per minute through 1 millimeter ID glass mixing coils. Throughput on the RFA can approach 360 samples per hour, but averages closer to 90 samples per hour on most environmental tests. In 1986, Technicon (Bran+Luebbe) introduced its own microflow TRAACS-800 system.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA dynamic {{simulation}} model of an injection riser/pipeline/well for injection of shipped liquefied CO 2 {{was set up}} using the multiphase flow simulator OLGA. Furthermore, the topside offloading process was modelled using HYSYS. The models were applied for case studies using parameters from the existing Sn∅hvit and Sleipner CO 2 injection wells and reservoirs. The study quantified effects related to flow capacity (pump/compressor requirements and line sizing of the riser, pipeline and well), freezing, hydrate formation, phase change and heat transfer in the offloading and injection system. With an available injection pump discharge pressure of about 120 bar, the injection capacities were predicted to about 275 kg/s on Sn∅hvit and 400 kg/s on Sleipner when assuming 7 ” <b>ID</b> <b>tubing</b> size in the well and 700 m flowline length. In the base case scenario with a 700 m buried pipeline and injection temperature of - 53 °C (this storage temperature on the ship, at a pressure of 7 - 8 bar had been selected for optimum transport capacity) {{there is a high}} risk of unwanted hydrate formation and freezing in the formation and on the outer surface of the riser and pipeline. The bottomhole temperatures were predicted as low as - 38 and - 46 °C on Sn∅hvit and Sleipner respectively when injecting at pump design rate, far beneath expected hydrate and freezing temperature of 10 - 12 °C and - 1. 9 °C (in salt water) respectively. Thus heating, either by topside heat exchangers and/or by utilizing the warmer sea water (5 °C) via a longer injection pipeline is required to avoid problems. An alternative storage condition at - 20 °C and 20 bar was proposed and simulated to reduce energy requirements due to heating and pressurization at the ship. The heating power was reduced by 18 MW while topside pumping power was reduced by 0. 5 MW in this case...|$|E
40|$|A pre {{producing}} well {{which has}} been rendered unable to restart production present challenges which is not in need of consideration {{when faced with a}} well {{which has been}} intentionally killed with the use of high density fluids. The procedures main goal is to reduce the hydrostatic column pressure in the wellbore in order to obtain a suitable differential pressure with regard to the low available reservoir pressure and subsequently to trigger production flow. The evaluated methods are the use of light weight hollow glass spheres (HGS) additive, bullheading {{with the use of a}} lightweight substitute for gas and finally the use of a plunger swab procedure. The applicability of the HGS additive presented a wide range of utility, especially in conjunction with bullheading as the injection procedure where the HGS could be a substitute for gas. Available HGS products have initial densities ranging from ρHGS= 600 kg/m 3 to ρHGS= 320 kg/m 3 and crush strengths ranging from 13793 kPa to 68966 kPa. Several mixture compositions were established for different cases with a base fluid density of 800 kg/m 3 in a 6 5 / 8 ” (6, 1 ” <b>ID)</b> <b>tubing</b> where a 30 % solution of HGS 5000 could cover a differential pressure of 40 bar in a well with TVD = 5000 m. Backflow evaluation with the use of bullheading showed that the mixture would be displaced from the wellbore in 309 minutes with a final production rate of 196 m 3 /d and a differential pressure of 9, 8 bar. The swabbing procedure was a great success with regard of restarting a killed well with ρkillfluid= 1200 kg/m 3. Backflow considerations established that pre shut in production flow could easily be regained, even with relative low plunger submergence. An operation with a drowned wellbore presented a high submergence requirement in order to be successful. Submergence depths of 309 m, 495 and 1500 meters in a 2000 meter wellbore were considered for a 5 ½” tubing, were the latter did prove successful. The first two depths were the maximum suggested work tension and 80 % of break strength for the most hardened swab line from Camesa. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted to evaluate the degree of band broadening in very high pressure LC due to column connections. Different column manufacturers use slightly different designs for their column fittings. If the same column connections are repeatedly used to attach columns of different origins, different void volumes form between capillary tubes and column inlets. An Agilent Ultra Low Dispersion Kit (<b>tubing</b> <b>id</b> 75 μm) was installed on an Agilent Infinity 1290 ultra HPLC and used to connect successively an Agilent, a Phenomenex, and a Waters column. A series of uracil (unretained) samples were injected and eluted at {{a wide range of}} flow rates with a water/acetonitrile mixture as eluent. In order to determine the variance contribution from column connections as accurately as possible a nonretained probe compound was selected because the variance contribution from the column is the smallest for analytes, which have very low k values. Yet, this effect still has an impact on the resolution for moderately retained compounds (k > 2) for narrow-bore columns packed with fine particles, since variance contributions are additive for linear chromatographic systems. Each injection was replicated five times under the same experimental conditions. Then NanoViper column connections (<b>tubing</b> <b>id</b> 75 μm) were used and the same injections were made. This system was designed to minimize connection void volumes for any column. Band variances were calculated as the second central moment of elution peaks and used to assess the degree of band broadening due to the column connections. Band broadening may increase from 3. 8 to 53. 9 % when conventional metal ferrules were used to join columns to connection sites. The results show that the variance contribution from improper connections can generate as much as 60. 5 % of the total variance observed. This demonstrates that column connections can play a larger role than the column packing with respect to band dispersion. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Most commercially {{available}} nanoelectrospray ionization (NSI) sources possess well-defined electrical ground {{points in the}} mobile phase flow path. Inclusion of a ground point eliminates possible safety hazards involving source high voltage. Most home-built sources, however, lack a specifically defined ground point; the ground point often resides in injection valves, auto-samplers, or chromatographic pumps. Poorly placed ground-points affect analytical performance because high-voltage (HV) source current flows to this point. HV for on-line NSI is commonly provided through an electrode contacting the mobile phase upstream from the emitter. Current flow between HV supply, ground point, and nanoelectrospray plume (e. g., the current that flows from emitter to inlet) engenders the functional equivalent of a voltage-divider circuit. Relative impedance between the ground point and HV supply, and the impedance between the HV supply and NSI plume, determines effective spray voltage at the emitter tip. If relative impedance to the ground point is too low, effective voltage at the emitter sinks below the HV supply, affecting plume stability or even preventing spray formation; this obstacle is amplified in gradient elution because mobile phase surface tension changes during the analysis. Periodic or chaotic spray drop-out is a typical result. Plume formation and stability with gradient elution will be investigated using zero-dead-volume, optically clear, platinum electrode assemblies for HV and ground connections. Figure 1 shows a 150 μm platinum wire for HV contact at the junction between 75 and 50 μm <b>ID</b> fused-silica <b>tubing.</b> HV contact is made through a 150 μm platinum wire.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} API-CIMS is a downsized {{version of}} the instrument used and described by Marandino et al. (2007). A schematic of the main components is given in Figure S 1. The ion source consists of a heated and temperature-controlled glass-lined stainless steel tube containing a radioactive 63 Ni foil, as described in Saltzman et al. (2009). Lens voltages for ion optics were supplied by a Gamma custom multichannel DC power supply and the quadrupole supply was an Extrel QPS 500 DC/RF power supply and mass command board. Ions were detected using an ion multiplier and discriminator/preamplifier. The primary difference between this instrument and the earlier CIMS instrument is the replacement of a turbo-pumped vacuum stage (1000 L s- 1; 5 x 10 - 3 Torr) in the vacuum system with a turbo charger/rough pumped (50 L s- 1; 1 Torr) collision chamber. The collision chamber is an Extrel API collision chamber with modified entrance configuration. A custom Labview™ program and multichannel A/D interface (NI USB- 6343, X Series DAQ) were used to provide the mass command signal and to acquire the ion counts. The same interface was used to acquire the saw tooth synchronizing signal and to output the ion counts as analog signals for logging by the multichannel data logger described above. The gas standard was supplied from a cylinder (11. 79 ppm) at a mass flow-controlled flow rate of 3 - 6 ml min- 1, resulting in a d 3 -DMS level of 440 – 885 ppt in the air stream.

40|$|The "VacuSIP ” is a {{simplification}} of the SIP system {{developed by}} Yahel et al. (2007), {{and it is}} considerably cheaper and adapted for SCUBA base work. The system was originally designed after Wright and Stephens (1978) and Riisgård (1991) for direct in situ sampling of the rates and efficiencies by which suspension feeders remove (or discharge) substances from (to) the water they filter. Nevertheless, VacuSIPs can be used wherever a controlled and clean, point-source water sample is required. A simple valve operation or needle piercing by a SCUBA diver allows the external water pressure to force the sampled water into an evacuated sample container.

The first phase of an experiment to study the performance of dielectric Cerenkov wakefield accelerating structures at extremely high gradients in the GV/m range has been completed. The experiment {{took advantage of the}} unique SLAC FFTB electron beam and its ultra-short pulse lengths and high currents (e. g., {sigma}{sub z} = 20 {micro}m at Q = 3 nC).

40|$|Introduction We have {{developed}} a high-frequency electronic biosensor of parallel-plate geometry that is embedded within a microfluidic device. This novel biosensor allows us to perform dielectric spectroscopy {{on a variety of}} biological samples—from cells to molecules—in solution. Because it is purely electronic, the sensor allows for rapid characterization with no sample preparation or chemical alteration. In addition, it is capable of probing length scales from millimeters to microns over a frequency range 50 MHz to 40 GHz, and sample volumes as small as picoliters [1, 2]. Our high-frequency biosensor has evolved from previous device designs based on a coplanar waveguide (CPW) geometry [2]. For our current device, we employ microfluidic tectonics (µFT) [3] to embed two microstrip conductors within a microfluidic channel. The electronic coupling between the two conductors is greater than in our previous CPW design and more importantly, leads to an enhanced sensitivity. Our utilization of µFT allows us to incorporate easily this high-frequency electronic biosensor with a variety of lab-on-a-chip architectures. Device Description Figure 1 is a schematic of our high-frequency electronic biosensor. We fabricate this sensor by first depositing a 500 Å seed layer of gold onto two glass microscope slides. We then use photolithography to pattern the gold that is subsequently electroplated to a thickness of 4 - 6 µm. After reactive-ion etching the photoresist and removing the unplated gold with a standard iodine-based gold etchant, we align the two slides under a microscope such that the microstrip conductors overlap one another in a parallel-plate geometry (80 µm x 500 µm). We control the separation between the microstrip conductors using gold foil spacers 3 – 25 µm thick. The foil additionally ensures coupling between the grounds on each slide. Following alignment, we employ µFT to bond the two glass slides together and to create a microfluidic channel running perpendicular to the microstrip conductors (see Figure 1). We complete the device by inserting 0. 02 ” <b>ID</b> vinyl <b>tubing</b> through predrilled input and output holes of the device [3]. All of our devices are designed to have a 50 Ω matched impedance and minimal insertion loss for 0. 05 – 40 GHz. With these characteristics, we expect a sensitivity of 0. 05 dB. Results By accessing frequencies > 20 GHz with our device, we can probe unique low-frequency vibrational or rotational modes of bio-macromolecules, since at these frequencies the counterions have fully relaxed, the dipole moment of water is rapidly decreasing, and the macroscopic distortions of macromolecules become important and are reflected in the obtained spectra. As a first demonstration, we have measured PCR products. We are able to distinguish between non-reacted primers for PCR amplification and reacted PCR products (24 amplification cycles). Figure 2 shows representative spectra of the two different DNA solutions obtained from a single device and scaled to DI water. We have obtained similar spectral features from additional devices and are currently developing a quantitative model to explain our results. This initial demonstration of molecular differentiation using a high-frequency electronic biosensor shows the great promise of electronic biosensing...|$|R
40|$|Herein an {{alternative}} approach aimed at reducing the cost of numbering up technique as a scale up strategy for chemical processes from the laboratory bench top to the industry is explored. The effect of increasing channel size on the reaction conversion of the synthesis of azo compounds is investigated. This was achieved via a systematic investigative understanding of the synthesis in microreactors where a proof of concept study was performed to determine the optimum reaction parameters in azo coupling reactions involving couplers with aminated or hydroxylated groups in Little Things Factory-MS microreactors (Channel diameter: 1. 0 mm) It was found that at slightly alkaline conditions (pH 8. 55) and at a temperature of 25 °C, excellent conversions were attained in the azo coupling reaction of the diazonium salt solution of 2, 4 -dimethylaniline to 2 -naphthol. On the other hand, the azo coupling reaction of the diazonium salt solution of p-nitroaniline to diphenylamine was found to thrive at a pH of 5. 71 and at a temperature of 25 °C. Using, these optimized reaction parameters, the in-situ and reactive quench of diazonium salts in LTF-MS microreactors was investigated where {{it was found that}} at a flow rate of 0. 2 ml/min, 0. 03 ml/min and 0. 07 ml/min of diazotizable amine & HCl, sodium nitrite and coupler solutions respectively, a conversion of 98 % is achieved in approximately 2. 4 minutes. A library of azo compounds was thus generated under these reaction conditions from couplers with aminated or hydroxylated aromatic aromatic systems. The scaled up synthesis of these compounds in a homemade PTFE <b>tubing</b> (<b>ID</b> 1. 5 mm) reactor system was thereafter investigated and comparable conversions were observed. Capitalizing on the benefits of a large surface area and the short molecular diffusion distances observed in microreactors, in-situ phase transfer catalyzed azo coupling reaction of diphenylamine to p-nitroaniline was also explored. In this investigation a rapid and easy optimization protocol that yielded a 99 %, 22 % and 33 % conversion of diphenylamine, carbazole and triphenylamine respectively in approximately 2. 4 minutes using Chemtrix microreactors was established.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2012. Major: Chemistry. Advisor: Michael T. Bowser. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 103 pages. A novel, microfluidic platform for segmented flow assays {{has been developed}} using commercially available Teflon tubing and PEEK connectors. Such a system {{can be used to}} generate arrays of nano to pico liter sized droplets separated from each other by plugs of a fluourous solvent. Each droplet becomes an individual reaction vessel suitable for high-throughput applications. We have applied this method {{to the development of a}} single enzyme molecule fluorescence assay. Characterization of the droplet generation platform was done with the use of a 100 μm ID PEEK T-junction connector. When two immiscible streams, such as water and a fluorous solvent, meet at the T-junction an array of aqueous droplets separated by plugs of the solvent is generated inside the Teflon tubing. Experiments have shown that, like previous microfabricated segmented flow devices, our system can control the size of the droplets generated solely by changing the ratio of the flow rates of the two phases. Using this approach droplets can be produced with good reproducibility (better than 6 % in all cases and better than 3 % in most) over a wide range of flow rates. Rates of droplet generation of 10. 37 ± 0. 17 drops/s are easily achieved for good high-throughput potential. Fast on-line mixing of reagents and long term droplet stability of up to 7 days has also been demonstrated. The discovery of the heterogeneity of enzyme molecules with respect to activity has resulted in the development of a variety of single enzyme molecule assays, with the aim of investigating the prevalence and origin of this phenomenon. The segmented flow platform we have developed is well suited to the application of single enzyme assays. It has the advantage of high-throughput, as well as ease of fabrication compared to PDMS or silica based devices and elimination of exposure of the enzyme analyte to the walls of the channel or well. A segmented flow, single molecule assay has been developed for the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP). Single AP molecules were sequestered inside 100 pL droplets generated in a PEEK tee and stored in a length of 50 μm <b>ID</b> Teflon <b>tubing.</b> The droplet array was allowed to incubate for a suitable time period, during which the AP molecules converted the weakly fluorescent substrate AttoPhos® into a strongly fluorescent product. AP molecules were found, as in previous studies, to display heterogenous activity with up to a 9 -fold difference between individual enzymes In the last section of this work we have used the commercial glass treatment Aquapel as a capillary wall coating agent to reduce protein absorption in capillary electrophoresis (CE). Due to their large number of potential sites for interactions with the fused-silica wall, protein separations with CE can often be difficult. For this reason, much effort is expended on the development on wall coating agents for the prevention of such interactions. Aquapel is a fluorous polymer used commercially to render glass surfaces hydrophobic. The efficacy of the coating was investigated using a suite of three basic proteins: lysozyme, cytochrome c and α-chymotrypsinogen. Separation efficiencies of up to 130, 000 theoretical plates were achieved over a pH range of 4. 0 to 7. 0, a significant improvement over bare fused silica capillary. Electroosmotic flow (EOF) was reduced by the Aquapel coating but not entirely suppressed. The stability of the coating was also examined. 62 protein injections were performed over a two day period during which analyte migration times varied by less than 3. 5 %. Due to the ease of application and low cost, coating with Aquapel is an attractive alternative to available capillary coatings...|$|R
