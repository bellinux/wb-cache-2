Battery D10 {{sat on a}} shelf at location 5, batteries D30 and D40 were on shelves in location 4, and battery D20 was at location 24. Two power supplies converted the unregulated battery power to regulated 56 vdc and 5 vdc. The 56 vdc power supply was at location 1 and provided power to the ST-124-M3 platform <b>electronic</b> <b>assembly</b> and the accelerometer signal conditioner. The 5 vdc power supply at location 12 provided 5 ±.005 vdc to the IU measuring system.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, a 19-point {{program of}} Economic and Financial Reform, liberalized market controls, stimulated exports and {{designed}} {{a strategy to}} attract foreign companies and foreign capitals. An exports processing area was created in Kaohsiung and in 1964, General Instruments pioneered in externalizing <b>electronic</b> <b>assembly</b> in Taiwan. Japanese companies moved in to benefit of low salaries, the lack of environmental laws and controls, a well-educated and capable workforce, {{and the support of}} the Government. But the nucleus of the industrial structure was national, and it was composed by a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, created within families with the family savings, and savings cooperatives nets (會 Pinyin: Huì). They had the support of the government in the form of subsidies and credits loaned by the banks.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays in the {{automotive}} industry a move away from purely mechanical to <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies</b> can be observed. In order to protect these <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies</b> from environmental influences {{as well as from}} undesirable access, they often are sealed with different compounds e. g. silicone gels or epoxy resins. Therefore new challenges for the remanufacturing of <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies</b> with regard to removal of sealants, a definition, creation, and analysis of technical cleanliness have arisen. These are taken up {{as a part of the}} research project "eCleanER - Electronic Component Cleaning Engineering for Remanufacturing".

40|$|The {{electronics}} {{market is}} characterized by short innovation cycles. It is becoming increasingly difficult for suppliers to provide spare parts during an automobile's entire product life cycle. The innovation cycle and the production period of <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies</b> are clearly lower than the product life cycle of automobiles. Nevertheless in the automotive industry the supply of spare parts by tier- 1 suppliers has to be guaranteed {{for a period of}} about 20 years. Due to these constraints, a gap results regarding the supply of spare parts. In this situation, beside the supply options like "periodic manufacturing" and "long term storage" of new assemblies the option "reuse" of used <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies</b> is becoming more important. Knowledge about the reliability is an essential prerequisite for applying the option of "reuse of electronic assemblies". It is important to get a better understanding of ageing mechanisms depending on specific use conditions and to obtain knowledge about possibilities to estimate the reliability of used <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Used <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies</b> with different mileage and thermal conditions were investigated in relation to their failure and ageing mechanism with the intention to describe the correlation between life cycle of the unit and the ageing mechanism and the expected reliability. Information about the condition of electronic systems in use supports the reuse of <b>electronic</b> <b>assemblies</b> for spare part supply. An approach to condition monitoring using monitoring structures is described. These structures are more susceptible to certain loads, thus the structures fail earlier than functional components. From this, knowledge about reusability can be obtained...|$|R
