Sweety fights off her brother's henchmen and escapes with Guddu.|$|E
5|$|According to the Illuminated Chronicle, {{in order}} to secure Solomon's succession, his father {{arranged}} a meeting with Duke Béla at the royal manor in Tiszavárkony. The king proposed that his brother choose between a crown and a sword (which were the symbols of royal and ducal power, respectively), but had previously commanded <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> murder the duke if Béla picked the crown.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had told <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since the special forces commander had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids. The generals were aware of the threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{by itself}} and {{completely}} {{cut off from}} all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit. At 08:00, nearing the top of Hill 464, it surprised and killed three North Korean soldiers. Soon after, North Korean automatic weapons and small arms fire struck the company. All day G Company maneuvered around the hill but never gained its crest. At mid-afternoon it received radio orders to withdraw that night. The company left six dead on the hill and, carrying its wounded on improvised litters of ponchos and tree branches, it started down the shale slopes of the mountain in rain and darkness. Halfway down, friendly fire injured Captain Herman L. West, the G Company commander. The company scattered but West reassembled it. Cautioning <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> move quietly and not to fire their weapons, West led <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> the eastern base of Hill 464 where he went into a defensive position {{for the rest of}} the night.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, Allen led two rifle {{companies}} (Bravo and Delta) of the 2nd Battalion out from their temporary night defensive position along the Ong Thanh Stream to patrol an area to the southeast, which was covered by thick jungle canopy. After marching for about , the battalion found a fortified Viet Cong bunker, so Allen ordered <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> pull back and directed airstrikes against Viet Cong positions. When the bombing runs were over, Allen’s men entered the camp and a firefight broke out with Viet Cong snipers firing down from trees in the surrounding areas. Again, Allen ordered <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> pull back and form a perimeter to protect their wounded soldiers, as artillery strikes were called in against Viet Cong bunker positions. The 2nd Battalion re-entered the camp, and they discovered the bodies of 17 dead Viet Cong soldiers. Allen's men then moved through {{the western end of}} the camp, and another fire-fight broke out with an estimated 60 Viet Cong soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Surrounded, he told <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> die as martyrs, {{and opened}} fire. His {{defiance}} and manner {{of his death}} (which stunned the traditional leadership) electrified the Palestinian people. Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle of}} wits ensues between Waggett, {{who wants to}} {{confiscate}} the salvaged cargo, and the islanders. Waggett brings in Macroon's old Customs and Excise nemesis, Mr. Farquharson, and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> search for the whisky, but the forewarned islanders manage to hide the bottles in various ingenious places, including ammunition cases which Waggett ships off-island. When this is discovered, Waggett is recalled to the mainland to explain himself, leaving the locals triumphant.|$|E

5|$|About {{ten minutes}} after the surrender, Pritchard heard rapid gunfire to the north. He left Davis and the {{captured}} men {{in the hands of}} his 21-year-old adjutant. Once he had approached the gunfire, he realized it was the 4th Michigan and the 1st Wisconsin shooting at each other with Spencer repeating carbines, neither realizing who they were shooting at. Pritchard immediately ordered <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded.|$|E
5|$|After Philip's death, Demosthenes {{played a}} leading part in his city's {{uprising}} {{against the new}} king of Macedonia, Alexander the Great. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor in this region, Antipater, sent <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, {{in order to avoid}} being arrested by Archias of Thurii, Antipater's confidant.|$|E

With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With {{the help of}} another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the morale of his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E

5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But since they were treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{approached}} and their ammunition ran dangerously low, Bouck feared {{they could be}} flanked at any time. He planned to pull his men back just before dusk, when they would have enough light to escape through the woods. Bouck ordered <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> remove the distributor caps from their Jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to the rear. He dispatched Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston through the woods to locate Major Kriz at Regimental HQ and seek instructions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1918, Grayburn {{was educated}} in Dorset {{and joined the}} Army Cadet Force before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. He was initially commissioned into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and later joined the Parachute Regiment. At the age of 26 he went into action in the Battle of Arnhem where {{he was part of the}} small force that was able to reach Arnhem road bridge. Between 17–20 September he led his platoon, and later the remnants of a battalion, in the defence of the small British perimeter around the bridge, but was killed after standing up in full view of a German tank in order to direct <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> new positions.|$|E

He and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> are forced <b>to</b> work under Brigadier General Xray Tango and work {{for the betterment of}} the Kurian Order.

5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of <b>his</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
