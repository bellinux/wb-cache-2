50|$|The {{scheme of}} Chapter 3 of the Act deals with {{admissibility}} of evidence. Evidence which is relevant is generally admissible, and evidence which is irrelevant is inadmissible. Evidence is relevant {{if it is}} evidence which, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) {{the assessment of the}} probability of a <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> in the proceedings. As evidence which is relevant has the capability to affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue,</b> it is “probative”. This determination is known as logical relevance. Logical relevance merely requires evidence have a logical connection to the facts in issue.But neither s 55 nor s 56 of the Act requires that evidence be probative to a particular degree for it to be admissible. Evidence that is of only some, even slight, probative value will be admissible, just as it is at common law. Therefore, evidence is either relevant or it is not and if the evidence is not relevant then no further question arises about its admissibility. However, logical relevance isn't sufficient to establish the potential admissibility of the evidence and is still possible for the evidence to be inadmissible. This determination is known as ‘legal relevance’ as opposed to logical relevance and sets a demanding test for discretionary exclusion (but one that is not obligatory) where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial. Once the legal relevance of the evidence is established, the exclusionary principles and exceptions to those principles are also to be considered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] In today’s {{complex and}} technologically {{oriented}} society, scientific evidence surfaces {{in nearly every}} kind of litigation. Among other things, the use of forensic science to solve a crime which later {{will be used as}} an evidence in the courtroom. One of the important areas of forensic science is forensic linguistic. Forensic linguists are called in to help a court answer the questions pertaining to application of linguistic knowledge and techniques in the investigation of a crime. This paper addresses, from the perspective of Malaysia, the primary issue of relevancy of forensic linguistic evidence under the Evidence Act 1950. This paper further emphasizes on the issue of admissibility of such evidence in the courtroom to prove the <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> in the criminal trial. The paper suggests that the Malaysian Courts shall have the proper guidelines in terms of admissibility of forensic linguistic evidence to uphold justice.

40|$|Social policy {{information}} is {{information that may}} assist a judge in determining the social or economic consequences of a law. Social policy {{information is}} used by judges in developing the law. There are three jurisprudential models that, arguably, {{could be used to}} describe the reception and use of social policy information by the High Court of Australia. Under the appropriate model for describing the current law - the Legal Sources Model - social policy information is not treated as a <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue,</b> and is not subject to the common law rules of evidence or to section 144 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Under the Legal Sources Model, the reception and use of social policy information is characterised {{as an integral part of}} the judicial reasoning process in determining the content of the law and remains within the sole discretion of the judge, subject to various restrictions. These restrictions arise out of the requirements of judicial process (the parties must be given an opportunity to comment on contentious social policy information) and constitutional limitations (court processes must not resemble Parliamentary Inquiries). Case studies demonstrate that social policy information is often widely used without any acknowledgement of the legal basis on which it is used, without the source of information being identified in the written judgment, and without any apparent method for evaluating the reliability of the information. The current system for the reception and use of social policy information fails to satisfy Best Practice Standards in several important respects, including the following. First, there is no legal rule that defines the circumstances in which judges should obtain, through inquiry, social policy information they reasonably need. Secondly, there is no legal rule that facilitates an evaluation of social policy information by judges. Thirdly, the source of social policy information is not always mentioned in judgments. Fourthly, the law regarding the reception and use of social policy information is not certain. Experience in relevant overseas jurisdictions - the United States, Canada and New Zealand - suggests that these problems are not unique to Australia. Various reform proposals are suggested. These are designed to overcome the deficiencies in the current system and to take advantage of useful ideas for reform which have been proposed overseas. The key proposal is that the High Court should develop a protocol to assist judges in using social policy information. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
50|$|This strict {{distinction}} remained {{despite the}} fact that by the 16th century, the role of juries was changed. Juries had become triers of fact and the practice of laying sworn testimony of witnesses had become general. The juries, however, still had to be drawn from the county in which the venue was laid. If the matter had arisen outside England (i.e. a foreign locality), the legal fictions employed in transitory actions were not applicable, and so jury could be summoned to try the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue.</b> The matter could not be heard. For example, in Skinner v East India Co 6 St Tr 710, the House of Lords in 1666, held that actions relating to ships and trespass to the person could be determined in courts in England because they were transitory in nature. But actions for dispossession of house and island, was not relievable in courts of England because they are local in nature.|$|R

40|$|When justice goes wrong, grave {{consequences}} entail. They are {{damaging to}} the standing {{of the legal system}} and people’s lives. Humans are not good at assessing uncertainties. Parties to a legal proceeding adduce evidence to support or reject hypotheses. Errors happen when the tribunal fails to consider properly all the evidence in the context of inherent probabilities or improbabilities. This research work does not advocate trials by mathematics or statistics. This work extends the understanding of the application of Bayesian Networks in the law domain. The original contribution to knowledge is the analysis of evidence by Bayesian Network in the context of specific legal requirements of Hong Kong. The research questions are: 1. What are the legal requirements for the analysis of evidence in a criminal trial in Hong Kong? 2. How can a Bayesian Network be constructed for the purpose of such analysis? 3. Is such a Bayesian Network effective for the analysis? In answering the questions, this research work examined the feasibility of generic models created for digital crime scene investigations and concluded that each case must be, for the purpose of analysis of evidence in the trial, represented by a different Bayesian Network. This research work examined the trial processes, the tasks of tribunal of facts of criminal trials and some appellate decisions in Hong Kong. The work also created models of reasoning processes for the juries in Hong Kong. The work then compared the properties of Bayesian Networks with the processes of evaluation of evidence during trials. This research work also considered the reluctance of courts in the United Kingdom to allow experts to express their opinions on the bases of Bayesian calculations; even though trials are practically evaluations of uncertainties and assignments of degrees of beliefs. This research work then constructed a schedule of levels of proof and proposed a schematic method, to be used with the schedule, to construct Bayesian Networks for any types of trial in Hong Kong. The method requires an analyst to go through a mass of evidence systematically, and analyse their relationships amongst the ultimate probandum, the penultimate probanda, the intermediate propositions, the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> and the <b>facts</b> relevant to the issue. This work then demonstrated the applications by two criminal cases in Hong Kong. The analyses show that the construction of Bayesian Network by the schematic method enables an analyst to take precaution to reach an assessment rationally and to approximate as far as capable his or her belief to the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue.</b> published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
