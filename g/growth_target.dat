40|$|A {{familiar}} question {{raised by}} the Federal Reserve System's evolving use of money <b>growth</b> <b>targets</b> {{over the past twenty}} years is whether monetary policymakers had sound economic reasons for changing their procedures as they did [...] either in adopting money <b>growth</b> <b>targets</b> in the first place, or in subsequently abandoning them, or in both instances. This paper addresses that question by comparing two kinds of evidence based on U. S. time-series data: first, evidence bearing on what Federal Reserve policymakers should have known about the relationship of money to income and prices, and when they should have known it; and second, evidence showing how and when the Federal Reserve changed its actual (as opposed to stated) reliance on money <b>growth</b> <b>targets.</b> The main conclusion from this comparison is that whatever economic conditions might have warranted reliance on money <b>growth</b> <b>targets</b> in the 1970 s and early 1980 s had long disappeared by the 1990 s, so that abandoning these targets was an appropriate response to changing circumstances. Whether adopting money <b>growth</b> <b>targets</b> earlier on was likewise appropriate is less clear. ...|$|R

When {{the economy is}} mainly subject to shocks that do not involve monetary policy trade-offs for society, inflation targeting is preferable. Otherwise, nominal income <b>growth</b> <b>targeting</b> may be superior because it induces inertial policy making, which improves the inflation-output-gap trade-off. Somewhat paradoxically, inflation targeting may be relatively less favorable the more society dislikes inflation, and the more persistent are the effects of inflation-generating shocks.

Our purpose is to develop fruitful hypotheses that might usefully be explored in subsequent, more formal research. From a positive perspective. a frequently observed pattern in the case studies is that central banks adopt money <b>growth</b> <b>targets</b> when inflation threatens to get out of control. Central banks appear to use money <b>growth</b> <b>targets</b> both as guideposts for assessing the stance of policy and as a means of signalling their intentions to the public; however. no central bank. adheres strictly to targets in the short run.
