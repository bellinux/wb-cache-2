40|$|The use of superfine fibers as piles {{to produce}} flocked fabrics is underreported despite their {{excellent}} properties. Therefore, a superfine polyamide fiber {{was used for}} piles to produce <b>flocked</b> <b>fabric</b> in this study, and a full factorial design was employed with three design factors at three levels to optimize the process parameters in terms of flocking density. The flock density is found, experimentally, to increase with the decrease of flocking distance and the increase of field strength and flocking time. A ternary linear equation is also established in this study based upon the regression analysis on experimental results and verified by F-test showing that it has remarkable significance. Comparison with experimental values shows that the regression equation possesses high accuracy. The optimum parameters are empirically and experimentally determined as: flocking distance of 7 cm, field strength of 60 kV, and flocking time of 10 s...|$|E
40|$|Develop new {{configurations}} {{of textile materials}} for use in compact-size water pollution control, biofilter remediation systems. Polluted air and water treatment by bioconversion/biofiltration is a rapidly growing large industry that presently does not involve many textile products. The U. S. fiber and electro-fiber coating (flocking) industry will greatly benefit from this basic research of the proposed fiber based bioconversion surfaces by supplying more fiber and flock products to the potential market. Our research has progressed {{to the point that}} two identical trickling biofilter media test modules have been constructed. Here, commercially available bio-media (Bio Balls ® and Bio Fill ® from Aquatic Eco-Systems, Inc. Apopka, FL) materials have been tested to serve as a baseline to judge the overall biofilter performance of experimental flocked fabrics. The biochemical reaction employed involves the conversion of ammonia (toxic) to nitrate (non-toxic) ions using nitrosomas and nitrobacter micro-organisms. Prior to testing <b>flocked</b> <b>fabric</b> surfaces as a bio-media candidate, water flow-through/permeability tests and surface area calculations on flocked surfaced fabrics have been carried out. Also, hydrodynamic modeling and experimental studies have been completed showing that the most important factors in controlling the flow of water across flocked surfaces are flock density, length, aspect ratio of the fibers and fiber denier. These parameters will be used to plan the final year’s research works that will focus on a comparative evaluation of various {{configurations of}} flocked fiber surfaces as biofilter media...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{automated}} analysis system for defect detection {{in the print}} process of <b>flocked</b> <b>fabrics</b> with repetitive patterns is presented. This process represents a less computationally complex method than the detection of any type of pattern in the print process. For this reason, this problem can be solved using a personal computer (PC) inspecting 100 % of the production that fulfill the requirements of repetitive patterns. This system will be extremely useful for companies which produce repetitive pattern textiles in large quantities. The implementation of a prototype system, based on the Fast Fourier Transform, will be described...|$|R
5000|$|Stickers {{are also}} used for embellishing scrapbooking pages. Kinds of {{stickers}} sold for this purpose include acrylic, 3D, cardstock, epoxy, <b>fabric,</b> <b>flocked,</b> sparkly, paper, puffy, and vellum. While in the earlier days of scrapbooking stickers were sold mostly on 2"x6" [...] sheets, now 6"x12" [...] and even 12"x12" [...] size sheets are very common.|$|R
5000|$|Flocking {{is defined}} as the {{application}} of fine particles to adhesive coated surfaces. Nowadays, this is usually done by the application of a high-voltage electric field. In a flocking machine the [...] "flock" [...] is given a negative charge whilst the substrate is earthed. Flock material flies vertically onto the substrate attaching to previously applied glue. A number of different substrates can be <b>flocked</b> including textiles, <b>fabric,</b> woven fabric, paper, PVC, sponge, toys, and automotive plastic.|$|R
