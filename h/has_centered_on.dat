5|$|In the French sources, one {{important}} discussion <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> {{the question of}} whether the Natchez planned a simultaneous attack on the French with the other major tribes of the region. French colonial governor Étienne Périer, in a report to superiors in France written one week after the revolt, claimed that many of the Indian nations in the lower Mississippi Valley had plotted with the Natchez to attack the French on the same day and that even the Choctaw, who had been close allies of the French, were part of the plot. Périer then cancelled a meeting with the Choctaw planned for the first two days of December in New Orleans, contending that it was to be the occasion for an attack. Périer in this way defended his actions as governor by insinuating that the results of the massacre could have been worse if not for his prompt action. However, historians Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have pointed out that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in a 1730 unpublished narrative that Périer's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack. Another document in French, of anonymous authorship, asserted that the Natchez revolt was a British plan to destroy a new French tobacco business in Louisiana.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} factors that causes {{complications}} is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the {{blood vessels in the}} back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, dry eye and potential increase in myopia. That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> improving oxygen transmission through the lens.|$|E
25|$|The city’s and municipality’s {{recent history}} <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> {{violence}} related {{to drugs and}} the environment. Drug-related violence of {{the past several decades}} has taken its toll as tourism is down, fewer come to shop in the city and many residents stay indoors for fear of a stray bullet. The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years. The violence {{is not limited to the}} city of Petatlán; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades. A number of these have been partly or fully abandoned as drug-related violence grows. The violence is among local drug lords over turf.|$|E
25|$|In {{his work}} Nuijasota, sen syyt ja tapaukset (1857–1859) (English: Club War, its reasons and causes), {{historian}} and fennoman Yrjö Koskinen (né Forsman) saw the peasants as fighting {{for freedom and}} justice. Fredrika Runeberg's Sigrid Liljeholm (1862), {{one of the first}} historical novels in Finland, depicts women's fates during the war. Albert Edelfelt's painting Poltettu kylä (1879) depicts a woman, a child, and an old man hiding behind a rock as a village burns in the background. The poet Kaarlo Kramsu praised the insurgents and lamented their defeat in patriotic poems such as Ilkka, Hannu Krankka, and Santavuoren tappelu, published in Runoelmia (1887). After the Finnish Civil War, the debate <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> an interpretation that emphasizes Duke Charles's role in inciting the revolt, as found in Pentti Renvall's Kuninkaanmiehiä ja kapinoitsijoita Vaasa-kauden Suomessa (1949); and an explanation that stresses the roots of the rebellion in social injustice and class conflict, as argued by Heikki Ylikangas in Nuijasota (1977). A historical reenactment of the Cudgel War is conducted yearly in the Kavalahti scout camp. Jaakko Ilkka took the 75th place in the Great Finns TV show. A commemorative silver coin was also minted to mark the occasion.|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{controversy}} over Speer's knowledge of the Holocaust <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> his presence at the Posen Conference on October 6, 1943, at which Himmler gave a speech detailing the ongoing Holocaust to Nazi leaders.

500|$|While {{some critics}} have tended to view the film as {{perfectly}} straightforward, and even criticize its overarching themes as [...] "the stuff of torpid platitudes," [...] online discussion has been much more positive. Heated debate <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> the ambiguity of the ending, with many critics like Devin Faraci making {{the case that the}} film is self-referential and tongue-in-cheek, both a film about film-making and a dream about dreams. Other critics read Inception as Christian allegory and focus on the film's use of religious and water symbolism. Yet other critics, such as Kristin Thompson, see less value in the ambiguous ending of the film and more in its structure and novel method of storytelling, highlighting Inception as a new form of narrative that revels in [...] "continuous exposition".|$|E

500|$|Discussion <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> such themes as the {{conflict}} between modern human and nature, and the film's treatment of imperialism, racism, militarism and patriotism, corporate greed, property rights, spirituality and religion. [...] Commentators have debated whether the film's treatment of the human aggression against the native Na'vi is a message of support for indigenous peoples today, or is, instead, a tired retelling of the racist myth of the noble savage. [...] Right-wing critics accused Cameron of pushing an [...] "anti-American" [...] message in the film's depiction of a private military contractor that used ex-Marines to attack the natives, while Cameron and others argued that it is pro-American to question the propriety of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] The visual similarity between {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center and the felling of Home Tree in the film caused some filmgoers to further identify with the Na'vi and to identify the human military contractors as terrorists. [...] Critics asked whether this comparison was intended to encourage audiences to empathize with the position of Muslims under military occupation today.|$|E
500|$|In New Zealand, climate {{has been}} a {{challenge}} in finding wine regions suitable for producing Cabernet Sauvignon. Most of the industry focus <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> the North Island. The Hawkes Bay region {{was the first to}} make a significant effort in producing Cabernet Sauvignon but the cool climate of the region, coupled with the high yields and fertile alluvial soils, produced wines that were still marked with aggressive green and vegetal flavors. Added focus on canopy management, which gives the grapes more sunlight to ripen by removing excess foliage, and low vigor rootstock and pruning combine to achieve lower yields and have started to produce better results. The grape is sometimes blended with Merlot to help [...] compensate for climate and terroir. Other regions in New Zealand have sprung up with a renewed focus on producing distinctive New Zealand Cabernet Sauvignon: The Gimblett Road and Havelock North regions of Hawkes Bay, with their warm gravel soils, have started to achieve notice as well as Waiheke Island near Auckland. Overall the grape lags far behind Pinot noir in New Zealand's red wine grape plantings.|$|E
500|$|Opus Dei {{has been}} {{described}} as the most controversial force within the Catholic Church. According to several journalists who researched Opus Dei separately, many criticisms against Opus Dei are based on fabrications by opponents, and Opus Dei is considered a sign of contradiction. Several popes and other Catholic leaders have endorsed what they see as its innovative teaching on the sanctifying value of work, and its fidelity to Catholic beliefs. In 2002, Pope John PaulII canonized Escrivá, and called him [...] "the saint of ordinary life." [...] Criticism of Opus Dei <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> allegations of secretiveness, controversial recruiting methods, strict rules governing members, elitism and misogyny, and support of or participation in authoritarian or right-wing governments, especially the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978. The mortification of the flesh practiced by some of its members is also criticized. Within the Catholic Church, Opus Dei is also criticized for allegedly seeking independence and more influence. In recent years, Opus Dei has received international attention due to the novel The Da Vinci Code and its film version of 2006, both of which prominent Christians and non-believers criticized as misleading, inaccurate and anti-Catholic.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of {{the style}} of the book <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> its {{political}} aspects. Heinlein's discussions of his political beliefs were criticized as [...] "didactic", and the novel was derided for [...] "exposition [...] inserted in large indigestible chunks". Author Ken MacLeod's 2003 analysis of the political nature of Starship Troopers stated that it was [...] "a book where civics infodumps and accounts of brutal boot-camp training far outweigh the thin and tensionless combat scenes". Scientist and author John Brunner compared it to a [...] "Victorian children's book", while the Science Fiction Handbook published in 2009 said that the novel provided [...] "compelling images of a futuristic military" [...] and that it raised important questions, even for those who disagree with its political ideology. However, it stated that the story was weak as a tale of an alien encounter, as it did not explore alien society in any detail, but presented the Arachnids as nameless and faceless creatures that wished to destroy humanity. Anthony Boucher, founder of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, remarked in 1960 that Heinlein had [...] "forgotten to insert a story". A 1979 summary said that though Heinlein's vision might verge on fascism, his tightly controlled narrative made his ideology seem [...] "vibrantly appealing".|$|E
500|$|Criticism of the 1975 {{official}} {{release of}} The Basement Tapes <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> two issues: the recordings by The Band on their own, and {{the selection of}} the Dylan songs. In his book about the basement sessions, Greil Marcus describes the album's contents as [...] "sixteen basement recordings plus eight Band demos". Critic Michael Gray writes of the album, [...] "The interspersed tracks by The Band alone merely disrupt the unity of Dylan material, much more of which should have been included. Key songs missing here include 'I Shall Be Released' and 'The Mighty Quinn'". Heylin similarly argues that compiler Robbie Robertson did Dylan fans [...] "a major disservice" [...] by omitting those two songs as well as [...] "I'm Not There" [...] and [...] "Sign On The Cross". He writes, [...] "The album as released hardly gave a real idea of what they had been doing in Woodstock. Not even the two traditional songs pulled to the master reels—'Young But Daily Growin' and 'The Banks Of The Royal Canal'—made the final twenty-four cuts." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker, on the other hand, said of the 1975 release that, in comparison to the complete recordings released in 2011, [...] "Robertson, with some exceptions, knew which the good songs were" [...] and was right to clean up the recordings.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Pulitzer Prize-winning sportswriter Jim Murray {{selected}} Lee Smith as {{the active}} player {{most likely to}} be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, describing him as [...] "the best one-inning pitcher the game ever saw", and [...] "the best at smuggling a game into the clubhouse in history." [...] Since his retirement two years later, much speculation <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> Smith's specific chances of becoming a member of the Hall of Fame as well as the criteria for relief pitchers and closers in general. Only Hoyt Wilhelm, Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley, Goose Gossage, and Bruce Sutter have been inducted into the Hall of Fame-based primarily on their relief pitching, and only Sutter has been inducted with fewer innings or starting appearances than Smith. In addition, Fingers and Eckersley – the only two to be elected in fewer than eight tries – won MVP awards, and Sutter captured a Cy Young Award, but Smith was rarely a serious contender for either trophy. He pitched in a transitional era, when closers began to be expected to pitch only a single inning; although Smith and Goose Gossage each pitched in slightly over 1,000 games, Gossage ended his career with over 500 more innings. Sutter was the first pitcher ever elected to the Hall with fewer than 1,700 innings pitched; Smith, who pitched fewer innings every year from 1982 through 1989 and never pitched more than 75 innings after 1990, ended his career with fewer than 1,300. In 2005, statistician Alan Schwarz described Smith as a long shot for election despite the career record, and used Retrosheet data to compare the saves of several top relievers including Smith, Eckersley, Fingers, Gossage and Sutter. While Smith's save percentage (82%), outs per save (3.72) and average of inherited runners per game (.50) compared well with Eckersley's marks (84%, 3.33, [...]49), his figures in the last two categories sharply trailed those of the others; Fingers, Gossage and Sutter all averaged between 4.72 and 4.82 outs per save, with Sutter inheriting [...]67 runners per game and the other two [...]86, suggesting their saves were harder to achieve. Smith started his career earning multiple-inning saves, but the strategy in baseball for closers changed, and he was later used as a one-inning pitcher. He had a higher career save percentage than Fingers, Gossage and Sutter. Trevor Hoffman and Mariano Rivera both exceeded Smith's former record of 478saves, and the two are now widely considered the best one-inning closers ever.|$|E
