50|$|On February 9, 2007, a {{preliminary}} settlement in a class-action lawsuit against TracFone {{was carried out}} by Jeanette Wagner, and approved in the Boone (County) Circuit Court in Kentucky. The complainants alleged that Tracfone misled consumers by charging a roaming rate in their <b>home</b> <b>calling</b> <b>area</b> (they were charged for 2 units per minute, not the usual 1 unit per minute), and that it refused to extend their prepaid service time during handset repairs. Tracfone gave each of their customers an extra 20 units of airtime.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{recorded}} hopping variant {{is known}} as hopping bases. In this version, there is an area in the centre between the two <b>home</b> <b>areas</b> <b>called</b> the [...] "castle". The catcher {{is known as}} the [...] "king" [...] and starts in the castle; anyone caught by the King becomes one of the king's [...] "soldiers". The non-catcher players must hop between the home areas. The king and soldiers capture other players by touching them or forcing them to put both feet down. If the king puts both feet down, they have to return to the castle before they can capture any more players.|$|R

For instance, an amateur from British Columbia (VE7 in Canada) operating in Washington State (K7 in the USA) would amend their home-call with a trailing /K7 (e.g. VE7xxx becomes VE7xxx/K7).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. New {{developments}} in military, health and <b>home</b> <b>areas</b> <b>call</b> for new approaches for data acquisition in real-time. Such application areas frequently include challenging requirements for collection, process-ing {{and analysis of}} environmental data. Wireless Sensor Networks can collect such environmental data efficiently. Collected sensor node data needs to be transmitted in an efficient way due to limitations of sensor node resources in battery power and available bandwidth. In this paper, we present a method for efficient transmission of sensor measurement data using the IETF standard IPFIX. We show that its template based design is suitable for efficient transmission of senor data with low band-width consumption. In this paper, we present the protocol and its imple-mentation in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Additionally, a header compression scheme is introduced which further reduces communication cost during data transmission. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{endogenous}} determination of telephone local <b>calling</b> <b>areas.</b> In many telephone systems, calls between {{users in the}} same <b>calling</b> <b>area</b> are local; <b>calls</b> to outside the <b>calling</b> <b>area</b> are long distance and priced differently. We allow the extension of this area {{to be treated as}} a strategic variable. We show the extension of the <b>calling</b> <b>areas</b> which maximises the carrier’s proﬁt to be the same which a welfare maximising regulator would choose. Under a price cap regime in which prices are required to meet an average price constraint, the ﬁrm manipulates strategically the extension of the local <b>calling</b> <b>areas.</b> We end the paper by considering the case of a competitive market. In this case, again, the owner of the local loop extends the local <b>calling</b> <b>areas</b> in response to decreased efﬁciency or increased competition of its competitors...|$|R
