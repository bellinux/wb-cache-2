At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he [...] "found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from that time. Maybe I did a little cussing, now and then, but never at players." ...|$|E

[...] However, he was busy starring in The Sound and the Fury, and they could not negotiate his release from Twentieth-Century Fox. [...] Instead, they hired actor and dancer Gene Kelly, who had never directed on stage before.
