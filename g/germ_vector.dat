Suppose that this map takes all <b>germs</b> of <b>vector</b> lines to <b>germs</b> of Euclidean circles, or lines, or points.

The examples are inside a family in which the non-embeddability is of geometrical type. The proof relies on the properties of some linear functional operators that we obtain through the study of polynomial families of diffeomorphisms via potential theory. In this paper we prove 1...|$|R

Suppose that this map takes all <b>germs</b> of <b>vector</b> lines to <b>germs</b> of circles. Such map is called rounding. Two roundings are equivalent if they take the same lines to the same circles. We prove that any rounding whose differential at 0 has rank at least 2 is equivalent to a fractional quadratic rounding. The latter {{gives rise to a}} quadratic map between spheres. Results of P. Yiu on quadratic maps between spheres have some interesting implications concerning roundings...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that California was in close and {{intimate}} proximity to the <b>germs</b> and <b>vectors</b> required for pre-mission pestilence. In addition, the perception of California's geographic immunity will be revealed as unwarranted owing to the multiple pathways available for conveyance of microbial infection into the state. This examination will trace the routes which may have channeled exotic diseases into pre-mission California and illuminate the dispersal mechanisms that transported them. Once California specialists are convinced of the probabilities of pre-mission pestilence, they may be motivated to more confidently search for new evidence of its arrival and reevaluate the old. The goal of this geographic assessment is to stimulate these long overdue efforts...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a method to}} estimate {{the size of the}} domain of definition of the solutions of a meromorphic vector field on a neighborhood of its pole divisor. The corresponding techniques are, in a certain sense, quantitative versions of some well-known phenomena related to the presence of metrics with positive curvature. Several applications of these ideas are provided including a type of "confinement theorem" for solutions of complete polynomial vector fields on C^n and obstructions for certain (<b>germs</b> of) <b>vector</b> fields to be realized by a global holomorphic vector field on a compact Kähler manifold. As a complement a new approach to certain classical equations is proposed and detailed in the case of Halphen equations. Comment: This is a revised version of arXiv: 1111. 236...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper gives a {{characterization}} of valuations which follow the singular infinitely near points of plane vector fields, using {{the notion of}} L’Hôpital valuation, which generalizes a well known classical condition. With that tool, we give a valuative description of vector fields with infinite solutions, singularities with rational quotient of eigenvalues in its linear part, and polynomial vector fields with transcendental solutions, among other results. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to characterize valuations which follow the infinitely near points given by a singularity of a holomorphic vector field on a surface or, what is the same, a germ of a singular first order differential equation in the complex plane. Conceptually, a <b>germ</b> of <b>vector</b> field is nothing but a way of measurin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the rst {{half of the}} paper, we {{consider}} singularities of innitesimal contact transformations and rst order partial dierential equations, the main results being related to the classical Sternberg-Chen theorem for hyperbolic <b>germs</b> of <b>vector</b> elds. The second half explains how to construct global generating phase functions for solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and see what their singularities look like. Introduction. This is {{a more or less}} self-contained (self-centred?) presentation of the subject. A contact form on a manifold V is a 1 -form c such that, for every x 2 V, the linear form cx on TxV is non-zero and the bilinear form on the hyperplane Ker cx induced by dcx is non-degenerate; as there is no non-degenerate alternate bilinear form on an odd-dimensional space, this implies that dimV is odd...|$|R

For such a germ, called L-stable singularity, either the corresponding foliation admits a holomorphic first integral, or {{it is a real}} logarithmic foliation singularity. A notion of L-stability is also naturally introduced for a leaf of a foliation. In the complex codimension one case, for holomorphic foliations, the holonomy groups of L-stable leaves are proved to be abelian, of a suitable type. This implies the existence of local closed meromorphic one-forms defining the foliation, in a neighborhood of L-stable leaves...|$|R

40|$|Summary Approaches for the {{development}} of disease-resis-tant butternut (Juglans cinerea L.) are reviewed. Butternut is a threatened fine hardwood throughout its natural range in east-ern North America because of the invasion of the exotic fun-gus, Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum Nair, Kostich-ka and Kuntz, which causes butternut canker. Early efforts were made to identify and collect putatively resistant <b>germ</b> plasm, identify <b>vectors</b> and to characterize the disease. More recently, molecular techniques have been employed to geneti-cally characterize both the pathogen and the resistant germ plasm. Much of the host resistance may originate from hybrid-ization with a close Asian relative, Japanese walnut (Juglans ailanthifolia Carr.), and from a few natural phenotypic vari-ants.

These are biholomorphic to the intersection of a polydisc with an analytic set of the form “resonant monomials = constants”. Such a biholomorphism conjugates the restriction of X to one of its invariant varieties to the restriction of a linear diagonal vector field to a toric variety.

In a previous article we described the invariants addressing the analytical classification of these vector fields. They split into three parts: a formal, an orbital and a tangential component. For a fixed formal class, the orbital invariant (associated to the foliation) was obtained by Martinet and Ramis; we give it an integral representation. We then derive examples of non-orbitally conjugated foliations {{by the use of}} a “first-step” normal form, whose first-significative jet is an invariant. The tangential invariant also admits an integral representation, hence we derive explicit examples of vector fields, inducing the same foliation, that are not mutually conjugated.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{transmission of}} a ring minichromosome (MC) through mouse spermatogenesis as a monosome {{and in the}} presence of a homologue. Mice, either monosomic or disomic for the MC, produced MC+ offspring. In the monosomic condition, most univalents underwent self-synapsis as indicated by STAG 3, SCP 3, and SCP 1 deposition. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy revealed that ring MCs did not participate in meiotic telomere clustering while MC homologues paired at the XY-body periphery. Self-synapsis of MC(s) and association with the XY-body likely allowed them to pass putative pachytene checkpoints. At metaphase I and II, MC kinetochores assembled MAD 2 and BUBR 1 spindle checkpoint proteins. Unaligned MCs triggered the spindle checkpoint leading to apoptosis of metaphase cells. Other MCs frequently associated with mouse pericentric heterochromatin, which may have allowed them to pass the spindle checkpoint.

Landscape epidemiology, sometimes called spatial epidemiology, is a sub-discipline of medical geography that uses environmental conditions as explanatory variables in the study of disease or other health phenomena. This theory suggests that pathogenic organisms (whether <b>germs</b> or larger <b>vector</b> and host species) are subject to environmental conditions that can be observed on the landscape, and by identifying where such organisms are likely to exist, areas at greatest risk of the disease can be derived.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a relatively new infectious disease in the United States, and has a fairly well-understood transmission cycle that is believed to be highly dependent on environmental conditions. This study takes a geospatial approach to the study of WNV risk, using both landscape epidemiology and machine learning techniques. A combination of remotely sensed and in situ variables are used to predict WNV incidence with a correlation coefficient as high as 0. 86. A novel method of mitigating the small numbers problem is also tested and ultimately discarded.

40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{this note}} is to exhibit the integrability {{properties}} (in {{the sense of the}} Frobenius theorem) of holomorphic p-forms with values in certain line bundles with nonpositive curvature on a compact Kähler manifold. There are in fact very strong restrictions, both on the holomorphic form and on the curvature of the line bundle. In particular, these observations provide interesting information on the structure of projective manifolds which admit a contact structure: either they are Fano manifolds or they are biholomorphic to the projectivization of the cotangent bundle of another suitable projective manifold. 1. Main results Recall that a holomorphic line bundle L on a compact complex manifold is said to be pseudo-effective if c 1 (L) contains a closed positive (1, 1) -current T, or equivalently, if L possesses a (possibly singular) hermitian metric h such that the curvature current T = Θh(L) = −i∂ ∂ log h is nonnegative. Our main result is Main Theorem. Let X be a compact Kähler manifold. Assume that there exists a pseudo-effective line bundle L on X and a nonzero holomorphic section θ ∈ H 0 (X, Ω p X ⊗ L− 1), where 0 � p � n = dimX. Let Sθ be the coherent subsheaf of <b>germs</b> of <b>vector</b> fields ξ in the tangent sheaf TX, such that the contraction iξθ vanishes. Then Sθ is integrable, namely [Sθ, Sθ] ⊂ Sθ, and L has flat curvature along the leaves of the (possibly singular) foliation defined by Sθ. Before entering into the proof, we discuss several consequences. If p = 0 or p = n, the result is trivial (with Sθ = TX and Sθ = 0, respectively). The most interesting case is p = 1. Corollary 1. In the above situation, if the line bundle L → X is pseudoeffective and θ ∈ H 0 (X, Ω 1 X ⊗ L− 1) is a nonzero section, the subsheaf Sθ defines a holomorphic foliation of codimension 1 in X, that is, θ ∧ dθ = 0. We now concentrate ourselves on the case when X is a contact manifold, i. e. dim X = n = 2 m + 1, m � 1, and there exists a form θ ∈ H 0 (X, Ω 1 X ⊗ L− 1), called the contact form, such that θ ∧(dθ) m ∈ H 0 (X, KX ⊗L −m− 1) has no zeroes. Then Sθ is a codimension 1 locally free subsheaf of TX and there are dual exact 2 Frobenius integrability of certain holomorphic p-forms sequence...|$|R
40|$|Like humans, {{other animals}} are {{also able to}} smell and {{differentiate}} {{a large number of}} odours with great accuracy. Chemosensory signals {{play a vital role in}} locating host plants by insects. Drosophila has a well-developed olfactory system which can differentiate between different odours and recognize food, oviposition sites and potential mates. Studies of olfactory behaviour in invertebrates may aid in understanding the link between odour recognition and behaviour. Some selected olfactory receptors from Spodoptera (Slit-ORs) were co-expressed in Drosophila with its olfactory receptor Or 92 -a in the Drosophila ab 1 B neuron type by means of existing DmelOR 92 a-Gal 4 and UAS-SlitOR lines. Drosophila olfactory receptor 92 -a responses to acetoin. Acetoin is also detected by Drosophila olfactory receptor Or 9 -a which is located in ab 8 B neuron. Olfactory mediated behavioural responses of flies having modified olfactory systems were investigated to different odours, to determine which (if any) of the receptor modifications would change odour preference of flies. An olfactory attraction assay was employed for this purpose. In parallel, DNA sequences were cloned to prepare a transformation vector construct for stable expression of the Slit-ORs in DmelOR 92 -a neurons, containing the promoter sequence for Drosophila olfactory receptor Or 92 -a and selected olfactory receptor sequences from Spodoptera. The sequences were aimed to be cloned into a suitable Drosophila <b>germ</b> line transformation <b>vector</b> attB. There was no significant effect of co-expressing SlitOR in OR 92 -a neuron on the olfactory behaviour of D. melanogaster OR-a, OR-b, OR-c and OR 6 receptors.

In contrast, very few were attracted to the corresponding ligands for the Slit-ORs, regardless whether the Spodoptera OR was expressed or not...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} is to improve known {{sufficient}} conditions on a generic CR manifold M⊂ C^n for local holomorphic extensions of CR functions to a full neighbourhood of a point p∈ M. Conditions of this kind {{date back to the}} important extension result of J. M. Trépreau [Invent. Math. 83, 583 [...] 592 (1986; Zbl 0586. 32016) ] on monolateral extension of CR functions on a class C^ 2 hypersurface M. A known sufficient condition is strict pseudoconvexity of M, i. e., the Levi form of M has at least one negative eigenvalue in each conormal direction. The general problem of characterizing weakly pseudoconcave manifolds which admit full local extensions is still far from being completely solved. Some sufficient conditions (sector and ray property) are known for weakly pseudoconcave hypersurfaces of finite type. In this paper, the higher codimension case is taken under consideration showing that the situation is much richer than in codimension one. A CR manifold M is said to be trace pseudoconcave at a point p∈ M if, for every ξ∈ H^ 0 _pM (the holomorphic tangent), the Levi form L_ξ is either zero or has eigenvalues of both signs. Thus trace pseudoconcavity is a condition stronger than weak pseudoconcavity and weaker than strong pseudoconcavity [see C. D. Hill and M. Nacinovich, Invent. Math. 142, No. 2, 251 [...] 283 (2000; Zbl 0973. 32018) ]. Let G_ 1 be the sheaf of sections of the holomorphic tangent HM (i. e., smooth <b>germs</b> of CR <b>vector</b> fields), and let G_k, k≥ 2, be defined as the sheaf generated by G_k- 1 and [G_ 1, G_k- 1]. M is said to be of kind k_p at p if k_p is the smallest j∈ N for which the evaluation of G_j at p is the tangent space T_pM. M is said to satisfy the constant rank condition if k_p is independent of p∈ M. The main result of the paper is the following: Let M⊂ C^n be a smooth generic CR manifold and p_ 0 ∈ M. Assume that in a neighbourhood of p_ 0 M is trace pseudoconvex, satisfies the constant rank condition and is of kind k≤ 3. Then for every open neighbourhood U∋ p_ 0 in M, there is an open neighbourhood V∋ p_ 0 in C^n such that every CR distribution on U is smooth on M∩ V and has a unique holomorphic extension to V. The authors conjecture that the main theorem extends to arbitrary finite kind. The paper is devoted to the proof of the main theorem and to various applications, extensions of the theorem and examples...|$|R
