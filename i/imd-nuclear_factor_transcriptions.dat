40|$|BACKGROUND: Transcription {{regulatory}} {{networks are}} composed of interactions between <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> and their target genes. Whereas unicellular networks have been studied extensively, metazoan transcription regulatory networks remain largely unexplored. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model to study such metazoan networks because its genome is completely sequenced and many functional genomic tools are available. While C. elegans gene predictions have undergone continuous refinement, {{this is not true}} for the annotation of functional <b>transcription</b> <b>factors.</b> The comprehensive identification of <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> is essential for the systematic mapping of transcription regulatory networks because it enables the creation of physical <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> resources {{that can be used in}} assays to map interactions between <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> and their target genes. RESULTS: By computational searches and extensive manual curation, we have identified a compendium of 934 <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> genes (referred to as wTF 2. 0). We find that manual curation drastically reduces the number of both false positive and false negative <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> predictions. We discuss how <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> splice variants and dimer formation may affect the total number of functional <b>transcription</b> <b>factors.</b> In contrast to mouse <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> genes, we find that C. elegans <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> genes do not undergo significantly more splicing than other genes. This difference may contribute to differences in organism complexity. We identify candidate redundant worm <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> genes and orthologous worm and human <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> pairs. Finally, we discuss how wTF 2. 0 can be used together with physical <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> clone resources to facilitate the systematic mapping of C. elegans transcription regulatory networks. CONCLUSION: wTF 2. 0 provides a starting point to decipher the transcription regulatory networks that control metazoan development and function...|$|R
2500|$|Most <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> do {{not work}} alone. [...] Many large TF {{families}} form complex homotypic or heterotypic interactions through dimerization. For gene transcription to occur, a number of <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> must bind to DNA regulatory sequences. [...] This collection of <b>transcription</b> <b>factors,</b> in turn, recruit intermediary proteins such as cofactors that allow efficient recruitment of the preinitiation complex and RNA polymerase. [...] Thus, for a single <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> to initiate <b>transcription,</b> all of these other proteins must also be present, and the <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> must be {{in a state where}} it can bind to them if necessary.|$|R
50|$|<b>Transcription</b> <b>factors</b> (like all proteins) are {{transcribed}} from a gene on {{a chromosome}} into RNA, {{and then the}} RNA is translated into protein.
