5|$|Indian {{agriculture}} is {{heavily dependent on}} the monsoon {{as a source of}} water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines. These include the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876–1877 <b>famine,</b> <b>in</b> which over five million people died; the 1899 <b>famine,</b> <b>in</b> which over 4.5 million died; and the Bengal famine of 1943, in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.|$|E

5|$|Another ice <b>famine</b> <b>in</b> 1870 then {{impacted}} both Boston and the Hudson, with {{a further}} famine following in 1880; {{as a result}} entrepreneurs descended on the Kennebec River in Maine as an alternative source.

5|$|The {{logistical}} {{demands of}} the surrender were formidable. After Japan's capitulation, more than 5,400,000 Japanese soldiers and 1,800,000 Japanese sailors were taken prisoner by the Allies. The damage done to Japan's infrastructure, combined with a severe <b>famine</b> <b>in</b> 1946, further complicated the Allied efforts to feed the Japanese POWs and civilians.|$|E
5|$|A {{promotion}} came in c. 46, when Alexander {{was appointed}} procurator of Judea by Claudius. The province {{had returned to}} direct Roman rule only {{after the death of}} Agrippa in 44, and the tenure of Alexander's predecessor Cuspius Fadus had been marked by unrest, so Alexander's Jewish background may have marked him as a more acceptable governor. Less trouble is attested during his office, although he did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was afflicted by a severe <b>famine.</b> <b>In</b> 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.|$|E

5000|$|Famine {{had been}} a {{recurrent}} feature of life the Indian sub-continental countries of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and reached its numerically deadliest peak in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Historical and legendary evidences names some 90 <b>famines</b> <b>in</b> 2,500 years of history in South Asia alone. There are 14 recorded <b>famines</b> <b>in</b> India between the 11th and 17th centuries. <b>Famines</b> <b>in</b> India resulted in more than 60 million deaths {{over the course of}} the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. The last major famine was the Bengal famine of 1943. A <b>famine</b> occurred <b>in</b> the state of Bihar in December 1966 on a much smaller scale and in which [...] "Happily, aid was at hand and there were relatively fewer deaths". The drought of Maharashtra in 1970-1973 is often cited as an example <b>in</b> which successful <b>famine</b> prevention processes were employed. <b>Famines</b> <b>in</b> British India were severe enough to have a substantial impact on the long term population growth of the country in the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
5|$|He {{then made}} way to Egypt, {{arriving}} to a tumultuous reception in January AD 19. He had gone there to relieve a <b>famine</b> <b>in</b> the country vital to Rome's food supply. The move upset Tiberius, {{because it had}} violated an order by Augustus that no senator shall enter the province without consulting the emperor and the Senate (Egypt was an imperial province, and belonged to the emperor). He returned to Syria by summer, where he found that Piso had either ignored or revoked his orders to the cities and legions. Germanicus in turn ordered Piso's recall to Rome, although this action was probably beyond his authority.|$|E

Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice, Florence and Genoa. Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son, and Albrecht Dürer. Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses.|$|E

5|$|The Mahavira's teachings were {{gradually}} lost after around 300BC, {{according to}} the Jain tradition, when a severe <b>famine</b> <b>in</b> the Magadha region of ancient India caused a scattering of the Jain monks. Thereafter, attempts were made by Jain monks to gather again, co-recite the canon, and re-establish it in its entirety. These efforts identified differences between recitations of the Mahavira's teachings, and {{an attempt was made}} in the 5thcentury AD to reconcile the differences. However, the reconciliation efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions continuing with their own incomplete, somewhat different versions of the Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were written down in palm leaf manuscripts.|$|E

Financial demands were levied on {{the governments of the}} occupied countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, {{but not as much as}} during World War I. Greece experienced <b>famine</b> <b>in</b> the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Hong Kong Island was 7,450 when the Union Flag raised over Possession Point on 26 January 1841.

The population rebounded and multiplied {{over the next}} century, but another devastating <b>famine</b> <b>in</b> the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake.

5|$|Although {{an urban}} revolt in Aleppo {{did not take}} place in the {{aftermath}} of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city. In addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti-French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside, the hoarding and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had fled their villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and <b>famine</b> <b>in</b> some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|By the 14thcentury, Norwich {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most prosperous cities in England, and Norwich Market was a major trading hub. Control of, and income from, the market was ceded by the monarchy to the city of Norwich in 1341, from which time it {{provided}} a significant source of income for the local council. Freed from royal control, the market was reorganised to benefit the city as much as possible. Norwich and the surrounding region were devastated by plague and <b>famine</b> <b>in</b> the latter half of the 14thcentury, with the population falling by over 50%. Following the plague years, Norwich came under the control of local merchants and the economy was rebuilt. In the early 15thcentury, a Guildhall was built next to the market to serve as a centre for local government and law enforcement. The largest surviving mediaeval civic building in Britain outside London, it remained the seat of local government until 1938 and in use as a law court until 1985.|$|E
