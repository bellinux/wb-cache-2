50|$|A major {{challenge}} facing turbine design is reducing the creep that is {{induced by the}} high temperatures. Because of the stresses of operation, turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms. As temperatures are increased {{in an effort to}} improve turbine efficiency, creep becomes more significant. To limit creep, thermal coatings and superalloys with solid-solution strengthening and grain boundary strengthening are used in blade designs. Protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit oxidation. These coatings are often stabilized zirconium dioxide-based ceramics. Using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy. This reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade. Oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup {{on the outside of the}} blades, which is especially important in the high-temperature environment. The nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance. The microstructure of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition. A uniform dispersion of the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> - a combination of nickel, aluminum, and titanium - promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure. Refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the fatigue resistance, strength, and creep resistance.|$|E

The dislocation structure and morphology of gamma-prime was examined by transmission electron microscopy at the primary, secondary and tertiary creep stages at 73. 8 kgf/sq mm. Experimental results are described in terms of a high temperature creep model in the range of temperatures and applied stresses where shearing of the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> does not control the straining process...|$|E
40|$|The {{compositional}} {{limits of}} gamma and <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phases</b> in nickel-base superalloys are determined experimentally. It is found that gamma-prime had the following range of compositions {{for the various}} elements contained in this phase: 72. 1 to 78. 0 at. % Ni; 7. 8 to 17. 3 at. % Al; 1. 5 to 8. 9 at. % Cr; 0. 3 to 13. 9 at. % Ti, 0. 0 to 3. 9 at. % Mo, and 0. 0 to 7. 2 at. % W. The composition of gamma varied as follows: Ni is balanced; 1. 9 to 15. 4 at. % Al; 6. 6 to 30. 7 at. % Cr; 0. 0 to 3. 1 at. % Ti; 0. 0 to 8. 7 at. % Mo; and 0. 0 to 5. 0 at. % W.

The nonequilibrium <b>gamma-prime</b> and gamma <b>phases</b> were noted in foils 65 - 100 microns thick, while at higher quench rates (thinner samples) the matrix {{was found to}} be in a disordered fcc gamma phase with kappa carbide precipitates.

40|$|A nickel-based {{superalloy}} is provided which is resistant to deterioration in hydrogen at high operating temperatures and pressures, and which thus {{can be used}} in hydrogen-fueled spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle. The superalloy is characterized by a two-phase microstructure and consists of a <b>gamma-prime</b> precipitated <b>phase</b> in a gamma matrix. The gamma matrix phase is a primary solid solution and the gamma precipitated phase will be an intermetallic compound of the type A. sub. 3 B, such as nickel aluminide or titanide. Both phases are coherent, ordered, and compatible, and thus will retain most of their strength at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> on the {{deformation}} behavior and fracture resistance of melt-spun ribbons and consolidated bulk specimens {{of a series of}} Nial-based alloys with Co and Hf additions has been examined. The morphology, location, and volume fraction of the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> are significant factors in enhancing the fracture resistance of the normally brittle NiAl-based alloys. In particular, the results indicate that a continuous-grain-boundary film of gamma-prime can impart limited room-temperature ductility regardless of whether B 2 or L 10 NiAl is present. Guidelines for microstructure control in multiphase NiAl-based alloys are also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of the solutionized and aged nickel-base superalloy B- 1900 + Hf {{was examined}} after additional aging at 982 C for 72, 250, and 1000 hours. Alloy compositions that were examined contained the normal 1. 34 at. pct (4. 3 wt pct) Ta {{as well as}} 0. 67 at. pct and zero Ta levels. The <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> agglomerated, became platelike in morphology, and decreased in volume fraction for all three alloys throughout the aging treatments. Changes which occurred in the gamma and <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> compositions were nearly complete after 72 hours of aging while changes in the MC carbide composition continued throughout the aging. Blocky M 6 C carbides precipitated along the grain boundaries of all three alloys in the first 72 hours of aging. In addition, an acicular form of this Mo/Cr/Ni-rich carbide developed in the intragranular regions of the Ta-containing alloys...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was performed on}} As-HIP Rene' 95 to obtain additional information on the variation {{of the amount of}} gamma-prime with solutioning temperatures near the gamma-prime solvus temperature and the resulting effects on tensile and stress rupture strengths of As-HIP Rene' 95. The amount of <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> was found to increase {{at a rate of about}} 0. 5 % per degree Celsius as the temperature decreased from the solvus temperature to about 50 C below the gamma-prime solvus temperature. The change in the amount of <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> with decreasing solutioning temperature was observed to be primarily associated with decreasing solubilities of Al+Ti+Nb and increasing solubility of Cr in the gamma phase. For As-HIP Rene' 95 solutioned at either 1107 or 1135 C and subsequently water-quenched and double aged for 4 hours at 815 C followed by 24 hours at 650 C, the higher solution temperature resulted in significantly greater yield strengths at room temperature and 650 C as well as a greater room-temperature ultimate strength. Also, longer stress rupture lives at 650 C were associated with the higher solution temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{alloying}} additions on the mechanical {{properties of the}} B 2 intermetallic NiAl have been investigated in both the melt-spun ribbon and consolidated, bulk form. The study {{is based on a}} matrix of NiAl-based alloys with up to 20 at. pct Co and Fe additions and with reduced Al levels in the range of 30 - 40 at. pct. Characterization of the melt-spun ribbon by optical and scanning electron microscopy indicates a range of microstructures, including single-phase beta, <b>gamma-prime</b> necklace <b>phase</b> surrounding either martensitic or beta grains, and a mixture of equiaxed martensitic and gamma-prime grains. Bend ductility is present in melt-spun and annealed ribbons exhibiting the gamma-prime necklace structure and in a single-phase beta material containing 20 at. pct Fe. The analysis of compressive flow behavior on consolidated, bulk specimens indicates that the single-phase beta alloys exhibit a continuous decrease in yield stress with increasing temperature and profuse microcracking at grain boundaries. In contrast, multiphase (gamma-prime + either martensite or beta) alloys tend to display a peak in flow stress between 600 and 800 K, with little or no signs of microcracking. In general, heat treatments which convert the martensitic grains to beta + gamma-prime result in improved strength at temperatures above 600 K and better resistance to crack initiation...|$|R
40|$|Nickel {{aluminides}} containing 37, 38. 5 and 40 at. pct Al {{have been}} fabricated by XD synthesis and hot pressing. Such materials were compression tested in air under constant velocity conditions between 1000 and 1300 K. Examination of the microstructures of hot pressed and compression tested aluminides {{indicated that the}} structure consisted of two <b>phases,</b> <b>gamma-prime</b> and NiAl, for essentially all conditions, where gamma-prime was usually found on the NiAl grain boundaries. The stress-strain behavior of all three intermetallics was similar where flow at a nominally constant stress occurred after about two-percent plastic deformation. Furthermore, the 1000 to 1300 K flow stress-strain rate properties are nearly identical for these materials, and they are much lower than those for XD processed Ni- 50 Al. The overall deformation of the two phase nickel aluminides appears {{to be controlled by}} dislocation climb in NiAl rather than processes in gamma-prime...|$|R
40|$|Single crystal {{specimens}} of a nickel-base superalloy with axes near 001, 011, and - 112 {{were tested in}} tension at room temperature, 760, and 980 C. The alloy Rene N- 4, was developed for gas turbine engine blades and has the nominal composition 3. 7 Al, 4. 2 Ti, 4 Ta, 0. 5 Nb, 6 W, 1. 5 Mo, 9 Cr, 7. 5 Co, balance Ni, (all in weight percent). Analysis of slip band traces, specimen axis rotation, and dislocation Burgers vectors showed that at 760 and 980 C primary cube slip supplanted normal octahedral slip for the - 112 line-oriented specimens. The other two orientations, which have lower resolved shear stresses on the cube system, exhibited octahedral slip at all three temperatures. The critical resolved shear stress is considerably greater on the cube system than on the octahedral system at room temperature. However, at 760 and 980 C the critical resolved shear stresses on the two systems are about the same. While the room temperature and 980 C yield strengths for the two orientations exhibiting octahedral slip could be rationalized {{on the basis of}} resolved shear stress, those at 760 C could not.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} assure the {{reliability}} of advanced gas turbine systems, {{it is very important}} to evaluate the damage of high temperature materials such as Ni-based superalloys under creep and fatigue conditions quantitatively. The refractive index of the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> is found to be smaller than that of the gamma phase in the Ni-based superalloy, when the wavelength of an irradiated laser beam is shorter than 500 nm. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate the creep damage of this material quantitatively and non-destructively by observing the change of the micro texture in a grain (rafting) using a scanning laser microscope...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{the shape}} of the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> in the {{single-crystal}} nickel base alloy NASAIR 100 during tensile and compressive creep have been investigated experimentally by Laue X-ray diffractometry. It is found that under tensile loading, gamma-prime changes from the initial cubic shape to plates perpendicular to the applied stress. This change occurs during primary creep at 1000 C, 148 MPa. Prolonged creep exposures result in a thickening of the gamma-prime plates that is similar to Ostwald ripening often observed in other superalloys during creep. Under compressive loading, two sets of gamma-prime plates parallel to the applied stress are formed...|$|E
40|$|NASA IIB- 11, a {{candidate}} alloy for advanced temperature turbine engine disks, and four modifications with varying C and Hf concentrations were produced from prealloyed powders. Several notable effects of C and Hf {{concentration in the}} alloys were observed. Both {{the amount of the}} <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> and its solvus temperature increased with decreasing C, but only the gamma-prime solvus was affected by Hf, increasing with increasing Hf. Hf also promoted a cellular gamma-prime precipitation. Hf was, however, about equally distributed between gamma-prime and gamma. Hf and C both affected the carbides formed. Increasing both promoted formation of an MC relative to that of an M 6 C...|$|E
40|$|Inelastic {{deformation}} {{behavior of}} the cast Ni-base alloy, B 1900 + Hf, was investigated using data from step-temperature tensile tests and thermomechanical cyclic tests in the temperature ranges 538 - 760 C and 760 - 982 C. The deformation results were correlated with the dislocation structures of deformed specimens, identified by TEM. It was found that, in the 760 - 982 C temperature range, there are no thermal history effects in the inelastic deformation behavior of B 1900 + Hf. In the 538 - 760 range, anomalous cyclic hardening and, possibly, thermal history effects were observed in thermomechanically deformed alloy, caused by sessile (010) dislocations in the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase...</b>|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} X-ray diffraction {{techniques were}} used to determine the gamma-gamma prime lattice mismatch of three different nickel-base superalloys at temperatures between 18 and 1000 C. The measurements were performed on oriented single-crystal disks which had been aged to produce a semicoherent gamma-gamma prime structure. The thermal expansion of the lattice parameters of the gamma and gamma-prime phases was described by a second-order polynomial expression. The expansion of the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> was consistently smaller than that of the gamma phase, which caused the lattice mismatch to become more negative at higher temperatures. It was also shown that high values of lattice mismatch resulted in increased rates of directional gamma-prime coarsening during elevated temperature creep exposure...|$|E

The changes occurring in the microstructure effects were similar in both alloys. The gamma-prime and carbide volume fractions increased linearly with Ta additions, while the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> compositions did not change. Bulk Ta additions increased the levels of Cr and Co (in addition to that of Ta) of the gamma phase, {{a result of the}} approximately constant partitioning ratios for these two elements. The addition of Ta led to a partial replacement of Hf in the MC carbides. In addition, Cr-rich M(23) C(6) carbides formed as a result of MC carbide decomposition during heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructural}} development following {{heat treatments}} of several rapidly-solidified Ni 3 Al-Cr and Ni 3 Al-Cr-B alloys is presented. Depending on composition, the as-solidified samples were either 100 percent <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> - {{in the form}} of fine antiphase domains (APD) - or a mixture of gamma-prime (APDs) and beta phases. Upon annealing, the as-solidified microstructures transform to either APD-free gamma-prime or mixtures of gamma and gamma-prime phases. For those compositions where the quenched microstructures were 100 percent gamma-prime it was observed that APD coarsening followed conventional grain-growth kinetics, but when gamma phase precipitated on the APD boundaries the rate constant changed abruptly while the time exponent remained unaffected.

Three stages in the precipitation and growth of these particles are demonstrated. In the first phase, the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> was produced by nucleation of spinodal decomposition of the alloy. In the second stage, spherical gamma-prime particles were arranged at random in the matrix with the size independent of aging time. Then, the Al concentration in the matrix decreased with the - 1 / 3 power of the aging time. These {{results suggest that the}} degree of ordering increases with aging time. In the third stage, the particles were coarsened with aging time. They were arranged in the matrix (100) zone and were cubic, with the cube face lying on (100).

40|$|Many {{important}} metallic alloys are characterised by {{the chemical}} ordering of their atomic component elements. Examples are beta brass (βCuZn - {{one of the}} components of common brass), many of the gold-base alloys used in dentistry, Nickel-Titanium shape memory alloys with superelastic properties (great stretchability, as used for orthodontic wires) and Nickel-Aluminium <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> which strengthens superalloys for high-temperature turbines. The figure shown below (Fig. 1) represents such an ordered arrangement of two atomic species (could be copper and gold, or nickel and aluminium) on a face centred cubic lattice. The disordered lattice would have the yellow and blue atoms randomly distributed. While such important materials, the realisation that these crystals are chemically ordered (in contrast to chemically-disordered alloys, such as alpha brass (αCuZn), steels, aluminium alloys, and most other metallic alloys) is a relatively new understanding, being just now one century old. It had been understood {{for a long time before}} that crystals contained spatially-ordered atoms, but not that there was chemical order hidden inside. It was only with the development of methods of diffraction of x-rays by crystals that it became possible to recognise and quantify such chemical order. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Co-Al-W alloys {{strengthened}} {{with the}} L 12 <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase</b> have promise as next generation high temperature materials {{due to the}} ability to engineer a high gamma-prime content alloy with a higher gamma-prime solvus and higher melting point than many Ni-base gamma-prime strengthened alloys. Furthermore, these Co-Al-W gamma-prime alloys are interesting as potential cast-and-wrought alloys because they have a relatively narrow range of solidification temperature and large range of temperature between the gamma-prime solvus and the solidus, suggesting than manufacturing via an ingot metallurgy route would be feasible. However, since J. Sato et al discovered gamma-prime in the Co-Al-W alloy system in 2006, the focus in the literature has been on characterizing the structure and properties of these alloys and measuring and assessing the thermodynamics of the alloy system primarily for application as castings for turbine blade applications. To date the author is not aware of any publications describing the microstructure of vacuum induction melted, vacuum arc remelted ingots of a size more than about 2 kg. Most work has been performed using small, laboratory-scale, cast-and-hot-rolled samples or samples cast as single crystals. This paper presents ATI's experience in assessing the feasibility of manufacturing a cast-and-wrought billet product in the Co-Al-W-X alloy system. Three 22 [*]kg heats were produced to examine a small range of alloy compositions of potential commercial interest: Co- 9 Al- 9 W, Co- 9 Al- 10 W- 2 Ti, and Co- 9 Al- 10 W- 2 Ti- 0. 02 B, respectively. Each heat was vacuum-induction-melted and vacuum-arc-remelted then open-die forged. The ingot microstructure has been characterized.

The full text may be available through the publisher links provided above. The creep resistance of materials in spring applications is generally acknowledged to be well below that observed in other applications. Helical springs formed from three candidate nickel-based superalloys, Nimonic 90, René 41 and Haynes 282, have been tested under compression in order to gain some insight into this phenomenon. Stress relaxation tests conducted at 600 – 700 °C found that, under constant displacement, the degradation of the spring force is one to three orders of magnitude faster than would be predicted from creep data from extruded samples under equivalent tensile loading. An analytical model for torsional creep in helical springs is derived from {{a modified version of the}} Dyson creep model. The effects of various microstructural features on the deformation rate are considered. Effects such as the coarsening of the precipitate-strengthening <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase,</b> tertiary creep due to dislocation multiplication, damage evolution and hardening due to transfer of the stress to the particles from the matrix are concluded to make negligible contributions. It is predicted that the poor performance of the springs is due to the very high population of geometrically necessary dislocations that result from the bending and twisting of the wire into a helical coil. It is expected that these dislocations are resistant to conventional heat treatments, resulting in a persistent residual stress field and a large number of dislocations to facilitate the creep process. In some cases, the stress relaxation is found to be so fast that the precipitate hardening of the alloy is too slow to prevent significant initial degradation of the spring.

40|$|Alloys {{based on}} the {{intermetallic}} compound NiAl are of technological interest as high temperature structural alloys. These alloys possess a relatively low density, high melting temperature, good thermal conductivity, and (usually) good oxidation resistance. However, NiAl and NiAl-base alloys suffer from poor fracture resistance at low temperatures as well as inadequate creep strength at elevated temperatures. This research program explored macroalloying additions to NiAl-base alloys {{in order to identify}} possible alloying and processing routes which promote both low temperature fracture toughness and high temperature strength. Initial results from the study examined the additions of Fe, Co, and Hf on the microstructure, deformation, and fracture resistance of NiAl-based alloys. Of significance were the observations that the presence of the <b>gamma-prime</b> <b>phase,</b> based on Ni 3 Al, could enhance the fracture resistance if the gamma-prime were present as a continuous grain boundary film or 'necklace'; and the Ni- 35 Al- 20 Fe alloy was ductile in ribbon form despite a microstructure consisting solely of the B 2 beta phase based on NiAl. The ductility inherent in the Ni- 35 Al- 20 Fe alloy was explored further in subsequent studies. Those results confirm the presence of ductility in the Ni- 35 Al- 20 Fe alloy after rapid cooling from 750 - 1000 C. However exposure at 550 C caused embrittlement; this was associated with an age-hardening reaction caused by the formation of Fe-rich precipitates. In contrast, to the Ni- 35 Al- 20 Fe alloy, exploratory research indicated that compositions in the range of Ni- 35 Al- 12 Fe retain the ordered B 2 structure of NiAl, are ductile, and do not age-harden or embrittle after thermal exposure. Thus, our recent efforts have focused on the behavior of the Ni- 35 Al- 12 Fe alloy. A second parallel effort initiated in this program was to use an alternate processing technique, mechanical alloying, to improve the properties of NiAl-alloys. Mechanical alloying in the conventional sense requires ductile powder particles which, through a cold welding and fracture process, can be dispersion strengthened by submicron-sized oxide particles. Using both the Ni- 35 Al-Fe alloys to contain approx. 1 v/o Y 2 O 3. Preliminary results indicate that mechanically alloyed and extruded NiAl-Fe + Y 2 O 3 alloys when heat treated to a grain-coarsened condition, exhibit improved creep resistance at 1000 C when compared to NiAl; oxidation resistance comparable to NiAl; and fracture toughness values a factor of three better than NiAl. As a result of the research initiated on this NASA program, a subsequent project with support from Inco Alloys International is underway...|$|E
