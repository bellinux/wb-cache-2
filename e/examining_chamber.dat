40|$|The {{presented}} diploma thesis "Alternatives for {{the regional}} {{reform of the}} Czech Senate" frames {{on the basis of}} a comparative analysis of regional second chambers in the West European countries the possible alternatives for the regional reform of the Czech Senate. The comparative analysis of second chambers of parliaments in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and France identifies the similarities and differences between the <b>examined</b> second <b>chambers,</b> in particular with respect to their historical origin, way of election, size, constitutional powers, relation to the first chamber and relation to the executive branch of the government. The <b>examined</b> second <b>chambers</b> are classified according to A. Lijphart's typological concept on the scale of strong - medium strength - weak bicameralism. The comparative analysis is then the source for the framing of specific alternatives for the regional reform of the Czech Senate. The main conclusions of the thesis are: (1) examined West European regional second chambers fall within the types of medium strength and weak bicameralism, (2) the hypothesis about the weaker position of second chambers in unitary states is partially confirmed, and (3) the framing of representative and functional alternatives for the regional reform of the Czech Senate...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the morphological properties of freshly emitted and atmospherically aged aerosols from biomass burning. The impacts of particle morphology assumptions on hygroscopic predictions are <b>examined.</b> <b>Chamber</b> experiments were {{conducted at the}} University of California, Riverside, Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) atmospheric processes lab using two biomass fuel sources: manzanita and chamise. Morphological data was obtained {{through the use of}} an aerosol particle mass analyzer (APM), scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) system and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Data from these instruments was used to calculate both a dynamic shape factor and a fractal-like dimension for the biomass burning emissions. This data was then used with κ-Köhler theory to adjust the calculated hygroscopicity for experimentally determined morphological characteristics of the aerosol. Laboratory measurement of biomass burning aerosol from two chaparral fuels show that particles are nonspherical with dynamic shape factors greater than 1. 15 for aerosol sizes relevant to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation. Accounting for particle morphology can shift the hygroscopicity parameter by 0. 15 or more. To our knowledge, this work provides the first laboratory chamber measurements of morphological characteristics for biomass burning cloud condensation nuclei and provides experimental particle shape evidence to support the variation in reported hygroscopicities of the complex aerosol...|$|R
40|$|This {{work will}} <b>examine</b> <b>chamber</b> works {{involving}} up to 12 players {{which include the}} E-flat soprano clarinet. Doubling parts, defined as B-flat and E-flat clarinet on one part for one performer, will be included only if the E-flat clarinet is present for one or more entire movements. The intent {{is to show that}} this lesser-known repertoire includes numerous and varied works which are both unique and distinctive. No extant literature on this subject is currently available. The importance of playing auxiliary instruments cannot be emphasized enough as competition and demand increase in today's professional performing climate; therefore, I believe the subject to be of value as a source for those performers who wish to broaden their knowledge of the literature and increase their career viability. It is hoped that this paper will become a vital addition to the store of clarinet repertoire which is catalogued at this time. The examination of this music will be primarily from a performance perspective, and will include in-depth discussion of the points of interest and challenges of the most prominent works. Included is an annotated bibliography, providing a complete list of the repertoire with brief synopses. Detailed background information will also be presented, delving into such areas as composers' inspiration (why choose the E-flat clarinet?), their other works of the same period, premiere performances and possible dedicatees, and other significant influences...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} a mouse model to study the ability of human CFTR to correct the defect in mice {{deficient}} of the endogenous protein. In this model, expression of the endogenous Cftr gene was disrupted and replaced with a human CFTR cDNA by a gene targeted 'knock-in' event. Animals homozygous for the gene replacement failed to show neither improved intestinal pathology nor survival when compared to mice completely lacking CFTR. RNA analyses showed that the human CFTR sequence was transcribed from the targeted allele in the respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, in vivo potential difference measurements showed that basal CFTR chloride channel activity was present in the apical membranes of both nasal and rectal epithelial cells in all homozygous knock-in animals <b>examined.</b> Ussing <b>chamber</b> studies showed, however, that the cAMP-mediated chloride channel function was impaired in the intestinal tract among the majority of homozygous knock-in animals. Hence, failure to correct the intestinal pathology associated with loss of endogenous CFTR was related to inefficient functional expression of the human protein in mice. These results emphasize the {{need to understand the}} tissue-specific expression and regulation of CFTR function when animal models are used in gene therapy studies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
