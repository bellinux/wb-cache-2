Not yet, my friend! to-morrow 'faith it may } And {{for that}} very cause I print to-day. } How should I fret to mangle every line, In reverence to the sins of thirty-nine! Vice with such giant strides comes on amain, Invention strives to be before in vain; Feign what I will, and paint it e'er so strong, Some rising genius sins up to my song. [...] F. Yet none but you by name the guilty lash; Even Guthry saves half Newgate by a dash. Spare, then, the person, and expose the vice. [...] P. How, sir? not damn the sharper, but the dice? Come on, then, satire! general, unconfined, Spread thy broad wing, and souse on all the kind. Ye statesmen, priests, of one {{religion}} all! Ye tradesmen vile, in army, court, or hall, Ye reverend atheists-- [...] F. Scandal! name them! who? [...] P. Why that's the thing you bid me not to do. Who starved a sister, who forswore a debt, I never named; the town's inquiring yet. The poisoning dame-- [...] F. You mean-- [...] P. I don't. [...] F. You do! [...] P. See, now I keep the secret, and not you! The bribing statesman-- [...] F. Hold, too high you go. [...] P. The bribed elector-- [...] F. There you stoop too low. [...] P. I fain would please you, if I knew with what; Tell me, which knave is lawful game, which not? Must great offenders, once escaped the Crown, Like royal harts, be never more run down? Admit your law to spare the knight requires, As beasts of nature may we hunt the squires? Suppose I censure--you know what I mean-- To save a bishop, may I name a dean? [...] F. A dean, sir? no: his fortune is not made; You hurt a man that's rising in the trade. [...] P. If not the tradesman who set up to-day, Much less the 'prentice who to-morrow may. Down, down, proud satire! though a realm be spoiled, Arraign no mightier thief than wretched Wild; Or, if a court or country's made a job, Go drench a pickpocket, and join the mob. [...] But, sir, I beg you (for the love of vice!) The matter's weighty, pray consider twice; Have you less pity for the needy cheat, The poor and friendless villain, than the great? Alas! the small discredit of a bribe Scarce hurts the lawyer, but undoes the scribe. Then better, sure, it charity becomes To tax directors, who (thank God!) have plums; Still better, ministers; or, if the thing May pinch even there--why lay it on a king. [...] <b>F.</b> <b>Stop!</b> stop! [...] P. Must satire, then, nor rise nor fall? Speak out, and bid me blame no rogues at all. [...] F. Yes, strike that Wild, I'll justify the blow. [...] P. Strike? why the man was hanged ten year ago: Who now that obsolete example fears? Even Peter trembles only for his ears. [...] F. What? always Peter? Peter thinks you mad; You make men desperate if they once are bad: Else might he take to virtue some years hence-- [...] P. As S---k, if he lives, will love the prince. [...] F. Strange spleen to S---k! [...] P. Do I wrong the man? God knows, I praise a courtier where I can. When I confess, there is who feels for fame, And melts to goodness, need I Scarb'row name? Please let me own, in Esher's peaceful grove (Where Kent and Nature vie for Pelham's love), The scene, the master, opening to my view, I sit and dream I see my Craggs anew! [...] Even in a bishop I can spy desert; Secker is decent, Rundel has a heart, Manners with candour are to Benson given, To Berkeley, every virtue under Heaven. [...] But does the Court a worthy man remove? That instant, I declare, he has my love: I shun his zenith, court his mild decline; Thus Somers once, and Halifax, were mine. Oft, in the clear, still mirror of retreat, I studied Shrewsbury, the wise and great: Carleton's calm sense, and Stanhope's noble flame, Compared, and knew their generous end the same; How pleasing Atterbury's softer hour! How shined the soul, unconquered in the tower! How can I Pulteney, Chesterfield forget, While Roman spirit charms, and attic wit: Argyll, the state's whole thunder born to wield, And shake alike {{the senate and the}} field: Or Wyndham, just to freedom and the throne, The master of our passions, and his own? Names, which I long have loved, nor loved in vain, Ranked with their friends, not numbered with their train; And if yet higher the proud list should end, Still let me say: No follower, but a friend. [...] Yet think not, friendship only prompts my lays; I follow Virtue: where she shines, I praise: Point she to priest or elder, Whig or Tory, Or round a Quaker's beaver cast a glory. I never (to my sorrow, I declare) Dined with the Man of Ross, or my Lord Mayor. Some in their choice of friends (nay, look not grave) Have still a secret bias to a knave: To find an honest man I beat about, And love him, court him, praise him, in or out. [...] F. Then why so few commended? [...] P. Not so fierce! Find you the virtue, and I'll find the verse. But random praise--the task can ne'er be done; Each mother asks it for her booby son, Each widow asks it for the best of men, For him she weeps, and him she weds again. Praise cannot stoop, like satire, to the ground; The number may be hanged, but not be crowned. Enough for half the greatest of these days To 'scape my censure, not expect my praise. And they not rich? what more can they pretend? Dare they to hope a poet for their friend? What Richelieu wanted, Louis scarce could gain, And what young Ammon wished, but wished in vain. No power the muse's friendship can command; No power when virtue claims it, can withstand: To Cato, Virgil paid one honest line; O let my country's friends illumine mine! What are you thinking? [...] F. 'Faith, the thought's no sin: I think your friends are out, and would be in. [...] P. If merely to come in, sir, they go out, The way they take is strangely round about. [...] F. They too may be corrupted, you'll allow? [...] P. I only call those knaves who are so now. Is that too little? Come, then, I'll comply-- Spirit of Arnall! aid me while I lie. Cobham's a coward, Polwarth is a slave, And Littelton a dark, designing knave, St. John has ever been a wealthy fool-- But let me add, Sir Robert's mighty dull, Has never made a friend in private life, And was, besides, a tyrant to his wife. [...] But pray, when others praise him, do I blame? Call Verres, Wolsey, any odious name? Why rail they, then, if but a wreath of mine, Oh, all-accomplished St. John! deck thy shrine? [...] What? shall each spur-galled hackney of the day, When Paxton gives him double pots and pay, Or each new-pensioned sycophant, pretend To break my windows, if I treat a friend? Then wisely plead, to me they meant no hurt, But 'twas my guest at whom they threw the dirt? Sure, if I spare the minister, no rules Of honour bind me, not to maul his tools; Some, if they cannot cut, it may be said His saws are toothless, and his hatchet's lead. [...] If angered Turenne, once upon a day, To see a footman kicked that took his pay: But when he heard the affront the fellow gave, Knew one a man of honour, one a knave; The prudent general turned it to a jest, And begged, he'd take the pains to kick the rest: Which not at present having time to do-- [...] F. Hold, sir! for God's sake where's the affront to you? Against your worship when had S---k writ? Or P--ge poured forth the torrent of his wit? Or grant the bard whose distich all commend (In power a servant, out of power a friend) To W---le guilty of some venial sin; What's that to you who ne'er was out nor in? [...] The priest whose flattery be-dropt the Crown, How hurt he you? he only stained the gown. And how did, pray, the florid youth offend, Whose speech you took, and gave it to a friend? [...] P. 'Faith, it imports not much from whom it came; } Whoever borrowed, could not be to blame, } Since the whole house did afterwards the same. } Let courtly wits to wits afford supply, As hog to hog in huts of Westphaly; If one, through Nature's bounty, or his Lord's, Has what the frugal, dirty soil affords, From him the next receives it, thick or thin, As pure a mess almost as it came in; The blessed benefit, not there confined, Drops to the third, who nuzzles close behind; From tail to mouth, they feed and they carouse: The last full fairly gives it to the House. [...] F. This filthy simile, this beastly line, Quite turns my stomach-- [...] P. So does flattery mine; And all your courtly civet-cats can vent, Perfume to you, to me is excrement. But hear me further--Japhet, 'tis agreed, Writ not, and Chartres scarce could write or read, In all the courts of Pindus guiltless quite; But pens can forge, my friend, that cannot write; And must no egg in Japhet's face be thrown Because the deed he forged was not my own? Must never patriot, then, declaim at gin, Unless, good man! he has been fairly in? No zealous pastor blame a failing spouse Without a staring reason on his brows? And each blasphemer quite escape the rod Because the insult's not on man, but God? [...] Ask you what provocation I have had? The strong antipathy of good to bad. When truth or virtue an affront endures, The affront is mine, my friend, and should be yours. Mine, as a foe professed to false pretence, Who think a coxcomb's honour like his sense; Mine, as a friend to every worthy mind And mine as man, who feel for all mankind. [...] F. You're strangely proud. [...] P. So proud, I am no slave: } So impudent I own myself no knave: } So odd, my country's ruin makes me grave. } Yes, I am proud; I must be proud to see Men not afraid of God afraid of me: Safe from the Bar, the Pulpit, and the Throne, Yet touched and shamed by ridicule alone. [...] O, sacred weapon left for truth's defence, Sole dread of folly, vice, and insolence! To all but heaven-directed hands denied The muse may give thee, but the gods must guide: Reverent I touch thee! but with honest zeal, To rouse the watchmen of the public weal; To virtue's work provoke the tardy hall, And goad the prelate slumbering in his stall. Ye tinsel insects whom a Court maintains That counts your beauties only by your stains, Spin all your cobwebs o'er the eye of day! The muse's wing shall brush you all away; All his Grace preaches, all his Lordship sings, All that makes saints of queens, and gods of kings. All, all but truth, drops dead-born from the press, Like the last gazette or the last address. [...] When black ambition stains a public cause, A monarch's sword when mad vain-glory draws, Not Waller's wreath can hide the nation's scar Nor Boileau turn the feather to a star. [...] Not so, when diademed with rays divine, Touched with the flame that breaks from Virtue's shrine, Her priestless muse forbids the good to die, And opes the temple of Eternity. There other trophies deck the truly brave, Than such as Anstis casts into the grave; Far other stars than * and * * wear, And may descend to Mordington from Stair: (Such as on Hough's unsullied mitre shine, Or beam, good Digby, from a heart like thine). Let envy howl, while heaven's whole chorus sings, And bark at honour not conferred by kings: Let flattery sickening see the incense rise Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies: Truth guards the poet, sanctifies the line, And makes immortal, verse as mean as mine. [...] Yes, the last pen for freedom let me draw, When truth stands trembling on the edge of law; Here, last of Britons! let your names be read; Are none, none living? let me praise the dead, And for that cause which made your fathers shine Fall by the votes of their degenerate line. [...] Fr. Alas! alas! pray end what you began, And write next winter more essays on man.|$|E

5000|$|The {{nomenclature}} of the Erhardt-Perkins {{system is}} also {{very different from the}} Ernie Zampese-Don Coryell [...] "Air Coryell" [...] timed system. Route patterns of the receivers are numbered instead of named in the Air Coryell system (thereby making memorization easier). For example, an Air Coryell play such as [...] "924 <b>F</b> <b>stop</b> swing" [...] indicates that the primary wide receiver (X) should run a 9 pattern (a go), the tight end (Y) should run a 2 pattern (a slant), the secondary wide receiver (Z) should run a 4 pattern (a curl) and the F-back should go out for a swing pass (see Offensive nomenclature). Timing and precision are extremely important under the Air Coryell system, as the routes are intended to run like successive clockwork in order to be successful. The Air Coryell offense was used successfully by several coaches. Its history includes Jimmy Johnson's tenure as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. Johnson's offensive coordinator, Norv Turner implemented the system when he became head coach of the San Diego Chargers in 2007. The St. Louis Rams ran the Coryell system successfully under coordinator and then head coach Mike Martz; earlier still, Joe Gibbs won several Super Bowls running his version of the Coryell offense.|$|E
5000|$|The camera has a Leica {{designed}} Vario-Summicron of f2.0 aperture, and f 2.8 {{at maximum}} zoom of 3 x. The lens {{was built by}} Panasonic to Leica standards. This lens is also used on the Panasonic DMC-LC5, DMC-L40, Toshiba PDR-M70, and Canon G2-5. The camera itself sold for around $1500 (2011 dollars) of which the lens is estimated to have cost 50% of the total camera cost. A unique feature of the Digilux 1 (and Panasonic DMC-LC5) versus all other Digilux cameras, is that the sensor uses a complementary filter, CMYG rather than the RGB of later models. This filter had two benefits: The range of wavelengths of light captured by the sensor was much greater - it captures about 2/3 of the visible spectrum versus RGB which captures only 1/3 of the visible spectrum, so that the colors, especially reds and blues are more saturated. This is a benefit for landscapes especially. The second benefit is that the CMYG filter allows the passage of twice the photons, so that the camera is inherently 2 x more sensitive to light at the base ISO of 100 - this means that exposure times are half that of a comparable camera with RGB filter array. The camera has a 3 x zoom lens from f2.0 at the widest 35mm equivalent focal length, and f2.8 at the 100 mm equivalent focal length. Compared with modern compact cameras that usually have an f 3.5 - f 5.6 maximum aperture, the Digilux 1 at f 2.8 at 100mm, is 3 f stops faster ( [...] 2 f stops due to f2.8 vs f5.6 and one <b>f</b> <b>stop</b> due to its 2 x sensitivity.) To match exposure time under this focal length at max available aperture requires the second camera to be set to ISO 800 while the Digilux 1 is at ISO 100 cameras side by side.Digilux 1 images are not noise suppressed as much as modern cameras, so it is always necessary to use a noise suppression filter in post processing when shooting above the base ISO of 100. If this is done, then ISO 400 images can be quite acceptable. AT ISO 400 and f 2.0, the exposure times {{will be the same}} as a compact camera with an f 3.5 lens at ISO 2400, and the noise levels on the Digilux 1 will be much less after post-processing.|$|E
50|$|Light sensitivity: On {{sunny days}} {{the light is}} usually too intense for the camera which has a minimum {{aperture}} of f 8 and a minimum exposure time of 1/1000 second. It is necessary to add a polarizing filter of 3 <b>f</b> <b>stops</b> equivalent density (or a neutral density filter,) and this requires an adapter which extends the lens housing beyond the most extreme travel of the zoom lens. This adapter is available {{as part of a}} wide angle lens kit which while sold mainly for the Panasonic DMC-LC5, fiits the Digilux 1. The WA lens adapter makes a 28 mm equivalent focal length, and with the Leica 28mm optical finder which fits the flash bracket, it makes a good quality WA camera.|$|R

Previous titration of both Nalm 6 and human T cells transduced with the firefly luciferase vector revealed a time to peak of photon emission of five minutes, with peak emission lasting 6 – 10 min. Each animal was imaged alone (for photon quantitation) or in groups of up to 5 mice (for display purposes) in the anterior-posterior prone position at the same relative time point after luciferin injection (6 min). Data were collected until the mid-range of the linear scale was reached (600 to 60, 000 counts) or until maximal exposure settings were reached (<b>f</b> <b>stop</b> 1, large binning and 120 s) and were then converted to photons/s/cm 2 /steradian to normalize each image for exposure time, <b>f</b> <b>stop,</b> binning and animal size. For anatomic localization, a pseudocolor map representing light intensity was superimposed over the grayscale body-surface reference image. For data display purposes, mice without luciferase-containing cells were imaged at maximal settings, and a mean value of 3.6 × 105 p/s/cm 2 /sr was obtained. Mice with luciferase-containing Nalm 6 typically became moribund with leukemia when the photon flux approached 5 × 1011 p/s/cm 2 /sr, giving a detection range of 6 orders of magnitude.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of cognitive control consists {{in the ability to}} stop oneself from making inappropriate responses. In an earlier study we demonstrated that there are different mechanisms for stopping: global and selective (Aron AR and Verbruggen <b>F,</b> <b>Stop</b> the presses: dissociating a selective from a global mechanism for stopping. Psychol Sci. 2008 Nov; 19 (11) : 1146 - 53). We argued that participants are more likely to use a global mechanism when speed is of the essence, whereas {{they are more likely to}} use a selective mechanism when they have foreknowledge of which response tendency they may need to stop. Here we further investigate the relationship between foreknowledge and selective stopping. In Experiment 1 we adapted the earlier design to show that individual differences in recall accuracy for the stopping goal predict the selectivity of the stopping. This confirms that encoding and using a foreknowledge memory cue is a key enabler for a selective stopping mechanism. In Experiment 2, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to test the hypothesis that foreknowledge “sets up” a control set whereby control is applied onto the response representation that may need to be stopped in the future. We applied TMS to the left motor cortex and measured motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the right hand while participants performed a similar behavioral paradigm as Experiment 1. In the foreknowledge period, MEPs were significantly reduced for trials where the right hand was the one that might need to be stopped relative to when it was not. This shows that having a goal of what response may need to be stopped in the future consists in applying advance control onto a specific motor representation...|$|E
40|$|The Kookaburra as iconic Australian bird is {{represented}} in this photo-series exploring photomention principles, of photographing the 2 ̆ 2 decisive moment 2 ̆ 2 but rather than documenting it fully, applying documention theory of 2 ̆ 2 glancing 2 ̆ 2 or incorporating in passing through. This follows on in the vein of Group f/ 64 who through the lowest <b>f</b> <b>stop</b> sought to achieve detail and specificity that was beyond realist painting 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities. Of which, Henri Cartier-Bresson wrote: “In photography, {{there is a new}} kind of plasticity, the product of instantaneous lines made by movements of the subject. We work in unison with movement {{as though it were a}} presentiment of the way in which life itself unfolds. But inside movement there is one moment at which the elements in motion are in balance. Photography must seize upon this moment and hold immobile the equilibrium of it. ” This seizing of the 2 ̆ 2 frozen moment 2 ̆ 2 at which movement/moment are aligned towards a new geometry of spontaneity forms the basis of my aesthetic towards realist iconic immediacy - of phot(icon) ography. A 2 ̆ 2 borough 2 ̆ 2 is a subdivision of a city, for example London or New York - where a 2 ̆ 2 borough 2 ̆ 2 is administered with limited powers given to it by the city 2 ̆ 7 s local government. In a city such as Wagga Wagga, we relegate nature to the 2 ̆ 2 borough 2 ̆ 2 of an administered domain, wherein nature itself has been 2 ̆ 2 provided 2 ̆ 2 limited controls over its own agency. This photograph series, in this case 2 ̆ 2 Kooka(borough) 2 ̆ 2 clearly, decisively aims to restore nature to its primacy. The work continues its enquiry into the 2 ̆ 2 decisive moment 2 ̆ 2 aesthetic, and of naturalism and observed opportunity. It is not a photoshopped or otherwise altered or mediated photograph in any manner. A kookaburra alighted on the main flag-pole in the Historic Gardens in Wagga Wagga, and the Australian flag fluttered. The occurrence of our national symbols being naturally juxtaposed in this manner would be rare indeed; perhaps three million to one - this is a straight photograph of just such an instant where 2 ̆ 2 the real 2 ̆ 2 is beyond the range of normalcy. The photograph was shot on a hand-held Canon A 480, rather than Cartier-Bresson 2 ̆ 7 s preferred 35 mm camera. My photographic practice continues to explore these principles of straight photography, and autojournalism, to investigate observed iconic moments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} some of {{the large}} changes in the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy. It shows that, in some important cases, critics who were successful in arguing that past Fed approaches were responsible for mistakes that caused harm succeeded in making the Fed averse to these approaches. This can explain why the <b>Fed</b> <b>stopped</b> basing monetary policy {{on the quality of}} new bank loans, why it stopped being willing to cause recessions to deal with inflation, and why it was temporarily unwilling to maintain stable interest rates in the period 1979 - 1982. It can also contribute to explaining why monetary policy was tight during the Great Depression. The paper shows that the evolution of policy was much more gradual and flexible after the Volcker disinflation, when the Fed was not generally deemed to have made an error...|$|R

The course requires reading and writing about photography, as well as doing it on a regular basis. The class emphasis is on thinking about why people photograph, what photographs do and do not mean to us, and on doing documentary work, on telling stories with photographs. This is not a technical class, and it should not be considered an "introduction to photography. " I work on the assumption that any student signing up for the class has at least a minimal sense of the difference between <b>f</b> <b>stops</b> and T stops, and can find his or her way around a camera.
