5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arrives to {{the office}} with a fake {{mustache}} to hide {{what he thinks is}} a pimple over his mouth. Michael soon learns that it is a cold sore, and he over-reacts, thinking he has herpes. With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to <b>get</b> <b>tested.</b> Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling her about the herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E
5|$|The race {{organizers}} performed anti-doping controls {{throughout the}} race. Riders would be selected after a stage and have thirty minutes to <b>get</b> <b>tested.</b> The results generally would be returned between thirty and sixty minutes later. No rider tested positive in {{this edition of}} the Giro, but had this happened, the following penalties would have been applied: the rider would be demoted to last place of the stage, given a ten-minute penalty in the general classification, a lengthy suspension, and a fine of one thousand francs. Although no riders tested positive, Roberto Visentini, Flavio Giuppioni and Urs Zimmermann – who placed second, third and fourth, respectively, in the eighteenth stage – showed up too late for their control tests and were given the penalties corresponding to riders testing positive; after complaints and threats to leave the race from their team leaders, the jury later reverted their decision, and no penalty was given.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, {{she sends}} Lauren {{a message and}} meets her outside the police station, looking rough, as she has been arrested for shoplifting. Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and <b>get</b> <b>tested</b> for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a chlamydia infection. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall {{over the edge of the}} pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E

40|$|MSM {{have the}} highest HIV {{prevalence}} among all other populations. Among the drivers of this epidemic among MSM are large numbers of HIV positive individuals who are not virally suppressed and {{who do not know}} they are HIV positive, thus making them highly efficient transmitters of the virus. This makes increasing testing of MSM a public health priority. With the number of MSM <b>getting</b> <b>tested</b> stagnated and an even lower number of MSM subpopulations seeking out testing, it is imperative {{to the success of the}} National HIV/AIDS Strategy’s test and treat approach that the number of MSM <b>getting</b> <b>tested</b> be increased. <b>Getting</b> <b>tested</b> is the cornerstone of almost all prevention approaches and the gateway to HIV care as well as being an effective intervention in itself. Behavioral interventions have had limited success stemming the epidemic and new approaches are needed, especially in light of the test and treat strategy. This essay seeks to identify HIV testing trends among MSM, barriers and protective factors, and new approaches to outreach that are essential to moving the field of HIV prevention forward...|$|R

500|$|Although HCV was not {{discovered}} until April 1989, {{an estimated}} 170 million people worldwide are infected by hepatitis C. [...] As of April 2014, 130—150 million globally suffer from chronic hepatitis C infection; {{a significant number}} develop cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer. [...] Each year, 350,000 to 500,000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases. [...] No vaccine is available at this time. The symptoms of infection can be medically managed when the disease is diagnosed early, and a proportion of patients can be cleared of the virus by a course of anti-viral medicines. Globally, an estimated 50–95% of people treated are cured. With more recently developed medications cure rates are around 80 to 95%. The symptoms of HCV infection, especially in its early stages, can be mild enough to conceal {{the fact of the}} disease; thus, some people do not seek treatment. [...] As Live Aid founder Bob Geldof states, [...] "Stigma, shame and fear can suffocate awareness. These barriers prevent people from getting tested, receiving treatment, and clearing themselves of this disease". A number of celebrities diagnosed with the disease have decided to go public in order to raise awareness about hepatitis C and to encourage more people to <b>get</b> <b>tested</b> for the disease.|$|E
