5000|$|Female <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles</b> {{typically}} weigh 6 to 9 kg. One source {{states that}} adult females can weigh up to 10 kg. An exceptionally large captive female, [...] "Jezebel", weighed 12.3 kg. Being captive, this large female {{may not be}} representative of the weight possible in wild <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles</b> due to differences in the food availability. The male, in comparison, is much smaller and weighs only about 4 to 4.8 kg. <b>Harpy</b> <b>eagles</b> are 86.5 - 107 cm long and have a wingspan of 176 to 224 cm. Among the standard measurements, the wing chord measures 54 - 63 cm, the tail measures 37 - 42 cm, the tarsus is 11.4 - 13 cm long, and the exposed culmen from the cere is 4.2 to 6.5 cm.|$|R

2500|$|The {{golden eagle}} (Aquila chrysaetos) {{is one of}} the most {{powerful}} predators in the avian world. One author described it as [...] "the pre-eminent diurnal predator of medium-sized birds and mammals in open country throughout the Northern Hemisphere". Golden eagles usually hunt during daylight hours, but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season through their whole range. The hunting success rate of golden eagles was calculated in Idaho, showing that, out of 115 hunting attempts, 20% were successful in procuring prey. A fully-grown golden eagle requires about [...] of food per day. In the life of most eagles, there are cycles of feast and famine, and eagles have been known to go without food for up to a week. Following these periods without food, they will then gorge on up to [...] at one sitting. The powerful talons of the golden eagle ensure that few prey can escape them once contact is made. The talons of this species exert approximately [...] of pressure, around 15 times more pressure than is exerted by the human hand, although some opine that the largest individual females may reach a pressure of [...] Few other large raptors have been tested in their foot strength, though the huge <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle,</b> when tested, exerted a psi approximately [...] more than the tested golden eagle. It has been claimed that the golden eagle can lift more than their own body weight in flight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{golden eagle}} {{is a very}} large, dark brown raptor with broad wings, ranging from [...] in length and from [...] in {{wingspan}}. This species' wingspan is the fifth largest amongst extant eagle species. In the largest race (A. c. daphanea) males and females weigh typically [...] and [...] In the smallest subspecies, A. c. japonica, males weigh [...] and females [...] In the species overall, males may average around [...] and females around [...] The maximum size of this species {{is a matter of}} some debate. Large races are the heaviest representatives of the Aquila genus and this species is on average the seventh-heaviest living eagle species. The golden eagle ranks as the second heaviest breeding eagle in North America, Europe and Africa but the fourth heaviest in Asia. For some time, the largest known mass authenticated for a wild female was the specimen from the nominate race which weighed around [...] and spanned [...] across the wings. American golden eagles are typically somewhat smaller than the large Eurasian races, but a massive female that was banded and released in 2006 around Wyomingâ€™s Bridger-Teton National Forest became the heaviest wild golden eagle on record, at [...] No comprehensive range of weights are known for the largest subspecies (A. c. daphanea). Captive birds have been measured up to a wingspan of [...] and a mass of [...] (the latter figure was for an eagle bred for the purposes of falconry which tend to be unnaturally heavy), respectively. The standard measurements of the species include a wing chord length of , a tail length of [...] and a tarsus length of [...] The culmen reportedly averages around , with a range of [...] and the bill length from the gape measures around [...] The long, straight and powerful hallux-claw (or hind claw, the equivalent to the big toe) can range from , being about one centimeter more than the hallux-claw of a bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and a little more than one cm less than a <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> (Harpia harpyja). The sexes are similar in plumage but are considerably dimorphic in size. Females are rather larger than males with the differences increasing as the body size increases across the races. The large Himalayan golden eagles females are about 37% heavier and nearly 9% longer in wing length than the males of the race compared with the small Japanese golden eagles where females are a relatively modest 26% heavier and around 6% longer in wing length than males.|$|E
50|$|Fauna in {{the reserve}} include <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles,</b> three-toed sloths, capybaras, {{bottlenose}} dolphins, crocodiles, jaguar, and humpback whales.

Known predators include jaguars, margays, <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles,</b> and anacondas.|$|R
60|$|A {{different}} story {{has to be}} told {{with regard to the}} language. To begin with, there are no fewer than 34 species of which no sound-impressions were received. These include the habitually silent kinds--the stork, which rattles its beak but makes no vocal sound, the painted snipe, the wood ibis, and a few more; species which were rarely seen and emitted no sound--condor, Muscovy duck, <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle,</b> and others; species which were known only as winter visitants, or seen on migration, and which at such seasons were invariably silent.|$|E

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} American <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> to distinguish it from the Papuan eagle, which {{is sometimes}} known as the New Guinea <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> or Papuan <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle.</b> It is {{the largest and most}} powerful raptor found in the Americas, and among the largest extant species of eagles in the world. It usually inhabits tropical lowland rainforests in the upper (emergent) canopy layer. Destruction of its natural habitat has caused it to vanish from many parts of its former range, and it is nearly extirpated in Central America. In Brazil, the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> is also known as royal-hawk (in gaviÃ£o-real).|$|E
50|$|The snake eagles {{are placed}} in the {{subfamily}} Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted <b>eagles,</b> and <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles</b> have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner & Mindell proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae.|$|R
5000|$|By 2015, genetic {{research}} showed {{that many of}} the kite genera are related to the honey-buzzards, and that the tiny bat hawk (Machaerhamphus [...] or Macheirhamphus) is actually related to the huge <b>harpy</b> <b>eagles.</b> Several of the large kites are related more closely to the Buteo hawks (buzzards) than to the group of [...] "true" [...] kites and sea-eagles.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Harpy</b> <b>eagles</b> or [...] "giant forest eagles" [...] {{are large}} eagles that inhabit {{tropical}} forests. The group contains {{two to six}} species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches, and have traditionally been grouped together, they are not all related: the solitary eagles {{are related to the}} black-hawks, and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles.|$|R

50|$|The <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Vultur harpyja, after the mythological beast harpy. The {{only member of}} the genus Harpia, the <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> is most closely related to the crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) and the New Guinea <b>harpy</b> <b>eagle</b> (Harpyopsis novaeguineae), the three composing the subfamily Harpiinae within the large family Accipitridae. Previously thought to be related, the Philippine eagle has been shown by DNA analysis to belong elsewhere in the raptor family, as it is related to the Circaetinae.|$|E
40|$|Capsule]: Two {{juvenile}} <b>Harpy</b> <b>Eagles</b> were tagged {{at their}} nests with satellite transmitters. During {{the first two}} years after hatching both birds moved very short distances, with a maximum recorded distance of 1. 3 km from the nest. During the study period, neither bird started juvenile dispersal, but while one of the birds showed a significant overall increase in mean monthly distance from nest with age, the other bird did not. Protecting territories of adult <b>Harpy</b> <b>Eagles</b> may enhance the protection of juveniles {{for a long period of}} time. The Environment Ministry of Ecuador and EcoFondo funded the fieldwork.
