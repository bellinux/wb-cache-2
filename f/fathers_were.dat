5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the early Church <b>Fathers</b> <b>were</b> also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E

5|$|Literacy {{began to}} decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of the Third Century. Although the Church <b>Fathers</b> <b>were</b> well-educated, they {{regarded}} Classical literature as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings. Julian, the only emperor after {{the conversion of}} Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, {{on the grounds that}} they might corrupt the minds of youth.|$|E
5|$|From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the Christian {{authors who}} would become the Latin Church <b>Fathers</b> <b>were</b> in active {{dialogue}} with the Classical tradition, within {{which they had been}} educated. Tertullian, a convert to Christianity from Roman Africa, was the contemporary of Apuleius and one of the earliest prose authors to establish a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective. When the orator Symmachus argued for the preservation of Rome's religious traditions, he was effectively opposed by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan and future saint—a debate preserved by their missives.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was a sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting their shows of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other <b>fathers</b> <b>were</b> airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E

5|$|Robert Dudley was {{a pioneer}} of new industries; {{interested}} in many things from tapestries to mining, he was engaged in the first joint stock companies in English history. The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment among the poor. On a personal level, he gave to poor people, petitioners, and prisons on a daily basis. Due to his interests in trade and exploration, {{as well as his}} debts, his contacts with the London city <b>fathers</b> <b>were</b> intense. He was an enthusiastic investor in the Muscovy Company and the Merchant Adventurers. English relations with Morocco were also handled by Leicester. This he did in the manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making). He took much interest in the careers of John Hawkins and Francis Drake from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of Martin Frobisher's 1576 search for the Northwest Passage. Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the Galleon Leicester, which he employed in a luckless expedition under Edward Fenton, but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of Dom António, the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.|$|E
5|$|Students of Confucian {{studies were}} {{potential}} {{candidates for the}} imperial examinations, the graduates {{of which could be}} appointed as state bureaucrats in the local, provincial, and central government. There were two types of exams that were given, mingjing ('illuminating the classics examination') and jinshi ('presented scholar examination'). The mingjing was based upon the Confucian classics and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts. The jinshi tested a student's literary abilities in writing essay-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as their skills in composing poetry. Candidates were also judged on their skills of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in calligraphy, all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in rhetoric or fanciful writing skills. There was a disproportionate number of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families. The exams were open to all male subjects whose <b>fathers</b> <b>were</b> not of the artisan or merchant classes, although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation. In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the Five Classics with selected commentaries.|$|E

25|$|Adoption {{studies also}} suggest a strong genetic {{tendency}} towards alcoholism.

25|$|The Roman Lex Julia, Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis (17 BC), punished {{adultery}} with banishment. The two guilty {{parties were}} sent to different islands ("dummodo in diversas insulas relegentur"), and part of their property was confiscated. <b>Fathers</b> <b>were</b> permitted to kill daughters and their partners in adultery.

25|$|Similarly, Fuegen et al. {{found that}} when evaluators rated fictitious {{applicants}} for an attorney position, female applicants with children were held {{to a higher standard}} than female applicants without children. <b>Fathers</b> <b>were</b> actually held to a significantly lower standard than male non-parents. Cuddy, Fiske, and Glick show that describing a consultant as a mother leads evaluators to rate her as less competent than when she is described as not having children.|$|E

25|$|Elizabeth Tooker, an anthropologist, {{has said}} that it was {{unlikely}} the US founding <b>fathers</b> <b>were</b> inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States.

25|$|In {{this way}} the {{institution}} of slavery in Maryland was made self-perpetuating, as the slaves lived well enough to reproduce. The numbers of slaves in Maryland increased by continued imports up until 1808, and also by natural increase. By making slave status dependent on the mother, according {{to the principle of}} partus sequitur ventrem, Maryland, like Virginia, abandoned the common-law approach of England, in which the social status of children depended on their father. In the colonies, children would take the status of their mothers and thus be born into slavery if their mothers were enslaved, regardless if their <b>fathers</b> <b>were</b> white, English and Christian, as many were.|$|E
25|$|The social {{origins of}} Islamists changed after the 1952 Revolution. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Muslim Brotherhood had appealed {{primarily}} to urban civil servants {{and white and}} blue-collar workers. After the early 1970s, the Islamic revival attracted followers from {{a broad spectrum of}} social classes. Most activists were university students or recent graduates; they included rural-urban migrants and urban middle-class youth whose <b>fathers</b> <b>were</b> middle-level government employees or professionals. Their fields of study—medicine, engineering, military science, and pharmacy—were among the most highly competitive and prestigious disciplines in the university system. The rank-and- file members of Islamist groups have come from the middle class, the lower-middle class, and the urban working class.|$|E
