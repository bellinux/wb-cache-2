40|$|The {{photographic}} {{processing of}} color Landsat imagery was evaluated {{to determine the}} optimal enhancement techniques. Twenty-six images were examined to explore the effects of <b>gamma</b> <b>values</b> upon image interpretation in a subarctic environment. <b>Gamma</b> <b>values</b> were varied on the images of bands 4 through 7 prior {{to the creation of}} the color composites. This yielded color-composited images with various color balances. These images were evaluated in terms of visible geological features (drainage, lineaments, landforms, etc.) and landcover features (exposed rock and ground, coniferous forest, etc.). The results indicate that the most informative images are created by using <b>gamma</b> <b>values</b> of 2. 0 for band 4, 1. 0 for band 5, and 2. 0 for band 6 or 7.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In 1914, Ramanujan gave {{a list of}} 17 identities expressing 1 /pi as linear {{combinations}} of values of hypergeometric functions at certain rational numbers. Since then, identities of similar nature have been discovered by many authors. Nowadays, one of the standard approaches {{to this kind of}} identities uses the theory of modular curves. In this paper, we will consider the case of Shimura curves and obtain Ramanujan-type formulas involving special values of hypergeometric functions and products of <b>Gamma</b> <b>values.</b> These products of <b>Gamma</b> <b>values</b> are related to periods of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by Q(√− 3) and Q(√− 4) ...|$|R

50|$|Other display {{devices have}} {{different}} values of gamma: for example, a Game Boy Advance display has a gamma between 3 and 4 depending on lighting conditions.

Below a compressed value of 0.04045 or a linear intensity of 0.00313, the curve is linear (encoded value proportional to intensity), so γ = 1.

50|$|The {{importance}} of this for finance, is that option pricing problems, when extended beyond the standard assumptions (e.g. incorporating changing dividends), cannot be solved in closed form, but can be solved using this method. Note however, that for non-smooth final conditions (which happen for most financial instruments), the Crank-Nicolson method is not satisfactory as numerical oscillations are not damped. For vanilla options, this results in oscillation in the <b>gamma</b> <b>value</b> around the strike price. Therefore, special damping initialization steps are necessary (e.g., fully implicit finite difference method).|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} system, for example from camera through JPEG file to display, {{the role of}} gamma {{correction}} will involve several cooperating parts. The camera encodes its rendered image into the JPEG file {{using one of the}} standard <b>gamma</b> <b>values</b> such as 2.2, for storage and transmission. The display computer may use a color management engine to convert to a different color space (such as older Macintosh's γ = 1.8 color space) before putting pixel values into its video memory. The monitor may do its own gamma correction to match the CRT gamma to that used by the video system. Coordinating the components via standard interfaces with default standard <b>gamma</b> <b>values</b> makes it possible to get such system properly configured.|$|R
40|$|The visual {{appearance}} of natural scenes {{is governed by}} a surprisingly simple hidden structure. The distributions of contrast values in natural images generally follow a Weibull distribution, with beta and gamma as free parameters. Beta and gamma seem to structure the space of natural images in an ecologically meaningful way, in particular {{with respect to the}} fragmentation and texture similarity within an image. Since it is often assumed that the brain exploits structural regularities in natural image statistics to efficiently encode and analyze visual input, we here ask ourselves whether the brain approximates the beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>values</b> underlying the contrast distributions of natural images. We present a model that shows that beta and gamma can be easily estimated from the outputs of X-cells and Y-cells. In addition, we covaried the EEG responses of subjects viewing natural images with the beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>values</b> of those images. We show that beta and gamma explain up to 71 % of the variance of the early ERP signal, substantially outperforming other tested contrast measurements. This suggests that the brain is strongly tuned to the image’s beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>values,</b> potentially providing the visual system with an efficient way to rapidly classify incoming images on the basis of omnipresent low-level natura...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Allouche and Mendès-France (in Hadamard {{grade of}} power series, J. Num-ber Theory 131 (2011)) have defined the grade {{of a formal}} power series with {{algebraic}} coefficients as the smallest integer k such that this series is the Hadamard product of k algebraic power series. In this paper, we obtain lower and upper bounds for the grade of hypergeometric series by comparing two different asymptotic expansions of their Taylor coefficients, one obtained from their definition and another one obtained when assuming that the grade has a certain value. In such expansions, <b>Gamma</b> <b>values</b> at rational points naturally appear and our results mostly depend on the Rohrlich-Lang Conjecture for poly-nomial relations in <b>Gamma</b> <b>values.</b> We also obtain unconditional and sharp results when we can apply Diophantine results such as the Wolfart-Wüstholz Theorem for Beta values. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fluence for midline and lateralized tumors for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) by using a two-dimensional array. Methods: For this study, we selected 60 patients who were undergoing VMAT. The octavius phantom was computed tomography (CT) scanned and imported to the planning system. Verification plans were created for each plan and exported. The measurements were performed using 2 D seven 29 ion chamber array. Fluence measurement values for all the delivered plans were analyzed using VeriSoft software. The TPS calculated values were then compared with the measured <b>gamma</b> <b>values.</b> Results: The <b>gamma</b> pass percentage for midline tumors was found to be higher than that for lateralized tumors. The standard deviations between the <b>gamma</b> <b>values</b> for midline and lateralized tumors were 1. 96 and 2. 86, respectively. Moreover, the standard deviations between the point doses for midline and lateralized tumors were 0. 360 and 0. 283, respectively. The mean gamma passing rate was 96. 96 % for midline tumors and 96. 57 % for lateralized tumors for 3 %DD/ 3 -mm criteria. There is no significance found in the <b>gamma</b> <b>values</b> for midline and lateralized tumors with p -value 0. 08. Conclusion: No particular correlation was found between the gamma pass percentage for midline tumors and that for lateralized tumors.
