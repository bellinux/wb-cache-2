40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] amniocentesis is often complicated by the fetal head being fixed in the pelvis, oligohydramnios or a hyperirritable myometrium. These factors limit the success rate associated with the procedure. If the myometrium is relaxed with a β 2 -stimulant, a higher success rate may be achieved. This was investigated in a randomized, prospective, double-blind pilot study using <b>hexoprenaline.</b> When four- or five-fifths of the fetal head was palpable above the pelvis, <b>hexoprenaline</b> (17 amniocenteses) showed no advantage over a placebo (16 amniocenteses). However, when three-fifths or less of the fetal head was palpable above the brim, 4 dry taps were obtained {{in the control group}} using a placebo (17 amniocenteses), while none occurred in the study group (19 amniocenteses) (P < 0. 05). Elevation of the fetal head was less difficult in the study group, but this difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that <b>hexoprenaline</b> is not indicated for routine use during amniocentesis. When a dry tap is obtained or when marked difficulty is encountered in lifting the fetal head from the pelvis, 10 μg <b>hexoprenaline</b> administered intravenously 5 minutes before amniocentesis appears to facilitate successful completion of the procedure. However, a larger series is necessary to confirm this observation. Publisher’s versio...|$|E

40|$|We have {{determined}} simultaneously {{the density of}} beta-adrenoceptors in human myometria (by (-) -[125 I]iodopindolol binding) derived from 36 women undergoing cesarean section and in the corresponding circulating lymphocytes (by (-) -[125 I]iodocyanopindolol binding). In myometrial membranes about 80 % to 85 % of the beta-adrenoceptors were of the beta 2 -subtype. The density of myometrial and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors in women treated with the beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>hexoprenaline</b> to prevent preterm labor was about 65 % to 70 % lower than that in nontreated women. Concomitantly, in hexoprenaline-treated women the 10 mumol/L isoproterenol-evoked increase in lymphocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate content (as index for lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness) was diminished to a similar extent. Combining all data resulted in a significant positive correlation between myometrial and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor densities (r = 0. 7303; n = 36; p less than 0. 001). It is possible that determination of beta-adrenoceptor function in circulating lymphocytes may be a useful model to monitor myometrial beta-adrenoceptor changes during tocolytic therap...|$|E
40|$|The construction, {{evaluation}} and analytical application of ionophore-based sensors for potentiometric determination of <b>hexoprenaline</b> sulphate (Hx) or biperiden hydrochloride (BP) are reported. Electrode matrices compositions are optimized {{on the basis}} of the nature and content of sensing ionophore, ionic sites and plasticizers. Sensors incroporated with β-cyclodextrins (β-CDs), sodium tetrakis (4 -fluorophenyl) borate (NaTFPB) and 2 -fluorophenyl 2 -nitrophenyl ether (f-NPE), showed fast and stable potentiometric responses with mean Nernstian compliance of 59. 0 ± 1. 0 and 56. 8 ± 1. 4 mV·decade- 1 for Hx and BP, respectively in the concentration ranges 1 × 10 – 5 – 1 × 10 – 2 mol·L– 1 for Hx and 1 × 10 – 5 – 1 × 10 – 2 mol·L– 1 for BP. Incorporation of β-CD as molecular recognition element improved the electrode sensitivity and¨selectivity due to encapsulation of the drug molecule into β-CD cavity (host-guest interaction). The electrodes were fully characterized in terms of composition, usable pH range, life span and response time. The developed electrodes have been successfully applied for the potentiometric determination of the cited drugs in pharmaceutical formulations.

40|$|Objective: To {{ascertain}} whether adjuvant ampicillin and metronidazole given {{to women in}} preterm labour with intact membranes would prolong pregnancy and decrease the perinatal mortality and morbidity. Design: A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled trial. Setting: Three perinatal centres serving an indigent population. Subjects: Eighty-one women in active preterm labour with otherwise uncomplicated singleton pregnancies between 26 and 34 weeks gestation or an ultrasound fetal weight estimate of 800 g to 1500 g. Interventions: The study group received ampicillin and metronidazole for five days. The control group received no antibiotics. In all women contractions were suppressed with <b>hexoprenaline</b> and indomethacin for 24 h, and betamethasone was given for fetal lung maturity. Main outcome measures: Days gained and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Results: The study (n = 43) and control groups (n = 38) were comparable at entry. In those receiving ampicillin and metronidazole the pregnancy was significantly prolonged (median 15 days versus 2. 5 days, P = 0. 04) with significantly more women still pregnant after seven days (63 % versus 37 %,P = 0. 03, OR 0. 34 95 % CI 0. 13 - 0. 94). Significantly more infants {{in the control group}} developed necrotising enterocolitis than in the study group (5 versus 0, P = 0. 02). Conclusion: Adjuvant ampicillin and metronidazole in the management of women in preterm labour with intact membranes significantly prolonged the pregnancy and decreased neonatal morbidity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Beta(2) -adrenergic {{receptor}} (beta(2) AR) agonists are {{not consistently}} successful when administered as tocolytic therapy. The beta(2) AR displays genetic variability; an arginine-to-glycine substitution at codon 16 (Arg 16 Gly) {{has been shown}} to increase receptor desensitization in response to agonist exposure, whereas a substitution of glutamate for glutamine at codon 27 (Gln 27 Glu) decreases down-regulation. We have demonstrated that homozygosity for Arg 16 protects against preterm delivery. Our goal was to determine whether beta(2) -agonists are more effective in women with the Arg 16 genotype and preterm labor. METHODS: Sixty white women with preterm labor between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation were treated for 48 hours with intravenous <b>hexoprenaline.</b> The effect of tocolysis and outcome of pregnancy were recorded. The beta(2) AR genotypes at codons 16 and 27 of ADRB 2 were determined. A control group of 116 women delivered at term was also genotyped. RESULTS: Preterm labor was not associated with beta(2) AR genotype at codon 16 (17 % of patients with preterm labor were Arg 16 homozygotes versus 19 % of control subjects) or codon 27. Gestation was significantly prolonged in Arg 16 homozygotes (median, 69 days; interquartile range, 63 - 79 days) compared with the other 2 genotypes (median, 58 days; interquartile range, 2 - 72 days) (P =. 04). Tocolysis was 100 % successful in delaying delivery for 48 hours in Arg 16 homozygotes (n = 10), just failing to achieve statistical significance (P =. 069). In contrast, only 37 of 50 women carrying 1 or 2 glycine alleles (74 %) had delivery delayed by more than 48 hours with tocolysis. Neonatal outcomes were significantly better in babies born to mothers homozygous for arginine than in women with 1 or 2 Gly 16 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study examining the pharmacogenetics of beta(2) AR agonist therapy for preterm labor. It appears that Arg 16 homozygosity improves pregnancy outcome after beta(2) -agonist tocolysis. The relatively low frequency of Arg 16 homozygotes in our population limited the power of this investigation. Future assessments of tocolytic therapy may need to assess beta(2) AR genotype...|$|E
40|$|Important {{factors which}} {{may affect the}} fetal {{circulation}} are the fetal breathing movements (FBMs) and other movements adn the features of fetal circulation. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} FBMs are a normal phenomenon of intrauterine development and that there are two patterns of FBMs: (1) A predominant pattern of rapid, irregular (in rate and amplitude) episodic movements, with interspersed episodes of apnea that is present more than 50 percent of the time and accounts for more than 90 percent of the breathing activity. Interestingly, periodic sighs are often seen during these FBMs; (2) There is also a less frequent pattern of sporadic, slow (1 to 4 movements/min), deep inspiratory movements, like sighs or gasps, or espiratory efforts which resemble grunting, coughing, or panting. The first pattern, which represents normal fetal respiratory activity, only occurs during rapid eye movements (REM) sleep, and it is unrelated to changes in blood gases and pH values and to afferent impulses from aortic and carotid bodies; FBMs may produce intrathoracic pressure swings of 35 Torr or more and are independent of Hering-Breuer reflexes. This pattern is usually accompanied by increased FHR beat-to-beat variability and increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and flow (BF). Therefore, they may influence the velocimetry of B. F. in humans, e. g., RED and ARED in the umbilical artery blood flow (UABF), which do not necessarily indicate impending fetal demise. The second pattern is unrelated to the fetal behavioral state and blood gas tensions. Concerning the effects of drugs on FBMs, we have analysed the effects aminophylline (A) (bolus of 240 mg followed by 0. 2 mg/kg/min) given to women not in labor; A caused a prompt and sustained FBMs that started as vorteces and then as regular inspiratory and expiratory movements, which increased in frequency (up to 88 /min) and depth. <b>Hexoprenaline</b> given to pregnant women with threatened preterm labor were able to elicit FBMs and NFFV; the infusion of 0. 3 microg/min increased UABF. Conjugated estrogens administered to the mother as a 10 mg bolus enhanced FBMs, as documented by TM and nasal flow velocity waveforms (NFFV); this was associated with an increased UABF; betamethasone (4 mg bolus to the mother) was shown to induce FBMs and an increased UABF. In a twin pregnancy betamethasone (0. 5 mg/kg) was administered IV into the umbilical vein in one fetus and IM to the other; in both cases bradycardia and increase in UABF occurred, immediately after IV infusion, and after 30 min following IM injection FBMs were induced or enhanced in frequency and depth. The flow in MCA was unchanged. In conclusion, the fetal circulation is influenced by fetal behavioural states, particularly by FBMs that affect the fetal cardiovascular function, including blood pressure and FHR thereby conditioning the velocimetric response of its major vessels, i. e., UA and MCA BF, whose alterations do not necessarily reflect impending fetal demise...|$|E
