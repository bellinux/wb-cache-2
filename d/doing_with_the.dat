25|$|At {{the same}} time, some {{residents}} of Minnesota were being offered cards by First National of Omaha, at similar terms.

25|$|In 1962 Corvette chief {{engineer}} Zora Arkus-Duntov initiated {{a program to}} produce a lightweight version based on a prototype that mirrored the new 1963 Corvette. Concerned about Ford {{and what they were}} <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Shelby Cobra, Duntov's program included plans to build 125 examples of the Corvette Grand Sport to allow the model to be homologated for international Grand Touring races. After the GM executives learned of the secret project, the program was stopped, and only five cars were built. All five cars have survived and are in private collections. They are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built, not because of what they accomplished, but because of what might have been.|$|E

25|$|Freud {{initiated}} the psychoanalytic critique of Surrealism with his remark that what interested him {{most about the}} Surrealists was not their unconscious but their conscious. His meaning was that the manifestations of and experiments with psychic automatism highlighted by Surrealists as the liberation of the unconscious were highly structured by ego activity, similar to {{the activities of the}} dream censorship in dreams, and that therefore it was in principle a mistake to regard Surrealist poems and other art works as direct manifestations of the unconscious, when they were indeed highly shaped and processed by the ego. In this view, the Surrealists may have been producing great works, but they were products of the conscious, not the unconscious mind, and they deceived themselves with regard to what they were <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> unconscious. In psychoanalysis proper, the unconscious does not just express itself automatically but can only be uncovered through the analysis of resistance and transference in the psychoanalytic process.|$|E

[...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together.

500|$|While {{working on}} his thesis, Mayall had an idea of {{designing}} a small, fast slitless spectrograph, optimized for nebulae and galaxies. [...] He believed {{that if it were}} used in conjunction with the Crossley reflector it would make that facility competitive for {{at least some of the}} work that Humason and Hubble were <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> larger Mt. Wilson telescopes. [...] It was never expected to compete with the Mt. Wilson [...] instrument for stars or elliptical galaxies, which have condensed and relatively bright nuclei. The spectrograph was to be used instead to study extended, low-surface-brightness gaseous nebulae or irregular galaxies. [...] Mayall's thesis advisor, William Hammond Wright, and the then head of the Lick stellar spectroscopy program, Joseph Haines Moore, encouraged him to develop his spectrograph. [...] The device was constructed by the Lick Observatory's own workshop, and proved to be more efficient for extended, low-surface-brightness objects, particularly in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, thus confirming the expectations of Mayall. With Wright's strong encouragement, Mayall had used fused quartz to make ultraviolet transmitting optics, whereas the Mt. Wilson spectrographs used heavy glass lenses and prisms, which absorb ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E
500|$|In July 2015, Butters {{revealed}} that the season would feature the Darkforce, which ties to the characters Doctor Strange and Marcus Daniels, the latter having appeared in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In January 2016, Fazekas elaborated, saying that the Darkforce, known as Zero Matter in the series, {{is the result of}} a nuclear test gone wrong by Isodyne Energy. Looking to the history of the Darkforce in the comics, Fazekas and Butters [...] "were able to select what we liked and sort of make our own rules as to what it does, how it operates, and who it affects in our world." [...] The producers tried to take a scientific approach to the explanation of the Zero Matter, consulting with theoretical physicist Clifford Johnson to help ground it in science. Johnson provided the science equations seen on blackboards throughout the season, as well as real world reference for the Zero Matter containment systems. The showrunners also conversed with Eric Carroll at Marvel Studios to ensure anything they were <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Darkforce would not contradict the Doctor Strange script, and to see if they could destroy Howard Stark's hover car, which was originally seen as a prototype in Captain America: The First Avenger. The mention in the season finale of the land Stark owns in Malibu is a reference to what will become the location for the home of his son, Tony, in the MCU films.|$|E
