25|$|As {{the global}} {{temperature}} of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward {{in order to keep}} living in their preferred climates. Scientists have found that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, are better able to adapt to the rising temperatures than sedentary species, such as Glanville fritillaries. Glanville fritillaries will migrate around the Åland Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> keep in mind when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.|$|E

Professor William J. Devlin and coauthor Shai Biderman examined Khan's character compared to the Übermensch and found that Khan's blind pursuit of revenge is against Nietzsche's ideals of transcendence and self-creation of a meaningful life. Instead, the authors offer Spock's self-sacrifice in The Wrath of Khan as a better example of the Übermensch.|$|E

[...] He later explained that the series {{has the opportunity to}} explore the Inhumans outside of the Royal Family (who are the major focus of the comics, television series and previously planned film). The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics. The change was due to 20th Century Fox controlling the film and television rights to the majority of Marvel's X-Men and mutant characters.|$|E

For him, the fact {{that a majority of the}} British people – Muslim and non-Muslim – oppose the war in Afghanistan is not something to be celebrated, but <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be feared." [...] Rod Liddle, writing in The Spectator, said: [...] "Anjem Choudray...is one of those thick-as-mince gobby little chancers who could only possibly come from Britain."

[...] Describing vocalist Corey Taylor's performance, he said, [...] "Despite his manic energy [...] managed to keep his vocals tightly controlled, alternating between furious screaming and melodic passages". While reviewing their Toronto show on May 1, 2009 for CANOE, Jason MacNeil noted the absence of percussionist Crahan, although in noting that several other members would occasionally occupy the vacant drum kit, he added, [...] "It didn't seem to matter much to the fans." [...] He also said, [...] "For the most part, Slipknot kept the energy high" [...] and added that tracks like [...] "Dead Memories" [...] and [...] "Vermilion" [...] were the only moments [...] "which served as breathers."

500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 10, 2016, {{approximately}} 15 {{minutes of}} footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film. Umberto Gonzales of TheWrap called the footage [...] "stunning to behold". He added that a sequence shown {{in which the}} Ancient One sends Strange [...] "on his first trippy tour through the multiverse" [...] was [...] "where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> behold in IMAX 3D," [...] concluding that [...] "after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film." [...] Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was [...] "dizzying" [...] and [...] "far weirder and wilder than [...] trailers are letting on," [...] though {{felt it was a}} bit difficult [...] "to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, [...] "Seth Rogen's comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage." [...] IGN's Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where [...] "Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through".|$|E

500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there <b>is</b> <b>something...</b> <b>to</b> be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror.

Move, unfortunately, doesn't produce that reaction often enough... Move feels a little too safe, or, said another way, a little too static". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still has something to say, and they say it well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying [...] "Whether accompanied by sharp-edged electric or slippery resonator guitars, a kids choir or the Blind Boys of Alabama, Third Day's Southern rock remains grounded in the band's faith".|$|E

Natasha fears that she could lose her control over Andrew. Summer later asks Natasha {{if there is anything}} else, other than the physical aspect, to her relationship with Andrew. Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her stop and think about what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she wants to look forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is."
