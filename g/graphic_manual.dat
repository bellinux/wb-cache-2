40|$|In this degree {{project a}} study of the {{importance}} of a graphic identity to companies has been done. A questionnaire among small companies in Dalarna has beenmade. From this, three sets of graphic profile-program have been formed andthese are suitable for new companies. Finally a practical application has been made on Greenfield in Mora, a graphic profile has been designed. To cause an identity is to prove that someone or something exists by individualizingand distinguish. Every individual or company has its qualities or charasteristics. The way to a desirable identity is going by a corporate identity-program that containsthe companies strategies, people, products, buildings, trademarks, graphic design. To create an identity a well considered strategy is needed, where all members of the company are involved. This will lead to a positive image and means for an efficient market communication. The identity of the company is that the company wish what the company/product will stand for, but the image is what the market think about the company/product. The surrounding worldwill be convinced that the company is a reliable producer or deliverer. The companyvill also be regarded as useful and responsable, profitable as an object or partner and a good place of work. Today, trademarking is the most important carrier of identity for a company. A trademark, like a word, a picture or a slogan, will distinguish a product from theothers. What is needed to build up a strong trademark? How can a trade markbe developed to an advantage?To get {{a lot of people in}} the same direction clear guidlines are needed.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a degree of}} Bachelor, Industrial Design - Product Design at Luleå University of Technology. The project covers a period of ten weeks during the spring semester of 2016. As a company {{it is important to}} be able to show their customers what they have to offer. If that option is not available, it is difficult to establish themselves on the market and be as competitive as companies that can show what they can offer. This is a problem that Skellefteå Snickericentral (SSC) face as they feel that they can’t show customers what they can do. The purpose of this project was to create a basic design for a collections that SSC could commercialize to increase the chances of establish themselves on the interior market. The goal was to develop a concept for a high cabinet, a wall cabinet and base cabinet and interior in the form of shelves. The customer group for the collection are schools and kindergartens where the cabinets will be adapted for the kitchen environment. The project has been based on the questions:• How is a cabinet collection for the preferences of different targets?• What makes a product perceived as environmentally friendly?• How is the identity of Skellefteå snikericentral highlighted in a product line?• How are emotions conveyed by a product folder?The project is based on a stage-gate model in which following processes have been worked through; planning, literature, context, analysis, idea- and concept development, detailed design and implementation. The work is based on the theoretical framework that the literature study generated and consist of topics such as sustainable development, product styling, materials science and the Golden Section. The project resulted in a concept of a basic version of the cabinet collection consisting of a high cabinet, a wall cabinet and a base cabinet with drawers and designed for kitchen environments to schools and kindergartens. The collection is stylish with straight shapes and large clear metal handles with revealing attachment. The collection has an associated concept for a product leaflet that has been developed based on the company's <b>graphic</b> <b>manual.</b> The product folder opens the possibility for the SSC to visualize what they have to offer on the market and can lead to an increased customer base of the company.

40|$|Subject {{matter of}} the thesis is Use of the triage method in {{emergency}} events and its importance among selected bodies of the integrated rescue system. It contains both teoretical and research parts. Theoretical part includes definition of emergency events and definition of mass disaster. It also mentions organizations, which help {{to deal with these}} events. But the main point of the thesis is formed by triage issues in terms of its history, elementary distribution and putting the most frequently used methods. An important chapter is a description of the documentation associated with issues, especially triage and identification cards from the perspective of emergency medical services and fire protection units. The last point of the theoretical part is the mention of traumatology planning. The research part sets out three hypotheses, which focus on finding a theoretical readiness among selected bodies of the integrated rescue system. The first presupposition was that the knowledge of the staff of medical rescue services is better than knowledge of the members of other selected bodies. The remaining hypotheses put the same requirements, but in terms of lenght of employment of selected workers in integrated rescue system. Better knowledge is expected for the longer-acting staff and for staff, who have some experience with triage issues. Chapter also describes the statistical method which enabled the confirmation or refutation of the hypotheses - pair t-test. The methodology describes the method of data collection by using questionnaire, describes used statistical methods, provides basic empirical parameters and their comparison. The result of this comparison was expressed in percentage. The result of data processing from secondary sources was to determining that examined issue in the Czech Republic is very fragmented, in terms of used methods and documentation. Data needed to confirm hypotheses was collected from the staff of emergency medical services, fire rescue units and volunteer firefighters. Only a single hypothesis was confirmed. Theoretical knowledge of the staff of emergency medical services is not better than the knowledge of the other selected bodies. It is very similar to knowledge of staff of fire rescue units. However members of volunteer firefighters have the worst triage knowledge. Another finding was that lenght of employment of workers of ambulance components doesn´t affects the quality of their theoretical preparedness. Empirical research identified knowledges approximately the same. On the contrary, previous experience affects the degree of this knowledge. This assertion is {{based on the fact that}} workers from examined bodies, who had to solve real or training emergency events, by triage methods, have better degree of theoretical knowledge. The objective of the thesis was, besides process determination of the theoretical knowledge and hypotheses also identification of weaknesses in triage knowledge of workers from selected bodies and determination methods for their correction. Therefore, based on the results, was created a <b>graphic</b> <b>manual</b> procedure for triage in emergency events. It was created as a learning tool to deepen the knowledge or as a reminder tool of triage procedure for training or real situations. It is designed for all workers, especially for members of volunteer fire units, or other people, who are interested in this issue. Conclusion of the thesis includes suggestion for correction of some of the weaknesses identified in the theoretical readiness of employees or members of integrated rescue system, especially units of volunteer firefighters. This objective can be achieved by better access to educational materials, exchange of expertise focused on this issue and the possibility of greater participation of mass casualties training with other bodies of integrated rescue system...|$|E
