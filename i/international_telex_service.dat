50|$|Canada-wide {{automatic}} teleprinter exchange {{service was}} introduced by the CPR Telegraph Company and CN Telegraph in July 1957 (the two companies, operated by rivals Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, would join to form CNCP Telecommunications in 1967). This service supplemented the existing <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> <b>service</b> that {{was put in place}} in November 1956. Canadian telex customers could connect with nineteen European countries in addition to eighteen Latin American, African, and trans-Pacific countries. The major exchanges were located in Montreal (01), Toronto (02), and Winnipeg (03).|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Western Union {{started to}} build a telex network in the United States. This telex network started as a {{satellite}} exchange located in New York City and expanded to a nationwide network. Western Union chose Siemens & Halske AG, now Siemens AG, and ITT to supply the exchange equipment, provisioned the exchange trunks via the Western Union national microwave system and leased the exchange to customer site facilities from the local telephone company. Teleprinter equipment was originally provided by Siemens & Halske AG and later by Teletype Corporation. Initial direct <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> <b>service</b> was offered by Western Union, via W.U. International, {{in the summer of}} 1960 with limited service to London and Paris. In 1962, the major exchanges were located in New York City (1), Chicago (2), San Francisco (3), Kansas City (4) and Atlanta (5). The telex network expanded by adding the final parent exchanges cities of Los Angeles (6), Dallas (7), Philadelphia (8) and Boston (9) starting in 1966.|$|E

50|$|In 1967 Morocco {{placed the}} first {{underwater}} cable between Tetouan, Morocco, and Perpignan, France, through the Mediterranean. A few years later, in 1970, a transmission via INTELSAT was introduced. The <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> was then automated in 1971 just before installing a digital center in Fes.|$|R
50|$|The PTT began <b>telex</b> <b>services</b> in 1934, and by 1936 had linked up {{the cities}} of Zurich, Basel, and Bern, which were then linked via Zurich to the {{international}} market. In the meantime, the PTT also became responsible for developing the company's radio broadcasting, and, later, television broadcasting services.|$|R
5000|$|An {{automatic}} telephone exchange system links all important cities and towns. Cable, telegram, and <b>telex</b> <b>services</b> connect Cameroon {{to the outside}} world. In January 1974, a satellite telecommunications earth station was inaugurated, greatly {{improving the quality of}} Cameroon’s international telephone service. However, service is still limited to mostly business and government use.|$|R
5000|$|Exclusive agency {{contracts}} - Certain {{international news}} sources cooperate exclusively with IRNA in news dissemination service within Iranian territory. This implies {{that access to}} news items and pictorial <b>telex</b> <b>services</b> of other news sources is possible only through IRNA's news dissemination telex lines.

5000|$|... ln 1975, the <b>International</b> <b>Telex</b> Exchange was opened, {{allowing}} {{businesses to}} send telexes. Four years later, International Direct Dialling (IDD) services were introduced {{and the first}} electronic exchange was commissioned in Johor Bahru. The volume of new development was such that, in the early 1980s, the Department was compelled to appoint contractors to help build new lines and extend the cable network.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the charges}} {{inherent}} in use of the <b>Telex</b> <b>service,</b> messages sent via Prestel Telex Link were chargeable, in 1984 {{at the rate of}} 50p for destinations in the UK, £1.00 for Europe, £2.00 for North America, £3.00 for elsewhere and even £5.00 for sending to ships via INMARSAT. There was no charge to Prestel users for receiving Telex messages.|$|R
50|$|In 1945 as {{the traffic}} {{increased}} {{it was decided}} to have a separate network for Telex traffic and the first manual exchange opened in London. By 1954 the public inland <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> opened via manually switched exchanges. A number of subscribers were served via automatic sub-centres based on Post Office relays and Type 2 Uniselectors acting as concentrators for the manual exchange.|$|R
50|$|Teletex was {{designed}} as an upgrade to the conventional <b>telex</b> <b>service.</b> The terminal-to-terminal communication <b>service</b> of <b>telex</b> would be turned into an office-to-office document transmission system by teletex. Teletex envisaged direct communication between electronic typewriters, word processors and personal computers. These units had storage for transmitting and receiving messages. The use of such equipment considerably enhanced the character set available for document preparation.|$|R
50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1750, but created as SOE by the DFL N° 10, December 24 of 1981, {{dissolving}} the previous SOE Servicio de Correos y Telégrafos (Post and Telegraph service), separating mailing and <b>Telex</b> <b>services,</b> founding Telex-Chile (that was extinguished as service when Internet becomes massive, but still exists legally as enterprise, providing other telecommunications services). Depends administratively by the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications.|$|R

50|$|Of {{very great}} {{consideration}} is the town's tremendous improvement in {{social services and}} infrastructure facilities since 1975. In the 1980s and 1990s, multistory buildings were constructed in the poblacion greatly changing Tuguegarao's skyline. Other changes included landscaped schools and homes, cable television, air-conditioned buses, jet flights, telegraph and <b>telex</b> <b>services,</b> door-to-door delivery services, domestic and overseas long-distance calls, luxurious social amenities and other trappings of a highly urbanized town.|$|R

5000|$|... "International Record Carrier" [...] (IRC) was a term {{created by}} the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. Bell's {{original}} consent agreement limited it to international dial telephony. The Western Union Telegraph Company had given up its international telegraphic operation in a 1939 bid to monopolize U.S. telegraphy by taking over ITT's PTT business. The result was a de-emphasis on telex in the U.S. and a [...] "cat's cradle" [...] of <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> and telegraphy companies, the IRCs.|$|R
50|$|The first {{telephone}} service in Norway was offered in 1878 between Arendal and Tvedestrand, {{while the first}} international {{telephone service}} between Christiania and Stockholm was offered in 1893. Automation of the telephone system was started in 1920 and completed in 1985. In 1946 the first <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> was offered, and in 1976 satellite telephone connections to oil platforms in the North Sea were installed. In 1980 the first steps to digitalise the telephone network were taken.|$|R
50|$|A related {{innovation}} {{that came from}} AUTODIN was Western Union's computer based EasyLink service. This system allowed {{for one of the}} first marketable email systems for non-government users. In addition, the system allowed the same message to be sent simultaneously to multiple recipients via email, fax, mailgram, or <b>telex</b> <b>services</b> as well as allowing messages to be sent from the integrated formats. With the service, users could also perform research utilizing its InfoLink application. EasyLink Services International Corporation is now a separate company.|$|R
5000|$|Western Union {{purchased}} the TWX system from AT&T in January 1969. The TWX {{system and the}} special US area codes (510, 710, 810 and 910) continued right up to 1981 when Western Union completed the conversion to the Western Union Telex II system. Any remaining [...] "3-row" [...] Baudot customers were converted to Western Union <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> during the period 1979 to 1981. Bell Canada retained area code 610 until 1992; its remaining numbers were moved to non-geographic area code 600.|$|R
50|$|Short-wave {{telephone}} communications {{with other countries}} were opened in 1935. The submarine cable, Scotice, between Scotland and Iceland was opened in 1962. In connection with the cable, <b>telex</b> <b>services</b> were established in Iceland. A year later, the Icecan cable between Iceland and Canada was formally opened. In 1980, the Skyggnir Earth Station came online, and telephone calls to other countries then went via satellite. Direct dialling to other countries became possible for the first time. In 1994, a new submarine cable, CANTAT-3, was opened.|$|R
50|$|<b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> spread within Europe and (particularly after 1945) {{around the}} world.By 1978, West Germany, {{including}} West Berlin, had 123,298 telex connections. Long before automatic telephony became available, most countries, even in central Africa and Asia, {{had at least}} a few high-frequency (shortwave) telex links. Often, government postal and telegraph services (PTTs) initiated these radio links. The most common radio standard, CCITT R.44 had error-corrected retransmitting time-division multiplexing of radio channels. Most impoverished PTTs operated their telex-on-radio (TOR) channels non-stop, to get the maximum value from them.|$|R
