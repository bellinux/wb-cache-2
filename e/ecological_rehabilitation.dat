This global approach will be tested and fitted in a dynamic and integrated experimental model of reference flows in the laboratory. The relevance of using of physical experimental scale models will be highlighted for the identification of constitutive laws used in numerical modelling. Practical applications prove that the integration of powerful hydrodynamic software for water management is realistic and will lead to compute transient flooding, sedimentation and erosion events in natural compound channels, {{as well as to}} design and simulate the behaviour of hydraulic regulation works or locks. It will also help in working out new projects or reconstructions of hydraulic infrastructures, as well as <b>ecological</b> <b>rehabilitations.</b> Even if the sole quantitative plan will be taken into account, this opti-misation project will also lead to highlight favourable solutions, from a qualitative point of view.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{attempts to}} reconcile existing <b>ecological</b> theories, <b>rehabilitation</b> planning goals and implementation constraints {{in the form}} of a rehabilitation paradigm that considers potential and pragmatic ecosystem transformation pathways. The framework prioritises multiple developmental scenarios for post-disturbed landscapes within a continuum of ecological outcomes. A feature of the framework is that ‘novel’ ecosystems and agro-ecosystems, having a range of commercial and societal values, are valid outcomes spanning the conceptual divide between the ecological functions of under-rehabilitated versus re-instated ‘natural’ landscapes, especially in a changing environment. Landscape suitability analyses are considered to be fundamental to the incorporation of regional landscape and climate in the implementation of land rehabilitation and management strategies. Altogether, the paradigm could facilitate the identification of widely pertinent rehabilitation goals having direct implications at the regional scale of restoration ecology and acceptance of the need for ongoing commitment to the management of disturbed environments...|$|R

However, quantifying the ecological effects of such policies at the regional level is difficult. A case study was conducted at the regional level in the ecologically vulnerable region of the Loess Plateau, China, through the use of several methods including the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), hydrological modeling and multivariate analysis. An assessment of the changes over the period of 2000 – 2008 in four key ecosystem services was undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} the Chinese government’s <b>ecological</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> initiatives implemented in 1999. These ecosystem services included water regulation, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and grain production. Significant conversions of farmland to woodland and grassland were found to have resulted in enhanced soil conservation and carbon sequestration, but decreased regional water yield under a warming and drying climate trend. The total grain production increased in spite of a significant decline in farmland acreage. These trends have been attributed to the strong socioeconomic incentives embedded in the <b>ecological</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> policy. Although some positive policy results have been achieved over the last decade, large uncertainty remains regarding long-term policy effects on the sustainability of <b>ecological</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> performance and ecosystem service enhancement.

30|$|One {{legacy of}} mining {{operations}} in China {{is a large}} number of post-mining landscapes, generally situated in urban areas that thrived during the country’s period of industrialization. Clearly, such landscapes are associated with a number of negative impacts on the environment as well as living conditions (Chen et al. 2010; Luo and Chen 2011; Chang and Yang 2015; Ma and Hu 2015). Comprehensive land reclamation planning for mining areas and mine rehabilitation are still at an exploratory level and lack a theoretical foundation, while research on <b>ecological</b> restoration and <b>rehabilitation</b> remains at a qualitative, descriptive stage. In particular, the country requires a stable, socio-economically and environmentally coordinated regulatory framework for the coal sector, one that encompasses the question of mine-closure (Cao 2017).

40|$|Conventionally, most {{research}} and restoration involving in-stream wood focuses on large wood (> 0. 1 m diameter), excluding any smaller pieces. However, this may neglect {{a major component}} of in-stream habitat, as small wood can constitute the majority of pieces, particularly in small streams. The ecological benefit of large wood is well established, but corresponding benefits associated with small wood (0. 05 - 0. 1 m diameter) have not been demonstrated. To test the effect of wood dimension on macroinvertebrate community composition, we compared the fauna occupying large wood habitats with that occupying small wood at eight streams in south-eastern Australia. The relationships between wood dimensions and its macroinvertebrate fauna were complex. Community composition did not vary with wood dimension, and no significant correlations were found between other macroinvertebrate attributes (including family richness and evenness) and wood dimension, including diameter. However, analysis of covariance suggested that large wood supported a greater diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates, indicating that the method of analysis could influence the result. Adjustment for differences in sample dimension using rarefaction determined that these findings were likely to be a result of the surface area and volumes sampled varying with the dimension of the wood. Per unit surface area, and per unit volume, small wood supported a similar number of families to large wood. Thus we conclude that, relative to the available surface area, small and large wood can be equivalent in their contribution to the available habitat in a stream. Therefore, the potential value of small wood as a habitat resource warrants its explicit consideration for inclusion in <b>ecological</b> and <b>rehabilitation</b> studies. <br /...|$|R

This region also supports over one-half of the country’s population and includes its major tourist and industrial centres. The story of Cinderella provides an excellent simile for the status of coastal wetlands in this region of Australia: coastal wetlands provide extremely valuable ecosystem services (indeed, of considerably greater value than those provided by an equivalent area of inland wetland), yet they are undervalued by the general community, by natural-resource managers and by funding agencies. The selective investment of <b>ecological</b> research (including <b>rehabilitation</b> studies) into inland wetlands – and in particular into floodplain wetlands of the Murray–Darling Basin – has left us inadequately equipped to understand how temperate coastal wetlands function, how they will respond to climate change, and how degraded sites can be rehabilitated.
