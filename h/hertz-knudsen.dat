40|$|Theories on the {{evaporation}} of pure substances {{are reviewed}} {{and applied to}} study vacuum evaporation of pure metals. It is shown that there is good agreement between different theories for weak evaporation, whereas there are differences under intensive evaporation conditions. For weak evaporation, the evaporation coefficient in <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> equation is 1. 66. Vapor velocity {{as a function of}} the pressure is calculated applying several theories. If a condensing surface is less than one collision length from the evaporating surface, the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> equation applies. For a case where the condensing surface is not close to the evaporating surface, a pressure criterion for intensive evaporation is introduced, called the effective vacuum pressure, peff. It is a fraction of the vapor pressure of the pure metal. The vacuum evaporation rate should not be affected by pressure changes below peff, so that in lower pressures below peff, the evaporation flux is constant and equal to a fraction of the maximum evaporation flux given by <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> equation as 0. 844 n˙Maxn˙Max.

40|$|The {{evaporation}} rate of a liquid is determined, inter alia, by its equilibrium vapour pressure {{and by the}} actual pressure of vapour just above the surface. The relationship between these properties, the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> equation, can be deduced from the kinetic theory of gases. The evaporation coefficient, long used as a correction factor in this relationship, has been shown by recent experiments of Hickman, Maa, Schulze, and Cammenga to be unity, provided the equilibrium vapour pressure used in the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> equation is the value for {{the surface of the}} liquid. Difficulties in determining the surface temperature, and hence the vapour pressure, have led to values of the evaporation coefficient less than unity. It is also essential that the liquid surface be clean. Minute quantities of contamination on the surface can inhibit the convective transfer of heat through the liquid to the surface, and this can lower the {{evaporation rate}}. Certain monolayers, when spread on a liquid surface, can reduce the evaporation rate of the liquid. In some situations this reduction can be partly attributed to reduced heat transfer by convection, but often the monolayer itself can impede evaporation. This property is conveniently described by an evaporation resistance. Monolayers in condensed surface states usually have significant evaporation resistances, but there are some important exceptions. The resistance depends on molecular architecture, temperature, surface pressure and carbon chain length. Treatment of evaporation resistance in terms of an energy or free energy barrier to evaporation describes most of the experimental data, but attempts to predict resistance values have had little success. A postulate that evaporation is restricted to those parts of the surface not obstructed by monolayer molecules, the accessible area, has led to successful predictions of some aspects of evaporation resistance. However, there is, as yet, no comprehensive theory of evaporation resistance: indeed, some experimental observations can not be explained by any of the current theories...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to examine evaporation kinetics of metallic iron, {{one of the important}} materials forming terrestrial planets and meteorites. Platelets of pure metallic iron were heated at temperatures ranging from 1075 to 1312 ℃ under vacuum (10 ^ to 10 ^ Torr) for 0. 5 to 96 hrs. The evaporation proceeds by forming evaporation steps, although small wustite crystals were formed on the surfaces by partial oxidation of iron under vacuum. Amounts of evaporated iron estimated from mass loss of experimental charges increased with time at constant temperatures, showing a linear rate law. The evaporation rates, j, can be represented by ln j= 22. 21 ± 2. 29 [mol m^ s^]- 390. 6 ± 29. 2 [kJ mol^]/RT.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of interfacial heat and mass transfer {{is important for}} environmental and technical applications, especially nowadays for numerical simulations of two phase problems. However, the data available up to now are inconsistent, because most experiments performed on earth suffer under buoyancy and convection, and thus the boundary conditions at the evaluation could not clearly be defined. Therefore, we {{seized the opportunity to}} investigate interfacial heat and mass transfer in microgravity environment. In these experiments the growth and collapse in the overall superheated and subcooled bubles, respectively, liquid or free vapor bubbles were observed at various liquid temperature and pressure states and over periods of from a few seconds up to 300 seconds. It was {{for the first time that}} such very long periods of bubble growth could be observed. The experimental set-up allowed the control of the liquid supersaturation before the bubbles were initiated by a short heat pulse at a miniaturized heater. Therefore it was possible to perform a systematic parametric study. The measured curves for vapor bubble growth are in good agreement with our numerical simulation.

40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a dynamic model for a two-bed adsorption refrigeration system. Different from most existing researches which assume saturation vaper pressure in each device, the proposed method models the pressure in each device by considering both the liquid and vaper content in the device. Therefore, it can be more accurate in describing the system response and more suitable for studying the system instrumentation. The components included in this system model are: adsorption bed, evaporator, condenser, expansion valve, and etc. Each device is modeled based on the energy and mass conservation. Furthermore, the adsorption phenomenon is modeled by the â€œFreundlich equation,â€ and â€œlinear driving force model. â€ The phase change of the refrigerant in evaporator and condenser is modeled by <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> theory.

The original software presented, developed by the authors, are well suited for simulating laser milling or laser micromachining operations with power density up to 1014 W/m 2 and pulse duration in the order of nanoseconds. The temperature of the solid phase is evaluated by solving the Fourier equation by using the finite difference method (FDM). The recession velocity of the ablating surface is evaluated according to the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> equation assuming that the explosive effects are negligible. The plasma plume is considered in local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) and the energy balance permits to evaluate the plume temperature, ion distribution and pressure under the assumption that the gas expansion, from the surface target, produces a sonic front. The plume energy balance is influenced by the energy lost for irradiation from the plume and by the quantity of laser beam energy reflected from the target surface.

In particular, {{results have been}} obtained for thin film deposition processes for copper. The vapor phase of monatomic copper is simulated using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique. The growth rates obtained from the DSMC simulations are compared with measured growth rates. It is shown that, by simultaneously calculating the mass flow rate and the Knudsen number accurately, excellent agreement is obtained between simulated and measured growth rates. Based on this comparison, parameters of a variable hard sphere molecular model for copper vapor have been determined. Three different compact models for the dependence of the normalized growth rate profiles on the Knudsen number are considered and compared with each other. Droplet transport including momentum and energy coupling between the gas and droplet phase are used to compute the trajectories of droplets originating at the throat and lip of two different nozzles. The maximum droplet radius reaching the substrate and the variation of droplet size with angle predicted by the trajectory computations agrees well with the measurements using Optical Microscopy.

The examined models comprise phase-change mechanisms based on the kinetic theory of gases (<b>Hertz–Knudsen</b> equation), thermodynamic-equilibrium conditions (HEM), bubble-dynamics considerations using the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri model (ZGB), as well as semi-empirical correlations calibrated specifically for flash boiling (HRM). Benchmark geometrical layouts, i. e a converging-diverging nozzle, an abruptly contracting (throttle) nozzle and a highly-pressurized pipe, for which experimental data {{are available in the}} literature have been employed for the validation of the numerical predictions. Consideration on additional aspects associated with phase-change processes, such as the distribution of activated nucleation sites, as well as the deviation from thermodynamic-equilibrium conditions have also been taken into account. The numerical results have demonstrated that the onset of flashing flow in all cases is associated with the occurrence of compressible flow phenomena, such as flow choking at the constriction location and expansion downstream, accompanied by the formation of shockwaves. Phase-change models based on the kinetic theory of gases produced more accurate predictions for all the cases investigated, while the validity of the HRM and ZGB models was found to be situational. Furthermore, it has been established that the inter-dependence between intrinsic physical factors associated with flash boiling, such as the nucleation-site density and the phase-change rate, has a significant, yet not clearly distinguishable influence on the two-phase flow characteristics...|$|E

The esterification reaction was assumed to be the pseudo-homogeneous second-order reversible reaction, and the mass transfer effectiveness factor () was introduced in the modeling framework to systematically and collectively consider both evaporation and reaction, which are simultaneously and competitively occurred in the liquid phase. The nonlinear programming problem was constructed with the objective function consisting of the errors between experimental data and the estimated values from {{the reaction}} model. The problem was solved by using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm to identify kinetic parameters, reaction rate constants, and mass transfer coefficients. The values of mass transfer coefficients were found to follow the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> relation and expressed as a function of reaction temperature. From the reaction rate constants obtained from the proposed kinetic models, the apparent activation energy was estimated to be 43. 98 kJ/mol, which is lower than the value obtained from the reaction using heterogeneous catalysts.

The influence of the four harmonics at 266, 355, 532 and 1064 nm on the behavior of the nascent plasma is studied. In each case, the fluence is set equal to the threshold above which a phase explosion takes place (fluence of 7. 7, 7. 4, 6. 8, 5. 1 J cm(- 2) in order of increasing wavelength). The model takes into account free electrons and excited states of Al, Al+, Al 2 + and Al 3 +. Both groups of particles are characterized by their translation temperature in thermal non-equilibrium. Besides, each population density is assumed to be in chemical non-equilibrium and to behave freely through the involved seven elementary processes (electron impact induced excitation and ionization, elastic collisions, multiphoton ionization, inverse laser Bremsstrahlung, direct thermal Bremsstrahlung and spontaneous emission). Atoms passing from the sample to the gas are described by considering classical vaporization phenomena (governed by the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> law) so that the surface temperature is limited to values less than the critical point (T-c = 6700 K). The relative role of the elementary processes is discussed and the time-evolution of the excitation of the species is analyzed for the four considered wavelengths.

The influence of the first three harmonics at 355 nm, 532 nm and 1064 nm is studied. In each case, the fluence value is set equal to the threshold above which a phase explosion takes place. The sample surface temperature is therefore limited to the critical temperature (6700 K). The solid - gas transition is classically treated by using the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> law. The species considered in CoRaM-Al are Al, Al+, Al 2 +, Al 3 + and free electrons. They are in thermochemical non-equilibrium at different temperatures. Each state behaves freely owing to electron impact induced excitation and ionization, elastic collisions, Multiphoton Ionization (MPI), Inverse Bremsstrahlung (IB), thermal Bremsstrahlung, and spontaneous emission. The results show that MPI and IB play a complementary role in the heating process of electrons. In the ultraviolet and visible cases, the increase in electron temperature is mainly due to multiphoton ionization before the maximum irradiance. The electron temperature does not exceed 9000 K. The heavy particle temperature mainly results from the surface temperature. Conversely, in the infrared case, electron temperature strongly increases after the maximum irradiance owing to inverse Bremsstrahlung. Electrons then give a part of their energy for the benefit of heavy particles, which leads to the increase in their temperature. The electron number density reaches its maximum during the laser pulse with a value of the order of 10 (25) m(- 3) and the electron temperature exceeds 13, 000 K. A maximum of the ionization degree close to 0. 2 is thus obtained at 1064 nm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. A. All tights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Context. Ice {{lines are}} {{suggested}} {{to play a}} significant role in grain growth and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Evaporation fronts directly influence the gas and ice abundances of volatile species in the disk and therefore the coagulation physics and efficiency and the chemical composition of the resulting planetesimals. Aims. In this work we investigate the influence of the existence of the CO ice line on the particle growth and on the distribution of CO in the disk. Methods. We include the possibility of tracking the CO content and/or other volatiles in particles and in the gas in our existing dust coagulation and disk evolution model and developed a method for evaporation and condensation of CO using the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> equation. Our model does not include fragmentation, yet, which will be part of further investigations. Results. We find no enhanced grain growth just outside the ice line where the particle size is limited by radial drift. Instead we find a depletion of solid material inside the ice line which is solely due to evaporation of the CO. Such a depression inside the ice line may be observable and may help to quantify the processes described in this work. Furthermore, we find that the viscosity and diffusivity of the gas heavily influence the re-distribution of vaporized CO at the ice line and can lead to an increase in the CO abundance by up to a factors of a few in the region just inside the ice line. Depending on the strength of the gaseous transport mechanisms the position of the ice line in our model can change by up to 10 AU and consequently, the temperature at that location can range from 21 K to 23 K.

Transient simulations of filmwise condensation in a small two-dimensional parallel plate passage are performed. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to track the vapor liquid interface. The Geometric Reconstruction Scheme, which is a Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC) method, is employed to keep the interface sharp. The governing equations and the VOF equation with relevant source terms for condensation are solved explicitly. The surface tension is {{taken into account in}} the modeling and it is evaluated by the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) approach. Different methods to evaluate the source terms in the VOF and energy equations are summarized based on previous studies. The simulation is performed using the CFD software package, Ansys Fluent, and an in-house developed code. This in-house code is specifically developed to calculate the source terms associated with phase change, which are deduced from the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> equation based on the kinetic gas theory. The predicted results show that a laminar regime exists {{at the top of the}} wall, where the film is the thinnest. A wavy regime appears as a series of regular ripples/waves of condensate moving downwards under the action of both gravity and shear stress in the interface area. As a further step, the simulations have been run under different surface tension, wall temperature, and inlet velocity conditions. The predictions also indicate that the wave peak height decreases with increasing surface tension and decreases with increasing inlet velocity. This has an effect on the heat transfer characteristics of the condensation process. The condensation heat transfer increases sharply by increasing the temperature difference between the wall and saturation temperature of the inlet steam...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of {{the rate at which}} cosmic dust enters the Earth’s atmosphere has been highly uncertain, with a daily mass influx ranging between 5 t d- 1 and 270 t d- 1. In fact, this issue has an important implication because if the upper limit of the estimates is correct, then vertical transport in the middle atmosphere must be faster than is generally assumed. On the other hand, if the lower limit is correct, then our understanding of the cosmic dust evolution in the solar system, and the transport mechanisms from the middle atmosphere to the Earth’s surface will need to be revised. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to estimate a Meteor Input Function (MIF) that allows to understand different atmospheric phenomena in the Mesosphere lower Thermosphere (MLT). For this purpose, the Zodiacal Cloud Model (ZCM) which is contrained by mid-Infrared observations of the zodiacal dust is evaluated. The ZCM is a detailed dynamical model that attempts to explain the origin of cosmic dust and accounts for the directionality, and mass and velocity distribution of Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs) in the inner solar system. The thesis is divided into four parts. First, the ZCM – constrained by measurements of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) – is evaluated using the Chemical ABlation MODel developed at the University of Leeds. These results are compared with those obtained from two quite different distributions: the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) and the incoming flux measured by meteor head echo detections with High- Power and Large-Aperture (HPLA) radars. Second, a newly-developed laboratory Meteor Ablation Simulator (MASI) is used to test the thermodynamic model within CABMOD as well as the use of the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> relation to describe the kinetics of evaporation; the Na, Fe, and Ca ablation rate profiles modelled by CABMOD are then refined. Third, the absolute contribution of each cosmic dust population –Jupiter-Family Comets (JFCs), Asteroids (ASTs), and Long-Period Comets (LPCs) – to the global input is estimated accounting for the most recent version of the ZCM constrained by Planck satellite observations, the cosmic flux accretion rate at the bottom of an ice chamber at the Amudsen-Scott base at South Pole, and recent measurements of the vertical fluxes of Na and Fe atoms above 87. 5 km in the atmosphere.

40|$|Increased use of {{prescribed}} fire by {{land managers}} {{and the increasing}} likelihood of wildfires due to climate change require an improved modeling capability of extreme heating of soils during fires. This issue is addressed here by developing and testing the soil (heat–moisture–vapor) HMV-model, a 1 -D (one-dimensional) non-equilibrium (liquid–vapor phase change) model of soil evaporation that simulates the coupled simultaneous transport of heat, soil moisture, and water vapor. This model is intended for use with surface forcing ranging from daily solar cycles to extreme conditions encountered during fires. It employs a linearized Crank–Nicolson scheme for the conservation equations of energy and mass and its performance is evaluated against dynamic soil temperature and moisture observations, which were obtained during laboratory experiments on soil samples exposed to surface heat fluxes ranging between 10 000 and 50 000 W m − 2. The <b>Hertz–Knudsen</b> equation {{is the basis for}} constructing the model's non-equilibrium evaporative source term. Some unusual aspects of the model that were found to be extremely important to the model's performance include (1) a dynamic (temperature and moisture potential dependent) condensation coefficient associated with the evaporative source term, (2) an infrared radiation component to the soil's thermal conductivity, and (3) a dynamic residual soil moisture. This last term, which is parameterized as a function of temperature and soil water potential, is incorporated into the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity functions in order to improve the model's ability to capture the evaporative dynamics of the strongly bound soil moisture, which requires temperatures well beyond 150 °C to fully evaporate. The model also includes film flow, although this phenomenon did not contribute much to the model's overall performance. In general, the model simulates the laboratory-observed temperature dynamics quite well, but is less precise (but still good) at capturing the moisture dynamics. The model emulates the observed increase in soil moisture ahead of the drying front and the hiatus in the soil temperature rise during the strongly evaporative stage of drying. It also captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture that occurs at relatively low temperatures (50 – 90 °C), and can provide quite accurate predictions of the total amount of soil moisture evaporated during the laboratory experiments. The model's solution for water vapor density (and vapor pressure), which can exceed 1 standard atmosphere, cannot be experimentally verified, but they are supported by results from (earlier and very different) models developed for somewhat different purposes and for different porous media. Overall, this non-equilibrium model provides a much more physically realistic simulation over a previous equilibrium model developed for the same purpose. Current model performance strongly suggests that it is now ready for testing under field conditions...|$|E
