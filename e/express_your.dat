500|$|Mubarak {{rejected}} international {{calls to}} step aside. Finance Minister Samir Radwan {{said the government}} would be [...] "open to discussion with all shades of political opinions". The army had earlier broadcast a message on television:... You began by going out to <b>express</b> <b>your</b> demands {{and you are the}} ones capable of restoring normal life.|$|E
500|$|... "Baby I" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Ariana Grande for her debut studio album Yours Truly (2013). It was written by Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds, Antonio Dixon and Patrick [...] "J. Que" [...] Smith and produced by the first two. The song was released by Republic Records on July 22, 2013, as the second single from the album. The song was initially written with the singer Beyoncé in mind, but she rejected it. [...] "Baby I" [...] is an R and pop song with drums, horns and a syncopated beat. It also contains an uptempo '90s-inspired beat. Lyrically, the song is {{about not being able}} to fully <b>express</b> <b>your</b> feelings towards someone you love. The song was well received by music critics who complimented the song's [...] "throwback" [...] sound while others praised Grande's vocals comparing to the singer Mariah Carey.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Yield {{continued}} {{with the more}} contemplative type of writing found on No Code. Vedder said that while [...] "in the past we got really angry and we cried out against many things in our songs", he considered that when [...] "you become an adult you have to <b>express</b> <b>your</b> energy in a different way, more calm." [...] This led to songs that while not eschewing [...] "the bad side of life", ended up [...] "facing it from a more positive point of view, {{looking for a way}} to solve it. In the past we said: what a shit, this stinks, that sucks, everything sucks... Now it's time to say: stop, let's look for a solution, let's be positive." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by literary works, including Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita ("Pilate"), Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael ("Do the Evolution"), and the writings of Charles Bukowski ("In Hiding"). Gossard wrote the lyrics for the songs [...] "No Way" [...] and [...] "All Those Yesterdays", and Ament, making his first lyrical contributions to a Pearl Jam album, wrote the lyrics for the songs [...] "Pilate" [...] and [...] "Low Light". Ament said, [...] " [...] watch Eddie put his heart into singing lyrics that I wrote, was an experience I can't put into words." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is really}} interesting," [...] said the girl. [...] "Has sudden {{prosperity}} also rendered you incapable of <b>expressing</b> <b>your</b> thoughts in speech?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose we {{telegraph}} to my father, sir?" [...] {{suggested the}} judicious Pedgift. [...] "It's {{the quickest way}} of <b>expressing</b> <b>your</b> feelings, and the cheapest." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Expressing</b> <b>your</b> {{opinion is}} a form of civil defense. My mission was to {{encourage}} the opposition movement, to let people know they are not alone in this.|$|R
2500|$|Threatening {{resignation}} {{can also}} be seen as both active–constructive and active–destructive. This strategy involves the employee threatening to resign as a [...] "form of leverage for obtaining responsiveness and action from supervisors and management." [...] When used to <b>express</b> <b>your</b> concerns about unsafe and intolerable work conditions it is deemed constructive. However, this strategy will appear to be destructive when the managers view the threat as [...] " [...] and unprincipled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tonge was reprimanded by the Liberal Party leader Menzies Campbell, who commented [...] "I defend {{absolutely}} {{your right}} to <b>express</b> <b>your</b> views on the Middle East, including legitimate criticism {{of the state of}} Israel. But I {{do not believe that the}} remarks you used fell within that category." [...] He added that the remarks had [...] "clear anti-Semitic connotations" [...] Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, was quoted as saying: [...] "If someone makes comments that are so at odds with what the party feels, and hopefully at odds with common decency, then one would hope that they are no longer made welcome in the party itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another common term is [...] "Stud". A stud is a {{dominant}} lesbian, usually butch. They {{tend to be}} influenced by urban and hip-hop cultures and are often, but not always, Afro-American. In the New York City lesbian community a butch may identify herself as AG (aggressive) or as a stud. In 2005, filmmaker Daniel Peddle chronicled the lives of AGs in his documentary The Aggressives, following six women who went to lengths like binding their breasts to pass as men. But Peddle says that today, very young lesbians of color in New York are creating a new, insular scene that's largely cut {{off from the rest of}} the gay and lesbian community. [...] "A lot of it has to do with this kind of pressure to articulate and <b>express</b> <b>your</b> masculinity within the confines of the hip-hop paradigm..." [...] The AG culture has also been represented on film by Black lesbian filmmaker Dee Rees' 2011 work, Pariah.|$|E
6000|$|... "I really can't say, Mr. Crocker; but as {{you have}} now <b>expressed</b> <b>your</b> wonder, perhaps you had better {{go back to your}} room and do your work." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} fast!" [...] he said. [...] "It {{would be more}} fitting if you got down and <b>expressed</b> <b>your</b> regrets to the fräulein. You haven't heard Muller's story yet, Larry." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Keys stated that she [...] "eliminated all of the boundaries and all the limitations, {{so that you can}} feel your freedom and <b>express</b> <b>your</b> freedom in every way you possibly can". The Element of Freedom was scheduled to be released on December 1, 2009, to correspond with World AIDS Day, but was pushed back to December 15 for additional recording. According to the senior vice president of urban marketing for J Records, Keys [...] "had a couple of more things in the oven and she wants this to be right [...] So we gave her the additional time she needed." [...] Keys pointed out that she felt the album was being rushed for no reason. In {{an interview}} with Scottish newspaper The Scotsman, she stated that it [...] "seems unfair to have to rush these songs that were still coming and not allow them to be the best songs they could be. It was just two weeks' difference, but it made for an even better record".|$|E

6000|$|... "Lady Delahaye," [...] I said, [...] "my {{story may}} have sounded strangely, {{but it was}} true. I presume {{that you did not}} come here solely with the purpose of <b>expressing</b> <b>your</b> amiable opinion of my veracity?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Master Wilfred, {{you have}} <b>expressed</b> <b>your</b> {{opinions}} sufficiently to-night," [...] said the General. [...] "Suppose you and Fergus walk home together. A nasty low place as ever I saw. I have {{a mind to}} tell the Mayor about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For a {{young girl}} of your age, Pamela," [...] she said sternly, [...] "I {{consider}} that you <b>express</b> <b>your</b> opinions far too freely. Your attitude, too, is unjustifiable." ...|$|E

6000|$|The captain's voice {{checked the}} general {{outbreak}} of laughter. [...] "That will do, quarter-master. Let it be understood that nobody is {{to shoot the}} bird--and let me suggest to you, sir, {{that you might have}} <b>expressed</b> <b>your</b> sentiments quite as effectually in less violent language." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{fail to see}} the connection," [...] Mountjoy acknowledged, [...] "between {{what you}} have said so far, and the subject on which you <b>expressed</b> <b>your</b> {{intention}} of speaking to me. Pray forgive me if I appear to hurry you--or {{if you have any}} reasons for hesitation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, to-day. You {{can easily}} {{get as far}} as Roscommon. You have your own horse and car. And, what is more, before you go, you must write to your sister, telling her that you have made up your mind to leave the country, and <b>expressing</b> <b>your</b> consent to her marrying whom she pleases." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Order something, papa; <b>express</b> <b>your</b> wish; only don't hurt, don't grieve Graham. I cannot, cannot bear that. I love you, papa; but I love Graham too--because--because--it is {{impossible}} to help it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Besides, sire," [...] said Pere la Chaise softly, [...] "there {{would be}} little need for these {{stronger}} measures of which the good abbe speaks. As I have already remarked to you, you are so beloved in your kingdom that the mere assurance that you had <b>expressed</b> <b>your</b> will upon the subject {{would be enough to}} turn them all to the true faith." ...|$|R
60|$|RICHARD (gaily and bluntly). Not a scrap. Oh, you <b>expressed</b> <b>your</b> {{feelings}} {{towards me}} very frankly yesterday. What happened may have softened {{you for the}} moment; but believe me, Mrs. Anderson, you don't like a bone in my skin or a hair on my head. I shall be as good a riddance at 12 today as I should have been at 12 yesterday.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was liberally {{paid for}} my old {{attendance}} here," [...] I said, to soothe her, [...] "in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only {{for my own}} information.

6000|$|... "If I have pleased you it {{is rather}} more to the purpose," [...] said Austin, reflectively. [...] "I have, however, noticed that when you <b>express</b> <b>your</b> {{approbation}} there is usually something else to be done." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But," [...] remarked Bossuet, [...] "if it {{were once}} {{known that the}} king's will had been <b>expressed,</b> <b>your</b> Majesty may rest assured that even the worst of his {{subjects}} bear him such love that they would hasten to come within the pale of Holy Church.
