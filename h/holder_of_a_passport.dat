A frame describes a category of objects in terms of the attributes these objects exhibit, and the type of values which each of the attributes may take. The attributes are functions that relate unique values to the bearer of the attribute.

The respective entries in a passport are the values which these functions take for the bearer of the passport. Frame descriptions in terms of attribute...|$|E
