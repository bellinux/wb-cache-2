5|$|October: <b>Intel</b> announces new {{releases}} of <b>Intel</b> C++ Compiler and <b>Intel</b> Fortran Compiler for x86/x64, while Itanium support is only available in older versions.|$|E
5|$|Starting in November 2010, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of new product suites, the <b>Intel</b> Itanium Compilers were no longer bundled with the <b>Intel</b> x86 compilers in a single product. <b>Intel</b> offers Itanium tools and <b>Intel</b> x86 tools, including compilers, independently in different product bundles.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012 Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Oracle Corp. support lawsuit, court {{documents}} unsealed by a Santa Clara County Court judge revealed that in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid <b>Intel</b> around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, {{the two companies}} signed another $250 million deal, which obliged <b>Intel</b> to continue making Itanium CPUs for HP's machines until 2017. Under {{the terms of the}} agreements, HP has to pay for chips it gets from <b>Intel,</b> while <b>Intel</b> launches Tukwila, Poulson, Kittson, and Kittson+ chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform.|$|E

50|$|In October 2016, {{nearly one}} year after <b>Intel's</b> {{integration}} with Altera, STRATIX 10 was announced, {{which is based on}} <b>Intel's</b> 14nm Tri-Gate process.|$|R
50|$|The Desktop {{chipsets}} {{that support}} LGA 1156 are <b>Intel's</b> H55, H57, P55, and Q57. Server chipsets supporting the socket are <b>Intel's</b> 3400, 3420 and 3450.|$|R
5|$|Early A320s {{used the}} <b>Intel</b> 80186 and Motorola 68010. In 1988, the flight {{management}} computer contained six <b>Intel</b> 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 megabytes of memory.|$|E
5|$|A former <b>Intel</b> {{official}} {{reported that}} the Itanium business had become profitable for <b>Intel</b> in late 2009. By 2009, the chip was almost entirely deployed on servers made by HP, which had over 95% of the Itanium server market share, making the main operating system for Itanium HP-UX. On March 22, 2011, <b>Intel</b> reaffirmed its commitment to Itanium with multiple generations of chips in development and on schedule.|$|E
5|$|December: <b>Intel</b> and Sun {{announce}} {{joint effort}} to port Solaris to IA-64.|$|E

50|$|The Knights Corner {{product line}} is {{made at a}} 22 nm process size, using <b>Intel's</b> Tri-gate {{technology}} with more than 50 cores per chip, and is <b>Intel's</b> first many-cores commercial product.|$|R
50|$|<b>Intel's</b> Fab 68 {{is located}} in Dalian. The plan was {{announced}} on 26 March 2007, and operations started on 26 October 2010. It is <b>Intel's</b> first chip-manufacturing fabrication in East Asia.|$|R
5|$|February: <b>Intel</b> ships test {{versions}} of Kittson, {{the first new}} Itanium chip since 2012.|$|E
5|$|HP {{believed}} that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with <b>Intel</b> in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. <b>Intel</b> was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP and <b>Intel</b> initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|HP-UX 11i; an <b>Intel</b> 64 (x86-64) port was proposed, {{but later}} canceled.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, Tabula {{confirmed}} it would use 22-nm manufacturing process on <b>Intel's</b> Factories. As of July 2013, only 5 companies {{were allowed to}} use <b>Intel's</b> manufacturing process: Achronix; Tabula; Netronome; Microsemi; and Altera.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, <b>Intel's</b> Kirk Skaugen {{said that}} <b>Intel's</b> {{exclusive}} focus on Microsoft platforms {{was a thing}} of the past and that they would now support all [...] "tier-one operating systems" [...] such as Linux, Android, iOS, and Chrome.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} use is <b>Intel's</b> Trusted Execution Technology (TXT). <b>Intel's</b> TXT {{is used to}} create a [...] "chain of trust", and to {{remotely}} attest that a computer has a specified hardware setup and is using specified software.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to donations from individuals, the BSA receives extensive donations from major corporations. In 2010, their top corporate donors were, in order, <b>Intel,</b> Emerson, Verizon, 3M, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Pfizer, Valero, UPS, U.S. Bank, Eli Lilly, GE, and Monsanto. However, <b>Intel</b> and UPS cut funding to BSA in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with its Xeon family of server processors, Itanium {{has never been}} a high-volume product for <b>Intel.</b> <b>Intel</b> does not release production numbers. One industry analyst estimated that the production rate was 200,000 processors per year in 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>Intel</b> {{announced}} the official {{name of the}} processor, Itanium, on October 4, 1999.|$|E

40|$|By any measure, price deflators for {{semiconductors}} fell at {{a staggering}} pace {{over much of}} the last decade. These rapid declines are typically attributed to technological innovations that lower constant-quality manufacturing costs. But, given <b>Intel's</b> dominance in the microprocessor market, those price declines may also reflect changes in <b>Intel's</b> profit margins. Disaggregate data on <b>Intel's</b> operations are used to explore these issues. There are three basic findings. First, the industry data show that <b>Intel's</b> markups from its microprocessor segment shrank substantially from 1993 - 99. Second, about 3 - 1 / 2 percentage points of the average 24 percent price decline in a price index for <b>Intel's</b> chips can be attributed to declines in these profit margins over this period. And, finally, the data suggest that virtually all of the remaining price declines can be attributed to quality increases associated with product innovation.
