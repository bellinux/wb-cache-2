50|$|When the City & South London Railway {{opened in}} 1890 {{access to the}} {{platforms}} was by two hydraulic lifts, each capable of carrying 50 passengers. The later extensions had <b>electric</b> <b>lifts</b> and five were provided at Bank. Access to the Waterloo & City Railway in 1898 was by slopes and steps, and the Great Northern & City Railway (GN&CR) used both hydraulic and <b>electric</b> <b>lifts.</b> The Central London Railway provided <b>electric</b> <b>lifts</b> {{when it opened in}} 1900, and the opening of Bond Street station was delayed as the lifts were not ready. The UERL controversially imported 140 <b>electric</b> <b>lifts</b> from Otis Elevator Company in the U.S. for its three lines. Each carrying about 70 passengers, they were provided at every station except Gillespie Road (now Arsenal) and Embankment, where access was provided via the District's station. Hydraulic lifts were provided at Finsbury Park, powered from the GN&CR pumping station. and at Holloway Road there was an experimental spiral conveyor, but this was never used by the public. Each lift was manned, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office.|$|R

2500|$|A {{major breach}} of the canal {{occurred}} on 20 November 1911, when subsidence caused part of the aqueduct and the adjacent embankment to fail. Repairs were not completed until 10 July 1912, when the canal was reopened. The canal had to close for four months {{at the end of}} 1922 due to drought conditions. In 1934, the County Council installed an <b>electric</b> <b>lift</b> bridge at Royston. Traffic continued to fall, and maintenance costs increased as the effects of subsidence damaged the infrastructure, but the canal remained profitable until 1942. The following year, the Royston bridge was operated 856 times to allow boats to pass. Mottram Wood colliery was flooded on 13 June 1945, when another leak occurred near the aqueduct, and in 1946, [...] of water escaped from the canal on 22 November, flooding a housing estate and the surrounding countryside. The Aire and Calder applied to abandon the canal in May 1947, and although the fledgeling Inland Waterways Association campaigned for its retention, the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive (DIWE) expressed [...] "grave doubts as to whether {{it would be in the}} national interest to reinstate the waterway." [...] The DIWE then offered compensation to carriers who were affected by the closure, and the abandonment order was finally granted in 1953. The aqueduct was demolished immediately, as it was deemed to be unsafe.|$|E

40|$|For Use Indoors vs. Outdoors- If {{the lift}} {{will be used}} indoors, you will {{probably}} want an <b>electric</b> forklift. <b>Electric</b> <b>lifts</b> produce no harmful emissions and are quieter. Outdoors, you will generally want an internal combustion (IC) forklift. Whether gas or diesel, these machines are less expensive than <b>electric</b> <b>lifts</b> with a similar capacity. They're also waterproof, unlike electric models. For use on uneven ground, rough terrain forklifts use large pneumatic tires and an extendable lifting arm. If you're going back and forth, or using the lift in a semi-enclosed area like a loading dock, a liquid propane (LPG) forklift {{might be the best}} choice. They produce less exhaust than other types of IC lifts, so they can be used indoors, but can also operate safely outdoors. If for indoor warehouse use- There are many specialized types of forklifts designed for the crowded conditions inside warehouses. These machines are all electric powered. � Walkies and riders are simply motorized pallet jacks. They are great for moving palletized loads around a warehouse, but don't provide {{much in the way of}} safety or lifting heights. These are the least expensive type of lifts...|$|R

50|$|Models 73, 106, 126, 107, 127, and 147, {{the last}} {{generation}} of Cub Cadets to utilize the narrow frame, composed {{the next generation of}} Cub Cadets. The model 73 still contained the seven horsepower Kohler engine, three speed direct drive transmission, pan seat, and optional round fenders. The Cub Cadet 106, which replaced the model 104, had a ten-horsepower Kohler engine and three speed transmission, while the model 126 which replaced the model 124, had a twelve-horsepower Kohler engine and a three speed direct drive transmission. The ten horsepower model 107 and the twelve horsepower model 127 were hydrostatic units which replaced the models 105 and 125. The model 147 was unique {{because it was the first}} model of Cub Cadet to utilize a fourteen-horsepower Kohler engine. The flywheel on this engine was so large, International had to widen the frame next to the flywheel so the engine would fit between the rails. The model 147 was also unique because it was equipped with <b>electric</b> <b>lift.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>lift</b> used an electric motor to raise and lower implements with the movement of a switch. The most noteworthy style change in these Cub Cadet models were the wider square fenders. These are the same fenders that were standard on all the following Cub Cadet models International made and some of the early models MTD made. These models were produced from 1969 to 1971.|$|E
50|$|Built 1904-1905 beside Wiśniowa Avenue and Sudecka Street junction, {{the tower}} {{supplied}} {{water to the}} residents of the southern districts of Wrocław for many years. The tower is 63 meters high. It was equipped with an <b>electric</b> <b>lift</b> from the very beginning. From June 1906 the lift allowed people to reach an observation deck situated at a height of 42 meters (the ticket cost 10 pfennig), from which one could admire the vista of Wrocław, its surroundings and Mount Ślęża. Two years later a red flag used to be hung at the top to inform people about very good viewing of the Sudety Mountains on a given day.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is constructed of load-bearing brick walls with internal structural iron and a stucco façade. The façade is complex as {{the building was}} designed to reflect the wealth of its owners at the time through the free classical style incorporating elements of arched openings, pediments, pilasters, a Hellenistic frieze and a large Diocletian window. The indication of new Queen Anne Revival style {{is evident in the}} picturesque roofline with a pedimented parapet and bold flanking chimney stacks. As with many buildings at the time, the basement is hidden behind iron balustrading at the ground floor level. In 1926 an <b>electric</b> <b>lift</b> was installed adjacent to the original hydraulic lift.|$|E
500|$|As {{with many}} of the C's stations, it was {{originally}} built with a single central island platform serving two tracks in a single tunnel [...] an arrangement still seen at Clapham North and Clapham Common. Access to the platforms from street level was via three Euston Anderson <b>electric</b> <b>lifts</b> before the rebuilding of the station. When the C line was closed for tunnel reconstruction in the early 1920s to accommodate larger trains, the station façade was reclad with tiling and the lifts were replaced by new ones from Otis.|$|R
