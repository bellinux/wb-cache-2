40|$|Hydrogels possess several {{physical}} and chemical properties suitable for engineering cellular environments for biomedical applications. Despite recent advances in hydrogel systems for cell culture, it is still a significant challenge to independently control the mechanical and <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of hydrogels, both of which are well known to influence various cell behaviors when using hydrogels as 3 D cell culture systems. Controlling the crosslinking density of a hydrogel system to tune the mechanical properties inevitably affects their <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties,</b> as the crosslinking density and diffusion are often inversely correlated. In this study, a polymeric crosslinker is demonstrated that allows for the adjustment of the degree of substitution of reactive functional groups. By using this polymeric crosslinker, the rigidity of the resulting hydrogel is controlled in a wide range without changing the polymer concentration. Furthermore, their <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties,</b> as characterized by their swelling ratios, pore diameters, and drug release rates, are not significantly affected by the changes in the degree of substitution. 3 D cell studies using this hydrogel system successfully demonstrate the varying effects of mechanical properties on different cell types, whereas those in a conventional hydrogel system are more significantly influenced by changes in <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties...</b>|$|R

30|$|Since {{the first}} report on {{mesoporous}} silica fiber [32], most of the subsequent quiescent interfacial studies were focused on the fibers and their characteristics, e.g., pore orientation [33 – 35], formation kinetics [36, 37], and <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> [38 – 40]. Little attention was given to investigate the quiescent interfacial method itself and the physical chemistry involved in a comprehensive manner compared to the well-studied mixed and static systems. This technique is differentiated by the way silica precursor is administered and thus has unique features of reaction and morphological evolution. Besides, this technique can be utilized to overcome challenges associated with pore orientation in membrane synthesis. For example, we have extended the quiescent interfacial method to fabricate inorganic membranes with favorable pore orientation by a new approach called counter diffusion self-assembly [41, 42].|$|R

We use single-molecule imaging to visualize the movement of individual, fluorescently labeled PCNA molecules along stretched DNA. Measurements of <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> as a function of viscosity and protein size suggest that PCNA moves along DNA using two different sliding modes.

40|$|SummaryPatterning in the Drosophila embryo {{requires}} local activation {{and dynamics}} of proteins in the plasma membrane (PM). We used in vivo fluorescence imaging {{to characterize the}} organization and <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of the PM in the early embryonic syncytium. Before cellularization, the PM is polarized into discrete domains having epithelial-like characteristics. One domain resides above individual nuclei and has apical-like characteristics, while the other domain is lateral to nuclei and contains markers associated with basolateral membranes and junctions. Pulse-chase photoconversion experiments show that molecules can diffuse within each domain but do not exchange between PM regions above adjacent nuclei. Drug-induced F-actin depolymerization disrupted both the apicobasal-like polarity and the diffusion barriers within the syncytial PM. These events correlated with perturbations in the spatial pattern of dorsoventral Toll signaling. We propose that epithelial-like properties and an intact F-actin network compartmentalize the PM and shape morphogen gradients in the syncytial embryo...|$|R
40|$|Signaling {{from the}} {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor (EGFR) via phosphorylation on its C-terminal tyrosine residues requires self-association, which depends on the <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of the receptor and its density in the plasma membrane. Dimerization is a key event for EGFR activation, but the role of higher order clustering is unknown. We employed single particle tracking to relate the mobility and aggregation of EGFR to its signaling activity. EGFR mobility alternates between short-lived free, confined and immobile states. In the immobile state, EGFR tends to aggregate in clathrin-coated pits, which is further enhanced in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and does not require ligand binding. EGFR phosphorylation is further amplified by cross-phosphorylation in clathrin-coated pits. Because phosphorylated receptors can escape from the pits, local gradients of signaling active EGFR are formed. These results show that amplification of EGFR phosphorylation by receptor clustering in clathrin-coated pits supports signal activation at the plasma membrane...|$|R

The observed tracks were classified into three different states by machine learning and all found to be distributed homogeneously over the particle. Most probe molecules (88 %) were immobile, with the molecule most likely being physisorbed or trapped; the remainder was either mobile (8 %), with the molecule moving inside the macropores, or showed hybrid behavior (4 %).

Diffusion in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm was mainly measured as fast diffusional mobility. In contrast, diffusion in the nucleolus was complex and mainly much slower diffusional mobility, although both the fast and the slow diffusional mobilities were dependent on the protein length. Interestingly, we found that diffusion in the nucleolus was clearly changed by energy depletion, even though the diffusion in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm was not changed.

In the present communication, the electrochemical behaviour towards hydrogen evolution and CO and alcohol electrooxidation at different platinum-based catalysts has been studied using the new DEMS cell configuration.

30|$|We have {{investigated}} the MSF {{in a number of}} earlier publications and reported their microstructural [37] and <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> [38, 40]. In this work, part of these results will be presented as a reference to delineate effects of other variables. The growth starts with a thin amorphous layer at the interface of the two-phase mixture within 2  days of induction followed by slow growth of a white matrix of fibers attached to the thin amorphous layer in the water phase. Regular particulates also emerge along the fibers in the water bulk and precipitate {{at the bottom of the}} beaker (see Figure  1). We noticed that 10 to 14  days is a typical period for fiber growth over which the yield and pore order of fibers increase markedly with time. The long time is due to quiescent conditions where species has to interdiffuse slowly in absence of any bulk movement. TBOS species diffuse from the silica layer into the water phase; surfactant micelles also diffuse in the water bulk to interact with silica species in the interfacial region. Water and alcohol (resulting from the hydrolysis) diffuse as well and evaporate at the interface. This was reported to influence the growth in this method [42].|$|R

The aim was to preoperatively assess tumor growth {{in white matter}} tracts using quantitative MR tractography (3 T). The hypothesis was that suspected infiltrated tracts would have altered <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> in infiltrated tract segments compared to noninfiltrated tracts. Materials and Methods. Forty-eight patients with suspected low-grade glioma were included after written informed consent and underwent preoperative diffusion tensor imaging in this prospective review-board approved study. Major white matter tracts in both hemispheres were tracked, segmented, and visually assessed for tumor involvement in thirty-four patients with gliomas grade II or III (astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas) on postoperative neuropathological evaluation.

40|$|Steady-state {{fluorescence}} oxygen quenching {{experiments were}} performed on phospholipid vesicles where 2 -dimethylamino- 6 -lauroylnaphthalene (Laurdan) was inserted. The quenching efficiency {{was found to be}} much higher in vesicles in the liquid-crystalline phase with respect to the gel phase, by a factor of about 50. Since the oxygen solubility in the two phospholipid phases can differ at most by a factor of 4 based on literature values, we concluded that oxygen diffusion must be responsible for the great difference in the quenching efficiency. A relatively high quenching efficiency was also found in vesicles composed of equimolar gel and liquid-crystalline phospholipids. Simulations were performed using the linear superposition of the properties of the pure phases to demonstrate that, in the case of vesicles composed of coexisting phases, the <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of oxygen in each phase are largely modified by the presence of the other. The addition of 10 mol% cholesterol to the gel phase rendered Laurdan fluorescence approximately as quenchable as in the equimolar mixture of the two phases. This result points out that molecules such as cholesterol, which introduce packing defects in the bilayer, favor oxygen diffusion. From the oxygen quenching experiments and using the properties of generalized polarization, the rate of Laurdan dipolar relaxation can be estimated. © 1992 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a new method, using a nanopipette, for controlled voltage-driven delivery of individual fluorescently labeled probe molecules to the plasma membrane which we used for single-molecule fluorescence tracking (SMT). The advantages of the method are 1), application of the probe to predefined regions on the membrane; 2), release of only {{one or a few}} molecules onto the cell surface; 3), when combined with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, very low background due to unbound molecules; and 4), the ability to first optimize the experiment and then repeat it on the same cell. We validated the method by performing an SMT study of the diffusion of individual membrane glycoproteins labeled with Atto 647 -wheat germ agglutin in different surface domains of boar spermatozoa. We found little deviation from Brownian diffusion with a mean diffusion coefficient of 0. 79 ± 0. 04 μm 2 /s in the acrosomal region and 0. 10 ± 0. 02 μm 2 /s in the postacrosomal region; this difference probably reflects different membrane structures.

This shape selectivity may be improved by depositing an inert (e. g. silaceous) layer {{on the surface of}} the catalyst crystals, which inertises non-shape selective surface acid sites and increases diffusional transport resistances. This thesis presents an investigation, using the zero length column (ZLC) method, into changes in the <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of cyclohexane in ZSM- 5 that has had tetraethoxysilane deposited on the surface in the liquid phase. Theoretical analyses of the ZLC technique and its use in a detailed study of cyclohexane in unmodiﬁed ZSM- 5 were performed in order to prove the reliability of the technique and measure baseline behaviour of the selected system. The ZLC method is a chromatographic technique for the measurement of diffusion coefficients in porous sorbents. Originally developed for gaseous hydrocarbon / zeolite powder systems, it has been experimentally extended to the measurement of liquid sorbate systems, macroporous zeolite pellets and resins and the measurement of self-diffusion through tracer exchange. The technique is robust against the intrusion of external heat and mass transfer effects by the use of relatively high ﬂow rates and small catalyst samples, Analysis of the desorption curves is simple: the slope of the linear (on semilogarthmic axes) long time region gives the diffusional time constant.

As an example we report our studies on the intracellular mobility of the actin-binding protein CapG in live breast cancer cells. This Gelsolin-related protein is a putative oncogene. It appears to be overexpressed especially in metastasizing breast cancer. Furthermore, the CapG protein {{is known to be}} involved in the motility control of non-muscle benign cells. Its increased expression triggers an increase in cell motility of benign cells. Thus it can be expected that in cancer cells overexpressing the CapG protein, motility, invasiveness and metastasis might be particularly promoted. Since the nuclear CapG fraction seems to be pivotal to the increase in cell motility, we focused our studies on the CapG mobility in cell nuclei of live breast cancer cells.
