40|$|Objective: To identify, {{summarise}} and synthesise available {{literature on}} the effectiveness of <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> for optimising <b>implementation</b> of complex interventions in primary care. Design: Systematic review of reviews. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and PsychINFO were searched, from first publication until December 2013; the bibliographies of relevant articles were screened for additional reports. Eligibility: criteria for selecting studies Eligible reviews had to (1) examine effectiveness of single or multifaceted <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies,</b> (2) measure health professional practice or process outcomes and (3) include studies from predominantly primary care in developed countries. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full-text articles of potentially eligible reviews for inclusion. Data synthesis: Extracted data were synthesised using a narrative approach. Results: 91 reviews were included. The most commonly evaluated strategies were those targeted at the level of individual professionals, rather than those targeting organisations or context. These strategies (eg, audit and feedback, educational meetings, educational outreach, reminders) on their own demonstrated a small to modest improvement (2 – 9 %) in professional practice or behaviour with considerable variability in the observed effects. The effects of multifaceted strategies targeted at professionals were mixed and not necessarily more effective than single strategies alone. There was relatively little review evidence on <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> at the levels of organisation and wider context. Evidence on cost-effectiveness was limited and data on costs of different strategies were scarce and/or of low quality. Conclusions: There is a substantial literature on <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> aimed at changing professional practices or behaviour. It remains unclear which <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> {{are more likely to be}} effective than others and under what conditions. Future research should focus on identifying and assessing the effectiveness of strategies targeted at the wider context and organisational levels and examining the costs and cost-effectiveness of <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies.</b> PROSPERO: registration number CRD 42014009410. <br/...|$|R

In addition, it has been noted that there is a high failure rate in the <b>implementation</b> of <b>strategy</b> as a result of the existence of many potential barriers to the effective <b>implementation</b> of <b>strategy.</b> A lack of leadership – specifically strategic leadership – in the management structures of organisations has been identified as one of the possible barriers to the effective <b>implementation</b> of <b>strategy.</b> However, strategic leadership is also widely regarded as one of the key drivers of <b>strategy</b> <b>implementation.</b> In view of the fact that the role of strategic leadership in <b>strategy</b> <b>implementation</b> has been overlooked, the following research question was addressed: What is the perceived role of strategic leadership in the <b>implementation</b> of <b>strategy</b> in South African organisations?
