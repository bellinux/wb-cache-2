40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to confirm the presence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and determine its prevalence, based on skin test reactivity, in cattle reared under extensive farming conditions in the Govuro district, Inhambane province, Mozambique. The study was comprised of a primary screening test using the single intradermal test (SIT) in randomly selected animals from Colonato and Sede dip tanks in Govuro. Positive reactors to the SIT were tested again with bovine and avian tuberculin using the single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>test</b> (SICTT) 7 weeks after the SIT. The sample size was calculated using Win Episcope 2. 0 based on 95 % confidence to detect a 2 % expected prevalence using the SIT, with a 1 % accepted error and accounting for a total population size of 7208. The calculated sample size was 682 animals. To compensate for the probability of 20 % default in reading, the sample size was increased to 853. During the testing process (SIT), it was evident from the first 3 reading days that the apparent prevalence (61, 94 %) was higher than expected (2 %), hence we decided to stop when the total number of cattle was 530. During the testing process (SIT), it was evident from the first 3 reading days that the apparent prevalence (61. 94 %) was far higher than expected (2 %), hence we decided to stop when the total number of cattle was 530. This was due to the fact that, at such a high prevalence, it would not be necessary to achieve as high a precision as 1 % accepted error. A sample size of 530 would be sufficient to achieve a precision of 4 % accepted error, which was regarded as more than adequate. The 530 cattle, 3 or more years of age, were selected using systematic random sampling from the two dip tanks (Colonato 371 and Sede 159 animals). All animals were identified by numbers painted, dorsally on the sacral region. Out of 530 tested cattle by SIT, 268 were read, and 166 / 268 (61. 94 % with 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 55. 8 – 67. 8 %) were found positive, with visible swallow at the injection site. Apparent prevalence (AP) was found to be 61. 94 % while the true prevalence (TP) was 75. 92 %. The predictive value of a positive result (PV+) was found to be 87. 9 %. No significant difference in apparent prevalence between the two areas was detected by Fisher’s exact test (P = 0. 11). By SICTT, out of 28 animals positive reactors to SIT, 21 were possible to read, and 13 / 21 (61. 9 %; 95 % CI: 55. 1 – 89. 3 %) were found positive. A three year old bull, positive reactor to the SIT, was slaughtered, and a detailed post mortem was carried out and organs with visible lesions were collected for further laboratory testing (histopathology, culture and isolation of M. Bovis and PCR). Later on, 30 more positive reactors to the SIT test were slaughtered: 25 / 30 (83. 3 %) showed visible lesions compatible with BTB, and total condemnation of carcass was made in 3 / 25 (12 %) due to generalized lesions. The high prevalence rate of skin test positive animals as well as gross lesions and histopathology were confirmed to be BTB by the isolation and identification of M. Bovis by culture and PCR. Our results suggest that bovine tuberculosis is highly prevalent in Govuro district and may thus represent a potential health problem of zoonotic tuberculosis in humans. Our results suggest that BTB has reached the plateau phase of endemicity in cattle in Govuro district. In this context, the positive predictive value of the SIT is very high and thus the use of the SICTT as a confirmatory test has a limited value and should not be advocated. Our results further indicate that no other prevalence study of BTB should be conducted {{in the next few years}} in Govuro district, unless comprehensive control measures are implemented. The focus of further studies should be on the isolation and the molecular characterization of M. Bovis from cattle and humans in order to assess transmission routes and the role played by BTB in human TB cases in Govuro district.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTB) is {{a significant}} and intractable disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used ante-mortem {{diagnostic}} tests for tuberculosis in cattle are the tuberculin skin test and the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assay, both of which measure cell-mediated immune responses to Mycobacterium bovis infection. However, limitations {{in the performance of}} these tests results in a failure to identify all infected animals. In attempting to increase the range of diagnostic tests for tuberculosis, measurement of the cytokine IP- 10 in antigen-stimulated blood has previously been shown to improve the detection of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis infection, in humans and African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer), respectively. In the present study, 60 cattle were identified by the single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> tuberculin <b>test</b> as tuberculosis reactors (n = 24) or non-reactors (n = 36) and the release of IFN-γ and IP- 10 in antigen-stimulated whole blood from these animals was measured using bovine specific ELISAs.

40|$|Although {{there is}} a wide {{consensus}} on the efficacy of paratuberculosis vaccination to limit economic losses, its use has been restricted because of its interference in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Data from a vaccine clinical trial in the Basque Country (Spain) has been evaluated in relationship with bovine tuberculosis intradermal test results. The trial included two herds applying a Test and Culling strategy and five applying an inactivated vaccine. The vaccine was applied to animals of all ages present in each vaccinated herd when joining the trial, and then to all the replacers within their first three months of life. Yearly testing done with the <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> <b>test</b> (CIT) was applied to all animals older than 6 weeks. Between 2005 and 2011, the study generated 2, 033 records from Vaccinated Herds (VH) and 2, 252 from Test and Cull herds (TC). Pre-vaccination positive results rate was 2. 40 % among the 7 herds in the single bovine intradermal tuberculin test (BSIT). Two years later it rose to 20. 42 % in the VH and remained below at 0. 75 % in the TC. Applying the CIT reduced these rates to only 0. 58 % in the VH and to 0. 25 % in the TC ons.

40|$|International audienceConsiderable {{effort has}} been devoted to {{improving}} the existing diagnostic tests for bovine tuberculosis (single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> tuberculin <b>test</b> [SICTT] and γ-interferon assay [γ-IFN]) and to develop new tests. Previously, the diagnostic characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) have been estimated in populations with defined infection status. However, these approaches can be problematic as there may be few herds in Ireland where freedom from infection is guaranteed. We used latent class models to estimate the diagnostic characteristics of existing (SICTT and γ-IFN) and new (multiplex immunoassay [Enferplex-TB]) diagnostic tests under Irish field conditions where true disease status was unknown. The study population consisted of herds recruited in areas with no known TB problems (2, 197 animals) and herds experiencing a confirmed TB breakdown (2, 740 animals). A Bayesian model was developed, allowing for dependence between SICTT and γ-IFN, while assuming independence from the Enferplex-TB test. Different test interpretations were used for the analysis: SICTT (standard and severe interpretation), γ-IFN (a single interpretation), and a range of interpretations for the Enferplex-TB (level- 1 [high sensitivity interpretation] to level- 5 [high specificity interpretation]). The sensitivity and specificity (95 % posterior credibility intervals; 95 % PCI) of SICTT[standard] relative to Enferplex-TB[level- 1] and γ-IFN were 52. 9 - 60. 8 % and 99. 2 - 99. 8 %, respectively. Equivalent estimates for γ-IFN relative to Enferplex-TB[level- 1] and SICTT were 63. 1 - 70. 1 % and 86. 8 - 89. 4 %, respectively. Sensitivity of Enferplex-TB[level- 1] (95 % PCI: 64. 8 - 71. 9 %) was superior to the SICTT[standard], and specificity of the Enferplex-TB[level- 5] was superior to γ-IFN (95 % PCI: 99. 6 - 100. 0 %).

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundBovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is {{a disease}} of significant economic importance and is a persistent animal health problem with implications for public health worldwide. Control of bTB in the UK has relied on diagnosis through the single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> cervical <b>test</b> (SICCT). However, limitations in the sensitivity of this test hinder successful eradication and the control of bTB remains a major challenge. Genetic selection for cattle that are more resistant to bTB infection can assist in bTB control. The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct a quantitative genetic analysis of SICCT measurements collected during bTB herd testing. Genetic selection for bTB resistance will be partially informed by SICCT-based diagnosis; therefore it is important to know whether, in addition to increasing bTB resistance, this might also alter genetically the epidemiological characteristics of SICCT. ResultsOur main findings are that: (1) the SICCT test is robust at the genetic level, since its hierarchy and comparative nature provide substantial protection against random genetic changes that arise from genetic drift and from correlated responses among its components due to either natural or artificial selection; (2) the comparative nature of SICCT provides effective control for initial skin thickness and age-dependent differences; and (3) continuous variation in SICCT is only lowly heritable and has a weak correlation with SICCT positivity among healthy animals which was not significantly different from zero (P >  0. 05). These emerging results demonstrate that genetic selection for bTB resistance is unlikely to change the probability of correctly identifying non-infected animals, i. e. the test’s specificity, while reducing the overall number of cases. ConclusionsThis study cannot exclude all theoretical risks from selection on resistance to bTB infection but the role of SICCT in disease control is unlikely to be rapidly undermined, with any adverse correlated responses expected to be weak and slow, which allow them to be monitored and managed...|$|R

Because problems of supply or quality cannot be discounted, it is prudent that Ireland identify alternative supplier(s) {{as part of a}} broad risk management strategy. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the performance of a number of different tuberculin combinations (that is, pairings of bovine and avian PPD; with different manufacturers) in the single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> tuberculin <b>test</b> (SICTT), as currently performed in Ireland. The study was randomised, controlled and double-blinded. A total of 2, 172 cattle were used in the study. Each animal was tested using two SICTTs, the first based on the tuberculin combination in current use, and the second using one of six trial tuberculin combinations. Analyses were conducted to compare both reactor-status and skin increase. For each control/trial tuberculin combination, there was good agreement between the control and trial reactor-status. Differences in skin increases were mainly confined to animals categorised as either negative or severe inconclusive. However, the measured differences were minor, and unlikely to have a significant impact on the actual test outcome, either for individual animals or for herds. In conclusion, while further studies determining sensitivity and specificity in Ireland would have to be done in the event of a change in tuberculin PPD there should be minimal disruption of the national programme if alternative tuberculin PPDs meeting WHO, OIE and EU regulations were used. In this study, the precision of the guinea pig bio-assay to assess tuberculin potency was low and therefore Ireland should maintain its practice of periodically assessing potency in naturally infected cattle, even though this is not currently required under WHO, OIE or EU Regulations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in dairy cattle {{in the three}} major milk producing regions of Eritrea was assessed by subjecting 15, 354 dairy cattle, 50 % of Eritrea's dairy cattle population, to the single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> tuberculin <b>test</b> (SICTT). Skin test results were interpreted according to guidelines of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) with > 4 mm as cutoff in skin thickness increase. In addition, we studied the relation between 'physiological' variables related to pregnancy and lactation, and the variable 'region' on the probability to be skin test positive. RESULTS: The BTB prevalences at animal and herd levels were: 21. 5 % and 40. 9 % in Maekel, 7. 3 % and 10 % in Debub, and 0. 2 % and 1. 6 % in the Anseba region, respectively. Overall, in the regions included, prevalence was 11. 3 % (confidence interval (CI) 95 % CI, 11. 29 - 11. 31 %) and 17. 3 % (95 % CI, 17. 27 - 17. 33 %), at animal and herd level, respectively. Considering positive herds only, the animal BTB prevalence was 36. 8 %, 30. 1 %, and 1. 8 %, in Maekel, Debub and Anseba, respectively, and the overall animal prevalence within these herds was 32 %.

Prior to SICCT, 6 % of the herd tested seropositive for MAP using milk ELISA, with 8 % positive on serum. ID Screen Paratuberculosis Indirect Screening Test (ID Vet) was used to screen the herd. Within 14 days of PPD administration, a significant increase in the prevalence of seropositive cows was recorded. Identical prevalence’s were recorded with both test matrices (39 %). ELISA values remained significantly higher until day 43 post-SICCT in milk (P= 0. 850), and day 71 in serum (P= 0. 602). If the ‘new’ positives detected post-bTB testing are deemed false positives due to generation of cross-reacting antibodies by administration of PPD, milk would appear a more suitable sample for JD ELISA testing within two months of SICCT. In summary, sampling for JD utilising milk ELISA should be avoided in the 43 day period following PPD administration, with serum ELISA sampling avoided for an additional 28 days...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{supporting}} the strategic planning of the National Program for Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis, different Brazilian states have been conducting cross-sectional studies, coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply and with scientific support from the University of São Paulo and the University of Brasilia. In Santa Catarina, the State Animal Health Agency (CIDASC) conducted a study on bovine tuberculosis (TB) prevalence and assessment of risk factors in 2012. The state was divided into five regions and, in each region, independent sampling was performed in two steps: (i) cattle herds with reproductive activity were randomly selected; and (ii) in each herd, a sample of females aged 24 months or older underwent the <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> tuberculin <b>test.</b> A questionnaire was used {{to collect data on}} production characteristics and management practices that could be associated with the tuberculosis infection. Herd prevalence of bovine TB was 0. 50 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 074 – 0. 93 %) while the prevalence of TB in adult females was 0. 06 % (95 % CI: 0 – 0. 12 %). No significant difference in the prevalence of infected herds and of positive females was observed among the five regions. The logistic regression model revealed that herds with 19 or more females showed an odds ratio (OR) of 7. 68 (95 % CI: 1. 22 – 48. 39) compared to smaller herds, while dairy herds presented an OR of 10. 43 (95 % CI: 2. 00 – 54. 25) relative to beef or dual-purpose herds. The results suggest that dairy herds, in which animals are kept in partial or total confinement, and larger herds, which tend to acquire animals more often, are at a higher risk of bovine TB. Given the low prevalence and the type of higher-risk properties, a bovine TB surveillance system should be targeted at the state’s dairy basins, particularly the western region that accounts for the major industries and more intensive dairy farms...|$|R
40|$|Anobservational case–control {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate risk factors for confirmed bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infection in cattle reacting positively to the single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> cervical <b>test</b> (SICCT) in Northern Ireland in the years 1998, 2002 and 2006. Macroscopic lesions were detected at slaughter (positive visible lesion (VL) status) in 43. 0 % of reactor cattle, whilst 45. 3 % of those sampled were confirmed as bTB positive due to the presence of lesions or positive histopathology/mycobacterial culture (positive bTB status). In 97. 5 % of the reactors, the VL status and bTB status were either both negative or both positive. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were conducted on data of 24, 923 reactor cattle with the variables herd identifier, local veterinary office (DVO) and abattoir being used asrandomeffects within all the models generated at univariable and multivariable level. The other variables within the dataset were used as fixed effects. Significant risk factors associated with VL status and bTB status at multivariable level (p < 0. 05) included age at death, breed, sex, test year, net increase in skin thickness at bovine tuberculin injection site, epidemiological status of skin test, total number of reactors at the disclosure test, mean herd size and prior response to the skin test. These risk factors are likely related to the time since infection, the strength of the challenge of infection and the susceptibility of the animal. These findings are important as the detection of visible lesions and the confirmation of bTB {{are an integral part of}} the overall bTB control programme in Northern Ireland and the veterinary meat inspection and hygiene programme. The visible lesion status and bTB status of an animal can affect the way in which bTB breakdowns are managed, since failure to detect visible lesions and recovery of Mycobacterium bovis can lead to a less stringent follow-up after other risk factors have been taken into account.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTB) is endemic in African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) in some National Parks in Southern Africa, whilst {{no studies}} have been conducted on BTB on buffalo populations in Zambia. The increased demand for ecotourism and conservation of the African buffalo on private owned game ranches has prompted the Zambian Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) and private sector in Zambia to generate a herd of “BTB-free buffaloes” for ex situ conservation. In the present study, 86 African buffaloes from four different herds comprising a total of 530 animals were investigated for the presence of BTB for the purpose of generating “BTB free” buffalo for ex-situ conservation. Using the <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> tuberculin <b>test</b> (CIDT) the BTB status at both individual animal and herd level was estimated to be 0. 0 % by the CIDT technique. Compared to Avian reactors only, a prevalence of 5. 8 % was determined whilst for Bovine-only reactors a prevalence of 0. 0 % was determined.

40|$|AbstractThe African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is {{considered}} the most important maintenance host of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in wildlife in Southern Africa. The diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis infection in this species mostly relies on the single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> tuberculin <b>test</b> (SICTT). As an alternative, the BOVIGAM® 1 G, an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assay, is frequently used. The test performance of cell-mediated immunity (CMI-) and humoral immunity (HI-) based assays {{for the detection of}} M. bovis infections in buffaloes was compared to identify the test or test combination that provided the highest sensitivity in the study. Buffaloes were sampled during the annual BTB SICTT testing in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi-Park (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) during June 2013. A total of 35 animals were subjected to the SICTT, 13 of these tested positive and one showed an inconclusive reaction. CMI-based assays (BOVIGAM® 1 G (B 1 G) and BOVIGAM® 2 G (B 2 G)) as well as a serological assay (IDEXX TB ELISA) were used to further investigate and compare immune responsiveness. Thirteen SICTT positive buffaloes and one inconclusive reactor were slaughtered and a post-mortem (PM) examination was conducted to confirm BTB. Lesions characteristic of BTB were found in 8 / 14 animals (57. 1 %). Test results of individual assays were compared with serial and parallel test interpretation and the sensitivity was calculated as a percentage of test positives out of the number of SICTT positive animals with granulomatous lesions (relative sensitivity). The B 1 G assay showed the highest individual sensitivity (100 %; 8 / 8) followed by the B 2 G assay (75 %; 6 / 8) and the IDEXX TB ELISA (37. 5 %; 3 / 8). Therefore, using in parallel interpretation, any combination with the B 1 G showed a sensitivity of 100 % (8 / 8), whereas combinations with the B 2 G showed a 75 % sensitivity (6 / 8). Out of the 21 SICTT negative animals, 7 animals showed responsiveness in the B 2 G or IDEXX TB ELISA.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{transmission is}} strongly determined by who contacts whom. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is a worldwide burden for animal populations. One {{of the major}} transmission mechanism between herd is the transfer of infectious animal. In East Africa, pastoralists may receive or bestow livestock to create and strengthen social relationships. Here, we used a network approach to examine {{the relative importance of}} such cattle transfer in the transmission of bTB. First, a total of 2550 cattle from 102 herds were <b>tested</b> using the <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> tuberculin <b>test</b> to assess the presence of bTB infected cattle in the herd. A herd was considered bTB positive if it had at least one tuberculin reactor animal. Next, we calculated the centrality of each herd in the cattle transfer network using four established measures of social network centralization: degree, betweenness, closeness and fragmentation. The relationships between the network centrality measures and bTB infection were examined using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). We found that a herd's in-degree in the social network was positively correlated with the risk of being infected with bTB (b = 4. 2, 95 %CI = 2. 1 – 5. 7;...|$|R

We investigated a total of 106 herds of cattle for presence of BTB using the <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> tuberculin <b>test</b> (CITT) while an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to gather epidemiological data on herd structure, management and grazing strategies. BTB prevalence at herd level was estimated and possible risk factors were investigated using the multiple logistic regression model. The true herd level prevalence of BTB was estimated at 49. 8 % (95 % CI: 37. 9, 61. 7 %). The logistic regression model showed that cattle herd BTB status was highly associated with area and husbandry practices. When compared to Kazungula, cattle herds in Blue Lagoon {{were more likely to}} test positive for BTB when other factors such as management practices were controlled (OR = 10. 5). In terms of grazing strategies, transhumant herds (TH) had higher odds (OR = 3. 0) of being positive compared to sedentary herds (OR = 1. 0).
