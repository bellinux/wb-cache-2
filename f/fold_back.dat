25|$|The American coot (Fulica americana), {{also known}} as a mud hen, is a bird of the family Rallidae. Though {{commonly}} mistaken to be ducks, American coots belong to a distinct order.

Coots live near water, typically inhabiting wetlands and open water bodies in North America. Groups of coots are called covers or rafts. The oldest known coot lived to be 22 years old.|$|E
25|$|Icepick grip – aka the pakal grip. The knife {{is held in}} {{a hammer}} grip but with blade reversed. This grip is usually used in concert with an {{overhand}} and downward thrusting or stabbing stroke. While the icepick grip is frequently employed by untrained knife users (esp. persons of lesser strength {{in an attempt to}} increase thrusting force), it may also be used by a skilled knife fighter as part of a sophisticated system that includes footwork and body movements including parrying and deception defenses. The major risk with this grip is that the blade is facing the user and can potentially <b>fold</b> <b>back</b> into the arm.|$|E
25|$|The narrow carbody {{provides}} for a catwalk along each side between the cabs, with <b>fold</b> <b>back</b> body panels for maintenance access. The cab {{is similar to that}} of the contemporary G class, with an anti-climber beam to prevent upward movement should a collision occur. Twin high impact windscreens are provided, with dual blade wipers. Each cab has room for a two-person crew, as well as an instructor if required. Air conditioning is provided, as well as an air-operated retention toilet at one end accessible from the catwalk. The locos were initially provided with automatic staff exchange equipment, but this was removed in the 1990s when the use of Electric Staff ended. The space remains in the cab side today.|$|E

25|$|All viperids have {{a pair of}} {{relatively}} long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs {{that are used to}} inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is {{at the front of the}} mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs <b>fold</b> <b>back</b> against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, it will be more a stab than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Secondarily, it is used for self-defence, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve their precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, it takes time to replenish, leaving the snake vulnerable.|$|E

2500|$|Nucleic {{acid and}} protein NMR {{spectroscopy}} are similar but differences exist. [...] Nucleic acids have a smaller percentage of hydrogen atoms, {{which are the}} atoms usually observed in NMR spectroscopy, and because nucleic acid double helices are stiff and roughly linear, they do not <b>fold</b> <b>back</b> on themselves to give [...] "long-range" [...] correlations.H NMR Spectroscopy of DNA}} [...] The types of NMR usually done with nucleic acids are 1H or proton NMR, 13C NMR, 15N NMR, and 31P NMR. [...] Two-dimensional NMR methods are almost always used, such as correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and total coherence transfer spectroscopy (TOCSY) to detect through-bond nuclear couplings, and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) to detect couplings between nuclei that are {{close to each other}} in space.|$|E
2500|$|Parameters {{taken from}} the spectrum, mainly NOESY cross-peaks and {{coupling}} constants, {{can be used to}} determine local structural features such as glycosidic bond angles, dihedral angles (using the Karplus equation), and sugar pucker conformations. [...] For large-scale structure, these local parameters must be supplemented with other structural assumptions or models, because errors add up as the double helix is traversed, and unlike with proteins, the double helix does not have a compact interior and does not <b>fold</b> <b>back</b> upon itself. [...] NMR is also useful for investigating nonstandard geometries such as bent helices, non-Watson–Crick basepairing, and coaxial stacking. [...] It has been especially useful in probing the structure of natural RNA oligonucleotides, which tend to adopt complex conformations such as stem-loops and pseudoknots. [...] NMR is also useful for probing the binding of nucleic acid molecules to other molecules, such as proteins or drugs, by seeing which resonances are shifted upon binding of the other molecule.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1930s, when {{the use of}} the [...] "WM" [...] system was spreading, Rappan {{developed}} a tactical system under which players switched positions and duties depending on the game's pattern. The system varied largely from the classic 2-3-5 formation and the WM, focusing in defense. The team would <b>fold</b> <b>back</b> into its own half and wait for the opponent's attack, conceding possession of the midfield. The system received the name of verrou or [...] "bolt". It has also been called [...] "Swiss bolt". Reportedly, Rappan looked for a system that was less rigid and less dependent on individual talent than the WM. It relied on collective work, and gave the amateurs of the time a chance to compensate to some extent for their lack of skill. The defensive strategy of the bolt relied on a mixture of zonal and man-marking. It was the first system to play four players in defense, using one of them as a [...] "security bolt" [...] supporting the other three. It is acknowledged that the bolt largely influenced the catenaccio (Italian for bolt) and its use of the libero (sweeper) in defense.|$|E

60|$|On July 2, the ships, sailing on westward {{from the}} head of Prince Edward Island, came in sight of the New Brunswick coast. They had thus crossed Northumberland Strait, which {{separates}} the island from the mainland. Cartier, however, supposed this to be merely a deep bay, extending inland on his left, and named it the Bay of St Lunario. Before him on the northern horizon was another headland, and to the left the deep triangular bay known now as Miramichi. The shallowness of the water and the low sunken aspect of the shore led him to decide, rightly, that there was to be found here no passage to the west. It was his hope, of course, that at some point on his path the shore might <b>fold</b> <b>back</b> and disclose to him the westward passage to the fabled empires of the East. The deep opening of the Chaleur Bay, which extended on the left hand as the ships proceeded north, looked like such an opening. Hopes ran high, and Cartier named the projecting horn which marks the southern side of the mouth of the bay the Cape of Good Hope. Like Vasco da Gama, when he rounded South Africa, Cartier now thought that he had found the gateway of a new world. The cheery name has, however, vanished from the map in favour of the less striking one of Point Miscou.|$|E
