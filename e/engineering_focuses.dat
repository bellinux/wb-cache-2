25|$|Control <b>engineering</b> <b>focuses</b> on the {{modeling}} of a {{diverse range of}} dynamic systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner. To implement such controllers, electrical engineers may use electronic circuits, digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and programmable logic controls (PLCs). Control engineering has {{a wide range of}} applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles. It also {{plays an important role in}} industrial automation.|$|E
25|$|Telecommunications <b>engineering</b> <b>focuses</b> on the {{transmission}} of information across a channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; {{this is known as}} modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2000, RIT began admitting {{students}} {{in the top of}} their application pools into the RIT Honors Program. Each college participates voluntarily in the program and defines their own program details. As an example, the College of <b>Engineering</b> <b>focuses</b> on engineering in a global economy, and uses much of the honors budget to pay for domestic and international trips for engineering students. In contrast, the College of Science is focused on expanding research, and provides most of its budget to student research endeavors. Students admitted to the program are given a small scholarship and have the opportunity to live in the honors residence hall.|$|E
