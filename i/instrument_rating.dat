5|$|On April 4, 1955, a United Airlines check captain, Stanley C. Hoyt, age 45, was {{carrying}} out <b>instrument</b> <b>rating</b> checks {{on two of}} the airline's pilots. Hoyt had been employed by United Airlines since 1937, and had 9,763 flying hours experience, 549 of which were in a DC-6. He was training the two pilots, Henry M. Dozier, age 40, and Vernis H. Webb, age 35, so {{they would be able to}} retain an <b>instrument</b> <b>rating</b> qualification, allowing them to fly under instrument flight rules. The aircraft was a Douglas DC-6, registration N37512, serial number 43001. The airframe had flown 22,068 flying hours, and had undergone an inspection 105 hours before the accident. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt & Whitney R2800-CB16 engines, fitted with Hamilton Standard 43E60-317 propellers.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} {{operated}} {{for the purpose}} of maintaining the currency of the <b>instrument</b> <b>rating</b> of two of the airline's pilots. Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through , the plane began banking to the right. It continued to roll through 90degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground. All three members of the flight crew were killed upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Hornet {{conversion}} courses run for six months, {{after which}} graduates are posted {{to one of}} the RAAF's front-line fighter units, No.3 Squadron or No.77 Squadron at Williamtown, or No.75 Squadron at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. Students must first gain their <b>instrument</b> <b>rating</b> on the Hornet, and are then taught basic fighter manoeuvres, air combat techniques, air-to-air gunnery, and air-to-ground tactics. The course culminates with Exercise High Sierra, a biannual event that was first run at Townsville, Queensland, in 1986. The exercise lasts for two weeks and involves day and night flights, including precision strike sorties with practice and live bombs.|$|E

5000|$|You must be <b>instrument</b> <b>rated,</b> have an IFR flight plan, 2-way radios, and a Mode-C Transponder ...|$|R
25|$|This {{rating is}} an {{intermediate}} step between piloting privileges that allow only for VFR flying and an <b>instrument</b> <b>rating.</b> This rating {{is included in}} the privileges of an <b>instrument</b> <b>rating,</b> as well as the Commercial Licence.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirements}} for an <b>instrument</b> <b>rating</b> {{are the same}} for both a private pilot licenceaeroplane and a private pilot licencehelicopter.

25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that Kennedy fell victim to spatial disorientation while descending over water at night and consequently {{lost control of the}} aircraft. Kennedy did not hold an <b>instrument</b> <b>rating</b> and was therefore only certified to fly under visual flight rules. However, {{at the time of the}} accident the weather and light conditions were such that all basic landmarks were obscured, making visual flight challenging, although legally still permissible.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a Piper PA-28-180 {{built in}} 1964. The pilot and registered owner, former Oklahoma State Senator Olin Branstetter was a certified commercial pilot and was <b>instrument</b> <b>rated.</b>|$|R

25|$|The <b>{{instrument}}</b> <b>rating</b> {{allows a}} pilot {{to fly in}} instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), for example when cloud layers obscure the pilot's view of the ground. An instrument-rated pilot is able to fly and maintain situational awareness strictly by using instruments and avionics. This rating {{is one of the}} more complex ratings and is a major step toward earning more advanced licences such as an airline transport pilot licenceaeroplane. It can be added to any aeroplane or helicopter licence and is a requirement for the issue of an Airline Transport Pilot Licence - Aeroplanes.|$|E
25|$|After the 1939 races, LeVier got {{his first}} formal job, working as a {{mechanic}} for the Douglas Aircraft Company, hoping to get promoted to test pilot. However, frustrated by his chances with that company, he earned an <b>instrument</b> <b>rating</b> {{and went to work}} for Mid-Continent Airlines in Kansas City. Six months later, though, he left that job also, to work with General Motors testing engines for Cessna aircraft in Wichita. When a job opened for him at the Lockheed Corporation in Burbank, California, he left Wichita and returned to southern California.|$|E

40|$|Forecast targeting", forward-looking {{monetary}} policy that uses central-bank judgment to construct optimal policy {{projections of the}} target variables and the <b>instrument</b> <b>rate,</b> may perform substantially better than {{monetary policy}} that disregards judgment and follows a given instrument rule. This is demonstrated in a few examples for two empirical models of the U. S. economy, one forward looking and one backward looking. A complicated infinite-horizon central-bank projection model of the economy can be closely approximated by a simple finite system of linear equations, which is easily solved for the optimal policy projections. Optimal policy projections corresponding to the optimal policy under commitment in a timeless perspective can easily be constructed. The whole projection path of the <b>instrument</b> <b>rate</b> {{is more important than}} the current instrument setting. The resulting reduced-form reaction function for the current <b>instrument</b> <b>rate</b> is a very complex function of all inputs in the monetary-policy decision process, including the central bank’s judgment. It cannot be summarized as a simple reaction function such as a Taylor rule. Fortunately, it need not be made explicit. ...|$|R

25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with an <b>instrument</b> <b>rating,</b> {{made the}} news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E

The aircraft was a twin-engine Aero Commander 680 flown by a pilot who had a private-pilot license and a reported 8,000 hours of flying time, but who held no <b>instrument</b> <b>rating.</b> The aircraft was recovered on 31 May. After her husband died, Pamela Murphy [...] moved into a small apartment and got a clerk position at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles, where she remained employed for 35 years. In 1975, a court awarded Murphy's widow and two children $2.5 million in damages because of the accident.|$|E
40|$|As {{monetary}} policy decisions under inflation targeting {{are based on}} the projections of the target variables, a new measure of monetary shock is needed to solve the problems of bias and inconsistency in regression which try to explain the effects of {{monetary policy}} on activity and inflation. In this work I propose a new measure of monetary shock which control for the anticipatory components of the <b>instrument</b> <b>rate</b> using a simple monetary rule as the framework. The empirical work for the new measure is tested for Chile. The results obtained with the new measure indicate that the effects of monetary policy on activity and inflation are larger than those obtained with measures that do not control for the anticipatory component of the <b>instrument</b> <b>rate.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Good {{monetary}} policy is both simple and complicated. The principles for good {{monetary policy}} are simple: Perform flexible inflation targeting, which means aiming to stabilize inflation around an explicit low positive numerical inflation target with some weight also on stabilizing the output gap, that is, stabilizing output around {{a measure of}} potential output. Because of the lags between monetary-policy actions and the effect on inflation and output, {{the way to do}} this is to look forward and perform forecast targeting, that is, to set the central bank’s <b>instrument</b> <b>rate</b> such that the inflation and the output-gap forecasts “look good, ” which means that the inflation and output-gap forecasts approach the inflation target and zero, respectively, some 1 — 3 years ahead. The practice of constructing these forecasts and deciding on the appropriate <b>instrument</b> <b>rate</b> (or rather, instrument-rate plan) is quite complicated, though, and requires the collection and processing of vast amounts of data, thorough analysis, and skillful combination of judgment and model results. Since monetary policy works via the expectations of future instrumentrate settings rather than the current <b>instrument</b> <b>rate,</b> and since expectations of future inflation and output matter for the private sector’s current pricing and production decisions, monetary policy is to a large extent the management of expectations. Therefore, the transparency an...|$|R

Furthermore, progress {{can be made by}} incorporating central-bank judgment and model uncer-tainty in a systematic way in the forecasting and decision process. In particular, incorporating model uncertainty allows the central bank to do more general “distribution forecast targeting” rather than the more restrictive “mean forecast targeting ” under the assumption of approximate certainty equivalence...|$|R
