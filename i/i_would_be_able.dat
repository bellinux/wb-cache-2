500|$|O'Hara {{was offered}} roles in The Razor's Edge (1946), which went to Tierney, John Wayne's film Tycoon (1947), which went to Laraine Day, and Bob Hope's The Paleface, which went to Jane Russell. She {{turned down the}} role in The Paleface as she {{was going through a}} {{turbulent}} period in her personal life and [...] "didn't think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to laugh every day and have fun". She later deeply regretted turning it down and confessed that she'd made a [...] "terrible mistake". In 1947, O'Hara starred opposite Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Shireen in the adventure film Sinbad the Sailor. O'Hara plays a glamorous adventuress who assists Sinbad (Fairbanks) locate the hidden treasure of Alexander the Great. She found the scenario to be [...] "ridiculous", but stated that it made a [...] "pot of money for RKO– action-adventures almost always did". Malone wrote: [...] "O'Hara looks splendid and gets to wear some of the most stunning costumes of her career—a different one in almost every scene—but her dialogue is floridly empty.

[...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

2500|$|Unable to come {{to terms}} with the Rangers, Shanahan sat out the first half of the 2008–09 season. Then, on January 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Shanahan agreed to join the New Jersey Devils for his second stint with the team. Four days later, on January 14, the terms of the contract were finalized and Shanahan signed a one-year, $800,000 prorated contract. The time between Shanahan's departure from and return to the Devils was 17 years, 294 days, the longest gap in tenure with one team in NHL history. Playing in his first game back with the Devils since 1990–91, he scored the first goal of the game against the Nashville Predators on a 5-on-3 power play by toe dragging the puck around the opposition player and then shooting it on the pad side on January 19 in a 3–1 win. On August 5, 2009, Shanahan agreed to a one-year deal with the Devils returning for a 22nd season, to play during the 2009–10 season. This would have been Shanahan's sixth season as a Devil. However, on October 1, 2009, the Devils and Shanahan parted ways, with Shanahan saying, [...] "When I signed this past summer, Lou Lamoriello, Jacques Lemaire and I agreed that if we were unable to find a suitable fit in which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to compete and contribute at the level I expect from myself, then I would simply step aside."

2500|$|During {{his summer}} {{vacation}} at the Homestead in 1874, Alexander Graham continued to contemplate electrical sound reproduction while viewing the undulating {{surface of the}} Grand River from his [...] "dreaming place". He postulated that [...] "it {{would be possible to}} transmit sounds of any sort" [...] by the continuous variation of the intensity of the electric current. [...] This method of sound energy to electrical signal transduction was fundamentally different from the on-or-off transmission methods used by other telephone experimenters. [...] Alexander Graham held lengthy discussions with his father explaining what he thought he could achieve with a sound-driven transmitter producing an electrical signal which would instantaneously travel an electrical circuit to a receiver at another location where it would be converted back to sound. His record of a discussion with his father in their home's living room, wrote [...] "If I could vary the intensity of the electric current in exact proportion to the variation of the air density in the production of words, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to transmit speech by telegraph" [...] (using the telephone's technical analog, the telegraph, as the former name had not yet been adapted). On 26 July 1874 in their living room the younger Bell realized the technical principles of telephony, inventing the telecommunications device he is now closely identified with. Returning again to the Homestead the next summer in 1875 Bell wrote his first draft specifications of the telephone patent—commonly considered to be the most valuable patent in history—that September. He later built his first fully functional unit at Boston on 10 March 1876. Later that year, in August, Bell made the first successful voice transmission of any notable distance, between Brantford and Paris Ontario.|$|E
2500|$|He aroused much {{controversy}} by his {{series of three}} pictures: firstly, of a Roman execution (the Crucifixion by the Romans (1887)); secondly, [...] "Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English" [...] depicting sepoys being blown from cannons; and, thirdly, of the execution of Nihilists in St Petersburg. His picture Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English depicted executions carried out by tying victims to the barrels of guns. Vereshchagin's detractors argued that such executions had only occurred in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but the painting depicted modern soldiers of the 1880s, implying that the practice was then current. Because of its photographic style, the painting appeared to present itself as an impartial record of a real event. In the Magazine of Art in December 1887, Vereshchagin defended himself by saying {{that if there were}} another rebellion then the British would use this method again.By the late 19th century, Vereshchagin had gained popularity, not only in Russia, but also abroad and his name never left the pages of the European and American press. From his earliest works, unlike most contemporary battle pieces depicting war as a kind of parade, Vereshchagin graphically depicted the horrors of war. [...] "I loved the sun all my life, and wanted to paint sunshine. When I happened to see warfare and say what I thought about it, I rejoiced that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to devote myself to the sun once again. But the fury of war continued to pursue me," [...] Vereshchagin wrote. One day, in 1882, Vereshchagin’s exhibition in Berlin was visited by German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. Vereshchagin brought Moltke to his painting The Apotheosis of War. The picture evoked a sort of confusion in the Field Marshal. After his visit to the exhibition, Moltke issued an order forbidding German soldiers to visit it. The Austrian war minister did the same. He also declined the artist's offer to let Austrian officers see his pictures free of charge at the 1881 exhibition in Vienna.|$|E

2500|$|Women in Arab {{societies}} experience discrimination {{from the}} western world based upon many misconceptions {{and a lack of}} knowledge about the realities of their lives. As described previously, the themes of invisibility, lacking accurate representation in media that {{other parts of the world}} absorb, and conflation of identities, be it Arab/Muslim, anti-Zionist/anti-Semite, etc. The conflict occurring Israel and Palestine is a prime example of how these misconceptions create an incorrect understanding of the circumstances and experiences that women in this area encounter in their daily lives. In the article “Arabiya Made Invisible” [...] by Noura Erakat, Ms. Erakat illustrates how the concepts of anti-zionism and antisemitism are conflated to vilify and silence Arab women who support Palestine or denounce the occupation. She says,“The equation of anti-Semitism to anti-Zionism is systematically used as a silencing tactic. Anti-Semitism refers to the historic oppression and vilification of Jews that led to such tragedies as the Nazi-engineered Holocaust. Zionism is the theoretical notion that global Jewry should have a homeland, and in its practical application, Zionism has meant the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.”Erakat goes on to discuss one protest that was hosted by a group of women of color at the Boalt Law School at UC Berkeley, a silent vigil protesting the occupation of Palestine, Iraq, and Haiti. A Jewish student wrote an op-ed for the school paper complaining that people should not be protesting Israel because Israel is accepting of homosexuals and gives women equal rights. She pointed out that it was ironic that women and gay men were at this vigil, while the places they were showing support of do not respect their rights as much as Israel does. At this point, Erkat gets to the meat of her argument. She says, “This student asserts that misogyny and gender inequality are inherent to Arabs in general and Palestinians in particular. According to her, “the Israeli occupation has nothing to do with Arab oppression of women and gays.” She fails to consider that structural violence waged on women in the context of war and occupation is the most extreme of its form. Moreover, she swiftly disregards the nexus of colonial occupation and patriarchy....when a nationalist movement becomes militarized [...] [...] [...] male privilege in the community usually becomes more entrenched...”The denial of the reality that the occupation and the threat it poses to women and gender equality in this opinion shows a prime example of how the incorrect characterization of Arab women can lead to further misconceptions and false justifications for situations of oppression. In a critique of Erakat's Students for Justice in Palestine group, a fellow student claims to be concerned as to whether his Palestinian peers at Berkeley would be comfortable exercising the freedoms they enjoy in Berkeley on the streets of Ramallah or Jerico. Erakat illustrates how this critique uses false concern to invalidate the real concerns that Palestinians living outside the occupied territories hold for their homeland, despite their differences in living situations and freedoms. She writes in response, “whereas the author wonders whether <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to comfortably walk around in tight jeans in Palestine, I wonder, if this man is truly concerned with my personal freedom, then why isn’t he protesting the twenty-five-foot Apartheid Wall built between my village of Abu-Dis and Jerusalem? If he really cares whether I can read Lolita comfortably, then shouldn’t he be more concerned that Palestinian children are denied a roof over their heads because of consistent home demolitions? His concern with my personal liberation seems disingenuous in light of the fact that he fails to mention Israeli military occupation as a significant, if not the most significant, factor contributing to the subjugation of Palestinian women’s rights. Instead, he uses the lack of gender equality in Palestine as a justification for its continued colonization.” ...|$|E
