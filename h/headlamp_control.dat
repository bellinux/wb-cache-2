5000|$|In 1991, a [...] 4.9-liter V8—the {{largest of}} this type—became the new {{standard}} powerplant. Also new was a grille of an inverted trapezoid design (almost upside-down from last years egg-crate keystone design), and revised bumper and body-side moldings. The new grille held the familiar shape of the Cadillac crest itself—a styling cue that continues to this day. The grille was now attached to the forward edge of the hood, and lifted up along with the hood when raised (similar to Mercedes-Benz). The secondary hood release latch {{was at the bottom}} of the grille instead of its previous location above the passenger side headlight. In addition to the new engine and minor front-end restyling, several previously optional features became standard this year, including the anti-lock braking system, accent striping, automatic door locks, twilight sentinel <b>headlamp</b> <b>control,</b> electrochromic inside rear-view mirror, and electric rear window and side mirror defogger. New standard features included rear-seat air conditioning vents, central door unlocking from the driver's door and luggage compartment, sun visors with shaded slide-out extensions, rear window lock-out switch, brake / transmission interlock safety switch, and an oil life indicator through the fuel data center. Other new features included the available remote keyless entry system, and the optional illuminated mirrors now featured a slide switch that offered variable intensity lighting. The first [...] "Deville Touring Sedan" [...] became available to the public on April 1, 1991. As a limited edition of only 1,500 produced for the 1991 model year, it was offered in 5 monochromatic paint schemes: Carmine Red; Cotillion White; Black; Dark Slate Gray metallic; and Black Sapphire Metallic. Larger 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] forged aluminum wheels with a wreath and crest center cap were fitted to P215/60R16 Goodyear GA all-season radial tires. A quicker 17:1 steering gear was also used. The specific Beechwood-color interior of the DeVille Touring Sedan had leather seating areas and revised seat design with integral lumbar support. Both driver and passenger seat featured six-way power seat adjusters and power recliners. This specific interior also featured American Walnut wood accents on the doors and instrument panel. A grill-mounted wreath and crest replaced the traditional stand-up hood ornament. Side door moldings feature [...] "TOURING SEDAN" [...] lettering and import style break-away outside rearview mirrors were painted body color. Revised sport door handles also are painted body color. The revised exterior also included a cloisonne deck lid lock cover similar to the STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe. Approximately 75 of these 1991 models remain roadworthy as of December 31, 2014.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) {{has been}} widely {{concerned}} {{in the area of}} traffic safety. Firstly, it's an analysis of research achievements about control method and mathematics model of AFS, and the question is focused on the lag of <b>headlamp</b> <b>control</b> system, which means the actual bending angle of AFS always lags behind the steering-wheel angle. Then, a study of how to solve this lag has been proceeded. After the geometrical relations among safety braking distance and the rate of steering-wheel angle and turning radius of the vehicle is analyzed, an mathematics model considered these variables has been set up. In order to improve the road illumination of the bending beginning stage, a preview control method and the control algorithm of preview model, rolling optimization and feedback correction have been set up. Based on this preview control algorithm, a simulation model of the whole AFS has been built as well as the AFS control experiment platform. After a comparison between preview control and servo control, it can be discovered that preview control method is superior to servo control in AFS system. Introduction： Now the AFS <b>headlamp</b> <b>control</b> systems in most articles are servo control systems which mainly use signal of the steering-wheel angle that is obtained in real time and signal of speed to calculate th...|$|E

40|$|The project {{proposed}} {{a prototype of}} an adaptive car <b>headlamps</b> <b>control</b> using image processing. The adaptive headlamps system focuses on the lighting angle control of low beam in the headlamps which its light tracks moved horizontally. The controller in headlamps is based on image processing from a camera mounted on the car. Adaptive headlamps system consists of portable tiny computer of Raspberry Pi, Arduino microcontroller, and two stepper motors for {{the left and the}} right headlamps. The system was implemented on the headlamps of a Toyota Avanza car. The adaptive headlamps system could detect most types of cars ahead. It could decrease a ‘glare’ effect and increase the driver sight based on survey taken from the driver and the driver of opposite car. The system still couldn’t detect the opposite car with high intensity of light from braking lamps, as well as the light from the opposite front lamps...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} vehicle light {{detection}} method using a hyperspectral camera {{instead of a}} Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) camera for adaptive car <b>headlamp</b> <b>control.</b> To apply Intelligent Headlight Control (IHC), the vehicle headlights need to be detected. Headlights are comprised {{from a variety of}} lighting sources, such as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), High-intensity discharge (HID), and halogen lamps. In addition, rear lamps are made of LED and halogen lamp. This paper refers to the recent research in IHC. Some problems exist in the detection of headlights, such as erroneous detection of street lights or sign lights and the reflection plate of ego-car from CCD or CMOS images. To solve these problems, this study uses hyperspectral images because they have hundreds of bands and provide more information than a CCD or CMOS camera. Recent methods to detect headlights used the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM), and Euclidean Distance Mapper (EDM). The experimental results highlight the feasibility of the proposed method in three types of lights (LED, HID, and halogen) ...|$|E

In 1989, for the 10th {{anniversary of}} the G Model, a new model variant with {{permanent}} 4-wheel drive, a wood-trimmed interior and optional Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) debuted at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. Production began the following April. For 1992, a new sub-series for professional users began production. The civilian model began to offer cruise control, a stainless-steel spare-tire cover, running boards and Burl Walnut wood interior trim. The same year, the 100,000th G Model was built in Graz. In 1994, the model line was officially renamed the G-Class. Ventilated front disc brakes and a driver’s air bag became standard. In 1996 the automatic transmission became an electronically <b>controlled</b> 5-speed unit. <b>Headlamp</b> washers, cruise <b>control</b> and a front passenger’s air bag were added. In 1998, the range-topping G 500 with a 296 hp V 8 was introduced for series production.|$|R
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector <b>headlamps.</b> The <b>control</b> panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|R
2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual <b>headlamp</b> leveling system, <b>controlled</b> by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|R
