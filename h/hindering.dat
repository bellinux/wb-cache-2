5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem {{generally}} to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or <b>hindering</b> them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.|$|E

Matthias concluded a treaty with the Swiss Confederacy on 26 March 1479, <b>hindering</b> the recruitment of Swiss mercenaries by the Emperor. He also entered into an alliance with Archbishop of Salzburg Bernhard II of Rohr, who allowed him to take possession of the fortresses of the Archbishopric in Carinthia, Carniola and Styria.|$|E

5|$|Operation Pig Bristle was {{an unusual}} {{transport}} task conducted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in May 1946.

No. 38 Squadron of the RAAF was given the task of transporting 25 tonnes of pig bristles from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong, from where the bristles were shipped to Australia.

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the game, players often occupy the space their opponent(s) want(s) to occupy. This may result in a player {{blocking}} his opponent's ability to play the ball. Such occurrences are termed either <b>hinders</b> or penalty <b>hinders.</b> A <b>hinder</b> is a replay of the current rally (the server resumes play at the first serve), while a penalty <b>hinder</b> results in the player who caused the avoidable obstruction to lose the rally. A type of <b>hinder</b> is a screen in which the player is unable to see the ball prior to it passing the opponent.|$|R

5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for <b>hindering</b> the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are <b>hindering</b> her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E
5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly <b>hindering</b> fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the battle the ROK III Corps was located to the east of the US 24th Infantry Division of the US IX Corps, defending the 38th parallel to the north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon. Composed of four divisions, the ROK III Corps placed its ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank at the hills north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The cold winter created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the heavy snow <b>hindering</b> construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition supplies.

5|$|By late 1958, Davis {{employed}} one of {{the most}} acclaimed and profitable working bands pursuing the hard bop style. His personnel had become stable: alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Bill Evans, long-serving bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. His band played a mixture of pop standards and bebop originals by Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and Tadd Dameron. As with all bebop-based jazz, Davis's groups improvised on the chord changes of a given song. Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, and saw its increasingly complex chord changes as <b>hindering</b> creativity.|$|E
5|$|Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo {{accelerated}} {{toward the}} waters of the North Atlantic, passing close to southeastern Newfoundland before becoming extratropical on October 19. Gusty winds and bands of heavy rain in the southeastern Avalon Peninsula engendered minor flooding and power outages. A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the British Isles and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely <b>hindering</b> transportation. The system later played a role in triggering torrential rains over the Balkans, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E

40|$|Advanced 1 -D {{models for}} Secondary Settling Tanks (SSTs) {{explicitly}} account for several phenomena {{that influence the}} settling process (such as <b>hindered</b> settling and compression settling). For each of these phenomena a valid mathematical expression needs to be selected and its parameters calibrated to obtain a model {{that can be used}} for operation and control. This is, however, a challenging task as these phenomena may occur simultaneously. Therefore, the presented work evaluates several available expressions for <b>hindered</b> settling based on long-term batch settling data. Specific attention is paid to the behaviour of these <b>hindered</b> settling functions in the compression region in order to evaluate how the modelling of sludge compression is influenced by the choice of a certain <b>hindered</b> settling function. The analysis shows that the exponential <b>hindered</b> settling forms, which are most commonly used in traditional SST models, not only account for <b>hindered</b> settling but partly lump other phenomena (compression) as well. This makes them unsuitable for advanced 1 -D models that explicitly include each phenomenon in a modular way. A power-law function is shown to be more appropriate to describe the <b>hindered</b> settling velocity in advanced 1 -D SST models...|$|R

In the period {{leading up to the}} vote, campaigning for Bảo Đại was banned, while Diệm's election campaign focused on personal attacks against Bảo Đại. These included pornographic cartoons of the head of state and unverified rumours claiming he was illegitimate and linking him to various mistresses. The government-controlled media launched polemical attacks on Bảo Đại, and police went door-to-door, warning people of the consequences of failing to vote.

5|$|Located {{south of}} a mid-level ridge and the {{continuing}} gap wind event, the nascent depression moved slowly west-southwest on October20. Initial environmental conditions were modestly favorable, allowing for steady intensification. The depression achieved tropical storm status by 00:00UTC on October21; the National Hurricane Center (NHC) assigned it the name Patricia accordingly. Throughout much of October21, Patricia moved through a region of drier, more stable air and over relatively cool sea surface temperatures. Both of these factors served to delay intensification of the cyclone. The system unraveled substantially, with banding features dissipating and the low-level circulation becoming poorly defined. Once clear of the <b>hindering</b> factors, convection blossomed over Patricia late on October21 and a central dense overcast formed over the center. Simultaneously, the storm accelerated west-northwest.|$|E
