2500|$|Camarine {{was a dark}} {{chestnut}} mare with a white blaze {{and four}} white socks bred near Brandon in Suffolk by Robert Wilson, 9th Baron Berners. She was sired by Wilson's horse Juniper, a [...] "useful" [...] stallion, {{best known as the}} damsire of Velocipede although he may have been the sire of the 1000 Guineas winner Catgut. Camarine came from Juniper's last crop of foals and was said to bear a striking resemblance to her sire. In early 1831, Camarine entered the ownership of Sir Mark Wood, 2nd Baronet, whose other good horses included Lucetta (Ascot Gold Cup) and <b>Galantine</b> (1000 Guineas).|$|E

60|$|To Westover, who {{had gone}} with the {{increasing}} forlornness a man feels in such pleasures after thirty-five, {{it seemed as if}} the two were in each other's company the whole evening. The impression was so strong with him that when Jeff restored Bessie to her aunt for the dance that was to be for some one else, and came back to the supper-room, the painter tried to satisfy a certain uneasiness by making talk with him. But Jeff would not talk; he got away with a bottle of champagne, which he had captured, and a plate heaped with croquettes and pease, and <b>galantine</b> and salad. There were no ladies left in the room by that time, and few young men; but the oldsters crowded the place, with their bald heads devoutly bowed over their victual, or their frosty mustaches bathed in their drink, singly or in groups; the noise of their talk and laughter mixed with the sound of their eating and drinking, and the clash of the knives and dishes. Over their stooped shoulders and past their rounded stomachs Westover saw Alan Lynde vaguely making his way with a glass in his hand, and looking vaguely about for wine; he saw Jeff catch his wandering eye, and make offer of his bottle, and then saw Lynde, after a moment of haughty pause, unbend and accept it. His thin face was flushed, and his hair tossed over his forehead, but Jeff seemed not to take note of that. He laughed boisterously at something Lynde said, and kept filling his glass for him. His own color remained clear and cool. It was as if his powerful physique absorbed the wine before it could reach his brain.|$|E

5000|$|The French {{word for}} a person who prepares charcuterie is charcutier, {{generally}} translated into English as [...] "pork butcher". This {{has led to the}} mistaken belief that charcuterie can only involve pork. The Food Lover's Companion, however, says, [...] "it refers to the products, particularly (but not limited to) pork specialties such as pâtés, rillettes, <b>galantines,</b> crépinettes, etc., which are made and sold in a delicatessen-style shop, also called a charcuterie." [...] The 1961 edition of Larousse Gastronomique defines it as: [...] "The art of preparing various meats, in particular pork, in order to present them in the most diverse ways." ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>galantine</b> is {{prepared}} by skinning and boning a chicken or other poultry. The skin is laid flat, with the pounded breast laid on top.

5000|$|On {{her first}} {{appearance}} as a three-year-old, Mark Wood's filly, now officially named <b>Galantine,</b> {{was one of}} eight fillies to contest the 1000 Guineas on April 21. She started at odds of 10/1 whereas Oxygen was made the 2/5 favourite for the race over the Ditch Mile course. The race was run at an extremely slow pace before developing into a sprint over the final furlong. <b>Galantine,</b> ridden by Patrick Conolly, had been among the leaders from the start, and held on to win by a neck from Mr Scott Stonehewer's filly Lioness, with Oxygen unplaced. The Sporting Magazine criticised the [...] "stupid" [...] tactics of the jockeys and described <b>Galantine</b> as [...] "a paltry, scratching thing" [...] at least a stone inferior to Oxygen at her best. On the following day, <b>Galantine</b> was tried against colts in the Newmarket Stakes over the same course and distance and finished unplaced behind the 2000 Guineas winner Riddlesworth. At the next meeting on 5 May <b>Galantine</b> ran a match race against Captain Rous's colt Crutch over the Ditch Mile. Carrying five pounds less than her opponent, <b>Galantine</b> was favoured in the betting and won by a length [...] "with the greatest ease" [...] to claim a prize of 200 guineas. Attendance at this meeting was unusually poor {{as many of the}} leading Turf figures where involved in the ongoing general election.|$|E
50|$|Forcemeat is {{a mixture}} of ground, lean meat mixed with fat by either grinding, sieving, or puréeing the ingredients. The result may either be smooth or coarse, {{depending}} on the desired consistency of the final product. Forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in charcuterie; such items include quenelles, sausages, pâtés, terrines, roulades, and <b>galantines.</b> Forcemeats are usually produced from raw meat, except {{in the case of a}} gratin forcemeat. Meats commonly used in the production of forcemeats include pork, fish (pike, trout, or salmon), seafood, game meats (venison, boar, or rabbit), poultry, game birds, veal, and pork livers. Pork fatback is often used for the fat portion of a forcemeat as it has a somewhat neutral flavor.|$|R
5000|$|Charcuterie is {{the branch}} of cooking devoted to {{prepared}} meat products such as bacon, ham, sausage, terrines, <b>galantines,</b> pâtés, and confit, primarily from pork. Originally intended {{as a way to}} preserve meats before the advent of refrigeration, these preparations are prepared today for the flavours that are derived from the preservation processes. In 15th century France, local guilds regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city. The guilds that produced charcuterie were those of the charcutiers. The members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats, which varied, sometimes distinctively, from region to region. The only [...] "raw" [...] meat the charcutiers were allowed to sell was unrendered lard. The charcutier prepared numerous items, including pâtés, rillettes, sausages, bacon, trotters, and head cheese.|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} a grand {{entertainment}} at Gaunt House on one beautiful evening in June, and the next day's journals contained almost two columns {{of the names of}} the most closely printed nobility and gentry who had been honoured with invitations to the ball. Among the guests were Sir Francis and Lady Clavering and Miss Amory, for whom the indefatigable Major Pendennis had procured an invitation, and our two young friends Arthur and Harry. Each exerted himself, and danced a great deal with Miss Blanche. As for the worthy Major, he assumed the charge of Lady Clavering, and took care to introduce her to that department of the mansion where her ladyship specially distinguished herself, namely, the refreshment-room, where, amongst pictures of Titian and Giorgione, and regal portraits of Vandyke and Reynolds, and enormous salvers of gold and silver, and pyramids of large flowers, and constellations of wax candles--in a manner perfectly regardless of expense, in a word--a supper was going on all night. Of how many creams, jellies, salads, peaches, white soups, grapes, pates, <b>galantines,</b> cups of tea, champagne, and so forth, Lady Clavering partook, it does not become us to say. How much the Major suffered as he followed the honest woman about, calling to the solemn male attendants and lovely servant-maids, and administering to Lady Clavering's various wants with admirable patience, nobody knows;--he never confessed. He never allowed his agony to appear on his countenance in the least; but with a constant kindness brought plate after plate to the Begum.|$|R
50|$|<b>Galantine</b> (foaled 1828) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare who won {{the eighteenth}} running of the classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse in 1831. Running {{exclusively}} at Newmarket, the filly ran eleven times and won four races in a racing career which lasted from April 1830 until May 1831. After being beaten in both her races as a two-year-old, <b>Galantine</b> won a controversial race for the 1000 Guineas on her three-year-old debut, beating the odds-on favourite Oxygen. Although she was considered a lucky and sub-standard classic winner, <b>Galantine</b> {{went on to win}} three match races at {{before the end of the}} season. She was retired from racing after two unsuccessful runs in 1832.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galantine</b> was {{retired from}} racing {{to become a}} broodmare. In 1832 she was sold and {{exported}} to Germany.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galantine</b> {{remained}} in {{training as a}} four-year-old but failed to win. On 25 April at the Craven meeting she ran a second match against Titania, but on this occasion she was defeated by Lord Chesterfield'd filly. Two days later she finished unplaced behind Lord Lowther's filly Scuffle in an all-aged claiming race over the Ditch Mile. <b>Galantine</b> was withdrawn from a match against Lioness at the next Newmarket meeting and never raced again.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galantine</b> was a bay mare bred by Sir Mark Wood, 1st Baronet the Member of Parliament for Gatton {{and owned}} during her racing career {{by his son}} and {{successor}} Sir Mark Wood, 2nd Baronet. She was sired by Reveller, a Yorkshire champion whose wins included the St Leger Stakes in 1818 and many other long-distance races on Northern courses. <b>Galantine</b> was his only classic winner, but he sired Mark Wood's Ascot Gold Cup winner Lucetta as well as The Mummer (July Stakes) and Ascot (St. James's Palace Stakes).|$|E
50|$|After a {{break of}} almost five months, <b>Galantine</b> {{returned}} to {{action for the}} autumn meetings at Newmarket, where she was entered in six races. On 3 October she was made favourite for a £100 Sweepstakes, but was beaten by her only rival, a colt named Lochinvar. Two weeks later she earned £100 for her owner without having to compete when her opponent, a colt owned by Lord Jersey, was withdrawn from a scheduled match race. Four days later she won a £100 match against Lord Chesterfield's Titania over the Ditch Mile and then finished unplaced in a five furlong handicap race later the same afternoon. On 2 November <b>Galantine</b> won another match, this time beating Lord Orford's colt The Grand Duke over the Rowley Mile for a prize of £100. On {{the final day of}} the Newmarket season, <b>Galantine</b> collected a further £100 when Thomas Thornhill's colt Earwig was withdrawn from a match race over the four mile Beacon Course.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>galantine</b> is a French dish of de-boned stuffed meat, most {{commonly}} poultry or fish, that is poached and served cold, coated with aspic. Galantines are often stuffed with forcemeat, and pressed into a cylindrical shape. Since deboning poultry is {{thought of as}} difficult and time-consuming, this is a rather elaborate dish, which is often lavishly decorated, hence its name, connoting a presentation at table that is galant, or urbane and sophisticated. In the later nineteenth century the technique's origin was already attributed to the chef of the marquis de Brancas. (The preparation is not always luxurious: Evelyn Waugh in his novel Men at Arms mentions [...] "a kind of drab <b>galantine</b> which Guy seemed to remember, but without relish, from his school-days during the First World War".) ...|$|E
5000|$|Until 1913, {{there was}} no {{requirement}} for British racehorses to have official names and the filly who would become <b>Galantine</b> raced unnamed in 1830. In the early 19th century most horses began their careers {{at the age of}} three and there were relatively few races for two-year-olds. One of the most important events for juveniles was the Clearwell Stakes at the Newmarket Second October meeting, in which <b>Galantine</b> (officially Sir M. Wood's b. f. by Reveller, out of Snowdrop) made her first racecourse appearance. She started at odds of 10/1 and finished unplaced behind the favourite Oxygen. Three days later [...] "the Snowdrop filly" [...] ran in the meeting's other major two-year-old race, the Prendergast Stakes. She showed improved form, finishing third to the colt Zany, who had beaten Oxygen in the July Stakes.|$|E
50|$|Roulade {{is similar}} to a <b>galantine.</b> The two major {{differences}} are instead of rolling the poultry evenly for the ends of the breasts to meet, the bird is rolled into a pinwheel shape, and the roulade is cooled by chilling it after it has been removed from the poaching liquid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galantine</b> is a chilled {{poultry product}} created after the French Revolution by the chef to the Marquis de Brancas. The term galant connotes urbane sophistication. Other origins are suggested: the older French word for chicken géline or galine or the word gelatin. Sources suggest the {{spelling}} of gelatin {{transformed into the}} words galentyne, galyntyne, galandyne, and galendine.|$|E
50|$|Chaudfroid sauce, also spelled as chaud-froid sauce, is {{a culinary}} sauce {{that can be}} {{prepared}} using a reduction of boiled meat carcasses and other ingredients. Simpler preparations of the sauce omit the use of meat, and some use sauces such as espagnole, allemande or velouté as a base. Chaudfroid sauce is typically served cold, atop cold meats and cold meat-based dishes such as <b>galantine</b> and terrine.|$|E
50|$|In today's {{commercial}} kitchens a ballotine {{is often}} made {{from other parts}} of poultry like the leg meat, also today's ballotine may be made using many types of meat and not always poultry.

They are also served hot or cold, whereas a <b>galantine</b> will be served cold.|$|E
50|$|A drum heater - {{also called}} band heater, barrel heater, {{container}} heater or canister heater- {{is used to}} reduce viscosity of liquids and gels by heating in order to fill, pump or bottle the respective liquid or to prevent liquids from freezing inside the drum.

She recorded her first success in the £300 Anson Stakes, over five furlongs, winning comfortably by a length from the colts Bohemian and Morisco. At the Second October meeting, she started the 11/8 against twelve opponents in the Clearwell Stakes. Ridden by John Barham Day, Oxygen won the five furlong race impressively by two or three lengths from Lord Egremont's unnamed black filly. The unplaced runners included a filly sired by Reveller out of Snowdrop who was later named <b>Galantine.</b> According to one observer, the winner displayed [...] "an Eclipse-like superiority" [...] over the opposition. After her win in the Clearwell Stakes Oxygen was made favourite for the following year's Oaks ahead of the Yorkshire-trained Circassian, with the two fillies dominating the betting markets.|$|E

She {{did not have to}} compete, however, as the other eight horses entered for the race were withdrawn by their owners, leaving Oxygen to walk over the course to claim the prize money. Three days later in the 1000 Guineas Oxygen was made the favourite at 2/5, the same odds at which her mother Whizgig had started when winning the race nine years earlier. She failed to emulate her dam as she finished third (officially [...] "unplaced") behind the upset winner <b>Galantine</b> after an extremely slow early pace resulted in the race developing into sprint over the last furlong. The Sporting Magazine criticised the [...] "stupid" [...] tactics of the jockeys and described the winner as [...] "a paltry, scratching thing" [...] at least a stone inferior to Oxygen at her best.|$|E
50|$|Chaudfroid {{sauce is}} a culinary sauce or gravy {{that can be}} {{prepared}} as a meat-based sauce by boiling the carcasses or bones of game meats or other meats such as poultry with herbs and spices. Vegetables such as onion and carrot have also been used. After cooking, the reduced sauce mixture is strained and gelatin is then added to provide viscosity. Chaudfroid sauce is used for several meats and meat-based dishes that are served cold, including meats such as fish, poultry, rabbit, venison, partridge, pheasant, duck and hard-boiled eggs, in which the cold sauce is used to coat the cold meat. Chaudfroid sauce has also {{been used as a}} topping for cold <b>galantine,</b> terrine and sweetbread dishes. The sauce serves to add flavor to meats and dishes and to decorate them. Chaudfroid sauce can provide the appearance of smoothness to meats, and such dishes are sometimes garnished with parsley or watercress atop the sauce.|$|E

Title of diploma thesis: Iron-chelating {{activity}} of selected alkaloids I. (2012 - 2013) Iron belongs among the essential trace {{elements in the}} human body, where takes many important functions. Metabolic disorder of iron occurs as iron deficiency (anemia) or its abundance (hematochromatosis). Production of free radicals is induced while the level of iron is increased. This has been observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Abundance of iron is treated by chelating agents (f. e. deferoxamine). Treatment takes place by slow infusion which is time-consuming and expensive. These are reasons of looking for new substances administrated orally. Alkaloids are products of secondary metabolism of plants. Big doses are toxic for body. Some of their properties {{can be used for}} treatment in low concentration. This work focuses on chelation activity of certain isoquinoline alkaloids (allocryptopine, berberine, bulbocapnine, eschscholtzine, <b>galantine,</b> lykorine, californidine, protopine, sinoacutine, sculerine and stylopine).

40|$|The author {{gives the}} data {{available}} in the literature and her materials on the prevalence and degree of noncognitive neuropsychological disorders (NNPDs) in dyscirculatory encephalopathy (DE) with non-dementia cognitive impairments (CI) and in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with mild to moderate stage dementia. Memantine (akatinol) therapy-induced changes in NNPDs are shown. It is emphasized that the significance of NNPDs in the general disease picture is now underestimated; in this connection their adequate therapy is not performed. This may result in a rapider progression of CI and a more significant reduction in daily activities in the patient. The high prevalence and multisymptom pattern of NNPD are determined in both patients with DE and non-dementia CI and in those with AD and mild to moderate stage dementia.  The degree of NNPDs correlates with the severity of cognitive defect and the low quality of life. Akatinol is noted to be clinically efficacious in DE and moderate CI against not only CI, but also NNPDs. In AD, symptomatic antidementia drugs (<b>galantine,</b> memantine, or their combination) arrest NNPDs in the first 3 months of therapy. Combined therapy should be recognized as best.  The data {{available in the}} literature {{and the results of}} the authorХs studies show the need for further investigations of NNPDs in patients with CI in order to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of neurogeriatric diseases. </p...|$|E
