5|$|Plants {{containing}} phytoestrogens {{have been}} administered for centuries for gynaecological {{disorders such as}} fertility, menstrual, and menopausal problems. Among these plants are Pueraria mirifica, <b>kudzu,</b> angelica, fennel, and anise.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, <b>kudzu</b> and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} medicine, <b>kudzu</b> {{has been}} used as a remedy for alcoholism, hangover, measles, menopausal symptoms, diabetes mellitus, fever, common cold, and neck or eye pain. However, a 2007 study suggested that the use of the <b>kudzu</b> root is inappropriate as a hangover remedy due to increased acetaldehyde accumulation through mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition. <b>Kudzu</b> has no benefit for treating cancer and is specifically contraindicated in people with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kudzu</b> is {{believed}} to have originated in Japan, where the ecosystem (primarily the tendency of <b>kudzu</b> to experience above-ground die back over winter) kept the vine from becoming a nuisance, and it is thought to have been introduced to China and likely Korea.|$|E
25|$|For {{successful}} long-term {{control of}} <b>kudzu,</b> {{it is not}} necessary to destroy the underground system, which can be extremely large and deep. It is only necessary to use some method to kill or remove the <b>kudzu</b> root crown and all rooting runners. The root crown is a fibrous knob of tissue that sits on top of the roots. Crowns form from multiple vine nodes that root to the ground, and range from pea- to basketball-sized. The older the crowns, the deeper they tend to be found in the ground. Nodes and crowns are the source of all <b>kudzu</b> vines, and roots cannot produce vines. If any portion of a root crown remains after attempted removal, the <b>kudzu</b> plant may grow back.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, <b>kudzu</b> {{thrives in}} mountainous regions, {{ranging from the}} 44th {{parallel}} north (the island of Hokkaido) to the 30th parallel north (the island of Kuchinoshima) {{and many of the}} lowlands and the islands. In Korea, <b>kudzu</b> grows in areas where the temperature can drop to -30 degrees Celsius.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kudzu</b> {{also has}} {{potential}} {{as a source for}} biofuel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kudzu</b> {{contains}} isoflavones, including puerarin (about 60% of {{the total}} isoflavones), daidzein, daidzin (structurally related to genistein), mirificin, and salvianolic acid, among numerous others identified. In traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as gé gēn (gegen), <b>kudzu</b> {{is considered one of}} the 50 fundamental herbs thought to have therapeutic effects.|$|E
25|$|Prescribed burning is {{also used}} on old {{extensive}} infestations to remove vegetative cover and promote seed germination for removal or treatment. While fire is not {{an effective way to}} kill <b>kudzu,</b> equipment, such as a skid loader, can later remove crowns and thereby kill <b>kudzu</b> with minimal disturbance of soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{used to make a}} jelly that tastes similar to grape jelly. Roots, flowers, and leaves of <b>kudzu</b> show {{antioxidant}} activity that suggests food uses. Nearby bee colonies may forage on <b>kudzu</b> nectar during droughts as a last resort, producing a low-viscosity red or purple honey that tastes of grape jelly or bubblegum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kudzu</b> {{management}} {{is of great}} concern {{in the management of}} national parks in the southeast such as Vicksburg National Military Park, Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. In Vicksburg, <b>kudzu</b> has invaded 190 of the 2,000 total acres of the park and threatens to diminish the historical value of the park.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects may}} occur if <b>kudzu</b> is taken {{by people with}} hormonal-sensitive cancer, or those taking tamoxifen, {{antidiabetic}} medications, or methotrexate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kudzu</b> is also {{becoming}} {{a problem in}} northeastern Australia, and has been seen in isolated spots in Northern Italy (Lake Maggiore).|$|E
25|$|It {{may become}} a {{valuable}} asset {{for the production of}} cellulosic ethanol. In the Southern United States, <b>kudzu</b> is used to make soaps, lotions, and compost.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, <b>kudzu</b> was {{introduced}} to Vanuatu and Fiji by United States Armed Forces to serve as camouflage for equipment {{and has become a}} major weed.|$|E
25|$|Ecologist Gerald Waldron {{made the}} Leamington find while {{walking along the}} beach. He {{recognized}} the <b>kudzu</b> instantly, having read about its destructive expansion in the southeastern United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kudzu</b> fiber, {{known as}} ko-hemp, is used {{traditionally}} to make clothing and paper, {{and has also}} been investigated for industrial-scale use. The stems are traditionally used for basketry.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{leaf litter}} {{associated}} with <b>kudzu</b> infestation results in changes to decomposition processes and a 28% reduction in stocks of soil carbon, with potential implications for {{processes involved in}} climate change.|$|E
25|$|Kudzu’s primary {{method of}} {{reproduction}} is asexual vegetative spread (cloning) which is aided by the ability to root wherever a stem is exposed to soil. For sexual reproduction, <b>kudzu</b> is entirely dependent on pollinators.|$|E
25|$|A different, and {{sometimes}} less time consuming {{option for the}} control of <b>kudzu</b> is chemical treatment with herbicides. Some common herbicides used are Tordon and Triclopyr and the most effective are Picloram and Tebuthiuron. However, chemical treatments are expensive, and killing off the plant completely requires large amounts of herbicides (40-80 gallons per acre). Herbicides {{are found to be}} most effective when they are used during the typical growing season, June–October, and when used for successive years. One case study saw a significant decrease in the growth of <b>kudzu</b> after just two years, whereas another study required the use of the herbicide for up to ten years.|$|E
25|$|Most {{mechanical}} {{means of}} <b>kudzu</b> removal {{practiced in the}} southeastern United States involve mowing the vine or cutting it back. These methods, though more effective than herbicides, are more time consuming. Vines must be mowed down just above ground level every month or two {{during the growing season}} in order to prevent them from growing back. When using this method of <b>kudzu</b> control, all of the plant material must be removed and/or destroyed (burned) to prevent the vines from taking root and re-growing. Another method of mechanical removal is to remove the crown of the plant. This part must also be destroyed to prevent re-implantation.|$|E
25|$|The city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, has {{undertaken}} a trial program using goats and llamas to graze on the plant. Similar {{efforts to reduce}} widespread nuisance <b>kudzu</b> growth have also been undertaken in the cities of Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Tallahassee, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998, the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has {{experimented with}} using the fungus Myrothecium verrucaria as a biologically based {{herbicide}} against <b>kudzu.</b> A diacetylverrucarol spray based on M. verrucaria works under {{a variety of}} conditions (including the absence of dew), causes minimal injury to many of the other woody plants in kudzu-infested habitats, and takes effect quickly enough that <b>kudzu</b> treated with it in the morning starts showing evidence of damage by midafternoon. Initial formulations of the herbicide produced toxic levels of other trichothecenes as byproducts, though the ARS discovered growing M. verrucaria in a fermenter on a liquid, instead of a solid, diet limited or eliminated the problem.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, phytoestrogenic {{plants have}} been used for centuries in the {{treatment}} of menstrual and menopausal problems, as well as for fertility problems. Plants used that have been shown to contain phytoestrogens include Pueraria mirifica, and its close relative, <b>kudzu,</b> Angelica, fennel and anise.|$|E
25|$|After initial herbicidal treatment, {{follow-up}} {{treatments and}} monitoring are usually necessary, {{depending on how}} long the <b>kudzu</b> has been growing in the area. It may require up to 10 years of supervision after the initial chemical placement {{to make sure the}} plant does not return.|$|E
25|$|While little {{research}} has been conducted on the impacts of plant invasion on atmospheric conditions, a study conducted at Stony Brook University in New York shows that <b>kudzu</b> has increased the concentration of atmospheric NOx in the eastern United States, which causes a 2 ppb increase in tropospheric ozone during high temperature events in addition to soil acidification, aluminum mobilization, and leaching of NO3- into aquatic ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kudzu</b> {{has been}} used as a form of erosion control as well as to enhance the soil. As a legume, it {{increases}} the nitrogen in the soil by a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its deep taproots also transfer valuable minerals from the subsoil to the topsoil, thereby improving the topsoil. In the deforested section of the central Amazon Basin in Brazil, it {{has been used}} for improving the soil pore-space in clay latosols, thus freeing even more water for plants than in the soil prior to deforestation.|$|E
25|$|Among these, the Changsega retells the {{creation}} {{of the world and the}} conflict between the creator and his usurper. Many themes in the Changsega are unique to Korea. According to the Changsega, Mireuk parted the world by putting four copper pillars between the earth and the sky. He destroyed each of the two suns and two moons and crafted the stars with the destroyed sun and moon. Mireuk discovered fire and water from a mouse after torturing it (as a gift to the mouse, Mireuk gave it the barns of the world), and made the first clothes from a <b>kudzu</b> vine. He created humans from five golden bugs and five silver bugs. The bugs grew into humans; the silver ones were women and the golden ones were male.|$|E
25|$|Many foreign {{species are}} {{cultivated}} in the state, some as ornamentals, others as novelty species. Included {{among these are}} the crape myrtle, Italian cypress, southern magnolia, live oak in the warmer parts of the state, and even hardy palm trees in the warmer central and eastern parts of the state. USDA plant hardiness zones in the state range from Zones 5 and 6 in the extreme {{western part of the}} state to Zone 7 in the central part, and Zone 8 around {{the southern part of the}} coast, the bay area, and parts of metropolitan Baltimore. Invasive plant species, such as <b>kudzu,</b> tree of heaven, multiflora rose, and Japanese stiltgrass, stifle growth of endemic plant life. Maryland's state flower, the black-eyed susan, grows in abundance in wild flower groups throughout the state. The state insect, the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly, is not common as it is near the southern edge of its range. 435 species of birds have been reported from Maryland.|$|E
500|$|Under the <b>Kudzu,</b> Shenandoah's second RCA album, {{followed}} in 1993. It {{was produced by}} Don Cook, who was also Brooks & Dunn's producer at the time. [...] "Janie Baker's Love Slave", written by [...] "Burning Love" [...] writer Dennis Linde, was a top 15 Billboard hit from the album early that year. Next came [...] "I Want to Be Loved Like That", which peaked at number three on Billboard, number two on Gavin Report and number one on Radio & Records. The album also included the band's fifth and final Billboard number-one hit, [...] "If Bubba Can Dance (I Can Too)", which Raybon and McGuire wrote with veteran Nashville songwriter Bob McDill after seeing a television commercial for line dancing instructions. [...] "I'll Go Down Loving You," [...] the last single from the album, spent eleven weeks on the Billboard charts and peaked at number 46, thus becoming the band's first single to miss the Top 40 since [...] "They Don't Make Love Like We Used To" [...] in 1987. Michael Corcoran of The Dallas Morning News called Under the <b>Kudzu</b> [...] "their strongest album to date", and Jack Hurst gave it three stars, saying, [...] "Shenandoah carries most of this album with impassioned vocals rather than superior song content." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{least from}} the 1970s, and perhaps earlier, the federal appellate courts {{permitted}} mail fraud prosecutions of public officials deprive the public of their intangible right to honest services. According to Professor John C. Coffee, [...] "he mid 1970s saw the flowering of the 'intangible rights doctrine,' an exotic flower that quickly overgrew the legal landscape {{in the manner of}} the <b>kudzu</b> vine until by the mid-1980s few ethical or fiduciary breaches seemed beyond its potential reach." [...] In McNally v. United States (1987), the Supreme Court held that a [...] "scheme or artifice to defraud" [...] under the mail and wire fraud statutes did not include a scheme or artifice to defraud another of the intangible right to honest services. In 1988, Congress responded by adding 18 U.S.C. § 1346 which provides: ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Masnick {{wrote about}} the case on Techdirt, commenting {{on the effect of}} Beck's actions on the meme's spread. He {{observed}} in retrospect it would have been advantageous for Beck to have simply done nothing rather than encourage the meme as a byproduct of his attempts to remove it from the Internet. Masnick pointed out that Beck's actions provided legitimacy to the meme's noteworthiness. Steffen Schmidt wrote of Beck's predicament in a Des Moines Register article: [...] "Mr. Beck has quite a task ahead of him. Shutting down one web site is like trying to eradicate Pueraria lobata the dreaded <b>Kudzu</b> vine that is eating the South." [...] Citizen Media Law Project observed Beck had exacerbated the situation by intimating legal tactics against Eiland-Hall, which served to increase the popularity of the meme and coverage of it among blogs.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>kudzu</b> {{plant was}} {{introduced}} to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. <b>Kudzu</b> {{was introduced to}} the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition. The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches, and {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, <b>kudzu</b> was distributed as a high-protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion. It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl. The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of <b>kudzu</b> to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government-aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government-funded plantings of <b>kudzu</b> which paid $19.75 per hectare. By 1946, it was estimated that [...] of <b>kudzu</b> had been planted. When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms, <b>kudzu</b> plantings were left unattended. The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the <b>kudzu</b> to grow virtually unchecked. In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed <b>kudzu</b> from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970. By 1997, the vine was placed on the “Federal Noxious Weed List”. Today, <b>kudzu</b> is estimated to cover [...] of land in the southeastern United States, mostly in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Mississippi. It has been recorded in Nova Scotia, Canada, in Columbus, Ohio, and in all five boroughs of New York City.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Kudzu</b> {{can be used}} by grazing animals, as it is high {{in quality}} as a forage and {{palatable}} to livestock. [...] It can be grazed until frost and even slightly after. [...] <b>Kudzu</b> had been used in the southern United States specifically to feed goats on land that had limited resources. [...] <b>Kudzu</b> hay typically has a 15–18% crude protein content and over 60% total digestible nutrient value. [...] The quality of the leaves decreases, however, as vine content increases relative to the leaf content. [...] <b>Kudzu</b> also has low forage yields despite its rate of growth, yielding around two to four tons of dry matter per acre annually. [...] It is also difficult to bale due to its vining growth and its slowness in shedding water. [...] This makes it necessary to place <b>kudzu</b> hay under sheltered protection after being baled. [...] <b>Kudzu</b> is readily consumed by all types of grazing animals, yet frequent grazing over three to four years can ruin stands. [...] Thus, <b>kudzu</b> only serves well as a grazing crop on a temporary basis.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, <b>kudzu</b> {{has been}} used as {{livestock}} feed, in fertilizer, [...] and in erosion control, and the vines have been used for folk art. In Korea, <b>kudzu</b> root is harvested for its starch, which is used in various foods including naengmyon, as well as a health food and herbal medicine. In China, <b>kudzu</b> root is used in herbal remedies, teas, and the treatment of alcohol-related problems. The efficacy of the treatment of alcohol-related problems is currently under question, but experiments show promising results. In Japan, the <b>kudzu</b> root starch (or kuzu root starch) extracted from <b>kudzu</b> roots is used in cooking and natural medicines, and it is used to make hay that sick animals will eat. The starch is used in Japanese cuisine, and is widely consumed as such in that country. <b>Kudzu</b> is also used as a food crop in Java, Sumatra, and Malaya, and can be found in Puerto Rico and South America.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Kudzu</b> fiber {{has long}} been used for fiber art and basketry. [...] The long runners which {{propagate}} the <b>kudzu</b> fields and the larger vines which cover trees make excellent weaving material. [...] Some basketmakers use the material green. [...] Others use it after splitting it in half, allowing it to dry and then rehydrating it using hot water. [...] Both traditional and contemporary basketry artists use <b>kudzu.</b>|$|E
