5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (<b>fused</b> <b>silica)</b> must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
25|$|The active {{medium of}} the heater {{depicted}} {{in this section}} is a coil of nichrome resistance wire inside a <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> tube, open to the atmosphere at the ends, although models exist where the <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> is sealed at the ends and the resistance alloy is not nichrome.|$|E
25|$|Capillary columns (under 0.3mm) {{are used}} almost {{exclusively}} with alternative detection means such as mass spectrometry. They are usually made from <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> capillaries, {{rather than the}} stainless steel tubing that larger columns employ.|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} luminescence induced in UV grade sapphire, MgF 2 and LiF 2, three <b>fused</b> <b>silicas,</b> {{and three}} Corning glasses, by 1 / 2, 1, 2, and 3 MeV electrons was recorded. In the wavelength {{range from the}} LiF UV cutoff to the near visible, a plane-grating spectrograph with photographic recording at resolutions of 0. 8 and 1. 6 nm was utilized. Qualitative results based on relative density tracings of seven of the nine materials obtained from preliminary plates are given...|$|R
40|$|The transmittances and reflectances of cultured {{crystalline}} quartz, Suprasil, Suprasil W, and Infrasil {{were compared}} over the wavelength region from 2 to 1000 microns. The high-water content of Suprasil and the low-water content of cultured crystalline quartz, Suprasil W, and Infrasil {{were determined by}} their transmittances measured at 2. 73 microns where water content causes high absorption in optical materials. The fact that the <b>fused</b> <b>silicas,</b> both with high- and low-water content, had identical far-IR transmittances and that their transmittances were greatly inferior to that of crystalline quartz led {{to the conclusion that}} their inferior transmittance is due to their amorphous structure and not to their water content...|$|R
50|$|Inside the {{fused quartz}} arc tube, two {{tungsten}} electrodes doped with thorium are sealed into each end and an AC voltage {{is applied to}} them through molybdenum foil seals <b>fused</b> in <b>silica.</b> It is the arc between the two electrodes where the light is actually created.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{the same}} atoms {{may be able}} to form noncrystalline phases. For example, water can also form {{amorphous}} ice, while SiO2 can form both <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> (an amorphous glass) and quartz (a crystal). Likewise, if a substance can form crystals, it can also form polycrystals.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor {{technology}} {{today is}} also utilized to etch holographically patterned gratings into robust {{materials such as}} <b>fused</b> <b>silica.</b> In this way, low stray-light holography is combined with the high efficiency of deep, etched transmission gratings, and {{can be incorporated into}} high volume, low cost semiconductor manufacturing technology.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} oxygen iodine laser is {{an infrared}} chemical laser. The chemical oxygen iodine laser {{was invented by}} the United States Air Force's Phillips Laboratory in 1977 for military purposes. Its properties make it useful for industrial processing as well; the beam is focusable and can be transferred by an optical fiber, as its wavelength is not absorbed much by <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> but is very well absorbed by metals, making it suitable for laser cutting and drilling. COIL is the main weapon laser for the military airborne laser and advanced tactical laser programs.|$|E
5000|$|Fused quartz is {{produced}} by <b>fusing</b> (melting) high-purity <b>silica</b> sand, which consists of quartz crystals. There are four basic types of commercial silica glass: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Infrared grade" [...] {{fused quartz}} (tradenames [...] "Infrasil", [...] "Vitreosil IR", and others), which is {{electrically}} fused, {{has a greater}} presence of metallic impurities, limiting its UV transmittance wavelength to around 250 nm, but a much lower water content, leading to excellent infrared transmission up to 3.6 Î¼m wavelength. All grades of transparent <b>fused</b> quartz/fused <b>silica</b> have nearly identical physical properties.|$|R
25|$|Most modern tubes have glass {{envelope}}s, but metal, <b>fused</b> quartz (<b>silica)</b> and ceramic {{have also}} been used. A first version of the 6L6 used a metal envelope sealed with glass beads, while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions. Metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2kW dissipation. The nuvistor was a modern receiving tube using a very small metal and ceramic package.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{application}} of CE in forensic science {{is the development of}} methods for amplification and detection of DNA fragments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which has to lead to rapid and dramatic advances in DNA typing in forensic. DNA separations are carried out using thin CE, 50-mm, <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> capillaries filled with a sieving buffer. These capillaries have excellent capabilities to dissipate heat, permitting much higher electric field strengths to be used than slab gel electrophoresis. Therefore separations in capillaries are rapid and efficient. Additionally, the capillaries can be easily refilled and changed for efficient and automated injections. Detection occurs via fluorescence through a window etched in the capillary. Both single-capillary and capillary-array instruments are available with array systems capable of running 16 or more samples simultaneously for increased throughput.|$|E
25|$|Gas-core reactor. A {{closed loop}} {{version of the}} nuclear {{lightbulb}} rocket, where the fissile material is gaseous uranium-hexafluoride contained in a <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> vessel. A working gas (such as hydrogen) would flow around this vessel and absorb the UV light produced by the reaction. This reactor design could also function as a rocket engine, as featured in Harry Harrison's 1976 science-fiction novel Skyfall. In theory, using UF6 as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable neutron flux, weakening most reactor materials, and therefore as the flux {{would be similar to}} that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows of}} the photomultipliers act as {{wavelength}} filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care {{has to be taken}} for uncommon wavelengths. Borosilicate glass is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300nm. High borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm. Glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope. Ultraviolet glass transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185nm. Used in spectroscopy. Synthetic silica transmits down to 160nm, absorbs less UV than <b>fused</b> <b>silica.</b> Different thermal expansion than kovar (and than borosilicate glass that's expansion-matched to kovar), a graded seal needed between the window {{and the rest of the}} tube. The seal is vulnerable to mechanical shocks. Magnesium fluoride transmits ultraviolet down to 115nm. Hygroscopic, though less than other alkali halides usable for UV windows.|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} fluid-assisted polishing for <b>fuse</b> <b>silica</b> {{and other}} optical materials {{with a high}} degree of success, and a super-smooth surface (Ra < 1 nm) and subsurface-damage-free layer can be produced. However, the fundamental mechanisms of the process for polishing reaction-bonded silicon carbide (RB-SiC) have not yet been studied in detail. This paper is concerned with the fabrication processability aspect of the RB-SiC components, and investigates results obtained by magnetorheological finishing (MRF) of RB-SiC mirror. It details experimentally the features of different polishing fluids and the characteristics of relative removal rates, analyses the processing limitations of the normal processing techniques and studies the effects of certain processing parameters on surface accuracy. The final surface roughness with an initial value of Ra = 17. 58 nm reached 4. 03 nm after 15 h of polishing, and then convergent to 1. 03 nm after another 7 h fine polishing. Experimental results based on the magnetorheological (MR) fluids show that, a MR fluid containing diamond particles helps to accelerate removal rates. Additionally, by adding a small amount of CeO 2 into the diamond-based MR fluid, it is possible to finish RB-SiC material to a higher level of surface quality.

50|$|Fumed silica (CAS number 112945-52-5), {{also known}} as {{pyrogenic}} silica because it is produced in a flame, consists of microscopic droplets of amorphous <b>silica</b> <b>fused</b> into branched, chainlike, three-dimensional secondary particles which then agglomerate into tertiary particles. The resulting powder has an extremely low bulk density and high surface area. Its three-dimensional structure results in viscosity-increasing, thixotropic behavior when used as a thickener or reinforcing filler.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} storage {{conditions}} on laser induced damage density at 351 nm on bare <b>fused</b> polished <b>silica</b> samples has been studied. Intentionally outgassing of polypropylene pieces on silica samples was done. We evidenced an important increase of laser induced damage density on contaminated samples demonstrating that storage could limit optics lifetime performances. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Gas Chromatography -Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) {{have been used}} to identify the potential causes of this effect. It shows that a small quantity of organic contamination deposited on silica surface is responsible for this degradation. Various hypotheses are proposed to explain the damage mechanism. The more likely hypothesis is a coupling between surface defects of optics and organic contaminants...|$|R
2500|$|The two {{predominant}} polymorphs of GeO2 are hexagonal and tetragonal. Hexagonal GeO2 has {{the same}} structure as Î²-quartz, with germanium having coordination number 4. [...] Tetragonal GeO2 (the mineral argutite) has the rutile-like structure seen in stishovite. [...] In this motif, germanium has the coordination number 6. [...] An amorphous (glassy) form of GeO2 is similar to <b>fused</b> <b>silica.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Many lamps have a shortwave UV {{blocking}} coating on {{the envelope}} and are sold as [...] "ozone free" [...] lamps for solar simulators applications. The company WACOM has also {{a long history of}} xenon lamp production. Some lamps have envelopes made out of ultra-pure synthetic <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> (such as [...] "Suprasil"), which roughly doubles the cost, but which allows them to emit useful light into the vacuum UV region. These lamps are normally operated in a pure nitrogen atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC), {{also sometimes}} known as gas-liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique {{in which the}} mobile phase is a gas. Gas chromatographic separation is always carried out in a column, which is typically [...] "packed" [...] or [...] "capillary". [...] Packed columns are the routine work horses of gas chromatography, being cheaper {{and easier to use}} and often giving adequate performance. [...] Capillary columns generally give far superior resolution and although more expensive are becoming widely used, especially for complex mixtures. [...] Both types of column are made from non-adsorbent and chemically inert materials. Stainless steel and glass are the usual materials for packed columns and quartz or <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> for capillary columns.|$|E

Some species of glass sponges are capable of fusing together to create reefs or bioherms. They are generally pale in colour, ranging from white to orange.|$|R
50|$|Another {{application}} of material science is {{the structures of}} ceramics and glass typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with SiO2 (silica or sand) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide <b>fused</b> with <b>silica.</b> At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning Gorilla Glass is a well-known example of the {{application of}} materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form {{are considered to be}} ceramics.|$|R

The early APFSDS penetrators fired by the T208 had a low length-to-diameter ratio, this being limited by their brittle tungsten carbide construction, with a diameter of 37mm, although they had a high muzzle velocity of [...] The rangefinder, the [...] "T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging" [...] (OPTAR) system, emitted pulsed beams of intense but incoherent infrared light. These incoherent beams scattered easily, reducing effectiveness in mist and rain and causing multiple returns, requiring the gunner to identify the correct return after estimating the range by sight. This, combined with the large and vulnerable design of the transmitter and receiver assembly, led to the abandonment of the OPTAR system in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council), an {{industry}} committee on standardization, developed {{a system of}} designating spectral responses.

No suitable photoemissive surfaces have yet been reported to detect wavelengths longer than approximately 1700 nanometers, which can be approached by a special (InP/InGaAs(Cs)) photocathode.|$|E
