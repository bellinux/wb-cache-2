5|$|Volcanic ash plumes {{can form}} above {{pyroclastic}} density currents, these are called co-ignimbrite plumes. As pyroclastic density currents travel {{away from the}} volcano, smaller particles are removed from the flow by elutriation and form a less dense zone overlying the main flow. This zone then entrains the surrounding air and a buoyant co-ignimbrite plume is formed. These plumes tend to have higher concentrations of fine ash particles compared to magmatic eruption plumes due to the abrasion within the pyroclastic <b>density</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E

Now, if we wish to maintain {{the notion of a}} convected density, then we must generalize the Schrödinger expression of the density and current so that space and time derivatives again enter symmetrically in relation to the scalar wave function.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Density</b> <b>currents</b> are flows {{driven by}} density {{differences}} caused by suspended fine solid material, dissolved contents, temperature gradient {{or a combination}} of them. Reservoir sedimentation is often related to sediment transport by <b>density</b> <b>currents.</b> This sedimentation can block bottom outlets, reduce the capacity of reservoir and harms the dam power plants. The head is the leading edge of <b>density</b> <b>currents.</b> In this paper, the influences of artificially roughened beds on dynamics of the frontal region of <b>density</b> <b>currents</b> are investigated experimentally.

5|$|Pyroclastic <b>density</b> <b>currents</b> {{can also}} produce ash particles. These are {{typically}} produced by lava dome collapse or {{collapse of the}} eruption column. Within pyroclastic <b>density</b> <b>currents</b> particle abrasion occurs as particles {{interact with each other}} resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow. These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which is removed from pyroclastic <b>density</b> <b>currents</b> in co-ignimbrite ash plumes.|$|R

50|$|Sheathfolds {{and other}} rheomorphic {{structures}} {{may be the}} result of a single stage of shear. Shear possibly occurred as the <b>density</b> <b>current</b> passed over the forming deposit. Vertical variations in the orientations of sheathfolds are evidence that rheomorphism and welding can occur syn-depositionally. It is disputed that the shear between the <b>density</b> <b>current</b> and the forming deposit is significant enough to cause all of the rheomorphic structures observed in ignimbrites, although the shear could be responsible for some of the structures such as imbricate fiamme. Load compaction on an inclined slope is likely responsible for the majority of the rheomorphic structures.|$|E

30|$|In the 1930 s, <b>density</b> <b>currents</b> (Daly 1936) and {{turbidity}} currents {{were considered}} to be one and the same. Since then, the domain of turbidity currents went through a remarkable period of revolution and evolution (Shanmugam 2016 a). After 80  years of research, we have come full circle. Today, we once again consider <b>density</b> <b>currents</b> and turbidity currents to be one and the same. For example, Parker and Toniolo (2007, p. 690) defined a turbidity current as follows: “When the density difference is mediated by the presence of suspended mud in the water column of the river, the resulting underflow is termed a turbidity current”. However, the distinction is that all turbidity <b>currents</b> are <b>density</b> <b>currents,</b> but not all <b>density</b> <b>currents</b> are turbidity currents (e.g., thermohaline-density driven bottom currents or “contour currents” (Hollister 1967)). It should be reiterated that all hyperpycnal plumes are density plumes, but not all density plumes are hyperpycnal plumes (e.g., hypopycnal and homopycnal plumes). This confusion can be easily avoided by simply adhering to the established concepts available in sedimentologic literature (Bagnold 1962; Dott 1963; Middleton and Hampton 1973; Sanders 1965; Shanmugam 1996, 2006 a, 2018 c; Talling et al. 2012).|$|R
