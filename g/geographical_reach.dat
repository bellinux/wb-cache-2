The sultanate reached the peak of its <b>geographical</b> <b>reach</b> during the Tughlaq dynasty, occupying most of the Indian subcontinent. This was followed by decline due to Hindu reconquests, states such as the Vijayanagara Empire asserting independence, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate breaking off.|$|E

The material of the boards has often shifted from locally available timber (chestnut, alder, cherry, etc.) to more beautifully sounding wood from other <b>geographical</b> <b>reaches</b> (Caribbean, West Africa...) such as iroko, sapele, elondo etc. Furthermore, stone (the group Gerla Beti called this variant harriparta) and metal tubes have been added, so widening the range of sounds and contrasts available. In some instances, they have even substituted the customary wooden boards. Big cardboard tubes can be beaten vertically on the floor. It is worth highlighting the manufacture by the group Oreka TX of a txalaparta based on ice blocks on their Scandinavian tour, a making recorded in their 2006 documentary film Nömadak Tx.|$|R
40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the key factors influencing advertisers in the selection of the advertising media in Tanzania.

Two samples, one consisting of 4 televisions stations and 27 firms that advertise on TV are selected through convenience and purposive sampling techniques. Another consist of Data was collected by using questionnaires, in depths interviews and documented records. It was hypothesized that four variables: audience size, timing of audience, <b>geographical</b> coverage (<b>reach)</b> and customer care had an influence on the selection of advertising media. All these relationships were tested separately using statistical tools available in the statistical package for social science (SPSS) program. The results show that the majority of advertisers are attracted by audience size and timing of audiences when selecting media in which to advertise. Moreover, most of the advertisers considered <b>geographical</b> coverage (<b>reach)</b> to be very important in the selection of the media. Customer care was also considered to be very important in selection of the television for advertising...|$|R
25|$|The Tughlaq dynasty {{lasted from}} 1320 to nearly {{the end of}} the 14th century. The first ruler Ghazi Malik rechristened himself as Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq and is also {{referred}} to in scholarly works as Tughlak Shah. He was of Turko-Indian origins; his father was a Turkic slave and his mother was a Hindu. Ghiyath al-Din ruled for five years and built a town near Delhi named Tughlaqabad. According to some historians such as Vincent Smith, he was killed by his son Juna Khan, who then assumed power in 1325. Juna Khan rechristened himself as Muhammad bin Tughlaq and ruled for 26 years.

25|$|The wave of {{raids on}} north Indian and western Indian kingdoms by Muslim warlords {{continued}} after Mahmud of Ghazni, plundering and looting these kingdoms. The raids did not establish or extend permanent boundaries of their Islamic kingdoms. The Ghurid Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad began a systematic war of expansion into north India in 1173. He sought {{to carve out}} a principality for himself by expanding the Islamic world. Mu'izz sought a Sunni Islamic kingdom of his own extending east of the Indus river, and he thus laid the foundation for the Muslim kingdom that became the Delhi Sultanate. Some historians chronicle the Delhi Sultanate from 1192 due to the presence and geographical claims of Mu'izz al-Din in South Asia by that time. The Delhi Sultanate covered varying parts of South Asia, and was ruled by a series of dynasties, called Mamluk, Khalji, Tughlaq, Sayyid and Lodi dynasties. Muhammad bin Tughlaq came to power in 1325, launched a war of expansion and the Delhi Sultanate reached it largest <b>geographical</b> <b>reach</b> over the Indian subcontinent during his 26-year rule. A Sunni Sultan, Muhammad bin Tughlaq persecuted non-Muslims such as Hindus, as well as non-Sunni Muslims such as Shia and Mahdi sects.|$|E
25|$|Revolts against Muhammad bin Tughlaq {{began in}} 1327, {{continued}} over his reign, {{and over time}} the <b>geographical</b> <b>reach</b> of the Sultanate shrunk. The Vijayanagara Empire originated in southern India as a direct response to attacks from the Delhi Sultanate., and liberated south India from the Delhi Sultanate's rule. In 1337, Muhammad bin Tughlaq ordered an attack on China, sending part of his forces over the Himalayas. Few survived the journey, and they were executed upon their return for failing. During his reign, state revenues collapsed from his policies such as the base metal coins from 1329-1332. To cover state expenses, he sharply raised taxes. Those who failed to pay taxes were hunted and executed. Famines, widespread poverty, and rebellion grew across the kingdom. In 1338 his own nephew rebelled in Malwa, whom he attacked, caught, and flayed alive. By 1339, the eastern regions under local Muslim governors and southern parts led by Hindu kings had revolted and declared independence from the Delhi Sultanate. Muhammad bin Tughlaq {{did not have the}} resources or support to respond to the shrinking kingdom. The historian Walford chronicled Delhi and most of India faced severe famines during Muhammad bin Tughlaq's rule in the years after the base metal coin experiment. By 1347, the Bahmani Sultanate had become an independent and competing Muslim kingdom in Deccan region of South Asia.|$|E

2500|$|According to sociologists Hanson and Pratt, men {{and women}} employ {{different}} strategies in their job searches that {{play a role in}} occupational segregation. These differing strategies are influenced by power relations in the household, the gendered nature of social life, and women's domestic responsibilities. The last factor, in particular, leads women to prioritize the geographical proximity of paid employment when searching for a job. In addition, most people have been found to find their jobs through informal contacts. The gendered nature of social life leads women to have networks with smaller <b>geographical</b> <b>reach</b> than men. Thus, the location of women in female-dominated occupations which are lower-status and lower pay is the result of [...] "severe day-to-day time constraints" [...] rather than a conscious and long-term choice made that would be able to maximize pay and prestige.|$|E

30|$|The {{stresses}} can be computed {{by considering}} all these parameters. A detailed analysis, {{that goes beyond}} the scope of this article, has been done in [20]. It shows that the magnitude of the thermal stresses alone are very small for both the repair layer and the natural stone, mainly due to the viscoelasticity of the repair material. Indeed, since its glass transition temperature is 20  °C, all the stresses that are created above this temperature are relaxed rapidly. As a consequence, and in contrast to what one might intuitively think, the highest thermal stresses are not created during summer but during the winter season. <b>Geographical</b> locations <b>reaching</b> particularly low temperatures are most at risk because the viscoelastic relaxation is much slower, but even in those cases damaging stresses are not expected [34].|$|R

40|$|Thermalism and spa {{treatments}} are traditionally considered effective {{in a number}} of dermatologic inflammatory conditions, yet there is scarce evidence about spring water effectiveness on psoriasis in a daily setting. We enrolled 34 patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-contralaterally-controlled trial, to evaluate Levico and Vetriolo arsenical-ferruginous water effectiveness on psoriatic lesions by daily 20 -minute wet packing for 12 consecutive days. Clinical, histopathologic and immunohistochemical parameters were considered. A statistically significant difference between spa water-treated lesions and placebo-treated lesions in the same patients was demonstrated for histopathologic and immunohistochemical parameters. Since iron ions have an antiproliferative effect on epithelia, and magnesium ions have an anti-inflammatory effect, Levico and Vetriolo water effectiveness on psoriasis could be addressed to their content of these ions. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 2 - 3 % of American adults (I).

Additionally, a new genus, Triangulospirifer, is also proposed to replace Triangularia (Poletaev, 2001) that was preoccupied by a Devonian molluscan genus. On {{the basis of the}} new material as well as published information, we have reviewed the taxonomic composition and the stratigraphic and palaeobiogeographic distributions of the three previously established genera from the viewpoint of palaeobiogeography.
