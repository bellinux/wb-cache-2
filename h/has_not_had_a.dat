His number 24 with the Pirates remains in circulation, most prominently worn by Brian Giles from 1999 to 2003 and by Pedro Alvarez from 2011 to 2015. The Giants have not reissued Bonds's number 25.|$|E
5|$|On 19 October 2011, Queen Mary 2 had her {{registry}} {{changed to}} Hamilton, Bermuda, from her previous home port of Southampton, {{to allow the}} ship to host on-board weddings. This {{marked the first time}} in its 171-year history that Cunard <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> ship registered within the UK. Bermuda is a member of the Red Ensign Group and the ship continues to fly the undefaced Red Ensign rather than the Bermuda Red Ensign.|$|E
5|$|The US <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{diplomatic}} mission in Somalia since {{the closure of}} the embassy in 1991.

5|$|The Virginia Seismic Zone <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{history of}} regular {{earthquake}} activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5in magnitude, because Virginia is {{located away from}} {{the edges of the}} North American Plate. The largest earthquake, at an estimated 5.9magnitude, was in 1897 near Blacksburg. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011, near Mineral. The earthquake was reportedly felt as far away as Toronto, Atlanta and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{political}} parties have been represented in the committee. The first committee consisted exclusively {{of members of the}} Liberal Party. The party was represented on all committees until 1973, after which it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> seat. In 1907, Francis Hagerup became the first representative from the Conservative Party, and this party has been represented on the board since. The Labour Party has been represented on the board since 1919, when Halvdan Koht became a member. The Agrarian Party (since named the Centre Party) was first represented on the board by Birger Braadland in 1938. The Christian Democratic Party was first represented by Erling Wikborg in 1965, the Socialist Left Party by Hanna Kvanmo in 1991 and the Progress Party by Inger-Marie Ytterhorn in 2000.|$|E

25|$|At {{the state}} level, the {{governorship}} {{has been held}} by the Republican Party since 1992, along with {{a majority of the}} state legislature and statewide officers.

25|$|The subregion's nature {{reserves}} are poorly managed. Little {{information is available}} for management purposes, as the subregion <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> thorough biodiversity survey, vegetation mapping is available only at 1:250,000 scale, and there are virtually no historical records of fires or other significant events. Other than routine baiting of foxes in some reserves, there is little done to manage threats. The main threat, rising salinity, is completely unmanaged, despite having already caused widespread population declines and extinctions in lowland communities.|$|E

25|$|She {{returned}} to Broadway in 1961 {{in the short}} run of Kwamina, another Adler musical which was written for her. She starred opposite Terry Carter. The musical centred on an interracial love story and was too controversial in a time when civil rights were hotly contested. The show <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Broadway revival since. Coincidentally, her father, Bobby Howes, was also on Broadway that year with a short revival of Finian's Rainbow, and a cast album exists of that show as well.|$|E
25|$|Indonesia <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{substantial}} {{conflict with}} its neighbours since the 1963â€“1965 Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, known in Indonesia as Konfrontasi with Malaysia. Possible future disputes relating to competing Malaysian-Indonesian South China Sea claims, where Indonesia has large natural gas reserves, concern the Indonesian government. As of 2007, some regional claims with neighbouring Malaysia {{have led to}} some minor sabre-rattling by both sides with a stalemate over the sovereignty of Unarang rock and the maritime boundary in the Ambalat oil block in the Celebes Sea.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Western royal families, the Saudi Monarchy <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{clearly defined}} order of succession. Historically, upon {{becoming}} King, the monarch has designated an heir apparent {{to the throne}} who serves as Crown Prince of the Kingdom. Upon the King's death the Crown Prince becomes King, and during the King's incapacitation the Crown Prince, likewise, assumes power as regent. Though {{other members of the}} Al Saud hold political positions in the Saudi government, technically it is only the King and Crown Prince who legally constitute the political institutions.|$|E

Carnegie Hall has its own artistic programming, development, and marketing departments, and presents about 250 performances each season. It is also rented out to performing groups.

Intra-Tasmanian air services are offered by Airlines of Tasmania. Until 2001 Ansett Australia operated majorly out of Tasmania to 12 destinations nationwide.|$|E
25|$|The main High Street {{through the}} village is Sneinton Dale. Many of the {{residential}} streets in Sneinton are named after battles and generals of the Second Boer War. Sneinton is bounded to the north by the B686 (Carlton Road), and {{to the west and}} south by the A612 road (Manvers Street and Colwick Loop Road) which runs from Nottingham to Newark-on-Trent. The railway to Netherfield and Grantham runs through Sneinton but it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> station since the Racecourse station shut in 1959. The Nottingham Suburban Railway connected Trent Lane junction in Sneinton with Daybrook, but bomb damage closed the Sneinton end in 1941 and the line ceased operations completely in 1954. Tramlines once ran down Carlton Road.|$|E
