There are many patches within the bay including the North Kenfig patches, green grounds, outer green grounds, madjoe and stalheim. These patches are created from faults, hollows, general topography and other factors. Sea depth around Port Talbot is 10m-50m with increasing depth with increasing {{distance from the}} coast. There are two beaches within Port Talbot: Aberafan and Morfa. Sand at both beaches are yellow and semi-shell rich. Tide in the area has a <b>harmonic</b> <b>prediction</b> which means it can be predicted easy and has repeatable tide heights every year. The outer bay area and sea area near Port Talbot Pier has a tidal stream with no <b>harmonic</b> <b>prediction.</b> A tidal stream (or tidal current) is an alternating horizontal movement of water associated with {{the rise and fall}} of the tide caused by tide-producing forces. This means that the tide can not be accurately predicted due to additional factors like currents, rip current, river mouths and precipitation. There are also two major dumping grounds within the bay. These are areas were sand is collected for construction industry. Port Talbot docks is a deep water harbour which allows large cargo shape to dock into the area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Improving {{broadband}} {{noise filter}} for audio signals By Alex Conway Filtering broadband noise in audio signals {{has always been}} a challenge since the noise is spread across a large bandwidth and overlaps the spectral range of the audio signal being recovered. There have been several broadband noise reduction techniques, such as spectral subtraction, developed for speech enhancement that might be applied to reduce noise in musical audio recordings as well. One such technique that is investigated in this thesis identifies the harmonic components of a signal to be preserved as those spectral magnitude peaks that exceed a chosen decision threshold. All other spectral components below the threshold are considered to be noise. Noise components are then attenuated enough to render them imperceptible {{in the presence of the}} harmonic signal, using a psycho-acoustical model of sound masking. The objective of this thesis is to show that this algorithm can be adapted and improved for musical audio noise reduction. Improvements include relaxing the filter when percussion events are anticipated, since these appear spectrally similar to broadband noise but are essential to the musical experience; and using <b>harmonic</b> <b>prediction</b> to preserve more of the signal harmonics than the simple threshold would pass. <b>Harmonic</b> <b>prediction</b> takes advantage of the known harmonic spacing of musical content and places noise filter pass bands around a fixed number of harmonics of every fundamental pitch found; passing some harmonics that would get filtered out by the original thresholding algorithm. Noise filtering improvements were assessed for both noise reduction and signal degradation effects by different signal to noise ratio computations. The audio results with and without improvements were also assessed using subjective listening tests, since how the sound is perceived is what matters most in musical recordings. Quantitative results show improved signal to noise ratios of filtered audio signals when the improvements were included compared to the original threshold-based filter. Perceived sound quality in listening tests was also higher with the percussion preservation and <b>harmonic</b> <b>prediction</b> improvements. In all listening tests, every listener rated the improved filter as the best...|$|E

The work contains several flaws devaluating the results: (1) the method is unreliable {{from the point of}} view of signal processing (it is impossible to make <b>harmonic</b> <b>predictions</b> for thousands of years based on only 35 years of data) and lacks quality control, (2) the result of post-diction apparently contradicts the observational data.

40|$|Novelty {{detection}} is {{a well-established}} method for analyzing {{the structure of}} music based on acoustic descriptors. Work on novelty-based segmentation prediction has mainly concentrated on enhancement of features and similarity matrices, novelty kernel computation and peak detection. Less attention, however, {{has been paid to}} characteristics of musical features and novelty curves, and their contribution to segmentation accuracy. This is particularly important as it can help unearth acoustic cues prompting perceptual segmentation and find new determinants of segmentation model performance. This study focused on spectral, rhythmic and <b>harmonic</b> <b>prediction</b> of perceptual segmentation density, which was obtained for six musical examples from 18 musician listeners via an annotation task. The proposed approach involved comparisons between perceptual segment density and novelty curves; in particular, we investigated possible predictors of segmentation accuracy based on musical features and novelty curves. For pitch and rhythm, we found positive correlates between segmentation accuracy and both local variability of musical features and mean distance between subsequent local maxima of novelty curves. According to the results, segmentation accuracy increases for stimuli with milder local changes and fewer novelty peaks.

The calculations are based on density functional theory, which is known to predict the properties of high-pressure iron with good accuracy. The temperature dependence of c/a is determined by minimising the Helmholtz free energy at fixed volume and temperature, with thermal contributions due to lattice vibrations calculated using harmonic theory.

40|$|Geomorphic {{evolution}} of estuarine habitats and landscapes over decadal timescales (> 10 years) {{is sensitive to}} sediment supply from the watershed as well as estuarine hydrodynamics. Sediment supply to Suisun Bay, California is subject to natural as well as anthropogenic influence, beginning with the drastic input of sediment during the hydraulic mining period of the late 19 th century. Today sediment supply is declining due to reduction of the hydraulic mining sediment pulse, reservoir storage, and land use practices. Future climate change, land use change, and sea level rise {{are some of the}} many factors that may alter sediment supply and threaten ecologically beneficial estuarine habitats. We have developed an estuarine geomorphic model based on a traditional tidal timescale hydrodynamic/sediment transport model, by idealizing boundary conditions, applying novel calibration procedures, and implementing a simplified time-stepping method. The Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) was developed for Suisun Bay, for the purpose of hindcasting historical geomorphic change and modeling future scenarios of geomorphic change. Seaward boundary conditions were idealized using tidal <b>harmonic</b> <b>prediction</b> for tidal stage and velocity, and a synthetic time-series for sediment concentrations was constructed by applying typical seasonal wind patterns and the spring-neap tidal signal. Calibration of these idealized boundary conditions and bed sediment parameters was accomplished using sediment flux data for the boundaries of Suisun Bay from water years 1997 and 2004. Calibrating to sediment fluxes guarantees that modeled net geomorphic change will not exceed the total supply of sediment from landward and seaward sources. The successful simulations of 1997 and 2004 allow {{for the development of a}} time-stepping method that reduces computational expense. The method involves simulating the two distinct sediment-transport seasons of Suisun Bay as month-long periods, then extrapolating the results of each compressed period for the entire season. Computational time for hindcasting and future scenario simulations is now reduced by 85 % using this simplified method...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{two different}} techniques for efficient control of slip energy in a slip-ring induction machine. The static Kramer system merely recovers slip power and returns {{it to the}} a. c. supply. As a result only sub-synchronous motoring or super-synchronous generating is possible. In the static Scherbius system, however, the slip power can be controlled both {{into and out of}} the secondary circuit. This allows the machine to operate as a motor and generator at both sub- and super-synchronous speeds. For wide speed range operation a current source inverter was used as this can inherently provide reversal of power flow. The operating requirements for the current source inverter operating in the secondary circuit of an induction machine have been determined. These considerations show that the current source inverter control signal must be synchronised to the secondary e. m. f. of the machine. The machine can then operate in a stable manner over a very wide speed range. The conventional analysis of the current source inverter has been developed to include the effect of the secondary slip e. m. f. which is shown to have a major effect on the commutation behaviour of the inverter. The action of the commutation circuit is affected by the phase angle between the secondary current and the slip e. m. f. This angle can be controlled electronically and the effect of this has been predicted and observed. A detailed study of the Kramer system has included analysis of the d. c. link current waveform including Fourier <b>harmonic</b> <b>prediction</b> in terms of the circuit parameters and the operating slip. The operation of the Kramer and Scherbius systems has been studied for both motoring and generating modes of the induction machine and their relative merits have been compared. In particular the novel idea of using the Scherbius system for variable speed wind energy recovery has been considered and reported in a published paper. Finally suggestions have been made for further work particularly for application to wind energy recovery...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{intelligence}} techniques, such as artificial {{neural networks}} (ANNs), {{have been widely}} used to improve the performance of power system monitoring and control. Although inspired by the neurons in the brain, ANNs are largely different from living neuron networks (LNNs) in many aspects. Due to the oversimplification, the huge computational potential of LNNs cannot be realized by ANNs. Therefore, a more brain-like artificial neural network is highly desired {{to bridge the gap between}} ANNs and LNNs. The focus of this research is to develop a biologically inspired artificial neural network (BIANN), which is not only biologically meaningful, but also computationally powerful. The BIANN can serve as a novel computational intelligence tool in monitoring, modeling and control of the power systems. A comprehensive survey of ANNs applications in power system is presented. It is shown that novel types of reservoir-computing-based ANNs, such as echo state networks (ESNs) and liquid state machines (LSMs), have stronger modeling capability than conventional ANNs. The feasibility of using ESNs as modeling and control tools is further investigated in two specific power system applications, namely, power system nonlinear load modeling for true load <b>harmonic</b> <b>prediction</b> and the closed-loop control of active filters for power quality assessment and enhancement. It is shown that in both applications, ESNs are capable of providing satisfactory performances with low computational requirements. A novel, more brain-like artificial neural network, i. e. biologically inspired artificial neural network (BIANN), is proposed in this dissertation to bridge the gap between ANNs and LNNs and provide a novel tool for monitoring and control in power systems. A comprehensive survey of the spiking models of living neurons as well as the coding approaches is presented to review the state-of-the-art in BIANN research. The proposed BIANNs are based on spiking models of living neurons with adoption of reservoir-computing approaches. It is shown that the proposed BIANNs have strong modeling capability and low computational requirements, which makes it a perfect candidate for online monitoring and control applications in power systems. BIANN-based modeling and control techniques are also proposed for power system applications. The proposed modeling and control schemes are validated for the modeling and control of a generator in a single-machine infinite-bus system under various operating conditions and disturbances. It is shown that the proposed BIANN-based technique can provide better control of the power system to enhance its reliability and tolerance to disturbances. To sum up, a novel, more brain-like artificial neural network, i. e. biologically inspired artificial neural network (BIANN), is proposed in this dissertation to bridge the gap between ANNs and LNNs and provide a novel tool for monitoring and control in power systems. It is clearly shown that the proposed BIANN-based modeling and control schemes can provide faster and more accurate control for power system applications.

These advantages {{are the same as}} those of the spherical harmonics used in global models if the singularity at the pole points for a globe is considered to be the counterpart of the lateral boundary condition for a limited region. If a limited-area model is nested in a global model, the prediction of the limited-area model at each time step is the sum of the inner part and the <b>harmonic</b> part <b>predictions.</b> The inner part prediction is solved by the double sine series from the inner part equations for the limited-area model.

40|$|The gas-phase {{infrared}} spectra of radical cationic and protonated corannulene were recorded by infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy using the IR {{free electron laser}} for infrared experiments. Electrospray ionization was used to generate protonated corannulene and an IRMPD spectrum was recorded in a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer monitoring H-loss {{as a function of}} IR frequency. The radical cation was produced by 193 -nm UV photoionization of the vapor of corannulene in a 3 D quadrupole trap and IR irradiation produces H, H 2, and C 2 Hx losses. Summing the spectral response of the three fragmentation channels yields the IRMPD spectrum of the radical cation. The spectra were analyzed with the aid of quantum-chemical calculations carried out at various levels of theory. The good agreement of theoretical and experimental spectra for protonated corannulene indicates that protonation occurs on one of the peripheral C-atoms, forming an sp 3 hybridized carbon. The spectrum of the radical cation was examined taking into account distortions of the C 5 v geometry induced by the Jahn-Teller effect {{as a consequence of the}} degenerate 2 E 1 ground electronic state. As indicated by the calculations, the five equivalent Cs minima are separated by marginal barriers, giving rise to a dynamically distorted system. Although in general the character of the various computed vibrational bands appears to be in order, only a qualitative match to the experimental spectrum is found.

In this work, a new approach is suggested for modal identification of a non-linear system. Modal parameters obtained through modal identification are used in <b>harmonic</b> response <b>prediction</b> at different forcing levels. The response at only the fundamental harmonic is considered. The model {{can also be used}} to predict the response of the non-linear system coupled with a linear system and/or subjected to structural modification. An iterative solution method is used in structural dynamic analyses. The identification method proposed is for systems where nonlinearity is between a single coordinate and the ground. Response dependent modal parameters of the non-linear system are obtained via modal testing at different response levels. The method presented is verified through case studies. In the case studies presented, a subsystem with cubic stiffness type non-linearity is considered and the simulated FRFs of the subsystem generated for various response levels are used as pseudo experimental values...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{an active}} {{frequency}} {{with a positive}} feedback in the d-q frame anti-islanding method suitable for a robust phase-locked loop (PLL) algorithm using the FFT concept. In general, PLL algorithms for grid-connected PV PCS use d-q transformation and controllers to make zero an imaginary part of the transformed voltage vector. In a real grid system, the grid voltage is not ideal. It may be unbalanced, noisy and have many harmonics. For these reasons, the d-q transformed components {{do not have a}} pure DC component. The controller tuning of a PLL algorithm is difficult. The proposed PLL algorithm using the FFT concept can use the strong noise cancelation characteristics of a FFT algorithm without a PI controller. Therefore, the proposed PLL algorithm has no gain-tuning of a PI controller, and it is hardly influenced by voltage drops, phase step changes and <b>harmonics.</b> Islanding <b>prediction</b> is a necessary feature of inverter-based photovoltaic (PV) systems {{in order to meet the}} stringent standard requirements for interconnection with an electrical grid. Both passive and active anti-islanding methods exist. Typically, active methods modify a given parameter, which also affects the shape and quality of the grid injected current. In this paper, the active anti-islanding algorithm for a grid-connected PV PCS uses positive feedback control in the d-q frame. The proposed PLL and anti-islanding algorithm are implemented for a 250 kW PV PCS. This system has four DC/DC converters each with a 25 kW power rating. This is only one-third of the total system power. The experimental results show that the proposed PLL, anti-islanding method and topology demonstrate good performance in a 250 kW PV PCS...|$|R
40|$|The {{harmonic}} impact {{caused by}} wind turbines should be carefully investigated before wind turbines are interconnected. However, the harmonic currents of wind turbines {{are not easily}} predicted due to the variations of wind speed. If the harmonic current outputs can be predicted accurately, the harmonic impact of wind turbines and wind farms for power grids can be analyzed efficiently. Therefore, this paper analyzes the harmonic current characteristics of wind turbines and investigates the feasibility of developing harmonic current predictors. Field measurement, data sorting, and analysis are conducted for wind turbines. Two harmonic current predictors are proposed {{based on the measured}} harmonic data. One is the Auto-Regressive and Moving Average (ARMA) -based harmonic current predictor, which can be used for real-time prediction. The other is the stochastic harmonic current predictor considering the probability density distributions of harmonic currents. It uses the measured harmonic data to establish the probability density distributions of harmonic currents at different wind speeds, and then uses them to implement a long-term <b>harmonic</b> current <b>prediction.</b> Test results use the measured data to validate the forecast ability of these two harmonic current predictors. The ARMA-based predictor obtains poor performance on some harmonic orders due to the stochastic characteristics of harmonic current caused by the variations of wind speed. Relatively, the prediction results of stochastic harmonic current predictor show that the harmonic currents of a wind turbine in long-term operation can be effectively analyzed by the established probability density distributions. Therefore, the proposed stochastic harmonic current predictor is helpful in predicting and analyzing the possible harmonic problems during the operation of wind turbines and wind farms...|$|R
