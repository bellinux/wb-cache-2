40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{high volume}} {{sampling}} system, employing Nuclepore filters and designed for sampling particulate in the plumes from industrial sources using a light aircraft, is described. The effluent of kraft paper mills was sampled using this system and then analyzed by electron microscopy. Size distributions of particles were obtained at several points downwind in the plume from a kraft mill. The size distribution close into the stack was log normal. There was {{a statistically significant}} reduction in median particle size a mile to two miles downwind of the stack. Also, the size distribution deviated from log normal. Several possible mechanisms are postulated as causes for this phenomena. Plume dilution with particles of smaller average size {{appeared to be a}} significant factor in causing the decrease. The median particle size close to the kraft mill was about 0. 35 micrometers. At downwind points it was found to be as low as 0. 15 micrometers. Chemical identification of kraft mill particles was accomplished using electron diffraction techniques. Kraft mill salt cake was identified in particulate samples collected as far downwind from the mill as eight miles. Sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) and calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) particles were both identified. Morphological associations were made with chemical identity. Sodium sulfate morphology was related to sampling technique. Due to the presence of water in the plume this compound appeared to have been fluid when sampled, and to have crystallized as a hydrate in a flat, smeared form on the filter. Calcium carbonate was a relatively large <b>flaky</b> <b>particle</b> appearing in both anhydrous and hydrated forms. Approximately 100 electron micrographs including both transmission and scanning micrographs are presented which support the sizing and morphological results...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{a process}} for the {{production}} of aluminium alloy metal– matrix composites (MMCs) by the liquid metal infiltration route was investigated. This process was based on Al 2 O 3 /SiC ceramic cake in different SiC that was obtained by chemical process rather than mixing of ceramic powders to obtain porous Al 2 O 3 / SiC ceramic foam. This product was heated up in ceramic crucible in the furnace. It was foamed by the effect of heat and as a result Al 2 O 3 /SiC ceramic cake was produced. Resulting Al 2 O 3 grains had 3 D honeycomb structure and SiC particles were in the alumina grains. Consequently, homogeneous powder mix and porosity were obtained within the cake. The morphology of the powder connections was networking with <b>flaky</b> <b>particles.</b> These <b>flaky</b> alumina <b>particles</b> provided huge amount of porosity, which was desired for ceramic preforms to allow liquid metal flow during infiltration.

The monitoring results were important in assessing {{the efficiency of the}} technique towards Batu Pahat marine clay. Two reactors were set up; 1. 0 M of calcium chloride (CaCl 2) and sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3) as the electrolyte and stainless steel plates as the electrodes. EKS technique was continued for 21 days with a constant voltage gradient (50 V/m). This technique was performed in two phases where the alteration of EKS was the combination of stabilizers used. The combinations of stabilizers in phase 1 and 2 were CaCl 2 - distilled water (DW) and CaCl 2 - Na 2 SiO 3, respectively. The technique was monitored using electric current, total inflow and outflow of electrolytes and pH of electrolytes. It showed fluctuated profiles of electric current for both phases, attributed by the introduction of calcium ions from the anode compartment. The inflow and outflow of electrolytes results showed that electromigration and electroosmosis occurred during EKS and it indicated the movement of anion and cation to the opposite direction. The pH of electrolytes kept constant value and balanced by electrolysis process at the cathode.

X-ray diagrams taken of the compressed samples showed that an oriented texture developed (luring the compression, i. e., tile basal planes of the <b>flaky</b> clay <b>particles</b> were arranged parallel to a plane normal to the direction of the applied stress. For the purpose of discussion the concept of the "plastic unit cell " is introduced. The "plastic unit cell " is a cubic volnme element, the faces of which are perpendicular to tile three principal stresses. The size of the "plastic unit cell " is very small as compared with the size of the macroscopic sample but large as compared with the size of one clay particle. It is the smallest unit for all considerations where macroscopic strain and stress distributions are involved. For all considerations involving the correlation between the characteristic strain-stress function of the material, the motions of the clay particles and water, and the forces present between the particles, the "plastic unit cell " is the largest unit. The clay particle in itself is rigid and, therefore, it cannot undergo the same deformation as does the "plastic unit cell". All of the clay particles present in a "plastic unit cell " together can go through a series of motions (translations and rotations) which, in effect, simulate the deformation of the "plastic unit cell". In the case of the compression test, the translatory and rotatory movements of the clay particles lead {{to the development of the}} oriented texture...|$|R
40|$|The {{particle}} shape {{characteristics of the}} coarse aggregate used can significantly affect the workability, strength, and durability of the concrete produced. However, traditionally, {{particle shape}} measurements {{have to be done}} in a manual way that is both cumbersome and time-consuming. Herein, digital image processing (DIP) techniques are used to analyze the particle shape characteristics of coarse aggregate. The main particle shape characteristics measured are flakiness and elongation. Twenty-five aggregate samples of different rock type and size have been analyzed and the results are compared to results obtained by the traditional manual method. Strong correlation between the DIP and manual measurement results is achieved and thus the DIP method, which is much faster, may be a better alternative for particle shape measurement. In fact, the DIP method yields more information about the particle shape than the manual method. With the DIP method used, it is possible to measure the mean thickness/breadth and length/breadth ratios of the aggregate directly, rather than just the proportion of <b>flaky</b> or elongated <b>particles</b> according to arbitrary definitions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The durability of construction aggregates will therefore depend upon the quality of aggregate mechanical properties. It is therefore important to understand how particle shape will effect mechanical properties of aggregates, measured by the Los Angeles and micro-Deval values. In order to assess the influence of particle shape on aggregate mechanical properties, the proportion of <b>flaky</b> and cubic <b>particles,</b> measured by the flakiness index (FI), was artificially varied in a series of tests for six different rock types. All in all 69 Los Angeles and 69 micro-Deval tests were performed according to European standards. The main findings are that the standard Los Angeles (LA) and micro-Deval (MD) test methods which measure the amounts of fines (< 1. 6 mm) produced by impact and/or wear are generally not sensitive to variations in the flakiness index (FI). The LAx and MDx values, which are measured by the amounts of material passing the lower fraction of the size range, are more sensitive to variations in the flakiness index (FI). Sieve analysis also shows that the standard LA and MD method of measuring production of fines is not always a good indicator of aggregate breakdown and may in some cases ignore increased breakdown of the aggregate coarser than 1. 6 mm. The LAx and MDx values better demonstrate the behavior of the aggregate coarser than 1. 6 mm and give better information about the extent of aggregate breakdown...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 New {{chemical}} synthesis strategies {{have been investigated}} for the preparation of acceptor-type graphite intercalation compounds (GIC's) with fluoroanions {{in order to obtain}} new materials and to develop {{a better understanding of the}} synthetic approaches and properties of the products. New GIC's containing borate chelate anion such as bis(oxalato) borate, CxB[OC(O) C(O) O]₂•δF, are prepared by the chemical oxidation of graphite with fluorine gas in the presence of a solution containing the intercalate anion in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. Due to the chemical method employed (F₂/AHF as the oxidizing agent), fluoride co-intercalates are present in the galleries. The GIC's compositions are determined using a newly-developed digestion method with an ion-selective electrode and potentiometer. The composition parameters x and δ are obtained using both elemental and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Elemental analyses of B and F for a stage 1 GIC indicate x [approximately equal to] 41 and δ [approximately equal to] 4. Powder XRD data and the structural refinement of these GIC's show that the intercalate anions "stand up" in the galleries, with the longer anion dimension oriented perpendicular to the graphene sheets, leading to the relatively large gallery height of di [approximately equal to] 1. 42 nm. The same {{chemical synthesis}} strategy is also used for chemical preparations of other two borate chelate GIC's; bis(perfluoropinacolato) borate, CxB[OC(CF₃) ₂C(CF 3) ₂O]₂•δF, and bis(hexafluorohydroxyisobutyrato) borate, CxB[OC(CF₃) ₂C(O) O]₂•δF. Stage 1 GIC's of these anions are obtained with the gallery height, di, of 1. 43 - 1. 45 nm. The fluoride co-intercalate contents in these GIC samples are also determined. The composition parameters x and δ are obtained using elemental analyses for stage 1 CxB[OC(CF₃) ₂C(CF₃) ₂O] 2 •δF and for stage 1 CxB[OC(CF₃) ₂C(O) O]₂•δF. TGA cannot be used to confirm these compositions due to the incomplete degradation of intercalates. Most likely, anions and their degradation products are trapped in the bulk of the large <b>flaky</b> graphite <b>particles.</b> The detailed compositions of GIC's containing bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide, CxN(SO₂CF₃) ₂•δF, and perfluorooctanesulfonate, CxC₈F₁₇SO₃•δF and fluoride co-intercalates are determined for the first time. These GIC's are prepared in aqueous HF, using K₂MnF₆ as the oxidizing agent. The fluoride co-intercalate content is approximately equimolar to anion content in both GIC's. For CxN(SO₂CF₃) ₂•δF, the fluoride content increases steadily with reaction time while the anion content is relatively constant. In contrast, CxC₈F₁₇SO₃•δF shows little change in the fluoride content over time...|$|R
40|$|For future {{development}} of automated sensor-based sorting in the mining industry, {{an improvement in}} the separation efficiency of the equipment is desirable. This could be achieved through {{a better understanding of}} the identification and separation aspects of the automated sorter. For automated sorters that undertake separation through the use of compressed air jets, the problem of poor separation efficiency has been linked with co-deflection losses. Co-deflection losses occur as particles meant to pass on to the ‘accept’ bin are co-deflected with the particles (which are to be deflected) meant to go to the ‘reject’ bin. To study co-deflection losses and suggest means of improving automated sorter separation efficiency, this research investigates the effects of particle size, shape, throughput, together with the proportion of particles (out of the total test batch) required to be deflected on separation efficiency. The effect of the air valve configuration on separation efficiency was also studied. Presented also is a mathematical model which could be used to predict automated sorter separation efficiency. All separation efficiency investigations were undertaken using a TiTech Combisense© (BSM 063) automated sorter. Samples of granite were sized into - 20 + 15 mm, - 15 + 10 mm and - 10 + 6 mm size fractions and grouped into cubic and flaky shape fractions. These fractions were then divided into two with one portion painted for colour separation efficiency investigations. The separation efficiency results confirmed earlier research indicating that particle size and the fraction requiring deflection affects separation efficiency, with separation efficiency decreasing with a decrease in particle size and an increase in throughput. It was observed that co-deflection loss occurs when correctly identified ‘accept’ particles are co-deflected due to their close proximity to ‘reject’ particles that are to be deflected. Observations from the tests indicate that an increase in the proportion of particles requiring deflection increases the probability of finding ‘accept’ particles in close proximity to ‘reject’ particles leading to co-deflections. Monte Carlo simulations were used to produce a random distribution of particles on the conveyor belt as would be obtained from actual investigations. From these simulations particle proximity relationships and particle co-deflections were studied. Results indicate that the Monte Carlo simulations under-predicts particle proximity associations. The effect of shape on co-deflection was investigated with results indicating that <b>flaky</b> shaped <b>particles</b> produce higher number of co-deflections compared to cubic shaped particles. It was also observed that the valve sensitivity determined from valve opening and closing times is of importance to the selectivity (precision) of the separating air jets. A mathematical separation efficiency model is presented which contains two variables, the belt loading (calculated using particle size, shape and throughput) and the particle fraction of the total test batch that are to be deflected (% deflection). The separation efficiency can be calculated once these two variables are determined. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceAKUTECHGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|On {{the long}} list of {{solid-state}} hydrogen storage materials, magnesium hydride stands out for its relatively high hydrogen storage capacity of 7. 7 wt%, combined with the low cost and abundance of magnesium. For practical applications however, issues such as the slow kinetics and the high stability of magnesium hydride must be resolved {{in order to reduce the}} potential operating temperatures of a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage system. Catalysis has been widely used to improve the hydrogen storage kinetics and thin film techniques have been used to explore novel structures and combinations of materials in order to improve both the kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogen storage in magnesium. The original contribution to knowledge of this work lies in the study and understanding of the evolution of a range of novel thin film multilayer coatings and the effect of the structure, structural evolution and materials on the hydrogen storage properties of these materials, each consisting of 150 layers of magnesium, < 20 nm thick, separated by < 3 nm thick layers of a nickel-rich, iron-based transition metal mix, chromium and vanadium. The samples, as well as a non-catalysed control sample, were produced by means of magnetron-assisted physical vapour deposition and delaminated from the substrate for volumetric, gravimetric and calorimetric hydrogen cycling measurements. The coatings were analysed both before and after hydrogen cycling to understand the structural evolution of the coatings from highly structured thin film multilayers to <b>flaky</b> thin film <b>particles</b> containing finely distributed nano-crystalline catalyst particles. The formation of the intermetallic Mg 2 Ni in one of the samples was found to be beneficial for the hydrogenation kinetics, whilst the dehydrogenation kinetics were found to be affected mostly by the nano-crystalline transition metal phases that formed in the catalysed samples during hydrogen cycling. This resulted in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of magnesium hydride in less than 4 and 13 minutes at 250 °C with activation energies as low as 60. 6 ± 2. 5 kJ mol- 1.

40|$|Brown bread was {{produced}} by adding three bran fractions of different sizes (Pollard 0. 75 mm 1. 8 mm), from the same grist, to a common base white flour. The addition of bran caused loaf volumes to be depressed and crumb structures to be coarse. Bran components appeared to affect gluten functionality by changing its physicochemical characteristics through a subtle interplay of chemical and physical effects. Pollard depressed loaf volumes the most, and Digestive bran the least. This could probably be attributed to differences in chemical composition. Pollard had the highest fat content, and therefore probably the highest lipoxygenase and glutathione concentrations, which adversely affected loaf volume. Subjecting the brans to a dry heat-treatment, which inactivated lipase and reduced the total reducing substances of which glutathione is part, increased loaf volume. This suggests that a chemical effect of the bran (probably the lipid metabolising enzymes lipase and lipoxygenase, as well as glutathione) is {{at least in part}} responsible for loaf volume depression. Heat treatment had the greatest effect on decreasing loaf volume depression in breads baked with Pollard and the least on breads Baked with Digestive bran, indicating a greater chemical effect in brans with smaller particle size. A similar baking study was conducted with bran from 10 widely differing wheat samples (all of the same nominal particle size range). The different brans caused different levels of loaf volume depression. In all cases, dry heat-treatment of the brans decreased total reducing substances, inactivated lipase and increased loaf volume and height. However, the loaves still differed somewhat in volume. It is possible that differences in chemical composition of the different bran sources also accounted for these differences in loaf volume depression. In addition to the difference in chemical compositions of the different brans, the higher loaf volumes of breads baked with Digestive bran, compared to those baked with Pollard, could also possibly be explained by the large, <b>flaky</b> Digestive bran <b>particles</b> trapping air bubbles in the dough. These air bubbles possibly provided extra nucleation sites for gas cells, as well as oxygen, which improved oxidation of the gluten and functioning of the oxidising agent ascorbic acid. The theory that Digestive bran particles trap air, could also probably explain why at low levels of addition, breads baked with Digestive bran had higher loaf volumes than the white bread controls. However, for large bran particles to be able to increase loaf volume, they have to be free of epicarp hairs. Heat treatment did not result in all the brans producing loaves of the same volume, suggesting that a physical effect of the bran is also responsible for loaf volume depression. CAT scanning of proofing dough showed a uniform crumb structure in white bread dough in contrast with bubbles in brown bread dough, which were large and irregular. Bubbles became more elongated as proofing progressed. Bran probably ruptured the gas cell walls of the foam structure, leading to coalescence of the bubbles. Coalescence caused larger and irregular bubbles with lower internal pressures, probably resulting in lower loaf volumes. It is concluded that there is a subtle interplay between the chemical and physical effects of bran on brown bread, which determines the extent of loaf volume depression. The addition of either large, epicarp hair free bran particles, or heat-treated smaller bran particles to white base flour are potential methods of optimising brown bread loaf size.
