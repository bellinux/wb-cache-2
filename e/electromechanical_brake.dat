40|$|In <b>electromechanical</b> <b>brakes,</b> central {{controllers}} require {{accurate information}} about the clamp force between brake pad and disc {{as a function of}} pad displacement. This function is usually denoted as characteristic curve of the caliper. In a typical <b>electromechanical</b> <b>braking</b> system, clamp force measurements vary with actuator displacements in a hysteretic manner. Due to ageing, temperature and other environmental variations, the hysteretic characteristic curve of calliper varies with time. Therefore, automatic caliper calibration in real time is vital for high-performance braking action and vehicle safety. Due to memory and processing power limitations, the calibration technique should be memory efficient and of low computational complexity. This chapter investigates the hysteresis as a nonlinear effect in the <b>electromechanical</b> <b>brakes,</b> and describes a technique to parametrically model this effect. This technique is a simple and memory-efficient real-time calibration method in which a Maxwell-slip model is fitted to the data samples around each hysteresis cycle.

40|$|The {{significance}} of the braking devices is increasing due to the intensification of manufacturing, increase in the moving masses, speeds of movement and frequency of braking. During a short time period the braking device needs to convert {{a significant amount of}} mechanical energy into heat energy and transfer it into the environment without compromising the operability of both devices and machines in general. For electric actuators braking a normally closed mechanical brake is frequently used. When disconnecting the motor from the network the brake friction surfaces are closed and prevent rotation, and when the motor is switched on, they are opens under the action of the electromagnet, electro-hydraulic pusher, special electric motor, mechanical or pneumatic device. In the case of joint implementation of the asynchronous motor and the mechanical brake, the drive of quick stop is more compact and convenient. Such devices are further called asynchronous motors with <b>electromechanical</b> <b>braking</b> systems henceforth. The large number of requirements as well as different conditions of operation cause a large variety of designs of such motors. One of the major shortcomings of the functioning of well-known design is the periodic wear of the friction linings and the need for frequent replacement of them. The solution to this problem is the use of asynchronous motor with recessed combo braking device. However, for some mechanisms that do not require a smooth stop of the motor shaft and that have a speed of rotation of the motor shaft less than 1500 rpm, more simple and cheap solution would be the use of an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>braking</b> device with an air gap compensation. Due to wear of the friction linings the air gap of the electromagnet increases. Due to the compensation of the air gap of the electromagnet these devices make it possible to rub the material of the friction lining longer. The current designs of the <b>electromechanical</b> <b>braking</b> device with compensation of the air gap are quite bulky and complicated to be manufactured. Therefore, the authors developed, experimentally investigated and implemented two new, simple and cheap designs of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>braking</b> device with compensation of the air gap. </p...|$|R

At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the brake device and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical slip clutch and control circuit.

The engine test cell was developed several years ago; over years, the engine operations and performance have been changed, in terms of output power and torque, entailing more severe dynamic loads affecting the driveline members. In this scenario, early failures of the rubber elements of the flexible coupling have occurred. The goal is to solve the problem by bringing the fewest possible modifications to the cell layout. An experimental campaign was thus carried out, with the aim of characterizing the current system dynamic behavior and finding possible modifications able to solve the problem.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{practically}} important {{issues associated with}} the development of an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>brake</b> (EMB, Brake-by-wire) and its safety control in early design stage. ^ The first issue is the development of an analytical dynamic model which should have all relevant degrees of freedom without being unnecessarily complex so as to be useful in PC simulation environment. This objective is achieved through the analytical model development of all relevant hardware components of EMB and modal analysis of its linearized approximation for model reduction. This model fulfills the need arising due to the nonexistence of an analytical model for EMB. The developed model has six degrees of freedom (DOF) and includes essential nonlinearities such as gear backlashes, Coulomb frictions, and disk air gap clearance. ^ The second issue is concerned with the safety control of EMB, either in case of force sensor failure or without using expensive force sensor for cost-saving purposes. To establish a force feedback structure without using force sensor, two simplified models are developed for contacting phase and non-contacting phase respectively, and a novel model based edge detection method is proposed and evaluated. Various parameter estimations are then performed to find realistic ways to obtain accurate and reliable estimates of key system parameters on-line to deal with the large operating ranges and changing working conditions of EMB. In addition, to deal with various nonlinearities and uncertain system parameters associated with an EMB, an advanced indirect adaptive robust controller (IARC) incorporated with the air gap management is designed for the entire brake operation to ensure a robust control performance. Extensive simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the analytical model and the achievable control performance of the imbedded IARC design without force sensor. Simulation results reveal that, in terms of transient tracking performance for ABS cycling, the proposed IARC clamping force controller without using force sensor shows much better results than the conventional PI controller with using force sensor. Thus, aside from the benefit of providing a fail-safe control strategy for force sensor failure, a much more stringent ABS cycle than currently used can be achieved with the proposed IARC to improve the friction force between the tire and the road for a shorter stopping distance. Such a much improved clamping force control performance is also vital for future advanced vehicle control using EMB. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{braking system}} {{is one of}} the major factors {{affecting}} a vehicle’s performance. The future of the automotive industry thrives by the creation of a greener, more efficient and lightweight braking mechanisms. Research on utilizing electromechanical brakes have shown potential due to their superior performance and controllability. The magnetorheological Brake (MRB) is a promising <b>electromechanical</b> <b>brake</b> which can provide variable damping through variation of the MR fluids’ apparent viscosity and yield strength using the applied magnetic field. Fast response time, low power requirement and large dynamic range are among unique features of MRBs making them an ideal candidate for vehicle applications. While some design configurations have been proposed for applying MRBs in the automotive industry, the commercial application has not yet been fully realized mainly due to the existence of their zero-field viscous torque. The focal purpose of this study is to propose and develop a novel real-size vehicle model of the MRB design with absolutely no energy loss in terms of viscous torque generation. The design is achieved using permanent magnets which force the MR fluid volume to shift locations between the brake’s operating modes – ‘on’ and ‘off’ – to allow complete de-coupling. The performance of the proposed design compared with the conventional design is demonstrated on a 2 -disk-type MRB configuration. The Herschel-Bulkley constitutive model is adopted for the MR fluid to derive the mathematical equations governing the systems’ braking torques as a function of the rotational speed, geometric properties, and applied electrical current. The MR fluid selected for the proposed designs is MRF- 132 DG from Lord Corporation. Analytical magnetic circuit analysis of the MRB design has been conducted which allows to approximately derive the relation between the magnetic field intensity and the electric current as a function of number of coil turns and the brake’s geometric variables. The analytical model is then verified using an electromagnetic finite element model developed in open source FEMM software. An equation relating densities of the materials used in the MRB and their corresponding dimensions is also derived to estimate the weight of the proposed MRB. Subsequently, a multidisciplinary design optimization problem has been formulated to identify the optimal brake geometrical parameters to maximize the dynamic range of the MRBs under weight, size and magnetic flux density constraints. The optimization problem has been solved using Genetic Algorithm (GA) followed by the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) technique implemented in the MATLAB environment to achieve the true global optimal design. It is shown that the proposed MRB design provides better performance specifications under the required design constraints while having zero viscous torque generation making it suitable for application in real commercial vehicles. Finally, a simple dynamic quarter-vehicle model integrated with the optimally designed MRB has been considered to investigate the brake performance in automotive application. A PID control scheme has been designed for optimal wheel slip control over different road surface conditions. The objective is to obtain the highest value possible for the road-friction coefficient. This is possible through regulating and maintaining the slip ratio to a desired value whether driving on dry, wet, snowy or icy roads. The controller is purposed to enhance the overall braking properties of a vehicle through reducing the stopping distance and time, enhancing stability, and avoiding wheel lockup...|$|E

40|$|Resolver sensors are {{utilized}} as absolute position transducers {{to control}} the position and speed of actuators in many industrial applications. The accuracy and convergence of the position and speed measurements provided by resolvers in <b>electromechanical</b> <b>braking</b> system (EMB) designs directly contribute to the braking performance and vehicle safety. In practice, the dc drifts, amplitudes, and phase shift of the resolver signals vary with aging and temperature, and adaptive techniques are required for the calibration of these parameters of resolvers. Existing classical adaptive techniques such as recursive least squares are unable to track the parameters during resting (low-speed actuation or stationary) periods and also a transient period after them. This paper proposes a new approach for real-time tracking of resolver parameters specially developed for actuator-control applications with varying speed and long resting periods. We formulate the algebraic relationship between the resolver parameters and the parameters of resolver characteristic ellipse, which is the ellipse formed by plotting the resolver signals versus each other. Having known the characteristic ellipse parameters, the resolver parameters are calculated using the formulated algebraic relation. Then, a new recursive and adaptive estimator is proposed to track the parameters of characteristic ellipse.

PURPOSE: The objectives of the present study were evaluate VO 2 peak and the power output (W) during a leg and an arm test performance in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) versus healthy people (HP). METHODS: Twelve women (age 45. 8 ± 11. 8 yr) with MS (EDSS 3. 3 ± 1. 8) and twelve women (age 45. 6 ± 10. 7 yr) HP were included in this study. They underwent two incremental exercise tests on an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>braked</b> arm crank ergometer and on an electromagnetic braked leg cycling ergometer separately. A computerized gas analysis system collected and analyzed gas exchange during the two kinds of testing. The statistical analysis was determined with the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: First, VO 2 peak (21. 5 ± 5. 9 vs. 30. 5 ± 4. 8 ml·kg·min- 1, p = 0. 001) y W (84. 5 ± 30. 1 vs. 141. 0 ± 13. 7, Watt, p = 0. 0001) during cycle ergometer test were significantly lower in MS compared with HP.
