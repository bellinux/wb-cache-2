25|$|Intended to paralyse black {{opposition}} and prevent political violence, {{the state of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>proved</b> a self-fulfilling prophecy. State repression deepened black alienation from the regime and suggested to some that peaceful political organising was a dead end. With the black leadership in detention, the political vacuum was filled by the more militantly inclined. In July and October 1960 large-scale demonstrations and rioting broke out in black townships.|$|R

50|$|The Emergency {{declared}} in 1975 (internal <b>emergency)</b> <b>proved</b> {{to be the}} most controversial. There was widespread criticism of the misuse of Emergency powers. In the elections held to the Lok Sabha in 1977 after the Emergency, the Congress Party led by Indira Gandhi lost and the Janta Party came to power. This government appointed the Shah Commission to investigate the circumstances that warranted the declaration of an Emergency in 1975. The commission did not justify the declaration of the Emergency. Hence, the 44th Amendment Act was enacted in 1978 to introduce a number of safeguards against the misuse of Emergency provisions.|$|R

Consequently, Ram and his supporters resigned from the government and the Indian National Congress in January 1977, denouncing Indira Gandhi and her Emergency rule.|$|R

The NSW Minister for Finance and Services Greg Pearce {{directed}} the Sydney Desalination Plant to reduce supply to about 90 million litres a day.

When the dam storage level reached 90% capacity, the Minister directed the Sydney Desalination Plant to cease production on 2 July 2012. Production will recommence when dam storage levels reach 70% and will remain in production until dam storage levels reach 80%.|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the {{efficiency}} of electrical conductivity test in {{evaluating the quality of}} castor seeds. Emergence of seedlings was evaluated in the field, with five seed lots of cv. AL Guarany 2002. The seeds were submitted to the following tests: germination; first count of germination; accelerated aging (45 degrees C by 24 to 100 % UR), emergence of seedlings in the field, rate of speed of development of seedlings and electrical conductivity, testing the periods (2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours) and the number of seeds (25, 50 and 75) in 75 ml of distilled water conditioning to 25 degrees C. A completely randomized design was used. The averages were compared by the Tukey test at 5 %. The mean laboratory and field test data were correlated.

25|$|While deep, the {{depression}} was also brief. The interwar <b>period</b> <b>proved</b> a <b>period</b> of recovery for Ballarat {{with a number}} of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system. In 1930, Ballarat Airport was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city. During World War II an expanded Ballarat airport was the base of the RAAF Wireless Air Gunners' School as well as the base for USAAF Liberator bomber squadrons. In 1942, Ballarat became connected to the state electricity grid by a 66,000 kV line. Prior to this, power supply was generated locally.|$|R
40|$|Aim. Circumferential {{reconstruction}} of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is most frequently performed in two sessions. The authors assessed feasibility, safety and {{results of a}} surgical technique in which {{the use of a}} small cage allows a less invasive strategy. In addition, since the authors perform urgent decompression in specific cases of spinal cord injury, feasibility of this technique in emergency was verified. Methods. In two Neurosurgical Departments, between May 2001 and May 2006, 62 patients with thoracic or lumbar fractures were operated on using this technique. X-rays were performed postoperatively and around 45 days from surgery. Three-dimension-computed tomography (3 D-CT) scans were performed at 3, 6 and 12 months. Neurological evaluations were repeated at every outpatient visit. After screw insertion at the adjacent levels and traditional transpedicular circumferential decompression, further bone is removed to excavate a niche in the vertebral body and the contiguous discs are removed. The expandable cage, filled with bone fragments, is inserted horizontal or oblique laterally to the sac and applied vertical inside that niche and then expanded. The circumferential stabilization is completed with bone grafting and posterior instrumentation. Results. 3 D-CT scans showed sound fusion and no manifest correction loss. Nineteen patients improved at least one grade in the ASIA scale and 11 gained neuromeric levels. Conclusion. This technique, fairly undemanding and feasible also in <b>emergency,</b> <b>proved</b> to be safe and resistant. Two-year follow-up demonstrated thriving fusion and steady alignment. It is a valuable surgical therapy to selected cases of burst fracture. ...|$|R
