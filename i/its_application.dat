40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. <b>ITS</b> <b>Applications</b> have {{in recent years}} {{assisted}} in {{reducing the number of}} fatalities in Europe. However, Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) have not benefited as much as vehicle users. The EU-sponsored VRUITS project assesses the safety and mobility impacts of <b>ITS</b> <b>applications</b> for VRUs, assesses the impacts of current and upcoming <b>ITS</b> <b>applications</b> on the safety and mobility of VRUs, identifies how the usability and efficiency of <b>ITS</b> <b>applications</b> can be improved, and recommends which actions have to be taken at a policy level to improve ITS safety and mobility. This paper describes the results of {{the first phase of the}} project, in which the critical scenarios for VRUs are identified starting from accident data analysis, and following a user needs based on focus groups and expert interviews. From this basis, the most promising <b>ITS</b> <b>applications</b> for VRUs are selected according to their potential to address the specific needs of VRUs...|$|R

5|$|The {{multifaceted}} {{nature of}} design management leads to varied opinion, {{making it difficult}} to give an overall definition; furthermore, design managers have a broad range of roles and responsibilities. These factors, combined with a multitude of other influences such as the industry involved, company size, the market situation, and the importance of design within the organization's activities. As a result, design management is not restricted to a single design discipline and usually depends on the context of <b>its</b> <b>application</b> within an individual organization.|$|E
5|$|After the loss, MacShara {{withdrew from}} the case but Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long-arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional. Citing a similar case, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision. The court also agreed with Rudzewicz's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida's long arm statute in <b>its</b> <b>application</b> to the case.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} the invasion, Portugal cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Indonesia {{and went on to}} support UN resolutions condemning the invasion.

Portugal's criticism mounted sharply from the mid-1980s, and due to public pressure, the country became one of the highest profile campaigners in international forums for East Timorese self-determination.
