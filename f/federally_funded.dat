5|$|In August 1990, {{four months}} after Ryan's death, Congress enacted The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (often known simply as the Ryan White CARE Act), in his honor. The act is the United States' largest <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> program for people living with HIV/AIDS. The Ryan White CARE Act funds {{programs}} to improve availability of care for low-income, uninsured and under-insured victims of AIDS and their families.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aircraft}} in the CAP fleet are equipped with the SDIS. This system allows CAP to send back real-time images of a disaster or crash site to anyone with an e-mail address, allowing the mission coordinators to make more informed decisions.

5|$|US40 {{followed}} {{the route of}} the National Road through Pennsylvania and Maryland. The National Road was the first <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> road built in the United States, authorized by Congress in 1806. Construction lasted from 1811 to 1837, establishing a road that extended from Cumberland to Vandalia, Illinois. Upon the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, {{the route of the}} National Road became part of US40.|$|E

Those measures {{have been a part}} of a general plan of religious administration that has included running religious programming on state television, <b>federally</b> <b>funding</b> the building of mosques and the restorations of shrines, and the promotion of the official government muftiyat to smooth connections between the state and Islamic believers.|$|R
5|$|Following her husband's death, Reagan {{remained}} {{active in}} politics, particularly relating to stem cell research. Beginning in 2004, she favored what many {{consider to be}} the Democratic Party's position, and urged President George W. Bush to support <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> embryonic stem cell research, in the hope that this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support his campaign for a second term.|$|E
5|$|The Young Adult Conservation Corps {{was also}} based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> program {{employed}} up to 45young people for local conservation {{projects in the}} state parks and forests and on state game lands. In addition, Sylvania Electric Products used two buildings in the industrial complex as warehouses for light bulbs until 1993. In 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation began a heavy equipment training school at Piper, which is still in operation.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, Commissioner Tanya Perrin-Johnson wrote {{a series}} of e-mails that were sent to about 20 {{employees}} in her department directing them {{to work on the}} mayor's re-election campaign. The Office of Special Counsel began an investigation to determine whether the e-mails represented a violation of the federal Hatch Act, which, among other things, prohibits employees involved in <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> programs from using their authority to influence political campaigns. As a result of the probe, in 2010 the Common Council decided to delay her reappointment as commissioner until the investigation concluded. She had been serving in an interim capacity. In April 2011, Perrin-Johnson resigned her position.|$|E

50|$|Pat Buchanan {{selected}} Foster as his running-mate {{after several}} other candidates such as Jim Traficant of Ohio and Teamsters Union president James P. Hoffa declined his offer. Foster, who had supported Buchanan's campaigns in 1992 and 1996, quit her own speaking tour {{to join the}} race. While Buchanan was hospitalized during part of the campaign, Foster was the ticket's mouthpiece, campaigning through television and radio appearances. This {{was the first time}} in history that an African-American had been nominated for Vice-President by a Federal Election Commission-recognized and <b>federally</b> <b>funding</b> political party, and the second time a woman had accomplished this (Democrat Geraldine Ferraro being the first).|$|R
40|$|The {{debate about}} whether to <b>federally</b> <b>fund</b> human {{embryonic}} stem cell research is at root a controversy about the legal status that should be accorded the human embryo. The undisputed, scientifically verifiable facts agreed to by even the most liberal proponents of human {{embryonic stem cell research}} are that (1) the embryo is living and genetically unique; (2) the embryo is human and capable of developing into an adult; and (3) derivation of human stem cells from embryos terminates them. Although philosophical and political disagreement subsequently arises about whether the embryo should be deemed a juridical person, quasi-person, or non-person, we have not adequately addressed the significance of these three undisputed facts for regulating embryonic stem cell research...|$|R
5|$|OTA {{announced}} plans to include sound barriers at three points along the turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations {{because they did not}} meet other criteria, including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> project, it opted to do so anyway.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Georgia and Duke University, Boyd began in academia {{as a professor of}} physics at West Georgia College. He then became a professor at Georgia Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay: <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers Gerald Rosselot and Glen P. Robinson, Boyd was influential in the founding of Scientific Atlanta, where he was a board member for 25 years. As director of the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research at Georgia Tech with a radioisotopes laboratory and the construction of the Frank H. Neely Research Reactor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, the eastern United States {{experienced}} generally hot and dry weather, leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same general area. After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water, but the legislators and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European socialism; this was {{in contrast to the}} <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> Tennessee Valley Authority, which mitigated flooding along the Tennessee River.|$|E

Other bills he opposed were: the Relief Act (1936), the Holding Company Act (1936), the Guffey-Snyder Coal Act to help raise the price of Pennsylvania's coal (1936); the Soil Conservation and Relief Act to reforest land (1938) and federal Crop Insurance (1938).|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we explore}} the tax-expenditure {{behavior}} of sub na-tional governments {{in a federal}} economy with interregional grants. Here, local public goods are produced through <b>federally</b> <b>funds</b> and (costly) local revenues, and have inter-jurisdictional spillover e¤ects. Sub national governments can choose either revenue or expenditure to maximise their bene 8 ̆ 5 t. The direction and magnitude of federal fund ow (that determine the local provision of public goods {{as well as the}} choice of optimizing instrument) are inuenced by the re-election prob-ability of the parties in power at the federal and provincial levels. We endogenise the policy choice (trevenue or expenditure) and show that, in presence of politics (modeled through a simple probabilistic voting environment), such a choice may bear a one-to-one relationship with the political identity of the province.

5|$|Although Fillmore {{had retired}} from the {{legislature}} after the 1831 session, he did not remain absent from politics for long. In 1832, {{he ran for the}} House of Representatives, and was elected. The Anti-Masonic presidential candidate, former Attorney General William Wirt, won only Vermont as President Jackson easily gained re-election. At the time, Congress convened its annual session in December, and so Fillmore had to wait {{more than a year after}} his election to take his seat. Fillmore, Weed, and others had realized that opposition to Masonry was too narrow a foundation on which to build a national party, and assembled the broad-based Whig Party from National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs were initially united by their opposition to Jackson, but became a major party by expanding their platform to include support for economic growth through rechartering the Second Bank of the United States and <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> internal improvements including roads, bridges, and canals. Weed joined the Whigs before Fillmore, and became a power within the party; his anti-slavery views were stronger than Fillmore's (who, though he disliked slavery, deemed the federal government without power over it), and closer to those of another prominent New York Whig, William H. Seward of Auburn, who was also seen as a Weed protégé.|$|E
5|$|MD 704 {{follows the}} {{abandoned}} {{right of way}} of the defunct WB Railway, an interurban railroad that included a northsouth line between Washington and Baltimore and a branch to Annapolis from Naval Academy Junction in Odenton. Construction on the electric railway began in 1902 and service began between the three cities in 1908. The WB went into receivership in 1931 and shut down in 1935. The Maryland State Roads Commission converted the abandoned railroad right of way into a two-lane highway from the District of Columbia line to US 50 (now MD 450) near Lanham between 1942 and 1944. The WB {{had a pair of}} timber bridges across its right of way. The Chapel Road bridge in Seat Pleasant, which carried what was then MD 389 and is now Addison Road across the railroad, was removed; the junction was regraded as an intersection with the new highway. In 1944, the War Production Board authorized the replacement of MD 202's bridge across the abandoned railroad {{as one of the few}} nonwar-effort highway projects <b>federally</b> <b>funded</b> during World War II. Construction on the new steel-and-concrete bridge began in late 1944 and was completed by 1946. Access between the grade-separated highways at the MD 202MD 704 junction was via a pair of two-way ramps.|$|E

40|$|Because {{settlement}} proceeds {{allocated for}} tobacco control in Texas are insufficient for statewide activity at <b>federally</b> recommended <b>funding</b> levels, the Texas Department of State Health Services {{has used the}} available funds in quasi-experimental pilot studies in which varying amounts of support are provided for selected parts of the state. Trends in tobacco use were measured in telephone surveys of 7, 998 (2000), 5, 150 (2002), and 5, 721 (2004) adults. Prevalence of cigarette smoking declined by almost one-third in the pilot area where comprehensive and sustained pilot activities to reduce tobacco use were organized at close to the <b>federally</b> recommended <b>funding</b> level. Significantly smaller reductions were observed {{in other parts of}} the state. In the group with the highest use, white non-Hispanic men, cigarette consumption declined by half in the pilot area.
