General type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> are expected to further extend this capability.

This paper introduces an alternative approach termed zSlices for representing general type- 2 sets based on interval type- 2 sets. Thus, this will lead to a smooth transition from interval to general type- 2 fuzzy systems. The proposed approach will lead to a significant reduction in both the complexity and the computational requirements for general type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>logic</b> <b>systems.</b> Hence, this will lead to facilitating the application of general type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>logic</b> to many real world applications.
