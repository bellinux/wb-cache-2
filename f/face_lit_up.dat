25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of some strange event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in the lamps, and that could explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and the leftovers would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would have been even more attracted to the oil in the lamps. Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up its hind legs to reach the lamp, with its <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> and eyes round with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E

Go home, get your England stuff ready, and I'll call first thing tomorrow...' Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice, this was still fantastic news... After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, {{and the opportunity to}} set the record straight... the telephone finally rang. 'Got some bad news, I'm afraid,' David began. 'I couldn't persuade Ted Dexter or Mickey Stewart, so you're not in any more. They've gone for Alan Igglesden. Know anything about him?' With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the Today newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gregor von Rezzori {{wrote of}} Kraus, [...] " [...] life stands {{as an example}} of moral uprightness and courage which should be put before anyone who writes, in no matter what language... I had the {{privilege}} of listening to his conversation and watching his <b>face,</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> by the pale fire of his fanatic love for the miracle of the German language and by his holy hatred for those who used it badly." ...|$|E
60|$|Up to {{that time}} it is {{probable}} that they believed that they were only being kept to be solemnly put to death. Their <b>faces</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up,</b> and without a word they sprang on to the horses' backs and dashed over the plains.|$|R
60|$|Harker's haggard <b>face</b> {{suddenly}} <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> {{as if with}} infernal flames.|$|R
60|$|He {{opened it}} hurriedly, his <b>face</b> {{suddenly}} <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> by expectation; {{but it was}} Dr Porhoët.|$|R
2500|$|He kept many pets at {{home and}} Surgeon-General Bannerman noted in his preface to Eha's books that he often found himself having to go on {{unpleasant}} trips to the primeval forests of Cumballa Hill to look for mosquito larvae to feed the fish. In appearance Eha {{has been described as}} a long, thin, erect, bearded man...with a typically Scots <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with the humorous twinkle one came to know so well. A photograph taken in 1902 shows a fringe of hair encircling a bald head which is commented upon by Bannerman as [...] "a condition which Kemp's Equatorial Hair Douche had not been able to prevent".|$|E
60|$|Passmore's {{withered}} little <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with a {{gleam of}} rare excitement.|$|E

60|$|The two <b>faces</b> were <b>lit</b> <b>up,</b> {{each with}} an {{opposite}} emotion, each with an opposite certitude. Further words were impossible. Romola hastily covered {{her head and}} went out in silence.|$|R
60|$|It is both {{painful and}} {{satisfactory}} {{to think how}} often these antitheses are to be observed in the individual most open to our observation--ourselves. We pass the evening with <b>faces</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> by some flaring illumination or other: we get up the next morning--the fiery jets have all gone out, and nothing confronts us but a few crinkled pipes and sooty wirework, hardly even recalling {{the outline of the}} blazing picture that arrested our eyes before bedtime.|$|R
60|$|I {{gazed at}} this strange girl once more astonished, {{and saw that}} her <b>face</b> was <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with such a light as I had never seen {{in the eyes of}} woman.|$|R
60|$|When he saw Birkin his <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> in a sudden, {{wonderful}} smile.|$|E
60|$|She {{reflected}} for a moment. Then her <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b> She {{pointed down}} the passage.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Parsons came in, and {{her quiet}} <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up,</b> too, as she greeted Mary. She kissed her tenderly.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hicks {{seemed to}} gather courage from his cigar. [...] "You didn't {{expect to find}} a lady {{passenger}} on board, did you?" [...] His poor disagreeable little <b>face</b> was <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with unpleasant enjoyment of the anomaly. Dunham hesitated for an answer.|$|R
60|$|His {{eyes were}} {{flashing}} now and his <b>face</b> was <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> {{so that he}} hardly seemed the same man. There was a flush on his sallow, thin cheeks, and I forgot that his voice was harsh and unpleasant. There was even a certain charm about him.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gogh’s first {{impression}} on seeing {{the painting was}} that Gauguin had depicted him as a madman. He later softened his view. [...] "My <b>face</b> has <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> after all a lot since, but it was indeed me, extremely tired and charged with electricity as I was then".|$|R
60|$|When Jessie {{handed the}} {{telegram}} {{to her father}} he opened it and read the contents eagerly. His <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|His long, thin, dyspeptic <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with {{a certain}} small {{political}} cunning and shrewdness that struck Brace with a half-respect.|$|E
60|$|That {{afternoon}} came a great shouting, and the cracking of whips {{outside the}} cabin. At once Tony Bings's <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|The cab rolled on. Lights from lamp-posts {{flashed in}} at windows. It was a pale, anxious little <b>face</b> that they <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> when they shone upon Jill.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} supper, during dessert, {{the music}} began to play, violins, and flutes. Everybody's <b>face</b> was <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b> A glow of {{excitement}} prevailed. When the little speeches were over, and the port remained unreached for any more, those who wished were invited out to the open for coffee. The night was warm.|$|R
60|$|Gerald's <b>face</b> was <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with {{an uncanny}} smile, full {{of light and}} rousedness, yet unconscious. He sat with his arms on the table, his sunbrowned, rather {{sinister}} hands, that were animal and yet very shapely and attractive, pushed forward towards her. And they fascinated her. And she knew, she watched her own fascination.|$|R
60|$|Trent was on {{the point}} of an angry negative. Suddenly he stopped--hesitated--and said nothing Monty's <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with sudden hope.|$|E
60|$|Without {{letting go}} his hold of me he turned about, his <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> bright as {{day by the}} full moon.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> for a moment. Her {{beautiful}} {{eyes were}} soft, {{although a few}} seconds later they were swimming with tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is natural}} {{that you should}} feel disappointed," [...] replied the doctor. [...] "I would myself earnestly advise you to try the effect of placing him at some other--" [...] The doctor stopped. The lady's <b>face</b> had <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with a {{wonderful}} smile, and she had raised her hand with a bewitching gesture of protest.|$|R
60|$|The {{pressman}} {{folded it}} up silently, {{and passed it}} back. He looked at the huge pile of correspondence and at Brooks--his dark thoughtful <b>face</b> suddenly <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with a rare gleam of excitement. In his own mind {{he was making a}} thumb-nail sketch of these things. There was material for one of those broad, suggestive articles which his editor loved. He wished Brooks good-night.|$|R
50|$|As Kate {{follows a}} trail {{leading to the}} barracks, they end up getting into a fight about Jack and Kate dislocates Juliet's shoulder. Juliet's yell of pain attracts the smoke monster, and they quickly run into the roots of a banyan tree for cover. The Monster roils {{up in front of}} them, and Juliet's <b>face</b> is <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> by a series of bright flashes of light. The monster then retreats, leaving Juliet terrified.|$|R
6000|$|The German volunteer's <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> for a second, {{then fell}} suspiciously. [...] "Say, Dan, vos dis a choke maype?" [...] he said slowly.|$|E
60|$|Baron Conrad {{broke into}} a great, loud laugh, but Abbot Otto's sad and {{thoughtful}} <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with no shadow of an answering smile.|$|E
60|$|The visitor blinked furtively, and whistled another tune. As {{he looked}} round the room, his eye {{fell on the}} cat. His <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|This ancient {{temple was}} built of rough blocks of lava, and {{was simply a}} roofless {{inclosure}} a hundred and thirty feet long and seventy wide --nothing but naked walls, very thick, but not much higher than a man's head. They will last for ages no doubt, if left unmolested. Its three altars and other sacred appurtenances have crumbled and passed away years ago. It is {{said that in the}} old times thousands of human beings were slaughtered here, in the presence of naked and howling savages. If these mute stones could speak, what tales they could tell, what pictures they could describe, of fettered victims writhing under the knife; of massed forms straining forward out of the gloom, with ferocious <b>faces</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> by the sacrificial fires; of the background of ghostly trees; of the dark pyramid of Diamond Head standing sentinel over the uncanny scene, and the peaceful moon looking down upon it through rifts in the cloud-rack! ...|$|R
60|$|The red {{snow was}} there plain enough {{the next morning}} before the valley was warm with light, and while Minnie, her mother, and aunt Kate were still peacefully sleeping. And Mr. Lee had kept his word, and was evidently seeking it, for he and Falkner were already urging their horses through the pass, with their <b>faces</b> towards and <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> by its glow.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so, too," [...] Mrs. Cunningham agreed. [...] "I am {{sure that}} even had the Squire's death come quietly, {{in the course of}} nature, {{it would have been a}} terrible blow to him. He was fond of you and Millicent, but his affection for your father was a passion; his <b>face</b> always <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> when he spoke to him. I used to think {{sometimes}} that it was like an old dog with his master. It was quite touching to see them together. I think, Mark, with you, that it is best that it should be as it is." ...|$|R
