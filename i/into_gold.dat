5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} metals were formed. They {{believed}} that different metals could be produced by varying {{the quality and quantity}} of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals <b>into</b> <b>gold,</b> which was the goal of many alchemists.|$|E
5|$|Correspondence of Monteverdi in 1625 and 1626 {{with the}} Mantuan courtier Ercole Marigliani reveals an {{interest}} in alchemy, which apparently Monteverdi had taken up as a hobby.

Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes <b>into</b> <b>gold</b> – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded {{that this would be a}} bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron <b>into</b> <b>gold,</b> the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|Alchemy {{was already}} well {{established}} before {{the rise of}} Islam. It {{was based on the}} belief that substances were made up of the four Aristotelian elements, fire, earth, air, and water in different proportions. Alchemists supposed that gold was the noblest metal, and that other metals formed a series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, too, that a fifth element, the elixir, could transform a base metal <b>into</b> <b>gold.</b> Jabir ibn Hayyan (8th–9th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue to be used when alchemy had transformed into chemistry. Ibn Hayyan identified many substances including sulphuric and nitric acids. He described processes such as sublimation, reduction and distillation. He made use of equipment such as the alembic and the retort stand.|$|E
50|$|Only {{the mercury}} isotope 196Hg, which occurs with a {{frequency}} of 0.15% in natural mercury, {{can be converted}} to gold by slow neutron capture, and following electron capture, decay <b>into</b> <b>gold's</b> only stable isotope, 197Au. When other mercury isotopes are irradiated with slow neutrons, they also undergo neutron capture, but either convert into each other or beta decay into the thallium isotopes 203Tl and 205Tl. Using fast neutrons, the mercury isotope 198Hg, which composes 9.97% of natural mercury, can be converted by splitting off a neutron and becoming 197Hg, which then decays <b>into</b> stable <b>gold.</b> This reaction, however, possesses a smaller activation cross-section and is feasible only with unmoderated reactors.|$|R

5|$|Book Four, The Alchemist, {{takes place}} in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, {{attempts}} to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone (which supposedly can turn Lead <b>into</b> <b>Gold),</b> but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with Alchemy (the prevailing belief of the scholars of the time) and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books (which come to Samarkand via the trade routes {{from all over the}} known world). However, his friends Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{confusion}} regarding the interchange {{of the currency}} with gold, but the system that India follows is that money cannot be exchanged for gold under any circumstances due to gold's lack of liquidity; therefore, money cannot be changed <b>into</b> <b>gold</b> by the RBI.

25|$|Following the {{devaluation}} of silver, and the abandon of silver as a currency standard by Western powers, Japan adopted {{the gold standard}} through the Coinage Law of 1897.
