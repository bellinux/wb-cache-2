5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and Amy Hennig {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The voice actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters. Many of the characters were meant to <b>highlight</b> <b>different</b> aspects of Drake's personality. Reception to {{the characters in the}} series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the believable nature of the characters and their interactions with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise, though one commentator pointed out that the women still fall into cliché roles. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians <b>highlight</b> <b>different</b> specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors <b>highlight</b> <b>different</b> aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E

Mandarin and Tamil language classes will be held in national schools, beginning with a pilot project in 220 schools in 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, it was {{reported}} that recording for the album had started. After Shawnna was removed, Ludacris stated that he still wanted the album to <b>highlight</b> <b>different</b> view points from males and females, so he recorded tracks with Nicki Minaj, Lil' Kim, Eve, Trina, Shawnna, Ciara, Ne-Yo, Monica, Flo Rida and Gucci Mane. Pharrell has been recording with Ludacris and will contribute production and vocals. It was confirmed in mid-2009 and in early 2010 that Bangladesh, Swizz Beatz and J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League had all contributed production to the album.|$|E
25|$|In historiography {{the breakup}} has been {{extensively}} discussed, though scholars <b>highlight</b> <b>different</b> points of contention, adversely interpreted dynamics of the conflict and contrasting methodologies. The most traditional judgement underlines the clash of personalities. Ramón Nocedal, son of political leader and himself raised to be a leader, considered it natural {{that he should have}} succeeded his father. His decisive leadership style and age seniority versus Carlos VII – a charismatic figure anxious not to be reduced to a decorative role by one of his subjects – did not help. In Carlism-biased versions of this theory, Nocedal is characterized by overgrown personal ambitions, in propaganda mocked as “Ramón I Pontifice Rey del Universo” or “Ramón Romea y Nocedal”.|$|E

500|$|Naughty Dog {{consciously}} avoided action game stereotypes, including super-powered {{heroes and}} overly sexualized female characters. They included a large {{cast of characters}} {{to ensure that the}} story was character-driven rather than story-driven. Co-president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells stated, [...] "I honestly think that the key element, {{if you really want to}} boil it down, is characters. People will tell a story, but if it's not a character-driven plot then you are missing something." [...] Many of these characters were specifically designed to <b>highlight</b> <b>different</b> facets of Nathan Drake's personality.|$|E

The episode was directed by John Stuart Scott, his first and only directing credit for the show.

As such, [...] "Andy's Play" [...] {{was one of the first}} episode of the season to specifically highlight [...] "potential heirs to the throne", in this case Ed Helms' character, Andy.|$|E

For the photo of Andrea with her parents, Hathaway posed with her own mother and David Marshall Grant. The Dengel twins recalled being asked every day for three years straight if the Harry Potter advance copies were real; to their great disappointment they were not and in fact were [...] "all gibberish". They eventually auctioned them for $586 on eBay, along with various clothing used in the film, to benefit Dress for Success, a charity which provides business clothing to help women transition into the workforce.|$|E

The entry was directed by Jeffrey Blitz, who had also directed the previous episode [...] "Nepotism". [...] "Counseling" [...] features Eric Zuckerman, Vincent Angelo and Michael Schur in guest appearances as a store teller, a vendor, and Mose Schrute, respectively. Evan Peters also appears as Luke Cooper in archival footage from the previous episode. With the seventh season of The Office being Carell's last, the writers decided to divide the season into two distinct halves; the first half would [...] "celebrate Carell's finale year and <b>highlight</b> <b>different</b> actors on the show", whereas the second half would focus on his departure {{and the search for}} a new manager. As such, [...] "Counseling" [...] {{was one of the first}} episode of the season to specifically highlight other characters, in this case Lieberstein's character, Toby.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Peter Ocko, his first writing credit for The Office since joining the staff in its seventh season as a co-executive producer. It was {{directed}} by Alex Hardcastle, the first episode of The Office he directed. Due {{to the fact that}} the seventh season of The Office was Carell's last, the writers decided to divide the season into two distinct halves; the first half would [...] "celebrate Carell's finale year and <b>highlight</b> <b>different</b> actors on the show", whereas the second half would focus on his departure and the search for a new manager. As such, [...] "Christening" [...] was written to specifically highlight [...] "potential heirs to the throne", in this case Fischer and Krasinski's characters, Pam and Jim.
