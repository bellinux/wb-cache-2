And when he declined they insisted, and even sent in to him prisoners under the charge of soldiers, that at least on their account he might come down. So being forced by necessity, and seeing them lamenting, he came to the outer mountain. And his labour this time too was profitable to many, and his coming for their good. To the magistrates, too, he was of use, counselling them to prefer justice to all things, and to fear God, and to know that with what judgment they judged they should be judged in turn. But he loved best of all his life in the mountain. Once again, when he was compelled in the same way to leave it, by those who were in want, and by the general of the soldiers, who entreated him earnestly, he came down, and having spoken to them somewhat of the things which conduced to salvation, he was pressed also by those who were in need. But being asked by the general to lengthen his stay, he refused, and persuaded him by a graceful parable, saying, [...] "Fishes, if they lie long on the dry land, die; so monks who stay with you lose their strength. As the fishes then hasten to the sea, so must we to the mountain, lest if we delay we should forget what is within."

5000|$|... "Open-fit" [...] or [...] "over-the-ear" [...] (OTE) {{hearing aids}} are small behind-the-ear type devices. This type is {{characterized}} by a minimal amount of effect on the ear canal resonances, as it traditionally leaves the ear canal as open as possible, often only being plugged up by a small speaker resting {{in the middle of the}} ear canal space. Traditionally, these hearing aids have a small plastic case behind the ear and a small clear tube running into the ear canal. Inside the ear canal, a small soft silicone dome or a molded, highly vented acrylic tip holds the tube in place.This design is intended to reduce the occlusion effect. Conversely, because of the increased possibility of feedback, and because an open fit allows low frequency sounds to leak out of the ear canal, they are limited to moderately severe high-frequency losses.While the design approach is attractive to a <b>general</b> <b>hearing</b> aid user, open-fit devices can by their design have problems when connected to Assistive Listening Devices (ALD's). This problem has been addressed by manufacturers, who provide assistive listening devices that can be paired with the hearing aid.|$|E

Heavier use also tended to be correlated with attendance at an all-deaf school. Implications of the findings of similar drinking patterns for the deaf and the hearing are discussed in terms of the lack of specific rehabilitation facilities for the deaf, along with possible reasons for the lack of use by deaf clients of alcohol rehabilitation agencies in the community...|$|E

40|$|A new questionnaire, {{developed}} to investigate self-reported hearing difficulties in unilateral deafness, {{was completed by}} 221 post-surgical vestibular schwannoma patients. Results were compared {{to a group of}} 51 normal hearers and 12 patients with severe unilateral deafness from other causes. The vestibular schwannoma patients rated their post surgical hearing as profoundly deaf in the operated ear, and worse than pre-surgical in the other. Factor analysis of the results revealed a <b>general</b> <b>hearing</b> factor and five factors, indirect listening, direct listening, face-to-face listening, noise and distance, and localization, representing performance in specific listening situations. Two factors, direct listening and face-to-face listening have not been commented upon previously in the literature.

In <b>general,</b> <b>hearing</b> loss is sensorineural, which is sometimes confused with presbycusis, mainly because it develops in patients older than 40 years of age. Angiopathy and neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus have been considered important factors for the vestibular-cochlear disorders found in these patients. However, there is controversy regarding the etiopathogenesis of hearing loss, as some researchers support that it develops due to neuropathy, others say it is due to angiopathy, or even a combination of both. Yet, some researchers believe diabetes mellitus and hearing loss {{are part of a}} genetic syndrome. We have conducted an extensive bibliographic review to determine whether there is cause-effect relationship between diabetes mellitus and hearing loss.

40|$|As interpreters {{for their}} deaf parents, hearing {{children}} are a cultural link between two often separate worlds: the Deaf and the Hearing. Data from a 4 year study of adult hearing children throughout the United States indicate {{significant differences between}} hearing daughters and hearing sons. Not only were daughters more likely than sons (regardless of birth order or age differences) to interpret for their parents, but daughters were also {{far more likely to}} be bilingual: fluent in both spoken English and American Sign Language. A similar gender bias has been observed among the <b>general</b> <b>hearing</b> public: women {{are far more likely to}} attend sign language classes and to work as interpreters for the deaf. This paper explores the social mechanisms and cultural values which determine the gender of the way we communicate with one another. Informants' narratives suggest that sign language and the practice of interpreting often touched upon a larger pattern of socialization and status differences between women and men. The discussion then turns to consider how these differences affect the cultural identity of hearing sons versus hearing daughters. sociolinguistics gender deafness sign language...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{relationship}} between noise exposure and hearing loss {{was investigated in}} five groups of industrial workers in Hong Kong. Audiometric examinations were made on textile weavers, textile spinners, metal workers, aircraft maintenance crews and workers in a bottling factory. Noise surveys were conducted {{in each of the}} work environments. Audiometric examinations were also made on a control group consisting of workers in 'non-noisy ' occupations. The results were compared with data obtained from similar studies made in Western countries. In general, the results were similar and no evidence was found for any ethnic differences between Western groups and Cantonese Chinese either in <b>general</b> <b>hearing</b> levels or in response to prolonged exposure to industrial noise. Measured hearing loss was plotted against noise immission levels for four groups of workers and compared with median and quartile values predicted by ROBINSON and SHIPTON (1977). The agreement between the predicted curves and observed data was reasonably good for spinning workers and workers in the weaving and bottling industries, but hearing loss of workers in the metal-work industry tended to be greater than that predicted. These results are discussed in terms of the impulsive characteristics of the noise...|$|E
40|$|Hearing aid {{satisfaction}} is a pleasurable emotional {{experience as an}} outcome of an evaluation of performance. Many tools {{have been designed to}} measure the degree of satisfaction overall, or along the dimensions of cost, appearance, acoustic benefit, comfort, and service. Various studies have used these tools to examine the relationships between satisfaction and other factors. Findings are not always consistent across studies, but in <b>general,</b> <b>hearing</b> aid satisfaction {{has been found to be}} related to experience, expectation, personality and attitude, usage, type of hearing aids, sound quality, listening situations, and problems in hearing aid use. Inconsistent findings across studies and difficulties in evaluating the underlying relationships are probably caused by problems with the tools (eg, lack of validity) and the methods used to evaluate relationships (eg, correlation analyses evaluate association and not causal effect). Whether satisfaction changes over time and how service satisfaction contributes to device satisfaction are unclear. It is hoped that this review will help readers understand current satisfaction measures, how various factors affect satisfaction, and how the way {{satisfaction is}} measured may be improved to yield more reliable and valid data. postprin...|$|E
40|$|Background: During {{the past}} years various drugs {{have been used}} for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) {{treatment}} including steroids that are shown to be beneficial. Directed delivery of high doses of steroids into the inner ear is suggested for its potential and known as intratympanic steroids therapy (IST). Despite the use of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone as the traditional treatments, there are still debates about the optimal dosage, preferred drug, and the route of administration. Materials and Methods: We performed a randomized clinical trial study in which 50 patients suffering from SSNHL and resistant to standard therapy were employed. Each patient took 0. 5 ml methylprednisolone (40 mg/mg) along with bicarbonate or dexamethasone (4 mg/mL) through direct intratympanic injection. This method was performed and scheduled once every 2 days for three times only for the dexamethasone receiving group. Hearing test was carried out and the results were analyzed according to a four-frequency (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0 kHz) pure tone average (PTA) and Siegel′s criteria. Results: According to Siegel′s criteria, three out of 25 (12 %) dexamethasone receiving patients were healed in 1 and 4 (16 %), 9 (32 %) were respectively recovered in Siegel′s criteria 2, 3, and 9 (32 %) showed no recovery. In the group receiving methylprednisolone, recovery was found in 6 (24 %), 8 (32 %), 7 (28 %) patients in the Siegel′s criteria 1, 2, 3, respectively, and in 4 (16 %) patients no recovery was recorded. In methylprednisolone group, hearing was significantly improved compared to the dexamethasone group (P < 0. 05). The <b>general</b> <b>hearing</b> improvement rate was 84 % in methylprednisolone receiving patients showing a significantly higher improvement than 64 % in the dexamethasone group. Conclusions: Topical intratympanic treatment with methylprednisolone is safe and an effective treatment approach for those SSNHL cases that are refractory to the common therapies by Dexamethasone...|$|E
