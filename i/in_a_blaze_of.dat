He once hired the entire Ballets Russes to entertain his house guests, and for a party at Ca' Rezzonico, which he rented for $4,000 a month ($ in current value), he hired 50 gondoliers to act as footmen and had a troupe of tight-rope walkers perform <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> lights.

500|$|During the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, Kripke {{announced}} that Jo would {{return in the}} series' fifth season.

Though unhappy, Tal was [...] "all for it" [...] because she felt it benefited the show, and found it [...] "grand" [...] that Jo [...] "went out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> glory". Jo {{was one of many}} deceased characters the writers considered to have appear in the alternate reality of the sixth season episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On", but they ultimately settled on Ellen.

The opportunity to return for the fifth season surprised her due to the large time span since her previous appearance.

A carelessly-directed Turkish searchlight briefly illuminated E15. The boat from HMS Majestic under the command of Lt Goodwin seized the opportunity and attacked. The first torpedo missed, and seconds later the boat was struck by a shell that blew away much of her stern, mortally wounding one of her crew and causing her irreparable damage. Undeterred, Goodwin went in again and scored a direct hit with his second torpedo, just forward of the conning tower, wrecking the submarine.|$|E

Joe {{wants to go}} straight and meets a woman. Rico, however, seeks {{a life of crime}} and joins the gang of Sam Vettori. He rises to the rank of boss of the crime family. After becoming concerned his friend will betray him he threatens him, at which point Joe's girlfriend goes to the police. Unable to bring himself to kill Joe and eliminate the witness against him, Rico goes into hiding. He is coaxed out by the police, who publish that he is a coward to the press. Rico is killed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> gunfire; his last words are [...] "Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?" [...] Robinson was initially cast in a small role but persuaded the film's producer to let him play the lead. Wingate, who then headed New York's censorship board, told Hays that he was flooded with complaints from people who saw kids in theaters nationwide [...] "applaud the gang leader as a hero." [...] The success of Little Caesar inspired Fox's The Secret Six (1931) and Quick Millions (1931), and Paramount's City Streets (1931), but the next big Hollywood gangster would come from Warners.|$|E

500|$|Broadly, {{the critics}} did not welcome Fleming's {{experiment}} with the Bond formula; academic Christoph Linder {{has pointed out that}} The Spy Who Loved Me received the worst reception of all the Bond books.

[...] while The Glasgow Herald thought Fleming was finished: [...] "His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail." [...] Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson described the tale as [...] "a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation", going on to hope that [...] "this doesn't spell the total eclipse of Bond <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blaze</b> <b>of</b> cornography". Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking [...] "why can't this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?" [...] The critic for The Times was not dismissive of Bond, whom they describe as [...] "less a person than a cult" [...] who is [...] "ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war". Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that [...] "the novel lacks Mr. Fleming's usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment".
