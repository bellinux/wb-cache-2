Mouton and Moss were of different eras and did not compete directly against each other, although they both appeared at the 1973 Monte Carlo Rally where Mouton co-drove. In 1985, they swapped cars in a private test session with Moss driving the Quattro and Mouton an Austin-Healey 3000.

[...] Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. [...] He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. [...] Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, [...] "My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing.</b> I had to fight for my name." [...] During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. [...] He later described the trial as [...] "the hardest two weeks" [...] of his life.|$|E

2500|$|One {{advantage}} Rachmaninoff had in {{this building}} process over most of his contemporaries was in approaching the pieces he played {{from the perspective of}} a composer rather than that of an interpreter. He believed [...] "interpretation demands something of the creative instinct. If you are a composer, you have an affinity with other composers. You can make contact with their imaginations, knowing something of their problems and their ideals. You can give their works color. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> for me in my interpretations, color. So you make music live. Without color it is dead." [...] Nevertheless, Rachmaninoff also possessed a far better sense of structure than many of his contemporaries, such as Hofmann, or the majority of pianists from the previous generation, judging from their respective recordings.|$|E

You {{lose a lot of}} your cuteness, because there's no chance for action, and action <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> to me." [...] A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in The Wild Party because her eyes kept {{wandering}} up to the microphone overhead. [...] "I can't buck progress [...]. I have to do the best I can," [...] she said. In October 1929, Bow described her nerves as [...] "all shot", saying that she had reached [...] "the breaking point", and Photoplay cited reports of [...] "rows of bottles of sedatives" [...] by her bed.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2015, Eno {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. He said: [...] "I don't think electability really <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing.</b> What's important is that someone changes the conversation and moves us off this small-minded agenda." [...] He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "By gathering this level of support Jeremy Corbyn has already shown {{that there is a}} strong nascent progressive movement in this country. He's shown the others in his party that there's a well of commitment for them to tap, if they have the will and the courage to do it. If nothing further happens with his campaign, that would be an undeniable and valuable contribution. I admit it: PM Corbyn is a long shot right now – but only four weeks ago bookies were giving 100-1 against him even becoming the candidate. Now it's 7-4 on. Things can change, and quickly. I think we should have some faith and give it a try." ...|$|E
2500|$|A multi-format points {{system was}} first {{introduced}} for the 2013 Women's Ashes series in England; the series consisted of one Test match, three One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for winning the Test match, with two points each if drawn, and two points for winning a limited overs match, and one point each if the match was drawn. Talking about the points system, then England captain Charlotte Edwards said [...] " [...] It preserves Test cricket, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing,</b> but equally we get to play the more popular formats which are one day and Twenty20 which {{the media and the}} public has a huge demand for." [...] England won the series 12–4 after the test match was drawn, Australia won one ODI and England won two ODIs and all three T20Is. The system was used again in the 2013–14 women's Ashes in Australia, with England winning 10–8, despite winning fewer matches; England won the test match, one ODI and one T20I, while Australia won two ODIs and two T20Is.|$|E

Some instances are serious expressions about God and especially His Providence, a common theme among Deists. Washington used words such as [...] "Grand Architect" [...] and [...] "Providence" [...] that were popular among deists. These terms were also commonly used by the Freemasons. While deists and Freemasons did use these words, words like [...] "Providence" [...] specifically were not excessively used by deists and Freemasons, but were also used by Christians during Washington's time period.|$|E
