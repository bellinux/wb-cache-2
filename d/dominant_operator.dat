Eurostar has become the <b>dominant</b> <b>operator</b> on the routes that it operates, carrying more passengers than all airlines combined. Other operators have {{expressed an interest in}} starting competing services following deregulation in 2010. On 1 September 2010, Eurostar was incorporated as a single corporate entity called Eurostar International Limited (EIL), replacing the joint operation between EUKL, SNCF and SNCB/NMBS. EIL is owned by SNCF (55%), [...] (CDPQ) (30%), Hermes Infrastructure (10%) and NMBS (5%).|$|E

50|$|In South Korea, {{mobile number}} {{portability}} service started from January 1, 2004. One thing {{different from other}} countries is that it started from SK Telecom, the <b>dominant</b> <b>operator</b> which has over 50% of market share. To prevent users' churning to the <b>dominant</b> <b>operator,</b> the government gave six months' and one year's delay to the second and the third operator, respectively. As a result, only SK Telecom's subscribers could move to other operators {{during the first six}} months. Fixed-line portability began as of August 1, 2004.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the link}} between termination rate reductions and retail prices. It draws on in-depth case studies of South Africa, Namibia and Kenya where regulators have reduced termination rates towards {{the cost of an}} efficient operator. To varying degrees these have all led to lower retail prices and a significant market expansion. While both Namibia and Kenya, experienced significant retail price reduction following substantial termination rate reductions, the case of South Africa demonstrates that termination rate reductions are not automatically passed through to consumers. In South Africa only the second reduction in March 2012 allowed smaller operators to reduce their off-net prices to a level could tempt subscribers from <b>dominant</b> <b>operators</b> to switch. The case studies confirm that retail prices do not go up in response to termination rates going down, in CPNP (calling-party's-network-pays) markets as contended by <b>dominant</b> mobile <b>operators.</b> This is also in contrast to a body of academic literature stating that termination rates and mobile retail prices constitute a two-sided market and that termination rate reductions will lead to a so called waterbed effect. This study draws on a database of all prepaid products available in 46 African countries which were collected monthly for the period January 2011 to June 2012. The OECD price basket methodology is used to compare prices between countries and between operators. In-depth face-to-face interviews on termination rate regulations were also held with regulators in Kenya, Namibia and South Africa. The analysis is further supplemented with an analysis of audited financial statements of <b>dominant</b> <b>operators</b> in each market, namely Vodacom South Africa, MTN South Africa, Telkom South Africa, MTC 2 in Namibia, and Safaricom in Kenya...|$|R

40|$|The {{masses of}} the {{positive}} parity [70, 0 (+) ] and [70, 2 (+) ] non-strange baryons are calculated in large N-c QCD by considering the most <b>dominant</b> <b>operators</b> in an 1 /N-c expansion.

Although being a sub-leading 1 /Nc order, we find that the spin-spin interaction plays a dominant role in describing the data. The role of No operators is also pointed out. We show how the contribution of the linear term in Nc, of the spin-spin and of the spin-orbit terms vary with the excitation energy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
