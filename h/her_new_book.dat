5|$|The tale {{was well}} {{received}} by the Scotsman, but The Times Literary Supplement was not entirely enthusiastic:Among the little books that have become as much a manifestation of autumn as falling leaves, one looks first for whatever Miss Beatrix Potter gives... In <b>her</b> <b>new</b> <b>book...</b> {{although there is no}} diminution in the charm and drollery of the drawings, Miss Potter's fancy is not what it was. The story is inconclusive. Next year we think she must call in a literary assistant. We have no hesitation in calling her pencil perfect.|$|E

She realises that Elm Tree House has changed loads and the new {{children}} act worse than herself in her days. At times, she tries to help the children, concluding in the new social workers almost firing her.

5000|$|She quickly {{decided that}} she wanted to write romantic {{adventure}} novels. Unlike the style of romance novels, her books would be told in first person narrative. <b>Her</b> <b>new</b> type of writing should contain heroes and heroines, as well as [...] "a sense of family and community." [...] In that vein, she intended <b>her</b> <b>new</b> style of writing {{to be based on the}} TV sitcom model. Like Seinfeld, <b>her</b> <b>new</b> <b>books</b> would have a central character that the rest of the cast of characters revolve around.|$|R

60|$|In Nathan Burke Mrs. Watts told {{with great}} power {{the story of}} a man. In this, <b>her</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> she does much the same thing for a woman. Jennie Cushing is an {{exceedingly}} interesting character, perhaps the most interesting of any that Mrs. Watts has yet given us. The novel is her life and little else, but it is a life filled with a variety of experiences and touching closely many different strata of humankind. Throughout it all, from the days when as a thirteen-year-old, homeless, friendless waif, Jennie is sent to a reformatory, to the days when her beauty is the inspiration of a successful painter, there is in the narrative an appeal to the emotions, to the sympathy, to the affections, that cannot be gainsaid.|$|E

500|$|The limited {{liability}} company continued to vex Heyer, and in 1966, after tax inspectors found that she owed the company £20,000, she finally fired her accountants. She then asked that the rights to <b>her</b> <b>newest</b> <b>book,</b> Black Sheep, be issued to her personally. Unlike her other novels, Black Sheep did not focus on members of the aristocracy. Instead, it followed [...] "the moneyed middle class", with finance a dominant theme in the novel.|$|R
6000|$|From that {{circle of}} my elders in the East, I {{returned}} to my children in the West {{with a sense of}} returning to the future. The radiant joy of Mary Isabel's face as I displayed her presents, a ring and a story book, restored me to something like a normal faith in the world. [...] "Wead to me, wead to me!" [...] was now her insistent plea, and putting aside all other concerns I turned the pages of <b>her</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> realizing that to her the universe was still a great and never-ending fairy tale, and her Daddy a wonder-working magician, an amiable ogre. Her eager voice, her raptured attention enabled me to recover, for a moment, a wholesome faith and joy in my world--a world which was growing gray and wan and cold with terrifying swiftness.|$|E
6000|$|One hesitates {{to apply}} the term [...] "joy-rider" [...] to so eminent a leader of {{contemporary}} thought as the authoress of [...] "The Dawn of Better Things," [...] "Principles of Selection," [...] and [...] "What of To-morrow?" [...] but candour compels the admission {{that she was a}} somewhat reckless driver. Perhaps it was due to some atavistic tendency. One of her ancestors may have been a Roman charioteer or a coach-racing maniac of the Regency days. At any rate, after a hard morning's work on <b>her</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> she felt that her mind needed cooling, and found that the rush of air against her face effected this satisfactorily. The greater the rush, the quicker the cooling. However, as the alert inhabitants of Manhattan Island, a hardy race trained from infancy to dodge taxicabs and ambulance wagons, had always removed themselves from her path with their usual agility, she had never yet had an accident.|$|E
6000|$|Augusta made no answer, and {{presently}} Jeannie dozed off. Her sister {{looked at}} her with eager affection. [...] "She is giving up," [...] she said to herself, [...] "and, if she gives up, she will die. I know it, it is because we are not going away. How can I get the money, now that that horrible man is gone? how can I get it?" [...] and she buried her head in her hand and thought. Presently an idea struck her: she might go back to Meeson and eat her words, and sell him the copyright of <b>her</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> for £100, as the agreement provided. That would not be enough, however; for travelling with an invalid is expensive; but she might offer to bind herself over to him for a term of years as a tame author, like those who worked in the Hutches. She was sure that he would be glad to get her, if only he could do so at his own price. It would be slavery worse than any penal servitude, and even now she shudders at the prospect of prostituting her great abilities to the necessities of such work as Meeson's made their thousands out of--work out of which every spark of originality was stamped into nothingness, as though it were the mark of the Beast. Yes, it would be dreadful--it would break her heart; but she was prepared to have her heart broken and her genius wrung out of her by inches, if only she could get two hundred pounds wherewith to take Jeannie away to the South of France. Mr. Meeson would, no doubt, make a hard bargain--the hardest he could; but still, if she would consent to bind herself for a sufficient number of years at a sufficiently low salary, he would probably advance her a hundred pounds, besides the hundred for the copyright of the new book.|$|E
