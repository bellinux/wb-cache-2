40|$|In the 2004 Presidential Election {{social and}} wedge issues {{were among the}} most publicized {{mobilization}} tools utilized by the Bush Campaign. Specifically, same-sex marriage has been suggested as a <b>key</b> <b>wedge</b> issue that may have mobilized voters, although research differs on its impact. My contention is that these previous studies miss the point with regard to wedge issues, which is that they are useful on persuadable voters, and persuadable voters live in swing states. I estimate a logit model using 2004 American National Election Studies survey data. I utilize voters ‟ decisions to turn out as the dependent variable and control for respondents ‟ positions on terrorism, the economy, same-sex marriage, political interest, party identification, and socioeconomic status. These findings demonstrate, consistent with my hypothesis, voters in swing same-sex marriage ballot measure states were more likely to turn out. These voters may not hav...|$|E

The older tradition of labor market dualism and some of the more modern research are seen to share a characteristic of misplaced exogeneity, and calls for asset redistribution and institutional regulation may need to be tempered by more fundamental explanations. Understanding labor contracts as a facilitator of specialization on the farm and in the larger economy is <b>key.</b> Integrating the <b>wedge</b> model of farm behavior with agency-cost explanations of organization will provide a powerful analytical tool. Ultimately, a general equilibrium view with endogenous institutions will deepen our understanding of why total costs of coordination increase even as turnover costs per worker decline and how public policy can facilitate that cooperation.

5000|$|The Discovery Institute (DI) is a {{religious}} think tank that drives the intelligent design movement. The Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC) counts most of the leading intelligent design advocates among its membership, most notably its program advisor Phillip E. Johnson. Johnson is {{the architect of the}} movement's <b>key</b> strategies, the <b>wedge</b> strategy and the [...] "Teach the Controversy" [...] campaign. The Discovery Institute and leading proponents represent intelligent design as a revolutionary scientific theory. The overwhelming majority of the scientific community, as represented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Sciences and nearly all scientific professional organizations, firmly reject these claims, and insist that intelligent design is not valid science, its proponents having failed to conduct an actual scientific research program. This has led the movement's critics to state that intelligent design is merely a public relations campaign and a political campaign.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} initial asymmetric wedge-impact flows with horizontal {{as well as}} vertical impact velocity. The {{method of}} two-dimensional vortex distributions is employed to model the initial-boundary-value problem. The numerical analysis involves discretization of the body surface and an iterative solution technique. Ex-perimental drop tests of a prismatic wedge were performed to gain understanding and provide data for comparison of initial water impact when asymmetry and horizontal impact velocity are present. The experimental investigation of initial flow separation off the wedge vertex (i. e., keel) during impact is described. Initial separation-ventilation of the flow from the vertex due to asymmetric impact or horizontal-vertical impact velocity is examined {{in relation to the}} present theory. Agreement between the data and the numerical predictions was demonstrated for small degrees of asymmetry and small ratios of horizontal to vertical impact velocity. The initial flow detachment from the vertex also revealed interesting hydrodynamic characteristics. <b>Key</b> words: asymmetric <b>wedge</b> impact, oblique entry, vortex distributions 1...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic wedges {{have been}} used in {{clinical}} practice for many years. Obvious superiority of dynamic over physical wedges is accompanied by the increased overhead involved in verifying the accuracy and reliability of their use. Contrary to very limited QA required to ensure proper functioning of the physical wedges, dynamic wedges, like any other dynamic treatment, require a robust QA program. This work expands upon previous suggestions and describes a comprehensive QA program for Varian enhanced dynamic wedges (EDWs) and presents the results of an 18 -month evaluation of these wedges. The QA program includes daily, monthly, and yearly tests and individual treatment QA at the onset of use of the EDWs. The results of the 18 -month evaluation show reproducibility in the wedge factors of better than 1 % and in dose profiles of better than 2 % on a monthly basis. Daily output measurements are generally within 2 % of expected values. PACS numbers: 87. 53. Xd, 87. 56. Fc <b>Key</b> words: dynamic <b>wedge,</b> enhanced dynamic wedge, quality assuranc...|$|R

The wedge splitting (WS) test {{is now a}} promising method to perform stable fracture mechanics tests on concrete-like quasi brittle materials. Fracture parameters, such as fracture toughness and critical crack opening displacement and et. al, are however not easy to determined since formulae available from stress intensity factor manual are restricted to standard specimen geometry. The paper attempts to compute expressions for commonly used fracture parameters for a general wedge splitting specimen. By means of finite element analysis program, test simulation was performed on non-standard wedge splitting specimen with different depth and initiation crack length, and thereafter expressions were proposed for stress intensity factor at the pre-cast tip and crack mouth opening displacement on the load line. Based on the work above, size effect on the unstable fracture toughness and crack extension were investigated, and the consistency of fracture toughness data for various specimen depth as well as initiation crack length is demonstrated. The crack extension is little sensitive to the initiation crack length, it increases with the depth of specimen, which {{can be explained by}} the boundary influence of the specimen...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{generating}} wedge-shaped dose distributions through dynamic multileaf collimator dose delivery rather than computer-controlled jaw motion is presented. The method {{starts with the}} calculation of a wedge-shaped beam profile for the desired wedge angle. The resultant wedge beam profile is then passed to the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) leaf sequence generation algorithm to create multileaf collimator (MLC) segments for dose delivery. Wedge-shaped dose distributions are achieved through dynamic MLC dose delivery guided with the generated MLC segments. The method has been tested by generating wedgeshaped doses {{for a set of}} conventional wedge angles (i. e., 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 60 °). Film dosimetry is used for dose distribution verification. For each dose delivery guided with MLC segments created for the indicated wedge angle, the desired wedge-shaped dose distributions are observed. It is concluded that the dynamic MLC can be used to implement dynamic wedges in the clinic. This technique is different from the virtual wedge or the dynamic wedge developed for a particular type of LINAC. The same method can be applied to any machine equipped with a MLC. Other advantages are that it can generate a wedge field at an arbitrary orientation as the omni wedge does, and it creates wedged and shaped fields using a MLC only. PACS number(s) : 87. 53.

40|$|The nonphysical wedge is a {{modality}} {{that uses}} computer-controlled jaw motion to generate wedge-shaped dose distributions. There are Varian enhanced dynamic wedges (EDWs) and Siemens virtual wedges (VWs). We recently commissioned dynamic wedges on both Varian and Siemens LINACs. The beam data, acquired with a Wellhöfer chamber array and a Sun Nuclear profiler, {{are used for}} modeling in the ADAC Pinnacle system. As recommended by ADAC, {{only a limited number}} of beam data is measured and used for beam modeling. Therefore, the dose distributions of dynamic wedges generated by Pinnacle must be examined. Following the commissioning of the dynamic wedges, we used Pinnacle to generate a number of dose distributions with different energies, wedge angles, field sizes, and depths. The computed data from Pinnacle are then compared with the measured data. The deviations of the output factor in all square and rectangular fields are mostly within 2. 0 % for both EDW and VW. For asymmetric fields, the deviations are within 3 %. However, exceptions of differences more than 3 % have been found in a larger field and large wedge combinations. The precision of the beam profiles generated by Pinnacle is also evaluated. As a result of this investigation, we present a scope of quality assurance tests that are necessary to ensure acceptable consistency between the delivered dose and the associated treatment plan when dynamic wedges are applied.

30|$|In this paper, {{we first}} discuss the {{development}} of the field of tribology, and highlight some of the main problems encountered in this area, such as lack of systematicness, loose correlation, and inadequate focus on the microscopic perspective. Then, we provide basic formulas of frictional mechanics while considering the friction effect on classical mechanics formulae. In order to carry out the frictional mechanics analysis, we first classify the interface. According to the size analysis of surface films, the manufacturing roughness of the surface, the contact width, and the roller radius of the rolling contact bearing, frictional mechanics has the features of interface mechanics, while interfaces are classified based on {{the presence or absence of}} a medium. Based on the classification, we further analyze the pressure and frictional stress of sliding and rolling friction problems without a medium, such as a slider, <b>wedge</b> <b>key,</b> and V belt. We also analyze problems with a medium, such as journal and rolling contact bearings. By comparing these results with those of classical mechanics without considering friction, we see that (1) friction causes deviations in the result for classical mechanics which does not consider friction, and (2) if the frictional stress and normal pressure affect each other, their interaction should be considered simultaneously. Finally, we summarize the friction problems, namely, sliding and rolling, with and without a medium, and deformed and non-deformed. From our analysis, we propose two conclusions. First, the frictional mechanics problem is a deviation of the classical mechanics problem, and secondly, frictional stress and normal pressure influence each other.|$|R
