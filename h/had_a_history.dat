5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by his pupils, his writing system was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died in}} 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> book translated into braille.|$|E

This organization was the seed of Paisley’s Fringe Theatre Event, which he founded while still working out of this space in 1982. This event was the original Edmonton International Fringe Festival, now the largest event {{of its kind in}} North America.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{later said}} his {{biological}} father <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of hitting his mother. James M. Cannon, {{a member of}} the Ford administration, wrote in a biography of Ford that the Kings' separation and divorce were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife, his infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.|$|E
5|$|Hailstorms have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of {{significant}} damage in Australia. Since records on insured losses by the Insurance Disaster Response Organisation began in 1967 three other hailstorms — Sydney in 1986 and 1990, {{as well as}} Brisbane in 1985 — feature on the top-ten list of most insured damages caused by a single natural disaster, {{in addition to the}} 1999 storm. Hailstorms have caused more than 30% of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural disasters in Australia during this period, and around three quarters of all hailstorm damage has occurred in New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Horner {{also pointed out that}} the tyrannosaur lineage <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of steadily improving binocular vision. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E

The school <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of producing high-caliber international basketball players, including Enes Kanter and Nikola Vučević. However, N'Diaye {{was not allowed to}} play the sport during his first year in the high school because of California Interscholastic Federation rules.

5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of {{run-ins with}} the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came {{while he was}} president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E

Several days after the knife was given to Fred Murray, the man's brother allegedly scrapped his Volvo.
