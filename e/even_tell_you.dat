500|$|The pilot episode {{aired in}} October rather than September, {{which was a}} month after new fall season shows {{normally}} premiered. Pearlman {{was pleased with the}} later broadcast date, believing that [...] "it creates a second wave of anticipation for an audience, too. I work in the business and I couldn't <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the names of a third of the new shows this season because we were bombarded with all the messaging." ...|$|E

The following day, he denounced [...] "the police methods" [...] of Diệm's [...] "dictatorship" [...] and warned the Vietnamese populace [...] "against a regime that was bound to lead them to ruin, famine, and war". Bảo Đại accused Diệm of trying to foment conflict between the French and the Americans. On {{the eve of the}} poll, Bảo Đại stated [...] "I can <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I know the percentage of favourable votes that Mr. Diem has decided to obtain." ...|$|E
500|$|Production of {{the episode}} began months in advance {{according}} to the episode's writer Steve Callaghan. [...] "We're actually working over a year ahead of time," [...] Callaghan says {{in an interview with}} Hollywood.com. He added [...] "We work so far ahead I can <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the finale the finale is a really cool episode called 'Roads to Vegas.' It's like a road show and Stewie and Brian teleport themselves to Las Vegas, but in the process [...] unknowingly create a duplicate of one another." [...] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Callaghan recalled the scene in the episode where Brian and Stewie consider joint suicide the most difficult scene for him to write in 2012.|$|E

I'm really excited about it." [...] Ora also talked about preparing for the video in June, [...] "It is going to be amazing; I can't <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what's going to happen because I am sworn to secrecy. It is going to be major. You've seen her video for [...] "Fancy"? She loves a theme and the theme for this one is fucking genius. All I am saying is I am in training for days for this video." [...] The video was shot in mid-July in Los Angeles. On 8 August 2014 during a performance, Ora announced that the video should premiere officially on 11 August 2014.

The video was directed by Director X and Iggy Azalea and premiered through VEVO on 13 August 2014. Daps was the second unit director for the music video. American actors Michael Madsen, Paul Sorvino, and actor/rapper T.I. also appear in the video. On 14 August 2014, exclusive behind-the-scenes footage from the video set was shown on the second episode of MTV's show House of Style, hosted by Azalea and where she revealed the visuals are inspired by 70s kung fu films and Tarantino movies.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this restriction, many {{media outlets}} refused {{to run the}} poster, or any ad that {{includes}} the word [...] "porno" [...] in the title, including a number of newspapers, TV stations, cable channels, and city governments, some of which responded to complaints about the ads at baseball stadiums and city bus stops. Many theaters displayed the film's title on their marquee as merely Zack and Miri. Weinstein Company marketing head Gary Faber stated that the ad was accepted {{in most of the}} outlets that were offered it, but that the studio would consider variations of the title for outlets that rejected it, including one version of the poster without the title that bears the slogan, [...] "Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks made a movie so outrageous that we can't <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the title." ...|$|E

6000|$|Corporal Westerburg hesitated. He {{stared down}} at the floor, then {{out the window at the}} spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up, getting slowly to his feet. [...] "I can't <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that, sir," [...] he said.|$|E

60|$|But {{it is not}} {{policy to}} bind oneself too closely to detail. A wise friend of mine, who knows his business, {{describes}} his hero invariably in the vaguest terms. He will not <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> whether the man is tall or short, clean shaven or bearded.|$|E
6000|$|... "The bravest {{men have}} been afraid of women. Won't <b>you</b> <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> me whether <b>you</b> enjoyed it? I am told you made an immense {{sensation}} there--that you leaped into fame." ...|$|R

6000|$|They parted at the dressing-room door, and as Guy bade {{her good}} night, he pushed back the damp hair {{that had fallen}} across his forehead, saying, 'I am sorry I {{disturbed}} your <b>evening.</b> I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the meaning of it another time.' ...|$|R

But I can't <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how the name of your place got out in the connection, though certainly {{you have a right to}} ask and to know. The circumstances were--peculiar.

60|$|Danny Meadow Mouse is timid. Everybody says so, {{and what}} {{everybody}} says {{ought to be}} so. But just as anybody can make a mistake sometimes, so can everybody. Still, in this case, it is quite likely that everybody is right. Danny Meadow Mouse is timid. Ask Peter Rabbit. Ask Sammy Jay. Ask Striped Chipmunk. They will all tell you the same thing. Sammy Jay might <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that Danny is afraid of his own shadow, or that he tries {{to run away from}} his own tail. Of course this isn't true. Sammy Jay likes to say mean things. It isn't fair to Danny Meadow Mouse to believe what Sammy Jay says.|$|E

6000|$|... "DON'T! It {{scares me}} yet, {{to think of}} it. I repented of it the minute it was done; and I was <b>even</b> afraid to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> lest your face might betray it to somebody. I didn't sleep any that night, for worrying.

No, I do not expect to be entertained by you, nor do I want you to expect me to entertain you and your friends to-night, for I decline to keep the engagement." ...|$|E

Art sure thou didst not creep into thy warlike office from some dark shop in Tower-Hamlets, and that thou hast not converted an unlawful measuring-yard into that glorious halberd?--I warrant thou canst not <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> whom this piece of antique panoply pertained to?" ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps you do {{not know}} where Ethandune is. Nor do I; nor does anybody. That is where the {{somewhat}} sombre fun begins. I cannot <b>even</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> for certain whether it is the name of a forest or a town or a hill. I can only say that in any case it is of the kind that floats and is unfixed. If it is a forest, it is one of those forests that march with a million legs, like the walking trees that were the doom of Macbeth. If it is a town, it is one of those towns that vanish, like a city of tents. If it is a hill, it is a flying hill, like the mountain to which faith lends wings. Over a vast dim region of England this dark name of Ethandune floats like an eagle doubtful where to swoop and strike, and, indeed, there were birds of prey enough over Ethandune, wherever it was. But now Ethandune itself has grown as dark and drifting as the black drifts of the birds.|$|E
