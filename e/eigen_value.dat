The eigen density distribution with respect to the largest <b>eigen</b> <b>value</b> is analysed. This study will help to determine the fluctuation of the eigen distribution with respect to allocated weight of the covariance matrix. This can be used to develop the classic portfolio asset allocation model by adding investors‘ ideas as parameters or weights. The maximum <b>eigen</b> <b>value</b> is 2. 24 and the corresponding weight is 1. 6, the minimum <b>eigen</b> <b>value</b> is 0. 24 and the corresponding weight is 0. 9.
