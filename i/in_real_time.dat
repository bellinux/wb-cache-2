40|$|Abstract – The paper {{addresses}} one of {{the challenges}} of short-term hydropower scheduling in a liberalized power system; bidding <b>in</b> the <b>real</b> <b>time</b> market for secondary reserve. All over the world, deregulation of the power industry is implemented. Different schemes may be used from case to case but basically the fundamental challenge remains the same. Generation must equal consumption in order to maintain frequency and quality of the delivered electric energy. If generation and consumption is different, the need for regulation arises and typically this is done in a balancing market also called the <b>real</b> <b>time</b> market. The paper proposes a method for decision aid to bid-ding <b>in</b> the <b>real</b> <b>time</b> market for owners of hydropower capacity in areas with deregulated electricity markets. Based on the economic dispatch of the units together with expected future operation cost, an estimate of the cost associated with regulation can be calculated. The actual cost of regulating is the lower limit on bids when partici-pating <b>in</b> the <b>real</b> <b>time</b> market. The paper shows how this cost information may be organized to form a bidding table <b>in</b> the <b>real</b> <b>time</b> market, and discusses the practical impli-cations of the approach...|$|R

5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>time</b> by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E
5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>time</b> during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>time</b> for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>time,</b> but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} Hironobu Sakaguchi {{stated that}} {{the idea for the}} game first came up in February 1997. The original idea for Brave Fencer Musashi was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game conceptualized as an action oriented, Musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer. However, he was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game's fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto was focused on the game's fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square's previous works. The development team prioritized the movement of polygons <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>time</b> and how light affected their appearance.|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{change of}} soil moisture storage {{is one of}} the most critical pieces of information required for efficient irrigation management.

This paper presents a successful application of custom-built wireless mesh sensor networks based on DigiMesh protocol, a proprietary technology developed by Digi International Inc. to monitor spatial distribution of soil moisture <b>in</b> near <b>real</b> <b>time.</b> Our system is designed to transport the measured data from wireless sensor networks in the field to cloud data base servers over cellular networks or Iridium satellites.
