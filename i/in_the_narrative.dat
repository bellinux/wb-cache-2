40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study of {{presented}} discourse in popular science narratives of discovery in English. It focuses on the fictionalizing role of presented discourse. The thesis proposes minor adjustments to the existing models of presented discourse analysis, dividing discourse presentation into Public Discourse (speech/writing) and Private Discourse (thought). After exploring the forms and functions of discourse presentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>narratives,</b> <b>the</b> thesis concludes that Private Discourse prefers the forms commonly associated with non-fiction while assigning to them the functions most often observed <b>in</b> fiction. All <b>the</b> forms of discourse presentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> contain dramatizing properties, yet Public Discourse possesses the highest degree of dramatization. Private Discourse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> possesses communicative properties generally assigned to speech/writing presentation exclusively. Private Discourse {{is more likely to}} communicate scientific hypotheses than reveal the inner worlds of actants. The thesis concludes with an examination of presented discourse outside <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> of discovery. This analysis confirms <b>the</b> phenomena observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> and reveals a unique feature of presented discourse outside the narratives-the fictionalized reader-a fictional actant created using discourse presentation. The findings of the thesis present a strong argument in favour of fictionality in popular science...|$|R

5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock.

When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

5|$|In {{promoting}} the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic characteristics whilst Davies highlighted {{her down to}} earth qualities and quintessential Britishness. Critical reaction noted that the character was more developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character's overall role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> {{of the first two}} series was praised. However, reaction to the character's 2008 return was more mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose—including two National Television Awards—and since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular, Piper experienced success in other high-profile roles as an actress which has been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who.|$|E
5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work.

The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature.

5|$|The group {{received}} {{an influx of}} funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to their faith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> that he constructed.|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{science and}} its {{political}} appearance are studied through an empirical exploration of their representations <b>in</b> <b>narrative</b> expressions. <b>The</b> field of investigation is allocated to formal and informal discourse on university, education and research in Sweden and China. The analysed expressions were taken from 202 written reports, as students and personnel in both countries answered an open ended-question, and four formal documents: the Chinese and Swedish laws on higher education and documents on research, science, and technology. <b>The</b> <b>narratives</b> were processed through a Meaning-Constitution-Analysis (MCA), a tool used to perform a deep study of a text based on a phenomenological approach that aims at making the implied assumptions and worldviews explicit. The analysis revealed a common representation of the university as an intermediary {{between the government and}} <b>the</b> student <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>narratives</b> and as a meta-character differentiated from <b>the</b> government <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>narratives.</b> Further, <b>the</b> meaning of science appeared as an adjective that characterizes a certain sphere of life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> informal <b>narratives</b> and as a dynamic behind a desired development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formal <b>narratives.</b> <b>The</b> meaning of politics emerged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>narratives</b> as <b>the</b> formation of an environment, mainly for activities in an institutional balance between input and outcomes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>narratives,</b> politics appeared as a competition for status, in which both academia and the government claim the recognition awarded for successful development. These representations of politics can guide the interpretation of the otherwise quite general understanding of education as a structure to be filled with activities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>narratives</b> and an object for a discussion based on values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>narratives</b> as well as the representation of research as an asset <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>narratives</b> and a source of legitimacy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>narratives.</b> <b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> contexts are similarly shaped by representations of an acting government, but they are different as the government takes <b>the</b> initiative <b>in</b> Swedish <b>narratives</b> in a task-oriented discourse, while it gets involved in ongoing academic life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> a process-oriented discourse. <b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> contexts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formal <b>narratives</b> are mainly centred on the outcomes, regarding a development that {{is the result of a}} dynamic, while <b>the</b> informal <b>narratives</b> are centred on the drivers. The revealed dimensions were analysed in relation to theories on historical phases as stories, inspired by Hayhoe (1996), and science cultures, inspired by Elzinga and Jamison (1995). <b>The</b> approaches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>narratives</b> indicate a tension between academic/civic and bureaucratic/political science cultures which are advantageously framed by <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> imperial and nationalist stories in contrast to a socialist story. <b>The</b> analysed Swedish <b>narratives</b> indicate a homogeneous representation of a dominant bureaucratic/economic science culture, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> universities and their staffs represent the government and are centred on the rights of the students and an expected outcome. The central concerns appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light of attributed tasks and invested means, and is advantageously framed by a story of an increasing focus on the uses of the university on the potential expense of academic concerns...|$|R

5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to have witnessed valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing {{off the face of the}} earth. As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative,</b> however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E
5|$|The predominate storyline {{heading into}} the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle, both members of The Angle Alliance. On the February14 episode of Impact!, TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen. Afterwards, Karen and Angle {{separated}} in the storyline on the March13 episode of Impact!. TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May15 episode of Impact!. Karen refused Angle's request on the May22 episode of Impact!, leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles. This led to a match between the two at Slammiversary which Styles won after a distraction by Karen. The two faced in a Lumberjack match on the June12 episode of Impact!, which Angle won before it ended in a brawl between Styles, Angle, Tomko, Christian Cage, Rhino, Abyss, and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Afterwards, Team 3D and the team of Cage and Rhino {{became involved in the}} feud with Team 3D joining Angle, while Cage and Rhino sided with Styles. Team 3D then injured both Cage and Rhino <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative,</b> with Rhino being knocked out on the June19 episode of Impact!, while on the June26 episode of Impact! Cage was slammed through a glass table by Brother Ray. Rhino returned from injury on the July3 episode of Impact!, challenging Team 3D and Angle to a Six Man Tag Team match at Victory Road, while teasing at adding Full Metal Mayhem rules to the bout.
