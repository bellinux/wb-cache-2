5|$|While not an {{illustration}} in itself, Christopher Nevinson’s statement against {{the slaughter of}} World War I in his painting Paths of Glory (1917) takes its title from another line in the Elegy, “The paths of glory lead but to the grave”. The title had already been used two years before by Irvin S. Cobb in an account of his journalistic experiences {{at the start of}} that war. It was then taken up in the unrelated Humphrey Cobb's 1935 anti-war novel, although in this case the name was suggested for the untitled manuscript in a competition held by the publisher. His book also served in its turn as the basis for Stanley Kubrick’s film Paths of Glory, released in 1957. This example <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> among many illustrating the imaginative currency that certain lines of the poem continue to have, over and above their original significance.|$|E
25|$|Three basic {{themes emerge}} from Qutb's writings. First, {{he claimed that}} the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a {{condition}} he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslim – as he defined them – therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> nonbeliever worthy of destruction.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} first film, {{merchandising}} accompanied Gremlins 2. This may have been integral to the film's purpose. As one critic wrote, [...] "it's a savvy, off-the-wall comedy that acknowledges, yes, it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> silly rip-off sequel, produced to sell off the merchandise inspired by the first film." [...] One reference the film makes to the original, an allusion to the merchandising surrounding Gizmo, drew criticism. Some critics saw the mention of merchandise as tasteless. This type of product placement has since become more common.|$|E

2500|$|The {{transplantation}} of the passage, {{in a few}} manuscripts, to precede John 7:37, or {{to follow}} 8:12, is a scribal adaptation intended to simplify things for the lector by presenting the lection for Pentecost as one uninterrupted segment of text. [...] Likwise, in the f-13 group of manuscripts, the pericope adulterae has been transplanted out of the Gospel of John, and has been placed {{at the end of}} Luke 21, so as to conveniently arrange the reading for Saint Pelagia's feast-day (October 8) near Luke 21:12-19, the lection for Saints Sergius and Bacchus (October 7). [...] Inasmuch as all these movements of the passage are different effects of the lection-cycle, the complete absence of the passage, it is proposed, <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> example of this phenomenon—albeit attested in manuscripts earlier than the earliest clear evidence of a lection-cycle in which this passage was read at Pentecost.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} Canada's policy in Afghanistan, {{a brief history of}} its foreign policy initiatives is in order. In post-Cold War conflicts, Canada [...] "experienced a steep—and at times bloody—learning curve as it tried to develop new techniques to contain violence and restore functioning civil societies." [...] After a 15-hour firefight in Croatia involving Canadian troops at a ground known as the Medak Pocket, it became clear that [...] "peacekeeping forces {{had to be able to}} make that rapid tactical transition. It meant that they had to be trained, equipped, and prepared for combat just as much as they were for peacekeeping." [...] This is reflected in the training and professionalism of the Canadian army mentioned later on the page. Moving to Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti a new peacekeeping partnership began to form. This required the assistance of soldiers and development organizations working hand in hand to achieve their rebuilding goals. These peacekeeping initiatives carried out by [...] "Canadians and other NATO troops in Bosnia and elsewhere in the post-Cold War conflicts are similar and relevant to what they are carrying out in Afghanistan. In many respects the peace-building in Kandahar <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> example of the 'new normal.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{declaration}} {{of a state of}} emergency, Bolivian troops took control of the airport in Pando's capital, Cobija, and prepared to retake the city. Morales accused the governor of Pando of orchestrating [...] "a massacre" [...] of farmers supporting Morales. Pando Governor Leopoldo Fernández rejected the accusation, saying [...] "They've accused me of using hit men, when everyone knows those socialist peasants, those fake peasants, were armed." [...] In a speech in Cochabamba, Morales condemned the opposition governors, saying they were [...] "conspiring against us with a fascist, racist coup," [...] and said they were [...] "the enemies of all Bolivians." [...] While promising to adopt a constitution opposed by the governors Morales said Bolivia's [...] "democratic revolution" [...] had to be seen through saying [...] "We have always cried 'fatherland or death'. If we don't emerge victorious, we have to die for the country and the Bolivian people." [...] Morales also said he would not hesitate to extend the state of emergency to other opposition-controlled departments. Rubén Costas, the governor of Santa Cruz, belittled the chances of a breakthrough in talks adding that [...] "if there <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> death or person wounded, any possibility of dialogue will be broken." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Jeffries from Allmusic noted Diddy's [...] "unfiltered self" [...] and [...] "unique attitude", stating [...] "This hook-filled, vibrant {{effort is}} that rare heartbreak album that can speak on a lovelorn level {{and then put}} a little strut back in your step." [...] Matt Sayles from The Boston Globe complimented its concept and praised the mixture of R vocals from Dirty Money and the guest {{features}} from the range of A-list friends, particularly Grace Jones stating that [...] "There’s no telling why she turns up but she sounds right {{at home on the}} thumping club anthem. [...] cameo <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> pleasant surprise on an album full of them." [...] Brandon Soderberg from The Village Voice was also impressed with the artistic creation. He said [...] "Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy’s word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It’s lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it’s overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that’s taken over as of late." [...] Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said [...] "Last Train to Paris {{is one of the first}} records that's really made me feel like [...] sounds clever. [...] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is that if you want to put sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... this album hits its mood right, though — gray skies, Eurorail, and drama — it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be." ...|$|E

[...] "Whether your politics have been those of an Imperialist from the broadest point of view--well, we won't discuss that question just now. We might, perhaps, differ. But there <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> point. Zealously and during the whole of your career, you have set your face steadfastly against any increase of our military power. They {{say that it is}} chiefly due to you and Mr. Busby that our army to-day is weaker in numbers than it has been for years. You have set your face steadily against all schemes for national service. You have taken up the stand that England can afford to remain neutral, whatever combination of Powers on the Continent may fight. Now tell me, do you see any possibility of failure, from the standpoint of a great politician, in your attitude?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> {{nuisance}} to {{be disposed}} of before I come to {{the positive side of}} my case. I mean the person who tells me that my schooldays belong to a bygone order of educational ideas and institutions, and that schools are not now a bit like my old school. I reply, with Sir Walter Raleigh, by calling on my soul to give this statement the lie. Some years ago I lectured in Oxford on the subject of Education. A friend to whom I mentioned my intention said, [...] "You know nothing of modern education: schools are not now what they were when you were a boy." [...] I immediately procured the time sheets of half a dozen modern schools, and found, as I expected, that they might all have been my old school: there was no real difference. I may mention, too, that I have visited modern schools, and observed that {{there is a tendency to}} hang printed pictures in an untidy and soulless manner on the walls, and occasionally to display on the mantel-shelf a deplorable glass case containing certain objects which might possibly, if placed in the hands of the pupils, give them some practical experience of the weight of a pound and the length of an inch. And sometimes a scoundrel who has rifled a bird's nest or killed a harmless snake encourages the children to go and do likewise by putting his victims into an imitation nest and bottle and exhibiting them as aids to [...] "Nature study." [...] A suggestion that Nature is worth study would certainly have staggered my schoolmasters; so perhaps I may admit a gleam of progress here. But as any child who attempted to handle these dusty objects would probably be caned, I do not attach any importance to such modernities in school furniture. The school remains what it was in my boyhood, because its real object remains what it was. And that object, I repeat, is to keep the children out of mischief: mischief meaning for the most part worrying the grown-ups.|$|E
