[...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|R

Born three years after the March on Rome, the Fascist state ideology was a consistent presence in her early life: her father's work required him {{to be a member of}} the Fascist Party, and she has recalled having to wear ‘silly armbands and uniforms otherwise you couldn’t go to school’. After spending a part of the war years in Emilia-Romagna - where twice she was arrested on suspicion of involvement with the partisans, and where she was strafed by Allied fighter aircraft while cycling on a county road - the family returned to Milan. Here, having lost most of his money, her father returned to work while she studied history at the University of Milan before moving to England in 1949 to learn English while working as an au pair. She has said that at the time food in Britain <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> discussed but that you ate. In England, she subsequently married Oliver Waley (1925-2007), and engaged in part-time work as the couple raised a family.|$|R

While both African and non-African critics agree that Achebe {{modelled}} Things Fall Apart on classic European literature, they disagree about whether his novel upholds a Western model, or, in fact, subverts or confronts it. Achebe continued to defend his decision: [...] "English is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> spend your lifetime acquiring, so it would <b>be</b> foolish <b>not</b> to use it.

40|$|As {{a farmer}} or rancher, {{you work hard}} for your money but may often have little to show for your efforts. While many {{of the reasons for}} poor {{profitability}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can control (prices for inputs, price received for livestock, price of fuel, weather extremes and more), there are many others you can control. Just like the crow in Aesop’s fable that could not reach the water {{in the bottom of the}} urn, just by taking one small step at a time, you can get what you want, too – increased profitability. Many of the causes of poor profit ability only require small changes on your part but can result in big returns over time. Reproductive Failure The single biggest source of losses on livestock operations is reproductive failure. A cow, doe or ewe that fails to produce and raise a live calf, kid or lamb incurs all of the costs of production for the year without generating an income. For this reason, females that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> pregnant at the end of the breeding season should be culled. Perhaps the most important reason animals fail to reproduce is poor nutrition. Females should be provided enough feed to maintain moderate or good body condition up until the time they give birth. Moderate to good body condition can be determined by body condition scoring. Your cows can be judged visually. They should be in body condition score (BCS) 5 (on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 = emaciated and 9 = obese) when they calve. (Se...|$|R

Throughout these phases, Humphrey kept a keen eye on color, light, and space while he moved between abstraction and representation. As Kenneth Baker explains in Art in America in 1984, “Each of his works defines an ideal viewing distance that can be discovered only by patient observation of {{the focus of the}} details, the resolution of the image and the proper relationship between body and object.

5000|$|For the Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., two new barristers (Asquith QC {{had just}} become Home Secretary), Finlay QC and T. Terrell made similar {{submissions}} to the counsel in the Queen's Bench, but also relied on new authorities {{to argue the}} company out of any contract. They again argued that the contract <b>was</b> <b>not</b> like other reward cases, because catching the flu <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> had control over, and that {{the words in the}} advertisement expressed a vague intention but in no way amounted to a promise. They said the terms were far too vague to make any contract. New arguments were that there was no [...] "consideration" [...] moving from the plaintiff - Mrs Carlill did nothing of value for the company - by getting the flu. They also argued that there was no communication of an intention by Mrs Carlill to accept the offer, and they relied on Brogden v. Metropolitan Ry. Co., where Lord Blackburn had said that to get a contract simply performing a private act <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough to create obligations on other people. If one was honestly going to take the advertisement seriously, then it would allow someone that stole the Smoke Ball, and used it and got the flu, to get a reward. But that would be absurd because there would be no benefit given to the company. And, using the arguments from the Queen's Bench briefly, even if it was a contract between a purchaser and the company, it would still be void as a wagering (gambling) contract or as an insurance contract without the required form.|$|R

Hedrick thought Garcia bright and hip, and advised Garcia to attend poetry {{readings}} at the North Beach coffee houses, such as the Co-Existence Bagel Shop, the social centre of the Beat community.
