5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the <b>dietitian</b> and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital <b>dietitian</b> and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E

5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat {{are more expensive}} than grain, fruit and vegetables.

5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less <b>dietitian</b> support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E

Subjects and design. Data were collected by means of an anonymous questionnaire posted to the CS <b>dietitians</b> (N = 126). The questionnaire consisted of four sections: general information, demographic and logistical information, professional duties and competencies, and personal experience. Results. Ninety <b>dietitians</b> returned the completed questionnaire, giving a 71 % response. Thirty-nine per cent of <b>dietitians</b> were placed during the first round of allocation, with 48 % placed during the third round or after further deliberations. Eighty-eight per cent of the <b>dietitians</b> reported a safe worldng environment. Full competency was reported by 26 % of <b>dietitians</b> for therapeutic nutrition, 47 % for food service management and 30 % for community nutrition. Only 7 % of <b>dietitians</b> found it very difficult to execute their daily duties. At the outset, 55 % of <b>dietitians</b> had a positive attitude regarding the year, with this percentage increasing to 67 % towards the end of the year.

5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive <b>dietitian</b> support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a <b>dietitian</b> for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [67]- 70). This thesis {{assessed the}} level of job satisfaction of hospital <b>dietitians</b> across the United States. Job satisfaction of professional employees is important to administrators {{not only because of}} the intrinsic desirability of having satisfied employees but also due to job satisfaction?s role in goal commitment. There have been significant relationships found between high job satisfaction and reduced absenteeism, decreased turnover, lower stress levels, and fewer work-related accidents. Historically, <b>dietitians</b> have expressed a high overall job satisfaction but dissatisfaction with their pay and opportunities for promotion in their positions. This study used the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) to determine the <b>dietitians?</b> level of facet satisfaction and the Job in General (JIG) scale to assess overall job satisfaction. Hospital <b>dietitians</b> were selected to comprise the sample since hospitals are by far the largest employer of <b>dietitians</b> in the United States. The JDI and JIG scale along with a demographic survey were mailed to the nationwide random sample to assess {{the level of}} job satisfaction and characteristics of the <b>dietitians</b> and employing hospitals. Job satisfaction of 234 (46. 8 % response) <b>dietitians</b> was studied in relation to age, level of education, years in present position, years in profession, employment status, title, number of employees supervised, type of employing hospital, average census, and salary. Facet satisfaction scores were also compared to <b>dietitians</b> studied in the Agriesti-Johnson and Broski (1982) research. <b>Dietitians</b> in the study were moderately satisfied with their jobs overall. They exhibited satisfaction with all job facets except for promotion, which was consistent with previous research. No significant differences were found between demographic characteristics and overall job satisfaction. Significant differences were found between job facet satisfaction and varying demographic groups of <b>dietitians.</b> The <b>dietitians</b> in the current study were significantly more satisfied with the work itself, supervision, coworkers, and pay and significantly more dissatisfied with opportunities for promotion than <b>dietitians</b> studied by Agriesti-Johnson and Broski.
