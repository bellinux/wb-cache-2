These guidelines give the FTC {{the right to}} prosecute false and misleading advertisement claims. The green guidelines were not created {{to be used as}} an enforceable guideline but instead were intended to be followed voluntarily. Listed below are the green guidelines set by the FTC.*Qualifications and disclosures: The Commission traditionally has held that in order to be effective, any qualifications or disclosures such as those described in these guides should be sufficiently clear, prominent and understandable to prevent deception. Clarity of language, relative type size and proximity to the claim being qualified, and an absence of contrary claims that could undercut effectiveness, will maximize the likelihood that the qualifications and disclosures are appropriately clear and prominent.*Distinction between benefits of product, package and service: An environmental marketing claim should be presented {{in a way that makes}} clear whether the <b>environmental</b> <b>attribute</b> or benefit being asserted refers to the product, the product's packaging, a service or to a portion or component of the product, package or service. In general, if the <b>environmental</b> <b>attribute</b> or benefit applies to all but minor, incidental components of a product or package, the claim need not be qualified to identify that fact. There may be exceptions to this general principle. For example, if an unqualified [...] "recyclable" [...] claim is made and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, then the claim would be deceptive.*Overstatement of environmental attribute: An environmental marketing claim should not be presented in a manner that overstates the <b>environmental</b> <b>attribute</b> or benefit, expressly or by implication. Marketers should avoid implications of significant environmental benefits if the benefit is in fact negligible.*Comparative claims: Environmental marketing claims that include a comparative statement should be presented in a manner that makes the basis for the comparison sufficiently clear to avoid consumer deception. In addition, the advertiser should be able to substantiate the comparison.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a duopoly {{operating in a}} market with consumers who care about both an envi-ronmental attribute and other brand-specific attributes of products. Consumers are assumed {{to have the same}} willingness to pay for incremental improvements in the <b>environmental</b> <b>attribute</b> (the product’s “green-ness”), though less than its social value, and differ in their total willingness to pay for the product of each firm. Firms can be asymmetric, in that holding the environmental quality of products the same, one firm’s product is more desirable to the average consumer than that of the other firm due to differences in intrinsic product quality. We focus on effects driven purely by the strategic interaction of firms, and thus do not allow for an aggregate demand response to changes in product quality and prices. The paper examines the choice of environmental quality of products by firms {{in the absence of any}} public intervention and the implications of various forms of public intervention. We show that (i) in the absence of regulation, the higher intrinsic quality firm will produce the greener product, (ii) a subsidy on the fixed costs of improving the <b>environmental</b> <b>attribute</b> or on the sale of the green product increases enrvironmental quality of both firm’s products only if the firms are sufficiently similar, (iii) a minimum quality standard leads the greener firm to lower its environmental quality, (iv) environmental quality would be under-provided even if consumers full...|$|R

Thus, the relatively higher partial pressure of oxygen at the apical regions may mean the bacteria present there are able to enter a replicating state easier and thus proliferate faster.

40|$|With the ever-growing {{threat posed}} by climate change {{in the minds of}} the world’s population, {{consumers}} are being asked to alter their consumption behavior, in the hope that such a change may help address current and future climate challenges. Thus, conventional wisdom would suggest that firms should develop and promote a product based on its environmental credentials. In doing so, consumers are likely to feel as though they are making a positive impact on the environment. However, despite the importance of environmental consumption, green products are often viewed as orthogonal with product performance. Given the importance placed on a product’s performance ability, firms seeking to promote green products may find that their previously assumed asset has become a liability. In the present thesis, we aim to explore two unique strategies in which a firm can enhance a green product’s perceived performance ability. The first is that of green product communication strategy. While firms may desire a communication strategy whereby the product <b>environmental</b> <b>attribute</b> is the focal component, we posit that such an approach maybe have negative consequences. Therefore, we develop and test the concept of green understatement. In this strategy, a firm employs subtle (vs. explicit) <b>environmental</b> <b>attribute</b> signals to communicate a green product’s environmental aspect. The results of three experiments show that a green understatement communication strategy leads to higher performance evaluations. Moreover, we introduce several boundary conditions, whereby this effect becomes stronger in situations of higher performance criticality (Experiment 1) and far social distance (Experiment 2) but is mitigated when the <b>environmental</b> <b>attribute</b> becomes optional (Experiment 3). Furthermore, we examine the mediating mechanism of autonomous motivation, whereby a green understatement communication strategy positively impacts on a consumers’ sense of autonomy, thus enhancing performance evaluations. The second strategy that we explore is the role of green attribute optionality, whereby the green attribute becomes optional via two distinct default policies (i. e. opt-in and opt-out). Thus, although the green attribute is present and may enhance the products’ environmental characteristics, it is not required for it to function. The findings of three experiments demonstrate that the opt-in green attribute optionality strategy increases performance evaluations compared to the non-optional and opt-out strategies (Experiment 4). Moreover, we find that this effect is negated when an individual possesses an analytical, as compared to a holistic, mindset (Experiment 5). Finally, we show that green product typicality mediates the relationship between green attribute optionality and performance evaluations (Experiment 6). Specifically, when the product is seen as typical to the green product category, performance evaluations erode. Our findings help advance our theoretical understanding of the role of green product communications and attribute optionality. Moreover, we provide managerial insights into the promotion and the production of green products to alleviate the sustainability liability. ...|$|R
