25|$|An object either (1) is {{immediate}} to a sign, {{and that}} is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a <b>dynamic</b> <b>object,</b> which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's universe of discourse, the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) immediate to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) dyanamic, an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) final or normal, a question's true settlement, which would be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.|$|E

It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as Prince Hamlet. All of those are special or partial objects.

For example, marching troop can detect any adversary intrusion without blind spot by MBC. However, conventional works only focused on barrier coverage for static objects, which fail when the objects start to move. Issues to address these dynamic-object scenarios, we propose the problem of mobile barrier coverage for <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects.</b> The most challenge is how to effectively maintain MBC when the motion of objects are unpredictable. We propose a fully distributed algorithm for mobile sensor nodes to cooperatively move and maintain the high-quality barrier coverage.

40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} devoted to {{developing}} the method of intelligent coordination control of a complex heterogeneous ensemble of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects.</b> Methodology. The method of solving this problem {{is based on the}} case-scenario approach presenting the activity of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> as templates that adapt to changing external conditions by using scenarios. The algorithm of satisfaction of critical time constraints was used to adapt scenarios. The proposed method can adequately reflect the experience and knowledge of control of a dynamic objects’ group using similar decision stereotypes to control in similar situations. The main elements of case decisions such as control actions, operations, scenarios, and plans were described. Findings. The hybrid control system was implemented. The lower level of the system was developed based on the hybrid system BRIZ, which combining the subsystem based on cases with the subsystem that implements the movement model and so is master, while case subsystem is slave. The middle and top levels of the system were developed as the event-based hybrid system MUSSON, which includes case-scenario subsystem, storage subsystem and subsystem that calculating spatial regions based on the model. Scripts and triggers for each class of events were described by scripting language SCDL. Originality. The three-tier coordination control system for ensembles of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> based on case-scenario approach was proposed for the first time.

The proposed approach is insensitive to inaccuracies and incomplete observations. It can reduce the information overload in the situation analysis, as well as decision-making time, thus increasing the efficiency of coordination of ensembles of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> during their mission’s execution process.

40|$|Real-time motion {{planning}} in an unknown environment involves collision avoidance of static {{as well as}} moving agents. Strategies suitable for navigation in a stationary environment cannot be translated as strategies per se for dynamic environments. In a purely stationary environment all that the sensor can detect can only be a static object is assumed implicitly. In a mixed environment such an assumption is no longer valid. For efficient collision avoidance identification of the attribute of the detected object as static or dynamic is probably inevitable. Presented here are two novel schemes for perceiving the presence of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> in the robot's neighborhood. One of them, called the Model-Based Approach (MBA) detects motion by observing changes in {{the features of the}} environment represented on a map. The other CBA (cluster-based approach) partitions the contents of the environment into clusters representative of the objects. Inspecting the characteristics of the partitioned clusters reveals the presence of dynamic agents. The extracted <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> are tracked in consequent samples of the environment through a straightforward nearest neighbor rule based on the Euclidean metric. A distributed fuzzy controller avoids the tracked <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> through direction and velocity control of the mobile robot. The collision avoidance scheme is extended to overcome multiple <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> through a priority based averaging technique (PBA). Indicating the need for additional rules apart from the PBA to overcome conflicting decisions while tackling multiple <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> can be considered as another contribution of this effort. The method has been tested through simulations by navigating a sensor-based mobile robot amidst multiple <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> and its efficacy esta [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Image based {{reconstruction}} of urban environments is a challenging problem {{that deals with}} optimization of large number of variables, and has several sources of errors like the presence of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects.</b> Since most large scale approaches make the assumption of observing static scenes, <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> are relegated to the noise modeling section of such systems. This is an approach of convenience since the RANSAC based framework used to compute most multiview geometric quantities for static scenes naturally confine <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> to the class of outlier measurements. However, reconstructing <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> along with the static environment helps us get a complete picture of an urban environment. Such understanding can then be used for important robotic tasks like path planning for autonomous navigation, obstacle tracking and avoidance, and other areas. In this paper, we propose a system for robust SLAM that works in both static and dynamic environments. To overcome the challenge of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> in the scene, we propose a new model to incorporate semantic constraints into the reconstruction algorithm. While some of these constraints are based on multi-layered dense CRFs trained over appearance as well as motion cues, other proposed constraints can be expressed as additional terms in the bundle adjustment optimization process that does iterative refinement of 3 D structure and camera / object motion trajectories. We show results on the challenging KITTI urban dataset for accuracy of motion segmentation and {{reconstruction of}} the trajectory and shape of moving objects relative to ground truth. We are able to show average relative error reduction by a significant amount for moving object trajectory reconstruction relative to state-of-the-art methods like VISO 2, as well as standard bundle adjustment algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{conventional}} {{technique for}} dealing with <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> in SLAM is to detect them and then either treat them as outliers [20][1] or track them separately using traditional multi-target tracking [18]. We propose a technique that combines the least-squares formulation of SLAM and sliding window optimisation together with generalised expectation maximisation, to incorporate both <b>dynamic</b> and stationary <b>objects</b> directly into SLAM estimation. The sliding window allows us to postpone the commitment of model selection and data association decisions by delaying when they are marginalised permanently into the estimate. The two main contributions of this paper are thus: (i) using reversible model selection to include <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> into SLAM and (ii) incorporating reversible data association. We show empirically that (i) if <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> are present our method can include them in a single framework and hence maintain a consistent estimate and (ii) our estimator remains consistent when data association is difficult, for instance {{in the presence of}} clutter. We summarise the results of detailed and extensive tests of our method against various benchmark algorithms, showing its effectiveness. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for spatially and temporally coherent semantic co-segmentation and reconstruction of complex dynamic scenes from multiple static or moving cameras. Semantic co-segmentation exploits the coherence in semantic class labels both spatially, between views at a single time instant, and temporally, between widely spaced time instants of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> with similar shape and appearance. We demonstrate that semantic coherence results in improved segmentation and reconstruction for complex scenes. A joint formulation is proposed for semantically coherent object-based co-segmentation and reconstruction of scenes by enforcing consistent semantic labelling between views and over time. Semantic tracklets are introduced to enforce temporal coherence in semantic labelling and reconstruction between widely spaced instances of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects.</b> Tracklets of <b>dynamic</b> <b>objects</b> enable unsupervised learning of appearance and shape priors that are exploited in joint segmentation and reconstruction. Evaluation on challenging indoor and outdoor sequences with hand-held moving cameras shows improved accuracy in segmentation, temporally coherent semantic labelling and 3 D reconstruction of dynamic scenes...|$|R
