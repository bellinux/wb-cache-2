Multiple members of Jackson's family refused to support the film, and some family members even attempted to stop the film agreement in August 2009.

The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor Alberto Nisman {{was appointed to the}} case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and the Hezbollah group of carrying it out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran for a joint investigation.

On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional hearing to explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy.

5|$|In {{order to}} create an RPG that would appeal to a wide {{audience}} unfamiliar with the genre, and video games in general, Horii {{wanted to create a}} new kind of RPG that did not rely on previous experience with the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPG, did not require <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> rote fighting, and could appeal to any kind of gamer. To accomplish this he needed to simplify the system and have players associate themselves with the hero. Thus as the game progressed, the hero would become stronger, in contrast to games like Super Mario Bros. where the character Mario did not become progressively more powerful during the game. He wanted to build on Portopia and place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement. He developed a coming-of-age tale that audiences could relate to and made use of RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this.|$|E

40|$|We derive {{analytic}} expressions, and approximate them {{in closed}} form, for the effective detection aperture for Cerenkov radio emission from ultra-high-energy neutrinos striking the Moon. The resulting apertures {{are in good}} agreement with recent Monte Carlo simulations and support the conclusion of James & Protheroe (2009) that neutrino flux upper limits derived from the GLUE search (Gorham et al. 2004) were too low by an order of magnitude. We also use our analytic expressions to derive scaling laws for the aperture {{as a function of}} observational and lunar parameters. We find that at low frequencies downward-directed neutrinos always dominate, but at higher frequencies, the contribution from upward-directed neutrinos becomes increasingly important, especially at low neutrino energies. Detecting neutrinos from Earth near the GZK regime will likely require radio telescope arrays with extremely large collecting area and <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> exposure time. Higher energy neutrinos are most easily detected using lower frequencies. Lunar surface roughness is a decisive factor for obtaining detections at higher frequencies and higher energies.

25|$|In 1985, Yuji Horii and {{his team}} at Chunsoft began {{production}} on Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior). After Enix published the game in early 1986, it became the template for future console RPGs. The game {{was influenced by the}} first-person random battles in Wizardry, the overhead movement in , and the mystery storytelling in Horii's own 1983 visual novel game Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii's intention behind Dragon Quest was to create a RPG that appeals to a wider audience unfamiliar with the genre or video games in general. This required {{the creation of a new}} kind of RPG, that didn't rely on previous D experience, didn't require <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> rote fighting, and that could appeal to any kind of gamer. Compared to statistics-heavy computer RPGs, Dragon Quest was a more streamlined, faster-paced game based on exploration and combat, and featured a top-down view in dungeons, in contrast to the first-person view used for dungeons in earlier computer RPGs. The streamlined gameplay of Dragon Quest thus made the game more accessible to a wider audience than previous computer RPGs. The game also placed a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, building on Horii's previous work Portopia Serial Murder Case, but this time introducing a coming of age tale for Dragon Quest that audiences could relate to, making use of the RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this. It also featured elements still found in most console RPGs, like major quests interwoven with minor subquests, an incremental spell system, the damsel-in-distress storyline that many RPGs follow, and a romance element that remains a staple of the genre, alongside anime-style art by Akira Toriyama and a classical score by Koichi Sugiyama that was considered revolutionary for console video game music.|$|E
