Jackson forgave her parents for her stifled upbringing reasoning, [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} as we get older, we grow and learn a lot more. And I think that my father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arms and just hugged me. I was crying saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just held me tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand to take {{farewell}} in the Kablunet's fashion.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hand with}} a twinkle of rather grim amusement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>'is</b> {{hand and}} Sam shook it, and then shook 'ands with Peter Russet, who was {{grinning}} so 'ard that he couldn't speak.|$|R
60|$|She {{shoved him}} in {{in front of}} 'er and stood ever 'im while he climbed aboard. When <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>'is</b> hand to help 'er she struck it away.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> in <b>his</b> hand {{a little}} purse, and chinked {{the money it}} enclosed.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, {{which she}} took passively, {{and he moved}} away.|$|E
60|$|Burton {{rose to his}} feet. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hand for}} the manuscript.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hand for}} the book, and found another passage for her.|$|E
60|$|She {{had stopped}} {{at the corner of}} the wall. <b>He</b> again <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand. Her little fingers slid coldly between his.|$|R
60|$|Selingman {{set down}} the bottle upon the table. Two great tears rolled down from <b>his</b> blue eyes. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> both <b>his</b> hands and gripped Maraton's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Joe, [...] "a rum upset--that there. Swig this down, sir!" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> to <b>his</b> master, a flask-cup {{filled with}} brandy. Mr. Lavender {{swallowed}} it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, {{and noticed}} with swift {{comprehension}} her first instinctive withdrawal.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hand and}} gave mine an earnest clasp. Then he went away.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand to Carnally, {{and they}} gripped in silence. Words were unnecessary.|$|E
60|$|It seemed his {{intention}} to say no more. But, after he had quite broken off, his deep eyes filled with tears, and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> both <b>his</b> hands to me.|$|R
60|$|There {{we found}} our patient, still, indeed, deadly pale, but vastly {{recovered}} and already {{seated on a}} chair. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> both <b>his</b> hands with a most pitiful gesture of interrogation.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{knock at}} the door, and Selingman entered, his face wreathed in smiles. He was wearing a long dinner coat and a flowing black tie. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> both <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, but {{she seemed}} {{in no hurry to}} let him go.|$|E
60|$|They {{reached the}} gate of the villa. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand to say good-by.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{arms and}} she came {{to him with a}} little sigh of satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|Emmie raved and wept, {{the secret}} flew abroad. But Matilda was silent and unmoved, Hadrian {{was quiet and}} satisfied, and nipped with fear also. But <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> against <b>his</b> fear. Mr. Rockley was very ill, but unchanged.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> the parchment, <b>his</b> eyes {{watching}} me intently, {{so that they}} never once strayed to Bianca.|$|R
60|$|He now rose, {{and went}} towards Robin, who {{got up from}} his seat as <b>he</b> approached, and <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arms to her. His {{eyes were}} bright with {{the joy of}} conquest.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> cutlass for inspection. It {{had been}} seriously bent {{in the recent}} encounter.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand gayly, but Collinson {{retained}} the slipper while he gravely examined it.|$|E
60|$|Eldon Parr was huddled {{over his}} desk reading a typewritten document; but <b>he</b> rose, and <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, which Hodder took.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's your appointment," [...] he said briefly, {{throwing}} away his pen, folding {{what he had}} written, and handing it to Jeff. It {{was the first time}} that he had looked at him since he entered. <b>He</b> now <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, grasped Jeff's, and said, [...] "Good-night!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> again <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand to Harry, {{and the boy}} {{left the}} cabinet with his heart burning with loyalty toward his monarch, and {{resolved}} that life itself should be held cheap {{if it could be}} spent in the service of so gracious and majestic a king.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, but {{she threw}} her arms round his neck, and kissed him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand. On {{the palm}} were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand. She hesitated, then gripped it heartily, {{and smiled}} through her tears.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> eagerly <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand {{to receive}} the goblet, but Sibyl, holding it beyond his reach a moment, {{deliberately}} let it fall upon the hearth, where it shivered into fragments, and the bright, cold water of immortality was all spilt, shedding its strange fragrance around.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> had <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arms, {{but they}} had fallen again to his side; for she had not come forward, {{remaining}} still in {{the opening of the}} doorway. Mere yellow skeleton that he was now, he felt the contrast between them, and thought his appearance distasteful to her.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{the signs}} stamped {{into her face}} of the evil times through which she had passed, and the more {{immediate}} traces of the crisis which lay so close behind her. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> both <b>his</b> hands, and stepped quickly toward her. He was only {{just in time to}} save her from falling.|$|R
