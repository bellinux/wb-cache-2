It will treat the question, how a country, hence a political system which was such closed and had a quite small economical standard and growth rate was able to improve in a tremendous way. This present fact discovers various questions, such like: How is it possible that a closed socialist state can <b>improve</b> <b>its</b> <b>economical</b> increase and international trade in a tremendous way? How is an increase in trade and production combined with energy consumption? How can China secure its energy sources in order to secure its production and energy household?

40|$|International audienceWaste wood {{valorisation}} may {{be done in}} {{many ways}} leading to chemical components production such as H 2 or methane but also into heat and/or electricity. In an eco-industrial park, heat recovery from the conversion process (wood to Hydrogen) may lead to better economical results. In this paper, we introduce a methodology leading {{to the design of}} an energy integrated waste wood to hydrogen conversion process in order to <b>improve</b> <b>its</b> <b>economical</b> performance when integrated in an eco-industrial park valorising its excess heat. The methodology is based on process modelling followed by its energy integration leading to a heat exchanger network synthesis. The process investment cost is calculated as a function of its operating conditions while the process revenue is evaluated using hydrogen and excess heat sales income. The parametric study is done using a Modelica based model while the heat exchangers network synthesis is done using a MILP algorithm implemented in the CERES platform...|$|E
40|$|IHC - IS Viti&Climate: Effect of Climate Change on Production and Quality of Grapevines {{and their}} Products, 28 th, 2012 Water is {{increasingly}} scarce in Mediterranean Europe and irrigated agriculture {{is one of}} the largest and most inefficient users of this natural resource. Ecological topics such as the “water foot print” have become more relevant for the academy, consumers, governments and food industry. The wine sector needs solutions to <b>improve</b> <b>its</b> <b>economical</b> and environmental sustainability. Agronomical solutions, such as deficit irrigation (water supply below full crop evapotranspiration) have emerged as a tool for more efficient water use in irrigated viticulture and with likely positive effects on berry quality. Improving our understanding on the physiological and molecular basis of grapevine responses to water stress is an important task for research on irrigated viticulture. Better knowledge of the different genotypic responses (e. g., leaf gas exchange) to water stress can help to optimize crop/soil management and improve yield as well as berry quality traits under unfavourable climate conditions. Mild water deficits have direct and/or indirect (via the light environment in the cluster zone) effects on berry growth and composition. Another important challenge is to determine how soil water deficit regulate genes and proteins of the various metabolic pathways influencing berry composition and consequently wine quality...|$|E
40|$|Microfinance and micro credits are {{concepts}} {{that are used}} frequently when talking about poverty reducing actions. This paper is {{a case study of}} the poverty alleviation impacts of microfinance institutions and it contrasts the effects of Grameen Bank and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) operating in Bangladesh. The case study examines the organisations effects in the 21 st century since most of the reports have compared the effects in the past not reflecting on future conditions. The questions at issue are if Grameen Bank and BRAC can affect the poverty status of its members in a positive way {{and if there is a}} positive effect, which of the approaches are the best to use? To analyse the non monetary dimension, concepts such as health and education has been used as indicators for poverty reduction and the monetary indicator used is income through employment. Simultaneously economic models and concepts have been considered throughout the paper. The findings of this case study implied that both organisations have positive effects on reducing poverty among its members, but BRAC has the broadest view seeing to all factors investigated and therefore its approach is the best to use. Nevertheless, as previous studies have implied sustainability and cost-effectiveness within the microfinance programme is important for the long-run poverty reduction. Evaluating the economic performance of the two organisations Grameen Bank is more efficient in using its resources than BRAC, but Grameen Bank show a decreasing rate of efficiency while BRAC is improving significantly. With this in consideration BRAC is still showing the best poverty reducing result for its members today, but if the organisation does not find a way to <b>improve</b> <b>its</b> <b>economical</b> performance its actions will not be sustainable in the long run...|$|E

40|$|Esta dissertaÃÃo investiga o grau de eficiÃncia dos investimentos realizados pela Faculdade Santo Agostinho â FSA, empresa do ramo de educaÃÃo {{superior}} em Teresina - PiauÃ, tendo como foco a anÃlise dos determinantes da relaÃÃo Receita/Custo. O objetivo principal Ã analisar o impacto dos investimentos com gastos em propaganda, tecnologia, treinamento e programa de incentivo salarial sobre a relaÃÃo Receita/Custo. Especificamente, os objetivos sÃo quantificar, atravÃs de um modelo economÃtrico, a contribuiÃÃo dos gastos com propaganda, tecnologia, treinamento e incentivo salarial sobre a relaÃÃo Receita/Custo e avaliar qualitativamente os resultados. Para alcanÃar esses objetivos se fez uso do modelo economÃtrico autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) utilizando uma amostra de dados primÃrios mensais de 2001 a 2006, coletados do balanÃo social da empresa. Os resultados obtidos apontam que as variÃveis gasto com treinamento, tecnologia e o plano de incentivo salarial da FSA impactam positivamente a relaÃÃo Receita/Custo com o maior impacto dando-se atravÃs dos gastos com tecnologia. Por outro lado, o gasto com propaganda se mostrou nÃo significante para explicar esta relaÃÃo. Nesse sentido, essa instituiÃÃo precisa rever sua polÃtica de propaganda com o intuito de melhorar sua eficiÃncia econÃmica. This dissertation {{investigates the}} degree of efficiency of the investments accomplished by Faculdade Santo Agostinho -FSA, a company in the branch of superior education in Teresina - PiauÃ, tending as focus {{the analysis of the}} determinants of the relationship Revenue/Cost. The main objective is to analyze the impact of the investments with expenses in propaganda, technology, training and program of salary incentive about the relationship Revenue/Cost. Specifically, the objectives are to quantify, through an econometric model, the contribution of the expenses with propaganda, technology, training and salary incentive about the relationship Revenue/Cost and to evaluate qualitatively the results. In order to reach those objectives it was applied the econometric model autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticde (ARCH) getting a sample of monthly primary data from 2001 to 2006, collected from the social balance of the company. The acquired results show that the variables: expenses with training, technology and the plan of salary incentive of FSA impact positively on the relationship Revenue/Cost, with the largest impact occurring through the expenses with technology. On the other side, the expense with propaganda was not significant to explain this relationship. This way, the institution needs to review its propaganda politics with the objective to <b>improve</b> <b>its</b> <b>economical</b> efficiency...|$|E
