40|$|The {{degree of}} nonuniformity of the billet {{temperature}} {{subjected to the}} radiative heat loss to the <b>discharge</b> <b>door</b> with different insulation thicknesses is investigated in this present study. The 2 -D steady-state heat conduction for the billet subjected to different heat fluxes is solved by being transformed into a dimensionless form. The Gauss-Seidel iterative method for a finite volume discretization of the billet is employed to obtain the temperature distribution of the billet. The numerical result is validated by comparing with the field measurement data. A qualitative agreement between these two is observed. An effect of different insulation thicknesses on the heat-transfer characteristics {{and the degree of}} nonuniformity of the billet temperature is examined. In case of the replaced 50 -mm thick insulation of the <b>discharge</b> <b>door,</b> the radiative heat loss to the <b>discharge</b> <b>door</b> is reduced by 49 % with the replaced insulation, and the degree of nonuniformity of the billet temperature is decreased by 23 Â°C...|$|E

50|$|In 1999 Freight Victoria, by {{then the}} {{operator}} of all Victorian freight trains, had expanded its grain operations to the Riverina areas of NSW; to facilitate this about 100 wagons from the post-1979 batches (selected fairly randomly) became VHAF; the new code represented their additional air-operated roof lids and <b>discharge</b> <b>doors,</b> operated by the main air-reservoir pipe (another group of ex JAF/X type wagons from the 1974 build also used this code).|$|R
50|$|Further {{conversions}} {{occurred in}} 2001-2003, when Freight Australia contracted ANI Bradken (Mittagong, NSW) to rebuild 22 of the VHEF class and 20 of the VHGF class {{to achieve a}} 100 LT capacity; the former were rebuilt into VHNY-class 100 LT grain wagons, becoming 1000-1021, while the latter kept their numbers (in the 230-296 range) but were reclassed to VHLY. The modifications were achieved by adding pneumatic roof hatches and <b>discharge</b> <b>doors,</b> strengthened side sills, a higher roof and stronger bogies. Around the same time, for comparison purposes, Alstom was contracted to new-build nine 100 LT grain hoppers at its Ballarat North Workshops; these became VHKY 1151-1159.|$|R

These were run in block trains of 16 wagons making a load of 1020 LT. These were hauled by a single 49 class diesel locomotive from Broken Hill to Parkes, the loading being 200 tons greater than the maximum allowed for the 49 class. At Parkes a 36 class and AD60 class Garratt took over for the journey to Molong where the 36 was replaced by another AD60 for the journey to Lithgow. A 46 class electric locomotive took the train from Lithgow to Gosford (the then limit of electrification) where another AD60 would take over to Sulphide Junction.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Cross docking {{is a form}} of {{operating}} break-bulk freight terminals in which the receiving products are not stocked but, instead, the incoming cargo is internally transferred to be immediately shipped in distribution trucks. With this approach, inventory costs and lead-times are significantly reduced. In this work, an approximate, continuous, non-stationary queueing model is established to estimate the number of cargo <b>discharging</b> <b>doors</b> in the receiving dock. Since the traditional first-come, first-served queueing discipline is not applicable to this specific problem, an alternative formulation, called least-distance, firstserved queue discipline, is adopted and analysed with a simulation approach. The problem is modelled to support a preliminary design of a cross-dock terminal. The objective function, to be minimized, is the sum of the rent cost of the terminal facility, the waiting cost of inbound trailers when being attended at the terminal, and the cost of handling and moving freight inside the terminal...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} a new kinematics of the billet reheating furnace unloading door, {{by using a}} noncircular gear train in the drive mechanism. The main objective of the kinematics modification {{is to reduce the}} heat loss by increasing the unloading door speed, during the stroke, while kept it at the conventional value {{at the beginning and end}} of stroke. In order to modify the door kinematics, the drive mechanism output motion is controlled by noncircular gears whose transmission ratio is defined as a hybrid multiparameters function. A study is developed to analyse the influence of the defining parameters on the variation of the gears transmission ratio and on the <b>discharging</b> <b>door</b> speed, respectively. Based on the analytical study, a certain law of variation was chosen to describe the mechanism kinematics; in accordance to the kinematics variation, the mating noncircular centrodes/pitch curves were modelled and the gears teeth are generated, considering constant circular pitch and constant pressure angle, respectively...|$|R

5000|$|The system {{consists}} of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the {{discharge from the}} vessel's oily water separator. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The bilge water from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil content meter. A flow switch secures that there is flow through the oil content meter and a flow meter counts the accumulated discharged overboard volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil content meter is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil content meter, accumulated <b>discharged</b> volume, <b>door</b> position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [...] cannot be tampered with and equally importantly provides {{the evidence that the}} vessel has been compliant. The recorder data is stored in an encrypted format and can be presented to any official body such as Port State Control, United States Coast Guard, Vetting or Classification society officials to prove that the vessel has been compliant to MARPOL 73/78 (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships) or any national regulation, and that no illegal discharge has been made.|$|R

The latter Youth (who {{used to be called}} Heigh-ho Dobbin, Gee-ho Dobbin, and by many other names indicative of puerile contempt) was the quietest, the clumsiest, and, as it seemed, the dullest of all Dr. Swishtail's young gentlemen. His parent was a grocer in the city: and it was bruited abroad that he was admitted into Dr. Swishtail's academy upon what are called [...] "mutual principles"--that is to say, the expenses of his board and schooling were defrayed by his father in goods, not money; and he stood there--most {{at the bottom of the}} school--in his scraggy corduroys and jacket, through the seams of which his great big bones were bursting--as the representative of so many pounds of tea, candles, sugar, mottled-soap, plums (of which a very mild proportion was supplied for the puddings of the establishment), and other commodities. A dreadful day it was for young Dobbin when one of the youngsters of the school, having run into the town upon a poaching excursion for hardbake and polonies, espied the cart of Dobbin & Rudge, Grocers and Oilmen, Thames Street, London, at the Doctor's <b>door,</b> <b>discharging</b> a cargo of the wares in which the firm dealt.|$|R

The existing Older Adult Mental Health (OAMH) liaison service was increasingly unable to meet the escalating needs of older and frail patients. Therefore, the service was modernized and enhanced on an âinvest-to-saveâ principle to provide a prompt holistic assessment for older adults with mental health problems. The objective of this study was a service evaluation to appraise clinical outcome, minimize the length of stay, and measure the predictors of adverse outcomes to streamline this enhanced service. Materials and methods: Patient demographics, social care needs, comorbidity burden (Charlson comorbidity index, CCI), and functional status (Barthel index, BI) were recorded from November 2014 to February 2015. Frailty status (frailty index, FI) was measured by an index (Rockwood index) of accumulated deficits. The outcomes were compared with the previous OAMH liaison service data over {{the same period a year}} earlier. Results: The new Rapid Assessment Interface and Discharge service assessed 339 Â patients compared to 179 by the previous liaison team over the 4 -month period. Mean age was 82. 18 Â± 8. 04 Â years, with 60 % women; preadmission BI was 14. 96 Â± 4. 35, and admission BI was 11. 38 Â± 5. 73 (P< 0. 001, paired t-test); mean CCI was 1. 66 Â± 1. 53, and mean FI was 0. 34 Â± 0. 99, and 80 % were on polypharmacy. The direct <b>discharges</b> from front <b>door</b> were increased by 7 %. The mean hospital stay reduced from 35 to 20 Â days in acute site and from 108 to 47 days in long-stay wards. The cost benefits were based on the mean reduction in hospital stay (41. 8 days) and admission reduction (2. 2 Â days), leading to a total annualized bed savings of 44 Â days. FI was the most highly significant factor between patient groups with a good and poor outcome (P= 0. 00003, independent groups t-test, t=- 4. 38, df 98). Conclusion: Prompt mental health assessments for acutely unwell frail older people are not only cost effective but also improve clinical outcomes.

40|$|As Jakarta {{developed}} into a metropolitan city, flood problems become {{the center of attention}} for its citizens and the government of Jakarta. Ciliwung River is one of the significant contributors to flood discharge in Jakarta. Flood control in Jakarta area requires a very hard effort, considering the geological conditions which is an area of the basin and hydrological conditions are very vulnerable to inundation because bypassed by many rivers from upstream. Changes in land use that was once empty land converted to settlements, housing, and the building also has occurred both in the upstream and downstream along the rivers that pass through Jakarta. After an evaluation of watershed and watershed Krukut Sunter which is around Ciliwung watershed, it was found that there were streams of the watershed around the exit and entry into the Ciliwung watershed. These rivers flood contributed by Â± 25 % of the Ciliwung watershed resulting in widespread inundation in Jakarta increases. One of the efforts to control flooding in Jakarta is the construction of weirs Katulampa which serves as an early information system to flooding Ciliwung will enter Jakarta. From the evaluation of the function obtained Katulampa weir water level to Alert 1 is 200 - 250 cm to estimate flood discharge using HEC-HMS at 733 m 3 / s. Data on the water level in the dam Katulampa estimates that approximately 9 - 10 hours later flood will arrive in Jakarta.
