Initially, the enterotoxigenic {{abilities}} of four Staph. aureus LHA, LHB, LHC and LHD strains isolated from raw ovine milk were examined in both BHI broth and ovine milk. In BHI broth, the Staph. aureus LHA, LHB, LHC and LHD strains were found toxigenic at 37 degrees C producing the staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) serotypes SEA, SEB, SEC and SED, respectively, whereas in ovine milk at 37 degrees C, Staph. aureus LHD was found to produce only SED, while no SE production was observed for the other examined strains. Thus, the fate of only Staph. aureus LHD and SED were examined in Feta and Galotyri cheeses. The cheeses were made from raw ovine toxic milk with preformed SED or raw ovine milk contaminated with high (ca 6 log cfu/ml) and low inocula (ca 3 log cfu/ml) of Staph. aureus LHD. Results showed that the pathogen was eliminated at slower rate in <b>Galotyri</b> <b>cheese</b> than in Feta cheese, for the high (5 d vs. 16 d) or the low (1 d vs. 12 d) inoculum trials. In both cheeses produced from the toxic milk, SED was detected during manufacturing and storage. SED was also detected in the curd (2 h), when Staph. aureus LHD populations had reached ca 7 log cfu/g, {{and up to the}} end of storage for the high inoculum trials of both cheeses. No SED was observed for the low inoculum trials of either cheese...|$|E
