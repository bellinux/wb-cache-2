40|$|As the {{foreclosure}} crisis continues, many communities {{are faced with}} a glut of properties that have completed {{the foreclosure}} process and are now owned by banks or other mortgage lenders. These properties, referred to as “real estate owned (REO), ” often sit vacant for extended periods and, recent studies suggest, depress neighboring property values. They also impose significant costs on local governments, which must try to address the risk of crime, <b>fire,</b> and <b>blight</b> that vacant buildings pose. In addition, many worry that REO properties sold to unscrupulous short-term investors hasten neighborhood decline. In this article we shed new light on the “REO problem ” by studying the stock of REO properties at the neighborhood level in three urban areas: Fulton County, Georgia (which includes Atlanta), Miami-Dade County, Florida, and New York City. Using a combination of longitudinal administrative data sets on foreclosure filings, auction sales, and property transactions provided by local government sources, we identify every property transfer into REO ownership in recent years and all subsequent transfers of these properties. To explore the ongoing neighborhood and community development challenges, we divide census tracts into four groups based on their concentrations of REO properties as of the end of 2011.

The disease can affect every part of the tree, from the fruit to the trunk. Infected trees may die within months or can linger for years with severely reduced yields. In addition to the scorched appearance of the plant parts that gives the disease its name, plant tissues infected with the bacteria will exude milky or reddish-brown ooze.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Before European settlement, vast {{areas of}} the eastern US {{deciduous}} forest were dominated by oak species.

During European settlement of the late 19 th and early 20 th century, much of the eastern United States was impacted by land-clearing, extensive timber harvesting, severe <b>fires,</b> the chestnut <b>blight,</b> and then <b>fire</b> suppression and intensive deer browsing. These activities had the greatest negative impact on the once-dominant white oak, while temporarily promoting the expansion of other oaks such as red oak and chestnut oak. More recently, however, recruitment of all the dominant upland oaks waned on all but the most xeric sites. Mixed-mesophytic and later successional hardwood species, such as red maple, sugar maple, black birch, beech, black gum and black cherry, are aggressively replacing oak. The leaf litter of these replacement species is less flammable and more rapidly mineralized than that of the upland oaks, reinforcing the lack of fire. The trend toward increases in nonoak tree species will continue in fire-suppressed forests, rendering them less combustible for forest managers who wish to restore natural fires regimes. This situation greatly differs from the western United States, where fire suppression during the 20 th century has made a variety of conifer-dominated forests more prone to stand-replacing fire.

40|$|Abstract. —Prior to European {{settlement}} vast {{areas of}} the eastern U. S. deciduous forest were dominated by oak species.

During European settlement of the late 19 th and early 20 th century, much of the Eastern United States was impacted by land clearing, extensive timber harvesting, severe <b>fires,</b> the chestnut <b>blight,</b> and then <b>fire</b> suppression and intensive deer browsing. These activities had the greatest negative impact on the once dominant white oak, while temporarily promoting the expansion of other oaks such as red oak and chestnut oak. More recently, recruitment of all the dominant upland oaks waned on all but the most xeric sites. Mixed-mesophytic and later successional hardwood species such as red maple, sugar maple, black birch, beech, black gum and black cherry are aggressively replacing oak. At Fort Indiantown Gap in southeast Pennsylvania, periodic burning over the last 50 years resulted in sites with lower tree density and a higher proportion of overstory oak species than unburned stands. Oak saplings averaged 875 per ha in burned forests and 31 per ha in unburned forests. Red maple had overstory importance of 7 percent and 24 percent in burned and unburned stands, respectively. The leaf litter of many oak replacement species (e. g., red maple, sugar maple, black birch, beech, black gum and black cherry) is less flammable and more rapidly mineralized than that of the upland oaks, reinforcing the lack of fire.
