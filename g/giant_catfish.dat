Though struggling, Will tells his father of their {{imagined}} daring escape from the hospital to the nearby lake, where everyone from Edward’s past is there to see him off. Will takes Edward into the river, where he transforms into the <b>giant</b> <b>catfish</b> and swims away. A satisfied Edward dies, knowing Will finally understands his love for storytelling. At the funeral, Will and Joséphine are surprised when all the people from Edward’s stories come to the service, though each one is a slightly less fantastical version than described. Will, finally understanding his father’s love for life, passes on Edward’s stories to his own son.|$|E

2500|$|Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are {{a diverse}} group of ray-finned fish. Named for their {{prominent}} barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong <b>giant</b> <b>catfish</b> from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, Vandellia cirrhosa. There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby. [...] Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many Auchenipteridae) are crepuscular or diurnal (most Loricariidae or Callichthyidae for example).|$|E

50|$|Grey {{to white}} in colour and lacking stripes, the Mekong <b>giant</b> <b>catfish</b> is {{distinguished}} from other large catfish species in this river by the near-total lack of barbels {{and the absence}} of teeth. The Mekong <b>giant</b> <b>catfish</b> currently holds the Guinness Book of World Records position for the worlds largest freshwater fish. Attaining an unconfirmed length of 3 m, the Mekong <b>giant</b> <b>catfish</b> grows extremely quickly, reaching a mass of 150 to 200 kg in six years. It can reportedly weigh up to 350 kg. The largest catch recorded in Thailand since record-keeping began in 1981 was a female measuring 2.7 m in length and weighing 293 kg. This specimen, caught in 2005, is widely recognized as the largest freshwater fish ever caught (although the largest sturgeon species can far exceed this size, they are anadromous). Thai Fisheries officials stripped the fish of its eggs as part of a breeding programme, intending then to release it, but the fish died in captivity and was sold as food to local villagers.|$|E
