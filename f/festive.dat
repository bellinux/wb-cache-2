5|$|A typical day-to-day {{traditional}} {{vegetarian meal}} of Uttar Pradesh, {{like any other}} North Indian thali, consists of roti (flatbread), chawal, dal, sabji, raita and papad. Many people still drink the traditional drink chaach (traditional Butter milk) with meals. On <b>festive</b> occasions, usually 'tava' (flat pan for roti) is considered inauspicious, and instead fried foods are consumed. A typical <b>festive</b> thali consists of Puri, Kachauri, sabji, pulav, papad, raita, salad and desserts (such as sewai or Kheer).|$|E
5|$|Each vocal {{movement}} of the cantata is assigned to one verse of the psalm. The work {{has been described as}} a brief, sunny and <b>festive</b> work.|$|E

5|$|Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was {{released}} on 14 January 1956 during the <b>festive</b> occasion of Thai Pongal. It was a milestone in Ramachandran's career and became a success {{at the box office}} which was largely attributed to it being the first full-length colour film in South India. The songs also attained popularity. The film was later dubbed in Telugu as Ali Baba 40 Dongalu.|$|E
5|$|Although Hindu {{women have}} {{traditionally}} worn saris, the shalwar kameez and Western attire is gaining acceptance among younger women. Western dress is worn more by men, although the dhoti and kurta are seen during festivals. The formal male sherwani is often worn with chooridar on <b>festive</b> occasions. Diwali, holi and Vijayadasami {{are the three}} most popular festivals in Allahabad.|$|E
5|$|Bach was in {{his second}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, where the feast was the only {{occasion}} during Lent when <b>festive</b> music was permitted. The theme of the hymn suits both the Annunciation and Palm Sunday, in a spirit of longing expectation of an arrival. An unknown poet retained, as in the other chorale cantatas of Bach's second cantata cycle, the hymn's first and last stanza unchanged, but paraphrased the themes of the inner stanzas to a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes da caccia, two solo violins, strings and continuo. All instruments play in the opening <b>festive</b> chorale fantasia, while the soprano carries the hymn tune and the lower voices answer in counterpoint of instrumental motifs. An oboe da caccia accents the first aria, the solo violins and strings return in the second aria, and an independent horn part crowns the closing chorale.|$|E
5|$|Every Christmas, Oxford Street is {{decorated}} with <b>festive</b> lights. The tradition of Christmas lights began in 1959, {{five years after the}} neighbouring Regent Street. There were no light displays in 1976 or 1977 due to economic recession, but the lights returned in 1978 when Oxford Street organised a laser display, and they have been there every year since.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>festive</b> occasion, the cantata is scored {{for three}} vocal soloists—alto, tenor and bass—a four-part choir, two horns (corno da caccia), two oboes, two violins, viola and basso continuo. Bach later used a similar scoring in Part IV of his Christmas Oratorio, to be {{performed}} on New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|The hymn tune Mendelssohn– an {{adaptation}} by William Hayman Cummings of a melody from Mendelssohn's cantata Festgesang (<b>Festive</b> Hymn), a secular 1840s composition, which Mendelssohn felt unsuited to sacred music – {{has become the}} standard tune for Charles Wesley's popular Christmas hymn Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.|$|E
5|$|The {{legends of}} Mohini {{are also being}} {{depicted}} in other dances, including the modern Kathak. The Sonal Nati, performed in the Saho area of Chamba district, Himachal Pradesh, retells the Mohini-Bhasmasura tale, and hence {{is known as the}} Mohini-Bhasmasura dance. It is performed on <b>festive</b> occasions, especially in the Saho fair held in Baisakh in the precincts of the Chandershekhar temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild onion}} dinner is a <b>festive</b> {{gathering}} that originated with the Southeastern tribes which call Eastern Oklahoma home. The meals often feature wild onion, pork, frybread, corn bread, Poke salad and a unique dish known as grape biscuits. The Tulsa Indian Women's Club has been holding annual Wild Onion Dinners {{since at least}} 1932.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{national}} flag is reserved to serve either informative of <b>festive</b> purposes. A single specimen {{of the flag}} on or {{in front of a}} public office building indicates its official role. Multiple flags, on the other hand, are normally used to decorate both public and private buildings to mark special occasions, such as national holidays.|$|E
5|$|With A Christmas Carol, Dickens {{captured}} the zeitgeist of the mid-Victorian {{revival of the}} Christmas holiday. He has been acknowledged as an influence on the modern Western observance of Christmas and inspired several aspects of Christmas, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a <b>festive</b> generosity of spirit.|$|E

5|$|Aarhus hosts many annual or {{recurring}} festivals, {{concerts and}} events, with the festival of Aarhus Festuge {{as the most}} popular and wide-ranging, along with large sports events. It is the largest multicultural festival in Scandinavia, always based on a special theme and takes place every year for ten days between late August and early September, transforming the inner city with <b>festive</b> activities and decorations of all kinds.|$|E
5|$|Anbe Vaa was {{released}} on 14 January 1966, during the <b>festive</b> occasion of Thai Pongal. It received positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised Ramachandran's performance, as he was known for doing mainly action-adventure films up until that point in his career. The film was also a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 23 weeks. It was also dubbed into Telugu, under the title Prema Manasulu.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, about three months after taking office at the end of May 1723. A <b>festive</b> service at the Nikolaikirche was an annual event, celebrating the inauguration of a new town council, always held on the Monday after St. Bartholomew (August 24). The text by an anonymous poet includes psalm verses and an excerpt from Martin Luther's German Te Deum. It is focused on acknowledgement of authority as a gift of God, thanks for past blessings, and prayer for future help.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a <b>festive</b> Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with the voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the contradictions}} within Ramesside king lists {{and the lack}} of contemporary, <b>festive</b> inscriptions, the exact chronological {{position}} of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba could have been the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, he points to the names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.|$|E
5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning {{to fall out of}} favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the <b>festive</b> entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.|$|E
5|$|Charing Cross was {{a central}} staging post for coaches, but the {{congested}} narrow road was a frequent scene of accidents; here, a bonfire has caused the Salisbury Flying Coach to overturn. <b>Festive</b> bonfires were usual but risky: a house fire lights the sky in the distance. A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnought was christened with {{a bottle}} of Australian wine by King Edward VII on 10 February 1906, after only four months on the ways. The bottle {{required}} multiple blows to shatter on a bow that later became famous. Signifying the ship's importance the launch had been planned to be a large elaborate <b>festive</b> event, however as the court was still in mourning for Queen Alexandra's father who had died twelve days before, she did not attend and a more sober event occurred.|$|E
5|$|Football (soccer), cricket and archery are {{the most}} popular sports in Gangtok. The Paljor Stadium, which hosts {{football}} matches, is the sole sporting ground in the city. Thangka—a notable handicraft—is an elaborately hand painted religious scroll in brilliant colours drawn on fabric hung in a monastery or a family altar and occasionally carried by monks in ceremonial processions. Chhaams are vividly costumed monastic dances performed on ceremonial and <b>festive</b> occasions, especially in the monasteries during the Tibetan new year.|$|E
5|$|Other yearly festivals are Paris-Plages, a <b>festive</b> {{event that}} lasts from mid-July to mid-August when the Right Bank of the Seine is {{converted}} into a temporary beach with sand, deck chairs and palm trees; Journées du Patrimoine, Fête de la Musique, Techno Parade, Nuit Blanche, Cinéma au clair de lune, Printemps des rues, Festival d'automne, and Fête des jardins. Carnaval de Paris, {{one of the oldest}} festivals in Paris, dates back to the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} New York City in late December 2009. The {{setting of the}} film required filming in winter during the <b>festive</b> season of Christmas leading up to New Year's Eve. Ravi K. Chandran handled the cinematography, while Sharmishtha Roy handled the film's production design. Filming was done in various locations in New York City, Las Vegas and San Francisco. Anand wanted to capture the distinct flavour of each city.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Vaughan Williams, {{who wrote}} in 1928 an {{arrangement}} of the traditional tune associated with the psalm, Old 100th ("All people that on earth do dwell"), arranged it for congregation, organ and orchestra for the coronation of Elizabeth II, becoming ubiquitous at <b>festive</b> occasions in the Anglophone world. Reger's setting, however, was not intended for church use, but first for a secular occasion, then for the concert hall.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{entomologist}} C.H. Curran's 1945 book, Insects of the Pacific World, noted {{women from}} India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles {{of the species}} Chrysochroa ocellata as pets. These living jewels were worn on <b>festive</b> occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Masonic Lodge is {{the basic}} {{organisational}} unit of Freemasonry. The Lodge meets regularly to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.). In addition to business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a Masonic degree or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic history or ritual. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, the Lodge might adjourn for a formal dinner, or <b>festive</b> board, sometimes involving toasting and song.|$|E
5|$|The {{festival of}} Purim celebrates the {{deliverance}} of the Jewish {{people from the}} plot of Haman to annihilate them in the ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire, {{as described in the}} Book of Esther. It is a day of rejoicing and merriment, on which children, and many adults, wear costumes. It is customary to eat a <b>festive</b> meal, seudat Purim, in the late afternoon, often with wine as the prominent beverage, in keeping with the atmosphere of merry-making.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} Uttar Pradesh dress {{in a variety}} of {{traditional}} and Western styles. Traditional styles of dress include colourful draped garments—such as sari for women and dhoti or lungi for men—and tailored clothes such as salwar kameez for women and kurta-pyjama for men. Men often sport head-gear like topi or pagri. Sherwani is a more formal male dress and is frequently worn along with chooridar on <b>festive</b> occasions. European-style trousers and shirts are also common among the men.|$|E
5|$|The {{screenplay}} and dialogues for Parasakthi {{were written}} by M. Karunanidhi, who would later become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. The film's soundtrack was composed by R. Sudarsanam. Parasakthi was released on 17 October 1952, during the <b>festive</b> occasion of Diwali, and faced controversies because of its portrayal of Brahmins and Hindu customs and practices in poor light. The elitarian society including the then ruling State government even demanded the film to be banned.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{that sits}} atop the Burnside Fountain is now {{commonly}} referred to as Turtle Boy. In the tradition of the Manneken Pis in Brussels, Turtle Boy has become an unofficial mascot for Worcester. Much of the local popularity of the statue is due to bawdy insinuations about how the boy and the turtle are portrayed. Anonymous members of the Worcester community sometimes dress the statue in <b>festive</b> clothes for holidays, local bands write crowd-pleasing songs about it, and the statue has even graced postcards of the city.|$|E
5|$|The temple is a {{focal point}} of festivals of the Chinese {{community}} in Penang. The Chinese New Year celebrations are particularly impressive. For 30 days following Chinese New Year, the temple remains open until late at night whilst thousands of lights turn the scenery into a sea of light. During the festival days, the complex is decorated with thousands of lanterns representing donations offered by devotees. Another <b>festive</b> feature is the long marches undertaken by hundreds of monks from Thailand to the temple, once or twice in a year.|$|E
5|$|This image's iconic status {{has led to}} parody and satire. New York painter Frank Moore re-created Rockwell's all-white Americans with an {{ethnically diverse}} family, as Freedom to Share (1994), in which the turkey platter brims over with health care supplies. Among the better known reproductions is Mickey and Minnie Mouse {{entertaining}} their cartoon family with a <b>festive</b> turkey. Several political cartoons and even frozen vegetable advertisements have invoked this image.|$|E
5|$|When the Sultan {{appeared}} before the Fortress he saw the walls hung with red cloth, as though for a <b>festive</b> reception, and a single great cannon thundered once to greet the mighty warrior monarch. The siege began on 6 August when Suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts, although the attack was successfully repulsed. Despite being undermanned, and greatly outnumbered, the defenders were sent no reinforcements from Vienna by the imperial army.|$|E
