50|$|As an {{affiliated}} {{college of}} Gauhati University, the college follows the syllabi prescribed by the university. Within the broad frame-work, the syllabus provides flexibility {{to the students}} in the selection of general / major subjects both in Arts and Commerce. In the Arts discipline, the general students have the option of selecting electives from subjects, which include Economics, Education, Political Science, History, Philosophy, Hindi etc. The Students opting for Honours Course can take up major subjects in English, Assamese, Hindi, Economics, Education and Political Science. In Commerce, students can opt for B.Com (General) or B.Com (Hons) carrying 1700 and 2000 marks respectively. Honours is available in three major areas viz. Accounting, Management and Finance. In most of the subjects in arts faculty, there is more emphasis on knowledge and less on skill. The programmes of study are flexible to offer students the benefits of <b>horizontal</b> <b>mobility</b> and elective options.

50|$|The {{selection}} of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect {{a table with a}} segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable table height, and <b>horizontal</b> <b>mobility</b> (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder). Free floating angiography tables with tilt and cradle capabilities are best suited for cardiovascular hybrid operating rooms.|$|E

40|$|Typically, to be incarcerated {{is to be}} fixed: limited within {{specific}} parameters or boundaries with {{liberty and}} agency greatly reduced. Yet, recent literature has attended to the movement (or mobilities) that shape, or are shaped by modes of incarceration. Rather than simply assuming that experiences are inherently ones of immobility, such literature unhinges carceral studies from its framing within a sedentary ontology. However, the potential of mobility studies for unpacking the movements enfolded in carceral space and imprisoned life {{has yet to be}} fully exploited. When attending to mobilities, criminologists have investigated the politics of movement through a traditional horizontal frame of motion (between prison spaces, between court and prison, etc.). This paper contends that studies of mobility in criminology could be productively rethought. Drawing on movements of convicts from Britain to Australia aboard prison ships, this paper argues that straightforward, <b>horizontal</b> <b>mobilities</b> at work in regimes of control and practices of resistance marry together with vertical mobilities. Paying attention to the complex mobilities involved in carceral experience leads to a more nuanced understanding of regimes of discipline and practices of resistance that shape how incarcerated individuals move (or are unable to move) within carceral spaces, past and present...|$|R

It represented a so-called early totalitarian state. The Aztec state in Mexico, during the period under consideration (1427 – 1519), was a confederation with weak central authority where the core of the confederation used conquered territories as a sort of economic backup. Their social organization represented an early class society with strong communal traits, little interference from the government in the daily life of the community, few opportunities for <b>horizontal</b> <b>mobility,</b> but vertical mobility was quite possi-ble.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to improve our {{understanding}} of the social intergenerational mobility in Geneva during the 19 th century. We provide an indepth study of data collected from the marriage registrations acts. These documents provide us information on the spouses, but also on their parents and the witnesses. Our analysis focuses on the transitions between six social statuses defined from the professions found in the marriage Records. Since we collected all acts for married men with a name beginning with letter B, we have also in our dataset the act for the marriage of the father when he get himself also married in Geneva. This led us to split our population into those who have a father married in Geneva and those who have not. The first subpopulation corresponds to people that are established in Geneva since more than one generation, while the others are newcomers. We first show that these two subpopulations considerably differ both in their social structure and in their father-son mobility schemes. Then, focusing on the stable population, for which we have data available, we provide a mobility analysis through three generations using an original induction tree approach. Beside these strict social mobility aspects, we consider also a spatial dimension by looking at how the mobility is affected by the birthplace of the spouses. Finally, we examine the familial framework of the newlyweds, especially how the familial support and control differ between the newcomers and the more enrooted population.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} a dynamical definition of an effective temperature for compacting granular media in the framework of the Fluctuation-Dissipation (FD) relations. We have studied two paradigmatic models for the compaction of granular media, which consider particles diffusing on a lattice, with either geometrical (Tetris model) or dynamical (Kob-Andersen model) constraints. Idealized compaction without gravity has been implemented for the Tetris model, and compaction with a preferential direction imposed by gravity has been studied for both models. In the ideal case of an homogeneous compaction, the obtained FD ratio is clearly shown to be in agreement with the prediction of Edwards' measure at various densities. Similar results are obtained with gravity only when the homogeneity of the bulk is imposed. In this case the FD ratio obtained dynamically for <b>horizontal</b> displacements and <b>mobility</b> and from Edwards' measure coincide.

40|$|Group I introns and homing {{endonuclease}} genes (HEGs) are mobile genetic elements, {{capable of}} invading target sequences in intron-less genomes. LAGLIDADG HEGs {{are the largest}} family of endonucleases, playing {{a key role in}} the mobility of group I introns in a process known as 'homing'. Group I introns and HEGs are rare in metazoans, and can be mainly found inserted in the COXI gene of some sponges and cnidarians, including stony corals (Scleractinia) and mushroom corals (Corallimorpharia). Vertical and horizontal intron transfer mechanisms have been proposed as explanations for intron occurrence in cnidarians. However, the central role of LAGLIDADG motifs in intron mobility mechanisms remains poorly understood. To resolve questions regarding the evolutionary origin and distribution of group I introns and HEGs in Scleractinia and Corallimorpharia, we examined intron/HEGs sequences within a comprehensive phylogenetic framework. Analyses of LAGLIDADG motif conservation showed a high degree of degradation in complex Scleractinia and Corallimorpharia. Moreover, the two motifs lack the respective acidic residues necessary for metal-ion binding and catalysis, potentially impairing <b>horizontal</b> intron <b>mobility.</b> In contrast, both motifs are highly conserved within robust Scleractinia, indicating a fully functional endonuclease capable of promoting horizontal intron transference. A higher rate of non-synonymous substitutions (Ka) detected in the HEGs of complex Scleractinia and Corallimorpharia suggests degradation of the HEG, whereas lower Ka rates in robust Scleractinia are consistent with a scenario of purifying selection. Molecular-clock analyses and ancestral inference of intron type indicated an earlier intron insertion in complex Scleractinia and Corallimorpharia in comparison to robust Scleractinia. These findings suggest that the lack of horizontal intron transfers in the former two groups is related to an age-dependent degradation of the endonuclease activity. Moreover, they also explain the peculiar geographical patterns of introns in stony and mushroom corals...|$|R
