5|$|Candace, back at {{the mall}} (having not further {{attempted}} to bust her brothers since the building implosion from earlier), is downtrodden until her crush, Jeremy, assures her to not let the boys' fun ruin her good time and that if she {{got the chance to}} sing, she ought to, so she joins with the band singing their hit song in a reunion concert. When she thinks she has <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it,</b> the band announces they have finished their career and the mall closes, leaving her in the dark.|$|E
5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finally,</b> the Act <b>made</b> <b>it</b> treason {{to attempt}} to repeal the Act. It was {{superseded}} in 1543 by the Third Succession Act, which returned Henry's daughters into the line of succession to the throne, but did not restore their legitimacy.|$|R
25|$|<b>Finally,</b> Nitta Yoshisada <b>made</b> <b>it</b> immortal in Japanese culture {{bypassing}} it on {{the evening}} of July 3, 1333 to invade Kamakura, bringing the Kamakura shogunate to an end. For this reason, it has been nominated a Historic Site by the Japanese government.|$|R

5|$|On 27/28 February 1942 33 bombers {{flew over}} Wilhelmshaven looking for Scharnhorst. Cloud {{obscured}} the target area and German reports noted only three explosions. Three Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers were lost to unstated causes. In 1942 Scharnhorst had evaded the worst attacks from RAF Bomber Command. It {{was ready for}} redeployment by the summer, {{but a series of}} accidents, such as striking a mine and running aground meant this was delayed until the turn of the year. The ship made three unsuccessful attempts to sail to Norway. On 10 January 1943 she was spotted by RAF aircraft and turned back after reaching only the Skagerrak. Another attempt was tried in January but failed. On 3 March 1943 Scharnhorst <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to Norway. She would survive another eight months before being sent on her last wartime mission, Operation Ostfront. During her sortie Scharnhorst was sunk at the Battle of the North Cape.|$|E

25|$|Steroids <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to baseball’s banned {{substance}} list in 1991, however {{testing for}} major league players {{did not begin}} until the 2003 season. While testing for steroids began, the usage did not stop.|$|E
50|$|A car {{accident}} {{on the set}} of Wolf seriously injured Han and her co-star Eric Mun, causing the drama to be delayed repeatedly until the decision was <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> to discontinue <b>it</b> with only three episodes aired. After a long recovery for Mun, the two actors reunited instead in the drama Super Rookie Ranger (also known as Invincible Parachute Agent or Korea Secret Agency).|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} to Mumbai, he received independent financing and Ankur (The Seedling) was <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> in 1973. <b>It</b> {{was a story}} of economic and sexual exploitation in his home state, Telangana, and Benegal instantly shot to fame. The film introduced actors Shabana Azmi and Anant Nag and won Benegal the 1975 National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film. Shabana won the National Film Award for Best Actress.|$|R
5000|$|... xdg_shell is a {{protocol}} aimed to substitute wl_shell {{in the long}} term, but will {{not be part of}} the Wayland core protocol. It starts as a non-stable API, aimed {{to be used as a}} development place at first, and once features are defined as required by several desktop shells, <b>it</b> can be <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> stable. <b>It</b> provides mainly two new interfaces: xdg_surface and xdg_popup. The xdg_surface interface implements a desktop-style window that can be moved, resized, maximized, etc.; it provides a request for creating child/parent relationship. The xdg_popup interface implements a desktop-style popup/menu; an xdg_popup is always transient for another surface, and also has implicit grab.|$|R
25|$|Despite being {{faced with}} dangers {{along the entire}} route of their journey, the battle weary Maedbdh along with Ailill and Fergus <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to Cruachan {{and that was the}} end of the tale of the Táin Bó Flidhais.|$|E
25|$|Jeff Townes and Will Smith were {{introduced}} to each other by chance in 1985. One night, Townes was performing at a house party only {{a few doors down}} from Smith's residence, and he was missing his hype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the party.|$|E
25|$|Bosman <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to a World Twenty20 {{tournament in}} the Caribbean in 2010, but {{appeared}} strangely {{out of sorts}} and made just eight runs in two innings, failing to find the boundary once. Despite that failure, he was signed by Derbyshire as their overseas player for the Friends Provident t20 tournament in 2010, and responded in superb fashion, hammering 94 off 50 balls {{to set up a}} crushing 65-run win over a strong Yorkshire side in June.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} later {{assisted in}} the encirclement of the Ruhr Pocket. <b>Finally,</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> a 350-mile sweep to the Mulde River {{in the heart of}} Germany as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany. During the fighting on the Western Front, the 104th Infantry Division displayed its night fighting prowess in several successful operations.|$|R
60|$|He was {{not with}} the party who {{came up in the}} evening but, in the centre of his rice, Harry found a small piece of paper rolled into a ball. There was not, however, light enough to enable him to read it; but he lay awake half the night and, at the first gleam of daylight, went up on to the {{platform}} and, seating himself so that he was not visible from below, waited till he could see to read the letter. It was, of course, in Mahratti; and so badly written that he had difficulty in deciphering <b>it.</b> He <b>finally,</b> however, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out.|$|R
50|$|Being {{able to fix}} cardiac {{tissue that}} has been damaged {{from a heart attack}} or heart disease is not very simple and {{it is one of the}} major {{challenges}} today in the field of tissue engineering ("Popular Science"). This is because heart cells are not the easiest objects to create in a lab. It takes an enormous amount of special care and work to develop the cells so that they beat in sync with one another ("Popular Science"). Even after the heart cells have <b>finally</b> been <b>made,</b> <b>it</b> is also a large task to insert the cells into the inoperable parts of the heart and to get them working in unison with the tissues that were still working properly ("Popular Science").|$|R
25|$|At Liscannor the oar-powered galleass Zuñiga (290, Naples) {{anchored}} off-shore with {{a broken}} rudder, having found {{a gap in the}} Cliffs of Moher, which rise sheer from the sea over 220 metres. The ship came under surveillance by the sheriff of Clare and, when a cock-boat was sent ashore in search of supplies, the Spanish were attacked by crown forces and had to withdraw to their ship. One captive was taken and sent for interrogation. Zuñiga escaped the coast with favourable winds, put in at Le Havre, and <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to Naples in the following year.|$|E
25|$|After a long gestation, Die Königin von Saba <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to {{the stage}} on 10 March 1875 at the Hofoper in Vienna. Although written for a mezzo-soprano, {{the role of the}} Queen of Sheba went to {{acclaimed}} dramatic soprano Amalie Materna, who had originated several roles in Wagner's operas. The premiere was highly successful, partly due to the theatre manager's ability to persuade Goldmark to make sizable cuts following the dress rehearsal. Performances in numerous European cities followed, and the work became particularly popular in Italy for several decades. The opera made its United States premiere at the Metropolitan Opera on 2 December 1885.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 2009, one {{day after}} Malaysia celebrated its 52nd Independence Day and after two arrests in 1997 and 2007, Alain Robert <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{successfully}} {{to the top of}} the Petronas Twin Towers. He started at 6:00 am local time and reached the top at 7:40 am local time without attracting the attention of the public. He celebrated his climb by standing with his arms outspread on the pinnacle of one of the Twin Towers. He was later fined RM2000 in default of two months jail at the Kuala Lumpur magistrate's court after he pleaded guilty to criminal trespass for scaling the Petronas Twin Towers.|$|E
5000|$|The heeled bullet {{design has}} many advantages, mainly when {{coupled with the}} {{straight}} or slightly tapered walled cases it appeared in. For pistols, converting a cap and ball revolver to use cartridges was as simple as cutting off part of {{the rear of the}} cylinder, replacing it with a frame-mounted ring, and changing the hammer. <b>It</b> also <b>made</b> new revolvers easier and cheaper to manufacture as the chambers could simply be drilled straight through the cylinder, whereas bullets narrower than the case required two different diameters to be drilled, and careful control of the depth for the larger diameter bit. <b>Finally,</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> very easy to chamber cartridges of the same diameter but differing lengths in the same firearm, which is still commonly seen today in [...]22 caliber rimfire firearms, which are marked [...] ".22 Short, Long, and Long Rifle". While this can be done with straight-walled cases not using heeled bullets, such as [...]38 Special in [...]357 Magnum firearms, it tends to create a lead and powder residue buildup {{at the front of the}} chamber, which can cause reliability problems if not cleaned out before switching back to the longer case.|$|R
5000|$|British {{magazine}} The Bookseller {{reported in}} May 2003, that The Separation was [...] "to be republished by Orion after the author bought back the rights from Simon & Schuster." [...] The report said that Priest {{was unhappy with}} the publicity and marketing support, and quoted Priest as saying, [...] "A lot of staff I had been working with had left. The new editor was clearly not in sympathy with the book, {{and there was no}} apparent inhouse support for it." [...] The article added that, in November 2002, Orion's managing director, Malcolm Edwards approached Priest and proposed that Gollancz republish the title in hardback. [...] "Gollancz has always felt like a natural home to me, so I can't say how pleased I am to <b>finally</b> have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> after all these years," [...] Priest said.|$|R
50|$|Mokelumne Hill {{was one of}} {{the richest}} gold mining towns in California. Founded in 1848 by a group of Oregonians, the placers were so rich that the miners risked {{starvation}} rather than head to Stockton to replenish their supplies (one <b>finally</b> did and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> rich by becoming a merchant). Soon after, gold was discovered in the nearby hills, so much so that miners were restricted to claims of 16 sq ft, and yet many of those claims were reported to have paid up to $20,000.|$|R
25|$|The ZBD patents {{included}} two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning {{the use of}} parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1400V to 2000V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. The other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source, voltage intensive' (VSVI) systems' by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885. Ottó Bláthy also invented the first AC electricity meter.|$|E
25|$|Her retirement, however, lasted {{less than}} 18 months. On 30 November 1950, she was ordered {{reactivated}} {{in response to}} the Navy's urgent need for warships – particularly for aircraft carriers – to prosecute the war which had erupted in Korea the previous summer. On 3 February 1951, Tarawa was recommissioned at Newport, Rhode Island, Captain J. H. Griffin in command. Though reactivated {{in response to the}} Korean War, Tarawa never saw service in that conflict. Rather, she served as a replacement in the 6th and 2nd Fleets for carriers dispatched to the war zone. On 1 October 1952, she became an attack aircraft carrier, and was redesignated CVA-40. The warship <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the Asiatic war zone in the spring of 1954, but long after the July 1953 armistice had ended hostilities.|$|E
25|$|In Iberia, Carthaginian {{rule was}} not popular, but Roman {{inaction}} during the Siege of Saguntum {{had made the}} natives cautious about an alliance against their masters. Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus established his headquarters at Cissa, {{in the midst of}} Hannibal's latest acquisition, the area between Ebro and Pyrenees. Despite initial setbacks, he won increasing support among the natives. This convinced the Carthaginian commander Hanno, the nephew of Hannibal, of the necessity to accept pitched battle before his troops had been united with the army under Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, despite being outnumbered 2 to 1. The result was a Roman victory in the Battle of Cissa in 218 BC. When Hasdrubal <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the scene, he was in no position to fight the Roman army and merely caught their navy personnel off-guard, killing some in the process.|$|E
50|$|The Bavarian Eastern Railway {{was taken}} over by the Bavarian State Railways in 1875. On 15 August 1877, the section from Oberkotzau on the Bamberg-Hof line to Holenbrunn was opened as a branch line. On 15 May 1878, the Nuremberg-Cheb line was opened as far as Marktredwitz. On the same day a {{connection}} was completed from Marktredwitz to Oberkotzau. Four years later on 1 June 1882, the gap between Wiesau and Marktredwitz was <b>finally</b> closed. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> possible to travel from Regensburg to Hof through Bavaria, without passing through Bohemia.|$|R

The paper also presented various solutions for technical equipment and discharge sewage and rain sewer into the cesspool, septic tank or wastewater treatment plant. <b>Finally,</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> a statement material consumption and cost of construction...|$|R
2500|$|After {{a bloody}} {{accident}} {{resulting in the}} death of a blue-collar worker, Édouard Mazé, in Brest in 1950, Abbé Pierre decided {{to put an end to}} his MRP affiliation on 28 April 1950, writing a letter titled [...] "Pourquoi je quitte le MRP" [...] ("Why I quit the MRP"), where he denounced the political and social attitude of the MRP party. He then joined the Christian socialist movement named Ligue de la jeune République, created in 1912 by Marc Sangnier, but decided to finally end his political career. In 1951, before the end of his mandate, he returned to his first vocation: to help homeless people. With the small indemnities he received as a deputy, he invested in a run-down house near Paris in the wealthy Neuilly-Plaisance neighbourhood. Astounding his neighbours, the priest began to repair the roof and the whole house, and <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> of <b>it</b> the first Emmaüs base (because, according to him, it was simply too big for one person).|$|R
25|$|Vette's DC-10 was not {{carrying}} any instruments designed for search and rescue, {{so the two}} pilots were forced to get creative. The captain could roughly estimate Prochnow's position relative to his plane by comparing their relative headings when facing the sun and solar angles of elevation. Next, Vette began to triangulate the Cessna's location using the 200-mile range of its VHF radio. Vette also tried dumping 24,000 pounds of fuel from his own aircraft {{in the hope that}} Prochnow might be able to see it, but this proved to be unsuccessful. Prochnow and Vette then compared the time at which each of them observed the sun to set, and the addition of this new information <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> possible for the Cessna's position to be calculated. After 23 hours of flying, and almost out of fuel—having used cruise control to stretch out the Cessna's usual 22 hours of fuel—Prochnow landed safely at Norfolk Island.|$|E
25|$|Leeman, {{who kept}} a journal, rallied his crew. They found water by digging on an {{offshore}} islet, and then killed seals and dried the meat, using the skins {{to raise the}} sides of the boat. Leeman even constructed his own compass. They then set sail for Java. They made their way up the Western Australian coast, and after a voyage of 2500km reached the eastern end of Java with the loss of only one man. In endeavouring to land their boat was wrecked and many of the men ran off into the jungle. Leeman and his three remaining companions then walked the full length of the south coast of Java, through jungle, volcanic country, braving marauding tigers along the way. Upon getting to the western end of Java they were captured by a Javanese prince and held for ransom. The Dutch then paid the ransom and Leeman and his compatriots <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to Batavia (Jakarta) on 23 September 1658.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
