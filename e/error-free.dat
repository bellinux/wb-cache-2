5|$|Richard {{closed out}} {{the season with}} two {{complete}} games, the first against the Braves on September 27, and the second against the Dodgers on October 2. He had a season-high 14strikeouts in his final start, which tied Steve Carlton's season-high mark. Richard concluded the season on a high note by winning nine of his last twelve decisions. At {{the end of the}} season, he led the Astros' pitching staff in wins, starts, complete games, innings pitched, walks and strikeouts. He had 18wins and 12losses in 267innings pitched and posted a 2.97ERA and 214strikeouts. For the first time since becoming a permanent member of the Astros' starting rotation, Richard was not the league leader in walks allowed, but as he had done in 1976, he led the league in wild pitches. He finished fourth in the league with 13 complete games, and he improved his fielding from the previous season by going through an <b>error-free</b> season.|$|E
5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is <b>error-free,</b> {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E
5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates <b>error-free</b> bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E

25|$|Single sided disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified <b>error-free</b> {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|E

McGraw's name began to become widely known after other daily papers as well as some national baseball weeklies, such as The Sporting News. Shortly (around a week later), McGraw heard from many professional clubs requesting his services for the upcoming season.|$|E
25|$|The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) is a {{conceptual}} model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers.

The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides <b>error-free</b> communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of that path.

500|$|The {{second game}} of 2015 against the Packers {{was held on}} Thanksgiving Day in Green Bay. The two teams, in their 190th meeting, had never played {{each other on the}} holiday; in Thanksgiving games, the Bears were 16–15–2, while the Packers were 14–19–2. Chicago's offense took on a defense that ranked second in the league in first quarter points allowed with 1.9, along with a defense that {{recorded}} six sacks in week eleven against Minnesota. Jeff Joniak added that the offense had to improve its red zone performance; against Denver, the Bears failed to score on three of the four trips to the red zone, leading to a 41.2 percent touchdown efficiency in 2015; in ten games, the Bears were only able to score 14 touchdowns within the 20-yard line. On the other side, Joniak stated the defense had to stop the Packers offense early; since 2014, the Packers had outscored opponents 151–27 at Lambeau, while also leading the league in first quarter points with an average of 7.6. Aaron Rodgers had thrown eight first quarter touchdown passes (the most in the NFL) in 2015, while the Packers had a league-best +57 scoring differential. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had allowed nine touchdowns in the first, though the defense had not given up a touchdown in the third quarter. Joniak also wrote that the Bears had to [...] "match and surpass the emotion" [...] on a night that featured Brett Favre's jersey retirement [...] "with their most physical, <b>error-free</b> and consistent performance".

2500|$|In 1963, Benoit Mandelbrot found {{recurring}} patterns {{at every}} scale in data on cotton prices. Beforehand {{he had studied}} information theory and concluded noise was patterned like a Cantor set: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to <b>error-free</b> periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy. Mandelbrot described both the [...] "Noah effect" [...] (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the [...] "Joseph effect" [...] (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards). This challenged the idea that changes in price were normally distributed. In 1967, he published [...] "How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension", showing that a coastline's length varies with {{the scale of the}} measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an infinitesimally small measuring device. Arguing that a ball of twine appears as a point when viewed from far away (0-dimensional), a ball when viewed from fairly near (3-dimensional), or a curved strand (1-dimensional), he argued that the dimensions of an object are relative to the observer and may be fractional. An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales ("self-similarity") is a fractal (examples include the Menger sponge, the Sierpiński gasket, and the Koch curve or snowflake, which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a fractal dimension of circa 1.2619). In 1982 Mandelbrot published The Fractal Geometry of Nature, which became a classic of chaos theory. Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.|$|E
