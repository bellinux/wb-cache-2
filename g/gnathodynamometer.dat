40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the influence of gender and bruxism on the maximum bite force. The concordance for the physical examination of bruxism between examiners was also evaluated. One hundred and eighteen individuals, from both genders, bruxists and non-bruxists, with an average age of 24 years, were selected for this purpose. For group establishment, every individual was submitted to a specific physical examination for bruxism (performed by three different examiners). Subjects were then divided into four groups according to gender and the presence of bruxism. The maximum bite force was measured using a <b>gnathodynamometer</b> at the first molar area, three times on each side, performed twice. The two measurements were made with a 10 -day interval. The highest value was recorded. The mean maximum bite force was statistically higher for males (587. 2 N) when compared to females (424. 9 N) (p 0. 05). The concordance between examiners for physical examination of bruxism was considered optimal...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{determines the}} {{relationship}} between several characteristics of jaw movement and masticatory performance determined by multiple regression analysis and adjusted for occlusal contact area and bite force. Materials and methods. Forty-two young adults with natural dentition participated in this cross-sectional study. Occlusal contact area was determined at the maximum intercuspal position by scanning interocclusal records. Maximum unilateral force was measured {{by means of a}} <b>gnathodynamometer.</b> The height and amplitude of mastication, occlusal glide length, lateral guidance angle, anterior-posterior distance and cycle duration were recorded using the ARCUSdigma II system. Masticatory performance was determined by sieving the Optosil particles resulting from 20 chewing cycles. Results. Median particle size was negatively associated with height of mastication, maximum bite force, occlusal contact area and amplitude of mastication. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the height of mastication and dental guidance angle are the characteristics of jaw movement most closely related to masticatory performance. Conclusions. In adults with natural dentition, a large vertical height of mastication and a small dental guidance angle are the characteristics of jaw movement most closely associated with good masticatory performance, determined by multiple regression analysis and adjusted for occlusal contact area and bite forc...|$|E
40|$|A pesquisa teve como objetivo determinar as forças de mordida de 73 indivíduos, por meio de um gnatodinamômetro. Os pacientes eram portadores de próteses parciais removíveis inferiores classes I, II ou III. A arcada antagonista era prótese, parcial removível ou fixa, ou total. Os resultados permitiram concluir que: as selas de extremidade livre, principalmente em suas posições extremas, conduziram a forças de mordida muito baixas; o envolvimento de prótese total, também, conduziu a forças de mordida baixas; o sexo masculino alcançou valores maiores que o feminino; com prótese parcial removível classe III, os dentes naturais molares e pré-molares desenvolveram valores maiores do que com classes I e II. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the biting forces of individuals wearing classes I, II or III partially removable mandibular dentures. Upper jaws presented fixed bridges, classes I, II or III partially removable dentures, or complete dentures. Measurements of biting forces were obtained by a <b>gnathodynamometer.</b> The conclusions were: classes I and II presented low biting forces, specially far from the last abutment tooth; when the opposite arcade was a complete denture, biting forces were low; males presented higher biting forces than females; natural molars and bicuspids presented higher biting forces with class III than with classes I or II...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether chewing side preference {{is related to}} handedness and lateral asymmetry of occlusal characteristics, muscular force and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in a dentate population. Design: One hundred and seventeen dentate adults participated in this cross-sectional study. Static and dynamic occlusal characteristics were determined at the maximal intercuspal position and at the lateral excursions by scanning interocclusal records and analysing them using image software. Unilateral maximum bite force and finger-thumb grip force were measured {{by means of a}} <b>gnathodynamometer.</b> TMD were assessed according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD. Chewing side preference and masticatory laterality were determined by observing the jaw's movement while each subject chewed silicone. Asymmetry or side difference of the variables was calculated. Correlation between side difference variables and masticatory laterality was studied using Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: Fifty-nine subjects chewed on the right, 15 on the left and 43 chewed on both sides. There was no relationship between preferred chewing side and handedness, lateral asymmetry of TMD or side difference in finger-thumb grip force. Significant and positive correlations were observed between masticatory laterality and side differences in bite force and side differences in occlusal contact area at intercuspal position (P< 0. 01). Conclusions: Chewing side preference in a dentate population is related to lateral asymmetry of bite force and asymmetry of occlusal contact area at the intercuspal position but not to handedness...|$|E

This way, this study compared the MBF in subjects with TMD to a control group and also evaluated its association with age, gender, height and weight. Forty healthy adults with complete natural dentition divided into four groups according to gender and presence or absence of TMD signs/symptoms (based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria – RDC) underwent a MBF test with a <b>gnathodynamometer</b> in molar and incisal areas. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test (p= 0. 05), and the relationship between age, gender, weight, height and MBF was verified by Pearson’s correlation test. There were no differences in MBF results between TMD and control groups (p> 0. 05). Female subjects exhibited lower MBF than male and MBF for the anterior area was lower than that for posterior area (p< 0. 05). Significant correlation was found between MBF and weight in TMD subjects (p< 0. 05), except for the anterior area in female subjects. There was a positive correlation between MBF and height in TMD male subjects (p< 0. 05). Within the limitations of this study, it is possible to conclude that bite force was not affected by TMD.

40|$|Some muscles have {{demonstrated}} a differential recruitment of their motor units {{in relation to}} their location {{and the nature of the}} motor task performed; this involves functional compart-mentalization. There is little evidence that demonstrates the presence of a compartmentali-zation of the superficial masseter muscle during biting. The aim of this study was to describe the topographic distribution of the activity of the superficial masseter (SM) mus-cle’s motor units using high-density surface electromyography (EMGs) at different bite force levels. Twenty healthy natural dentate participants (men: 4; women: 16; age 20 ± 2 years; mass: 60 ± 12 kg, height: 163 ± 7 cm) were selected from 316 volunteers and included in this study. Using a <b>gnathodynamometer,</b> bites from 20 to 100 %maximum voluntary bite force (MVBF) were randomly requested. Using a two-dimensional grid (four columns, six elec-trodes) located on the dominant SM, EMGs in the anterior, middle-anterior, middle-posterior and posterior portions were simultaneously recorded. In bite ranges from 20 to 60 %MVBF, the EMG activity was higher in the anterior than in the posterior portion (p-value = 0. 001). The center of mass of the EMG activity was displaced towards the posterior part when bite force increased (p-value = 0. 001). The topographic distribution of EMGs was more homoge-neous at high levels of MVBF (p-value = 0. 001). The results of this study show that the su-perficial masseter is organized into three functional compartments: an anterior, a middle and a posterior compartment. However, this compartmentalization is only seen at low levels of bite force (20 – 60 %MVBF) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the association between masticatory performance (MP) and bite force (BF) in children with sleep bruxism (SB) during the mixed dentition stage, considering also the occlusal characteristics. the sample was composed by 52 healthy children of both genders, aged 610 years. From those, 22 presented signs and symptoms of SB and 30 were the controls. SB diagnosis consisted of both parental report and presence of tooth wear. MP was evaluated by the individuals ability to comminute an artificial chewable test material for determining the median particle size (X 50) and distribution of particles in the different sieves (b). BF was measured using a digital <b>gnathodynamometer</b> with fork strength of 8 mm. the results were submitted to descriptive statistics, MannWhitney and chi-square tests, Spearmans correlation and multiple logistic regression. Mean BF and X 50 did not differ between groups with and without SB. A significant negative correlation was observed between BF and X 50 only in the group of children with SB. Moreover, the logistic regression model showed an association between the presence of SB and higher b index. the other independent variables included in the model showed no association with SB. BF did not differ between children with and without SB. Besides, higher BFs in children with SB meant better MP; however, they were more likely to present chewed particles retained in the larger aperture sieves, consequently requiring more chewing cycles to break down the test material in smaller particles.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} bite force (BF) and oro-facial functions at different dentition phases (initial-mixed, intermediate-mixed, final-mixed and permanent dentition) in children and adolescents diagnosed with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). the sample was selected from four public schools in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. of the 289 participants recruited, aged 8 - 14 years old, 46 were placed into the TMD group. TMD was diagnosed using Axis I of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (2011). Oro-facial functions were evaluated using the Nordic Orofacial Test-Screening (NOT-S), which involves both an interview and a clinical examination. BF was measured using a digital <b>gnathodynamometer.</b> Age and body mass index (BMI) were also considered. the data were analysed by the following tests: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Student's t-test, Spearman and Pearson coefficients, Qui-square test, Fisher's exact or binomial test, as indicated. Moreover, univariate and multivariable logistic regression were applied. for the TMD group, scores associated with NOT-S interview and NOT-S total were higher than for the control group (P= 0 center dot 033 and P= 0 center dot 0062, respectively). No differences in BF between genders or groups (0 center dot 05) were detected. Variables included in the multivariate logistic regression were BMI and NOT-S total. Based on this analysis, NOT-S total was associated with TMDs. Reported sensory function was the specific domain within NOT-S interview that established the significant difference between the groups (P= 0 center dot 021). the TMD group also had a greater number of alterations in the face-at-rest domain of the NOT-S exam (P= 0 center dot 007). Concluding, it did not detect an association between TMDs and either dentition phase or BF. Instead, BF correlated with age and BMI. Oro-facial dysfunction was associated with TMD in the studied sample, but this association may be bidirectional, requiring further researches.

40|$|Resumo: O objetivo desta dissertação foi avaliar as variáveis morfológicas e fisiológicas em crianças e adolescentes diagnosticados com desordens temporomandibulares (DTMs). Dois estudos foram conduzidos. O primeiro teve como objetivo avaliar a força de mordida (FM) e as funções orofaciais nas diferentes fases da dentição (dentição mista inicial, intermediária e final e dentição permanente) em crianças e adolescentes com diagnóstico de DTMs. Participaram 290 indivíduos de 8 a 14 anos; 47 formaram o Grupo DTMS e 243 o Grupo controle. A DTM foi avaliada por meio do Research Diagnostic Criteria for Tempormandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD), eixo I, e diagnosticada {{conforme}} os critérios estabelecidos. As funções orofaciais foram avaliadas com a versão brasileira do Nordic Orofacial Test - Screening (NOT-S) (entrevista e exame clínico). Para mensuração da FM utilizou-se um gnatodinamômetro digital. Computou-se a idade e o índice de massa corporal (IMC). Os dados foram analisados pela estatística descritiva, teste t de Student, correlação de Pearson ou Spearman, qui-quadrado, teste binomial ou exato de Fisher e regressão logística (?= 0, 05). Observou-se que a prevalência de DTM foi mais alta em meninas na dentição permanente (p= 0, 014) e em meninos na dentição mista intermediária (p= 0, 006). No grupo DTM, os escores do NOT-S entrevista (p= 0, 026) e NOT-S total (p= 0, 0063) foram maiores em relação ao controle. Não houve diferença na FM entre gêneros e grupos (p> 0, 05). As variáveis incluídas na regressão logística múltipla foram o IMC e o NOT-S (entrevista, exame e total). A função sensorial da entrevista foi o domínio que determinou diferença significativa na proporção de indivíduos entre grupos (p= 0, 021). Observou-se número significativamente maior de indivíduos com DTMs com alteração no domínio face em repouso no exame clínico do NOT-S. Concluiu-se que as fases das dentições e a FM não foram associadas à DTM. A idade correlacionou-se positivamente com a FM e IMC na dentição permanente. As disfunções orofaciais foram consideradas a variável preditiva da DTM, mas a característica transversal do estudo infere que esta associação pode ser bidirecional. O segundo estudo teve como objetivo a quantificação dos biomarcadores salivares de estresse, cortisol e alfa-amilase, em crianças e adolescentes com DTM, na faixa etária de 7 a 14 anos. Trinta e oito indivíduos compuseram o Grupo DTM e 38 o Grupo controle, pareados pela idade, gênero e presença de bruxismo. A saliva foi coletada em domicílio durante dois dias alternados, ao acordar, após 30 e 60 minutos e às 20 h 00. O cortisol foi quantificado pela técnica de enzimaimunoensaio e a alfa-amilase pelo método enzimático automatizado. Os dados foram analisados pelo teste de Shapiro-Wilks, estatística descritiva, teste de Mann-Whitney e coeficiente de Spearman (?= 0. 05). A área sob a curva das concentrações de cortisol e alfa-amilase foi calculada pelo método trapezoidal. Não houve diferenças entre o cortisol salivar e alfa-amilase entre os grupos. As correlações entre os biomarcadores não foram significativas para os grupos DTM e controle (r= 0. 03 e r= 0. 17 respectivamente). Concluiu-se que os níveis de cortisol e alfa-amilase salivar não se apresentaram alterados em crianças e adolescentes com DTM. Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate the morphological and physiological variables {{in children and adolescents}} with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Two studies were carried out. The first aimed to evaluate the bite force (BF) and the orofacial functions in the different dentition phases (early, intermediate and final mixed dentition and permanent dentition) in children and adolescents with TMD diagnosis. Two-hundred ninety subjects participated; 47 composed the TMD group ad 243 the Control group. The TMD was diagnosed using Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD), axis I. The orofacial functions were evaluated using the Nordic Orofacial Test - Screening (NOT-S) (interview and clinical examination). FM was measured using a digital <b>gnathodynamometer.</b> The age and body mass index (BMI) were considered. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistic, Student or Mann-Whitney test, Pearson or Spearman correlation, chi-square, binomial test or Fisher exact test and logistic regression (?= 0. 05). The prevalence of TMDs was higher for girls in permanent dentition (p= 0. 014) and for boys in intermediated mixed dentition (p= 0. 006). For TMD group the scores of NOT-S interview and the NOT-S total were higher than the Control group (p= 0. 026 and p= 0. 0063, respectively). There was not differences in BF between genders and groups (p> 0. 05). The variables included in the multivariate logistic regression were BMI and NOT-S (interview, exam and total). Sensory function of the interview was the domain that determined the significant difference in the proportions of subjects between groups (p= 0. 021). It was observed a greater number of boys and girls with alterations in face at rest domain in NOT-S exam. Concluding, the dentition phases and BF were not associated with TMD. The BF was correlated with age and BMI. The orofacial dysfunction was considered the predictor for TMD, but the cross-sectional design of the study infers that this association may be bidirectional. The second study aimed to quantify the stress biomarkers, cortisol and alpha-amylase, in children and adolescents with TMD, diagnosed using RDC/TMD, axis I. Thirty six subjects, aged from 7 to 14 years composed the TMD group and 36 the Control group, matched by gender, age and presence of bruxism. The saliva was collected at home during two alternate days, in the morning at awakening while lying in bed, 30 and 60 minutes after awakening (fasting), at night, at 8 pm. The salivary cortisol was assayed by enzyme immunoassay and the alpha-amylase by enzymatic automated method. The data were analyzed by Shapiro-Wilks test, descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney test and Spearman coefficient (?= 0. 05). The area under the curve (AUCG) of salivary cortisol and amylase concentrations against time was calculated by trapezoid method respective to the ground level. There was no difference for salivary cortisol and sAA AUCG, neither for BMI between groups. The correlations between the two biomarkers were not significant for both groups. It was concluded that the levels of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase were not altered in children and adolescents with TMD...|$|E
