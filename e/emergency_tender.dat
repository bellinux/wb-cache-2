50|$|ETN 909 W is a Shelvoke & Drewry <b>Emergency</b> <b>Tender</b> {{built on}} a Shelvoke WX SPV (special Purpose Vehicle) chassis fitted with Benson {{bodywork}} it was supplied new to Tyne & Wear Metropolitan Fire Brigade Fossway fire station in the East end of Newcastle. It is fitted with a Boughton 5 ton hydraulic winch and a 10 KW generator, which powers the extending lighting mast.|$|E
50|$|The Worsley Hotel fire of December 1974 was an arson {{attack that}} killed seven people, {{including}} probationary firefighter Hamish Petit of Paddington station. Four fire engines, a turntable ladder and <b>emergency</b> <b>tender</b> were initially mobilised to the scene, gradually increased to 30 pumps with three turntable ladders, three emergency tenders, and hose layers. A 41-year-old kitchen porter {{was convicted of}} the attack and seven counts of manslaughter and was jailed for life.|$|E
50|$|After a {{round of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>tendering</b> for the {{remaining}} services was organised by Centro on 30 March 2009, A2Z Travel ceased operations the following day.|$|R
50|$|Career staff {{appliances}} {{may also}} carry more specialised items used for industrial rescue, light USAR and high-angle line rescue. In some areas, these are carried on separate Rescue <b>Tenders</b> or <b>Emergency</b> <b>Tenders</b> {{which do not}} have pumping capabilities.|$|R
50|$|A {{major fire}} on 5 December 1964 {{destroyed}} the station. Within 40 {{minutes of the}} first firefighters arriving on scene, {{the scale of the}} blaze was so intense and widespread that the London Fire Brigade had mobilised 40 fire engines. In addition, 12 aerial turntable platforms, two firehose-laying vehicles and two <b>emergency</b> <b>tenders</b> as well as 235 firefighters battled the fire which killed two customs officials and destroyed hundreds of railway wagons, dozens of motor vehicles and millions of pounds worth of goods.|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} call, the LFB mobilised three pumps, a {{turntable}} ladder and <b>emergency</b> <b>tender</b> at 2:18 a.m. Upon arrival, a station officer and firefighter from Clerkenwell station headed {{down into the}} basement where it was apparent a major fire had broken out. Both became trapped in the basement cellars and suffocated to death. Excessive heat, dense smoke and worsening conditions meant crews had to be rotated as frequently as every 15 minutes, as firefighters suffered from severe heat exhaustion.|$|E
50|$|The {{contract}} was previously held by rival marine services firm Smit Amandla Marine until it expired in 2011 {{and a new}} bidding process started. Smit Amand Marine complained that its contract bid application had been leaked to Sekunjalo. The {{contract was}} initially awarded to Sekunjalo only to withdraw it and instead gave Smit Amandla one month to hand over their operation to the South African Navy. The department then found that the Navy could not properly maintain the fleet of six patrol vessels and issued an <b>emergency</b> <b>tender</b> to Nautic SA and Damen Shipyards.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} several 999 calls {{were made to the}} London Fire Brigade at 03:32 and {{received}} by the local fire station, A21, Paddington, who were ordered to the scene along with neighboring A22, Manchester Square and G26 Belsize, bringing the first attendance of 4 pumping appliances (2 were pumps - P, 2 were pump escapes - PE carrying the heavy but stable 50 foot (15m) wheeled escape ladders), a 100 ft (30m) turntable ladder - TL (aerial ladder) and an <b>emergency</b> <b>tender</b> - ET (for the breathing apparatus (BA) sets carried; BA wearing was then still a specialist skill).|$|E
5000|$|The final {{attendance}} involved 30 pumping appliances, 3 turntable ladders, 3 <b>emergency</b> <b>tenders</b> {{and other}} specialist vehicles such as hose layers for relaying water long distances, including the nearby Regents Canal at Little Venice. The [...] "stop" [...] message (= [...] "incident under control") was despatched at 08:02 that morning, but damping down and standby attendance {{went on for}} some days. The incident {{proved to be the}} largest fire in Central London that year, and resulted in one of the largest number of fire brigade bravery commendations from a single incident. Four of the firemen later received awards from the Queen.|$|R
5000|$|London's main railway goods {{terminal}} at [...] was gutted by {{a spectacular}} fire in December 1964. Within 37 {{minutes of the}} first crews arriving on scene, {{the scale of the}} blaze was so intense and widespread that 40 fire engines had been mobilised. In addition, 12 turntable ladders, two hose layers, two <b>emergency</b> <b>tenders,</b> and 235 firefighters battled the fire which killed two customs officials and destroyed hundreds of railway wagons, dozens of motor vehicles and millions of pounds worth of goods. The site remained derelict for the next 30 years until being rebuilt as Shoreditch High Street railway station.|$|R
5000|$|Churchorem have {{a police}} station, which serve city of Curchorem and {{neighbouring}} villages. Curchorem {{also have a}} major fire station which cater to areas like Chandor, Curchorem, Sanvordem and Quepem. The fire station have one <b>emergency</b> rescue <b>tender,</b> two heavy water tenders and one quick response vehicle. It have between 40 to 50 fire fighters.|$|R
50|$|The complex {{layout of}} the stock and {{partitioning}} of the building created difficulty finding the fire. With the intense heat and thick smoke, internal fire fighting was effected on {{the first and second}} floors. Around this time, a small amount of fire was noted breaking through the first floor ceiling, which was addressed. This indicated serious fire in the attic floor above. At around 12:00 with the initial crews becoming exhausted, Divisional Officer Quinn requested the attendance of an <b>emergency</b> <b>tender,</b> for the additional breathing apparatus and fresh men. This was dispatched from South Fire Station.|$|E
5000|$|The 1950s {{also saw}} {{the launch of the}} popular S type trucks, the {{so-called}} Big Bedfords, which brought Bedford into the 7-ton range. The S series was immortalised in RL form - a four-wheel drive, high ground clearance version, as the [...] "Green Goddess" [...] <b>emergency</b> fire <b>tender,</b> used by the Auxiliary Fire Service until 1968, then until 2004 over 1,000 were held in reserve by the Home Office for use in the event of fire-service industrial action or other serious emergencies. They were disposed of by the Home Office in 2005. Several have found new homes in African countries that lack a developed fire-fighting service, such as Kenya. The C series of 1957 was a forward-control derivative of the S series, and outwardly very similar to it.|$|R

50|$|Diving {{in a tank}} {{presents}} hazards, {{particularly in}} all water towers (EST) and ground tanks (GST) above 100000 gal. Divers require confined-space training and working at heights certification. In the USA commercial diving operations require at least one trained tender, a diver, and a supervisor. Surface-supplied air with two-way radio communications to the diver and a safety rope are preferred. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration regulation 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T allows scuba with a rope for basic communications. The diver should be wearing a harness, strapped to a safety rope, so that {{in case of an}} <b>emergency</b> the dive <b>tender</b> can pull the diver up. Diving contractors always need to check the safety legislation appropriate to their local jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|Page 1 of 11 The {{simulation}} {{system for}} the North Carolina floodplain-mapping project uses a suite of state-ofthe-art numerical wind, wave, and surge models to compute stillwater and wave setup elevations along the North Carolina coast. The model suite consists of the Hurricane Boundary Layer (HBL) wind model for tropical storms (hurricanes) and OceanWeather Inc's Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) model for extra-tropical storms; the wave-field models WaveWatch 3 (WW 3) and Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN), and the storm surge and tidal model ADvanced CIRCulation for Model for Oceanic, Coastal and Estuarine Waters (ADCIRC). This modeling approach {{is very similar to}} recent FEMA-sponsored projects in Louisiana and Mississippi. Each model in the system is linked through scripts that manage the simulation process on a highperformance computer at RENCI. This technical report describes the computational model system, numerical model grids, and development of the tropical storm statistical representation.

5000|$|In 1999, Momoedonu {{had been}} elected on the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) ticket to {{represent}} the Vuda Open Constituency in the House of Representatives, and subsequently appointed to the Cabinet. He was the only minister not present in the Parliament building when George Speight stormed the complex on 19 May 2000, taking Chaudhry and other government members hostage and staging a coup d'état. The President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, wanted to assume emergency powers {{to deal with the}} situation, but was unable to do so, because constitutionally, the President is not allowed to act except on the advice of the Prime Minister - and Prime Minister Chaudhry, being in captivity, was unable to render such advice. In a move which some legal scholars have questioned as being of doubtful constitutional validity, Mara therefore dismissed Chaudhry and appointed Momoedonu in his place on 27 May, so that Momoedonu could [...] "advise" [...] him to suspend Parliament and assume <b>emergency</b> powers. Upon <b>tendering</b> the requisite advice, Momoedonu promptly resigned. The whole procedure had taken only a few minutes. (The move backfired when, two days later, Mara was himself deposed by the Commander of the Fiji Military Forces, Commodore Frank Bainimarama.) ...|$|R
