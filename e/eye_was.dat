5|$|Gallagher was {{selected}} to compete at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics in long jump, 100m, shot put and discus, but she failed her classification test because the classifiers said the eyesight in her right <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> 0.01% better than it needed to be. In November 2009, her classification was revisited due to deterioration of her vision and she was deemed eligible to compete.|$|E
50|$|Odd-clawed spiders {{have eight}} eyes {{arranged}} in {{two rows of}} four. The front row curves slightly backward, while the back row curves slightly forward. The anterior and posterior lateral (left and right) <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> clustered closely together, while the median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> spaced further from each other. In females, the anterior and posterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest pairs, with a diameter of 0.35 mm. The anterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the smallest with a diameter of 0.23 mm. The posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> slightly smaller than the lateral eyes, at a diameter of 0.32 mm. In males, the anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest pair, with a diameter of 0.29 mm. Their posterior median eyes and posterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> about the same size, with a diameter of 0.25 mm. As with the female, the anterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the smallest pair, with a diameter of only 0.15 mm. All of the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> white in color, except for the anterior median <b>eyes</b> which <b>are</b> black.|$|R

The software data for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> stored in the Carl Zeiss Meditc MEL 80 laser and delivered by the eye-tracker controlled computer generated excimer laser pulses. The laser time for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> usually under 30 seconds. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> mainly corrected for distance and intermediate vision and the non-dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> corrected for intermediate and near vision, by increasing the depth of focus for each eye.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack album for You Are the Apple of My <b>Eye</b> <b>was</b> {{released by}} Sony Music Entertainment Taiwan on 5 August 2011. It contains six songs with vocals and nine instrumental pieces {{that were used}} in this film.|$|E
5|$|By 0900 UTC October 2, the eye {{started to}} become less defined. Based on this, {{the storm was}} {{downgraded}} into a category 3 hurricane. Although an <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> no longer visible on satellite imagery, the storms had displayed very deep convection, thus the NHC initially maintained the intensity at 120mph (195km/h). Virgil's eye continued to become less defined, and was downgraded to Category 2 intensity {{at the time of}} landfall on October 4. It rapidly weakened over land, and was a dissipating tropical depression by the time it moved offshore.|$|E
5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate. One theory is that Randy Savage punched Hogan because he believed that his ex-wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married (the couple divorced in September 1992). WWF officials claimed that the injury {{was the result of a}} Jet Ski accident.|$|E
50|$|Pupillary {{diameter}}. Light {{falling in}} one eye affects {{the diameter of the}} pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend's eye while he or she closes the other: when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> small; when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> large.|$|R
50|$|Aprusia veddah is {{only known}} from the female of the species. The females are 18.5mm long. The {{cephalothorax}} is pale orange and broadly oval in shape.

5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore You Are the Apple of My Eye {{earned a}} total of SGD$675,000, making it the second-highest-grossing film in Singapore that weekend despite the film's NC-16 rating (which meant that only viewers over age 16 were admitted); this {{surprised}} the film's distributor, 20th Century Fox. The film broke the record for highest opening weekend for a Taiwanese film in Singapore, previously held by the 2007 film Secret. It surpassed the performance of other Taiwanese films such as Monga, Cape No.7 and Lust, Caution. You Are the Apple of My <b>Eye</b> <b>was</b> the highest-grossing Asian film of 2011 at the Singapore box office, with earnings of SGD$2.93 million.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was {{operated}} on by Michael E. DeBakey in Houston for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, and in February 1965 a detached retina {{in his left}} <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> treated by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors while on a state visit to France; she spoke with the Duke for fifteen minutes but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.|$|E

5|$|On August24, {{satellite}} imagery indicated a hurricane with a defined <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> located over the central Pacific Ocean. It slowly weakened {{as it moved}} over lukewarm waters, and deteriorated more rapidly after wind shear increased. By August28, the system consisted of a circulation with only weak associated convection. It weakened to a tropical depression on August30, although it remained a tropical cyclone until September2. At {{that time it was}} last observed about 200mi (320km) south of Hilo, Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The Cat's <b>Eye</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula {{to be observed}} with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous and made of a few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths {{have been used to}} reveal the intricate structure of the nebula.|$|E
5|$|While slowly {{crossing}} Guam, Pamela produced {{winds of}} over 185km/h (115mph) {{across the entire}} island over a six-hour period, causing widespread heavy damage. Typhoon-force winds were reported for 18hours, and tropical storm-force winds were reported for 30hours. As the <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> crossing the island, the winds rapidly vacillated between gusts of 150km/h (90mph) to calmness {{in the span of}} a few minutes; this created a large pressure gradient that caused additional damage. The typhoon dropped a total of 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, including 690mm (27in) in a 24-hour period, on the island. This contributed to May 1976 being Guam's wettest month on record.|$|E

50|$|The {{relative}} {{strength of}} these two forces depends on which way the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> looking. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> adducted (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> in the primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts.|$|R
5|$|You Are the Apple of My <b>Eye</b> <b>was</b> first {{aired on}} {{television}} on 24 March 2012 on the STAR Chinese Movies network. It became the most-watched film {{on television in}} Taiwan, having attracted an audience of almost 3 million people. In the 15 to 44 years old audience, it had an average rating of 7.14, with the rating peaking at 9.27 during the screening. It was also the most-watched television program on both cable and free-to-air networks in Taiwan. STAR Chinese Movies reportedly purchased the rights to this film at a hefty price of NT$2 million (approx. US$69,000).|$|E
5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt early on August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the surface {{as a result of}} the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. Early on August 25, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} upper-level low developed west of Alberto on August 7 and August 8. This {{caused an}} increase in vertical shear, weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm on August 9. The low also caused the storm {{to turn to the}} northwest. However, on August 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on August 11, passing about 345mi (555km) east of the island. The strong storm became a Category3 major hurricane on August 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), and a 60mi (95km) wide <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35˚N, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies on August 13 and August 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 14.|$|E

50|$|These minions {{frequently}} wear {{a special}} magical gem called a hag eye. A hag <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{made from the}} real eye of a coven's previous victim.

This hidden <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> magically connected to the coven that created the hag eye. All three members of the coven can see whatever the hag <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> pointed at. Hag <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> usually placed on a medallion or brooch worn by one of the hag's polymorphed servants.

5|$|After {{studying}} {{architecture and}} then drama, Cartier {{began his career}} as a screenwriter and then film director in Berlin, working for UFA Studios. After a brief spell in the United States he moved to the United Kingdom in 1935. Initially failing to gain a foothold in the British film industry, he began working for BBC Television in the lae 1930s (among other productions he was involved in the making of Rehearsal for a Drama, BBC 1939). The outbreak of war, however, meant that his contract was terminated; his television play The Dead <b>Eye</b> <b>was</b> stopped in the production stage. After the war, he occasionally worked for British films before he was again hired by the BBC in 1952. He soon became one of the public service broadcaster's leading directors and went on to produce and direct over 120 productions in the next 24 years, ending his television career with the play Loyalties in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Allison {{remained}} somewhat disorganized, as no <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> visible, {{even when}} Reconnaissance flights confirmed {{that it was}} at hurricane intensity. The storm maintained itself as a minimal hurricane throughout the day on June 4 before it began {{to turn to the}} northeast, in response to southwesterly shear. Late that evening, the storm began to weaken, dropping back to tropical storm intensity as it approached the Florida Big Bend area. The intensity leveled off on June 5 until it made landfall that morning. Allison made its first landfall at about 10:00 am EDT (1400 UTC) near Alligator Point, Florida as a high-end tropical storm with 70mph (110km/h) winds. It briefly re-emerged over Apalachee Bay and made another landfall near St. Marks, Florida about one hour later with 65mph (100km/h) winds. Operationally, Allison was considered a hurricane until it made landfall, and was considered the earliest hurricane landfall in the United States for some time.|$|E
5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
