His {{participation}} in the nine-day mission was criticized by some members of the space community as a favor granted by Clinton; John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists' space-policy project, said: [...] "If he was a normal person, he would acknowledge he's a great American hero and that he should get to fly on the shuttle for free... He's too modest for that, and so he's got to have this medical research reason. It's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with medicine".|$|E
500|$|The defense {{maintained}} that Abu-Jamal was innocent {{and that the}} prosecution witnesses were unreliable. The defense presented nine character witnesses, including poet Sonia Sanchez, who testified that Abu-Jamal was [...] "viewed by the black community as a creative, articulate, peaceful, genial man." [...] Another defense witness, Dessie Hightower, testified that he saw a man running along the street shortly after the shooting, {{although he did not}} see the shooting itself. His testimony contributed {{to the development of a}} [...] "running man theory", based on the possibility that a [...] "running man" [...] may have been the shooter. Veronica Jones also testified for the defense, but she did not see anyone running. Other potential defense witnesses refused to appear in court. Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense. Nor did his brother, William Cook, who told investigators at the crime scene: [...] "I ain't <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this." ...|$|E
500|$|Best {{had been}} good friends with Neil Aspinall since 1961 when he rented {{a room in the}} house where Best lived with his parents. Best asked Aspinall to become the band's road manager and {{personal}} assistant; accepting the job, he bought an old Commer van for £80 (equivalent to £ in [...] ).. Aspinall was waiting for Best downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after the dismissal meeting. The two went to the Grapes pub on Mathew Street, the same street as the Cavern Club where the group had played. Aspinall was furious at the news, insisting to Best that he would also resign from the Beatles. Best strongly advised him to remain with the group. Aspinall's relationship with Mona Best (and their three-week-old baby, Roag) was ended. At the next concert Aspinall asked Lennon why they had fired Best, to which he replied [...] "It's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with you, you're only the driver." ...|$|E

500|$|Violent {{attacks on}} punk fans {{were on the}} rise. In mid-June Rotten himself was {{assaulted}} by a knife-wielding gang outside Islington's Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his left arm. Jamie Reid and Paul Cook were beaten up in other incidents; {{three days after the}} Pegasus assault, Rotten was attacked again. A tour of Scandinavia, planned to start {{at the end of the}} month, was consequently delayed until mid-July. In Oslo, Lydon posed in front of the photographs making the Nazi salute while wearing a sweater with a Swastika drawing. During the tour, a Swedish interviewer observed to Jones that [...] "a lot of people" [...] regarded the band as McLaren's [...] "creation". Jones replied, [...] "He's our manager, that's all. He's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the music or the image...he's just a good manager." [...] In another interview, Rotten professed bafflement at the furore surrounding the group: [...] "I don't understand it. All we're trying to do is destroy everything." [...] At the end of August came SPOTS—Sex Pistols On Tour Secretly, a surreptitious UK tour with the band playing under pseudonyms to avoid cancellation.|$|E
500|$|Best {{was sacked}} from the Beatles on 16 August 1962, by manager Brian Epstein acting {{on behalf of}} Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Accounts vary of Aspinall during this event. According to MerseyBeat editor Bill Harry, Aspinall was waiting downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop, and {{was the first one to}} talk to the by then ex-Beatle in the Grapes pub, across from the Cavern. Aspinall was furious and said that he would stop working for the band as well, but Best {{strongly}} advised him not to. Aspinall asked McCartney and Lennon at the next concert why they had fired Best and was told, [...] "It’s <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with you. You’re only the driver." [...] However, in a 2007 interview, Aspinall provided Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn with a distinctly different version of events, saying that he was physically present when Epstein sacked Best, that he told Best unprompted that he planned to continue working for the band, and that on his first subsequent encounter with the other band members, their first question to him was how Best had taken being sacked. At any rate, Aspinall stayed with the band, but he ended his affair with Best's mother, a relationship that had led to the birth of baby Vincent [...] "Roag" [...] Best. Aspinall denied the story for years before publicly acknowledging that he was indeed Roag's father.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{a promotional}} video that {{involves}} SpongeBob promoting diversity and tolerance was criticized by two U.S. Christian evangelical groups, most notably Focus on the Family, {{because they saw}} the character was being used as an advocate for homosexuality though the video contained [...] "no reference to sex, sexual lifestyle or sexual identity." [...] The incident led to questions {{as to whether or}} not SpongeBob, his best friend Patrick, and the rest of the series' characters are homosexual characters. After this speculation and comments, Hillenburg repeated his assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show. He clarified the issue and said [...] "We never intended them to be gay. I consider them to be almost asexual. We're just trying to be funny and this has <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the show." [...] Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen. Derek Drymon, the show's creative director until 2004, said, [...] "If SpongeBob holds hands with Patrick it's because he's his best friend and he loves him. I think the whole thing is a part of a larger agenda to stigmatize gay people." [...] Focus on the Family founder James Dobson later stated that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored the video, the We Are Family Foundation. Dobson noted that the foundation had posted pro-homosexual material on its website, but later removed it.|$|E

The album produced three consecutive number one singles, which held the top chart position for a combined 6 months. [...] The album's third single, [...] "La Camisa Negra" [...] ("The Black Shirt"), was used in Italy in support of neo-fascism by relating it to the uniform used under the regime of Benito Mussolini. In response, left-wing media network Indymedia called for a boycott of the song.

[...] "I'm there because I love to play music. And I'm in support of anyone who wants to play the instrument. I wouldn't care if Art Blakey was pink with polka dots and wearing a tutu. I wouldn't care if Tony Williams was green." [...] "There are people who have opinions about whatever and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion", says Blackman. [...] "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else is for you to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with real policing in the 1970s. It {{could not be more}} inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. In all the time I was in the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and that we are seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E

2500|$|Modeliste {{grew up in}} the 13th Ward of New Orleans. The {{eldest of}} six siblings, he was raised in part by his grandmother, Lula Blouin. His first drum set was a three-piece paid for by Blouin. He was nicknamed Zigaboo at age ten by a {{neighborhood}} kid, and by junior high school the name had stuck. His drumming style was influenced by Smokey Johnson, Bob French and other New Orleans drum greats as he learned by watching them perform at gigs. He said listening to other musicians was {{the most important part of}} his learning process. He particularly tried to emulate Smokey Johnson's style. He started playing gigs at an early age including a stint with The Hawketts, a band led by Art Neville at the time. Over time the band evolved into The Neville Sounds and by late 1960s into The Meters. In a 2013 interview with Modern Drummer, Modeliste said: [...] "Your biggest teachers were those two things you got on the side of your head. (...) It's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with rudiments, nothing to do with time signatures, but it's got a lot to do with what you hear." ...|$|E

Mthunjwa presented two documents in evidence mine management had indeed made commitments to the miners their grievances would be dealt with, but reneged, causing the violence. [...] "Management could have stuck with their commitment. The commitment was once you're there peacefully at work, management will address your grievances through union structures," [...] stated Mathunjwa, who noted he tried to help even though the confrontation did not involve his ACMU union. [...] "This was an in-fight of the members of NUM with their offices. It's <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with AMCU.". Mathunjwa explained Amcu's leaders had been called to the site to intervene in the standoff between workers and the mine as a peaceful intermediary, even though the ACMU did not represent those involved in the dispute. [...] "I pleaded with them. I said leave this place, they're going to kill you," [...] said Mathunjwa, who later broke down in tears.|$|E
2500|$|Tax Credits: Tax credits {{can remove}} {{a portion of}} the income tax owed to the state by the {{production}} company, but since most production companies are limited purpose business entities they often incur very little, if any tax liability. [...] The use of the word [...] "tax credit" [...] or [...] "tax rebate" [...] often results in public confusion, as they layperson may think the program is a refund of taxes paid by the production, when it is actually based on a significant percentage of the production's actual spend and the amount is awarded regardless of whether the entity pays taxes (which they generally do not) (as explained by Louisiana's Chief Legislative Economist: “It’s <b>got</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with tax...We’re just using the tax-filing process and the Department of Revenue as the paying agent for a spending program. That’s what we’re doing.”) [...] Production companies must often meet minimum spending requirements to be eligible for the credit. [...] Of the 28 states that offer tax credits, 26 make them either transferable or refundable. [...] Transferable credits allow production companies that generate tax credits greater than their tax liability to sell those credits to other taxpayers, who then use them to reduce or eliminate their own tax liability. Refundable credits are such that the state will pay the production company the balance in excess of the company's owed state tax.|$|E
