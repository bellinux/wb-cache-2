40|$|As {{there are}} no {{scientific}} insights concerning sheet metal <b>forming</b> <b>by</b> <b>hammering</b> using an industrial robot, the main objective of this research work is to develop such a process and to gain a scientific basis for this forming method. By providing all technical components such as equipment and software, its technical practicability is proven. Chapter 2 systematically describes {{the state of the}} art of conventional and incremental sheet metal forming processes. In chapter 3 today's sheet metal production is analyzed based on published literature. In chapter 4, the concept of the system and the process cycle are presented. In addition, several alternatives of sub-systems and systems, which combine the hammering forming process with other forming, cutting and joining methods, are shown. Chapter 5 describes the realization of the first test facility for the hammering forming process according to the selected variants of the sub-systems. A first fundamental research is described in compliance with the first main point of examination defined in chapter 3. The acquired scientific knowledge was applied to increase the application area of the hammering forming process by deriving new forming strategies for the product of sheet metal parts with more complex geometries and improved geometrical accuracy. In chapter 6 a one-dimensional mechanical model of the robot cell for hammering sheet metal forming is presented based on well-chosen assumptions and simplifications. After the derivation and verification of the mechanical model, the model is used for a theoretical examination of vibrations to formulate qualitative and quantitative statements concerning the dimensioning of the hammering tool and the industrial robot. In chapter 7 a prototypical pilot installation is presented, consisting of the sub-systems for fixing and supporting the sheet metal, the hammering tool and the software for path generation. The combined sub-systems for fixing and supporting the sheet metal and the hammering tool are realized in accordance with the solution variants in chapter 4. The pilot installation is used for testing the hammering sheet metal forming process and the developed components by producing several demonstration sheet metal parts and one sheet metal prototype for the automobile industry...|$|E

5000|$|In the 16th century {{demand for}} latten (brass) in England {{came from the}} needs of wool-carding, for which brass-wire combs were preferred, and battery pieces (brassware <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>hammering</b> sheet brass in a battery mill.) The only known method for {{producing}} the alloy was by heating copper and calamine together in the cementation process and in 1568 a royal charter was granted to the Society of the Mineral and Battery Works {{to search for the}} mineral and produce brass, to reduce dependence on imported metal from Germany. Factories to exploit the process were established at Isleworth and Rotherhithe. By the late 17th century enough was known of metallic zinc to make brass solder directly by combining copper and spelter (zinc ingots). In 1738 a patent was granted to William Champion, a Bristol brass founder, for the large-scale reduction of calamine to produce spelter.|$|R

5000|$|Mosan and Limoges enamels are {{the most}} famous, and the figures carved in the copper plate display a superb sense of line. The Stavelot Triptych in New York {{is an example of}} the finest Mosan work, and the Becket Casket in London a fine early piece from Limoges. The names of several Mosan goldsmith-enamellers are known. Relief and fully {{modelled}} figures were also enamelled, and some metal bases <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>hammering</b> into moulds. The Limoges production increased steadily in quantity, and by the Gothic period had declined in quality, but provided a fairly cheap product, especially of chasse caskets, produced on a semi-industrial scale and exported all over Europe. Spanish enamels, not easily distinguished from Limoges work, were also produced on a large scale. Mosan work was sometimes on gold or silver-gilt, but in Limoges and Spain gilt-copper is usual, and much Mosan work uses this too, as in the example illustrated. This example also shows the mixing of different colours and shades within the same cell, here used throughout the design in a complex manner, whereas in the Limoges examples below much less, and much simpler, use is made of this difficult technique. [...] A similar technique was known as [...] "shippou-zogan" [...] in Japan, where it was considered a form of damascening.|$|R
5000|$|Cup {{and ring}} mark stones are {{frequently}} found throughout Britain, with over 2500 sites in England alone, however an unusual feature {{of those at}} Ballochmyle {{is that they have}} been carved on nearly or actual vertical surfaces rather than horizontal and often 'altar-like' exposed stone outcrops. These types of carvings were created using 'hammerstones' or 'peckers', examples of these have been found elsewhere, hitting the surface of the rock repeatedly or using a grinding motion until the desired design was formed Some of the long grooves appear to be a series of cups that were then joined together. The soft nature of the stone at Ballochmyle gives insights into how the glyphs were created with many small holes that could not have been <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> a <b>hammering</b> action.|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the silver}} {{artifacts}} (namely individually made head-shaped beads, about 4.0 cm by 5.1 cm) were <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> alternating between <b>hammering</b> and annealing copper-silver alloy (Cu18Ag1Au) resulting in copper-oxide forming along the surface which can be removed using an acid (plant juices) or base (stale urine that has turned to ammonia). After many repetitions, the copper will be depleted resulting in the appearance of pure silver (in actuality silver only makes up 18% of the surface). Other silver artifacts {{are believed to have}} been made in roughly the same manner, but contain as much as 90% silver on the surface ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{introduce}} a new incremental sheet metal-forming process. <b>By</b> moving a <b>hammering</b> tool over a sheet of metal fixed in a frame, a three-dimensional workpiece can be produced without using any special die plate. Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes the exact procedure of the new process and the advantages in comparison with other flexible conventional and incremental forming processes. The hammering process in particular, will be considered with respect to material behavior and effects on the industrial robot. In addition, a special path generation for the incremental forming process and multiple robot tools with different drives constructed for the incremental forming process is shown. Findings: During the research {{it was discovered that}} complex geometries can be produced without any die plate and that a hammering tool with a mechanical eccentric should be used for the incremental forming process. Practical implications: As the forces on the handling equipment are very low compared with other forming processes, a common industrial robot can be used to move the hammering tool. Thus sheet metal parts can be produced with cost-effective equipment. Mainly, small and medium-sized enterprises can benefit from this new technology. Originality/value: The incremental forming process presented in this paper is patented by the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation. It {{is the first time that}} sheet metal parts with a size of 300 x 300 mm are <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> a <b>hammering</b> tool with 100 hits/s...|$|R

5000|$|Utility knives {{with stone}} or flint blades were {{undoubtedly}} used in personal combat since Paleolithic times.One {{of the earliest}} metal-blade fighting knives was the dagger. The first early Bronze Age daggers featured Beaker copper blades, probably done with stone tools. In 1984, a Beaker period (ca. 2500 - 2000 BC) copper dagger blade was recovered from the Sillees River near Ross Lough, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland that had a remarkably modern appearance. [...] The flat, triangular-shaped copper blade was 171 mm (6.75 inches) long, 42.5 mm (1.65 inches) wide, and 2mm (0.078 inches) in maximum thickness, with bevelled edges and a pointed tip, and featured an integral tang that accepted a riveted handle. [...] Analysis of the copper used in the dagger's construction revealed it to be of a type characteristic of the copper that was widely used in Ireland before the introduction of bronze tools and weapons. [...] By around 2000 BC daggers were being cast of bronze, with blades <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> drawing and <b>hammering</b> the metal on bronze anvils set in guides.|$|R
