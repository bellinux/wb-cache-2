40|$|Flight mirror {{assemblies}} (FMAs) {{of large}} telescopes, {{such as the}} International X-ray Observatory (IXO), have very stringent thermal-structural distortion requirements. The spatial temperature gradient requirement within a FMA could be as small as 0. 05 C. Con ventionally, heaters and thermistors {{are attached to the}} stray light baffle (SLB), and centralized heater controllers (i. e., <b>heater</b> <b>controller</b> boards located in a large electronics box) are used. Due to the large number of heater harnesses, accommodating and routing them is extremely difficult. The total harness length/mass is very large. This innovation uses a thermally conductive pre-collimator to accommodate heaters and a distributed <b>heater</b> <b>controller</b> approach. It minimizes the harness length and mass, and reduces the problem of routing and accommodating them. Heaters and thermistors are attached to a short (4. 67 cm) aluminum portion of the pre-collimator, which is thermally coupled to the SLB. Heaters, which have a very small heater power density, and thermistors are attached to the exterior of all the mirror module walls. The major portion (23. 4 cm) of the pre-collimator for the middle and outer modules is made of thin, non-conductive material. It minimizes the view factors from the FMA and heated portion of the precollimator to space. It also minimizes heat conduction {{from one end of the}} FMA to the other. Small and multi-channel heater controllers, which have adjustable set points and internal redundancy, are used. They are mounted to the mechanical support structure members adjacent to each module. The IXO FMA, which is 3. 3 m in diameter, is an example of a large telescope. If the <b>heater</b> <b>controller</b> boards are centralized, routing and accommodating heater harnesses is extremely difficult. This innovation has the following advantages. It minimizes the length/mass of the heater harness between the heater controllers and heater circuits. It reduces the problem of routing and accommodating the harness on the FMA. It reduces the risk of X-ray attenuation caused by the heater harness. Its adjustable set point capability eliminates the need for survival heater circuits. The operating mode heater circuits can also be used as survival heater circuits. In the non-operating mode, a lower set point is used...|$|E

It was successfully launched into orbit on November 20, 2004. The Swift mission is a first of its kind of multi-wavelength transient observatory for gamma ray burst astronomy. Its mission life is 2 years. The inclination is 22 deg maximum. The spacecraft bus voltage to the instruments is in the 24 V to 35 V range. The instruments will be turned off when the voltage is below 27 V. The BAT is mounted to the optical bench through five titanium flexures. The BAT has been developed at GSFC. Its telescope assembly consists of 256 Detector Modules (DMs) in the Detector Array. There are 16 Detector Array Blocks. Each Block holds 16 DMs, 3 Block Voltage Regulator (BVR) units and 3 Block Command & Data Handling (BCDH) units. The power dissipation of each Block has been measured to be 13 W.

The PBMR {{has called}} for {{research}} into the possibility of distributed in-core temperature measurement. In this thesis, several methods for distributed temperature measurement in high-pressure, -radiation and -temperature environments have been investigated {{by means of a}} literature study. The literature study has revealed FBG temperature sensors as the most feasible solution to the temperature measurement challenge. Various parameters affecting the propagation of light in optical fibres and consequently the FBG reflection profile was researched. The differential equations describing FBG structures were solved and implemented in Matlab in order to simulate WDM of a distributed FBG sensing system. Distributed sensing with apodized FBGs written in sapphire optical fibre show the most promise of becoming a solution to the measurement challenge.

40|$|Electronics warming has broad {{applications}} in the aerospace industry, where electronics assemblies are subject to lower than recommended temperature environments. Prior to operation {{it is necessary to}} raise the temperature of the electronics to the minimum safe operating level, recommended by the manufacturer. This is managed by adding an electrical heater inside the electronics assembly enclosure. A very important characteristic of the heater is how quickly the desired temperature needs to be reached. Of course, this characteristic determines the size of the heater needed for the warm up process. Since relatively low failure mode temperatures are often required by the aerospace industry, there is an additional level of complexity involved in designing the optimum size of a heater. In a failure mode condition, the analysis requires a heater to be sized to produce a small amount of heat even under hot environmental conditions. The two requirements of fast warm up time and low failure mode temperatures seem contradictory. The art of the Thermal Management in this type of design is {{to come up with a}} specific optimum heater size that can satisfy a rapid warm up requirement and yet not exceed the maximum allowable temperature during a failure mode scenario. Often a thermal engineer needs to work with an electrical engineer to manipulate the control algorithm for the heater in order to satisfy these two requirements. This study will investigate how to approach such a problem and how one can size such heater. Also, optimization techniques are considered in order to choose the proper design among all available solutions. There are two different ways to achieve a desired warm up time of a cold soaked electronics assembly. The first approach may require some manipulation of the location of the heater inside the box or the addition of insulating materials. This approach captures the heat generated by the heater inside the enclosure in order to achieve quicker warm up period. However, the presence of an insulator increases the risk of dangerously high temperatures during a failure mode scenario. To alleviate the insulator effect, the external enclosure heat dissipation mechanism must be altered. This kind of modification is costly and requires additional design steps. This is where the benefit of the second approach comes in. Namely, the desired result of a fast warm up time and lower failure mode temperatures can be achieved by manipulating the <b>heater</b> <b>controller</b> and controlling the amount of power to the heater. A Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Controller can be used to control not only the amount of heat generated by a heater, but also the percentage of heater "on” time within one pulse width and therefore the warm up time. Having the ability to control the frequency of releasing heat into the cold enclosure allows us to indicate two new parameters : the amount of heat load and the heat load frequency of inserting heat. A thermal management scheme can be developed to optimize the most efficient pair of values that will meet warm up time and failure mode temperature criteria. An analytical model is developed to study the thermal management of such a problem. The analytical model is used to perform an optimization study and to recommend a <b>heater</b> <b>controller</b> design for a given required specification...|$|E

However, <b>heater</b> <b>controllers</b> are only able to control open-loop power dissipation to about a part in 10 (exp 5). We used an array of rf-biased Josephson junctions to precisely control the electrical power dissipation in a heater resistor mounted on a thermally isolated cryogenic platform. Theoretically, this method is capable of controlling the electrical power dissipation to better than a part in 10 (exp 12). However, this level {{has not yet been}} demonstrated experimentally. The experiment consists of a liquid helium cell that also functions as a high-resolution PdMn thermometer, with a heater resistor mounted on it. The cell is thermally connected to a temperature-controlled cooling stage via a weak thermal link. The heater resistor is electrically connected to the array of Josephson junctions using superconducting wire. An rf-biased array of capacitively shunted Josephson junctions drives the voltage across the heater. The quantized voltage across the resistor is Vn = nf(h/ 2 e), where h is Planck's constant, f is the array biasing frequency, e is the charge of an electron, and n is the integer quantum state of the Josephson array. This results in an electrical power dissipation on the cell of Pn = (Vn) (sup 2 /R), where R is the heater resistance. The change of the quantum state of the array changes the power dissipated in the heater, which in turn, results in the change of the cell temperature. This temperature change is compared to the expected values based on the known thermal standoff resistance of the cell from the cooling stage. We will present our initial experimental results and discuss future improvements.

We have developed an ultra-stable temperature platform with a demonstrated noise of 25 pK in a one-hertz bandwidth, and we have identified the physical source of this residual noise. We used an array of RF-biased Josephson junctions to precisely control the electrical power dissipation in a heater resistor mounted on this thermally isolated cryogenic platform to well beyond our ability to measure, which we estimate is stable to better than a part in 10 (exp 12).

Also, the outgas heater cycled off when the cold stage was warming up to 323 K. A corrective action was taken before the attitude of the spacecraft was changed during the first week in flight. One orbit before the attitude was changed, the outgas heaters were disabled to cool off the cold stage. The cold stage temperature increase was strongly dependent on the spacecraft roll and yaw. It provided evidence that direct solar radiation entered the gap between the cooler door and cooler shroud. There was a concern that the direct solar radiation could cause polymerization of hydrocarbons, which could contaminate the cooler and lead to a thermal short. After outgas with the cooler door in the outgas position for seven days, the cooler door was changed to the fully open position. With the cooler door fully open, the maximum cold stage temperature was 316. 3 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, and the duty cycle of the outgas heater in the eclipse was the same as that in the sunlight.

40|$|Development of a {{predictive}} octane {{model is}} a potentially useful tool for designing fuel blends for meeting octane specifications. One of the approaches adopted is through chemical kinetic modelling of the autoignition properties of constituent compounds. The results obtained from models, however, are dependent on experimental data for validation. It was the intention of this thesis to provide empirical data {{that could be used}} confirm a recently proposed autoignition model based upon the results obtained from chemical kinetics modelling. Motored engines have been used extensively for the investigation of autoignition properties of fuels. They are useful in interpreting results from conventional ignition delay measuring systems as well as giving practical insight into the process of autoignition in spark ignition engines. The conditions required for autoignition reactions to take place are easily produced in a motored engine with a suitable compression ratio. A single cylinder engine was modified so that the inlet conditions could be adjusted and n-heptane was tested in the device. Fuelling was controlled with an injection system which was calibrated for n-heptane use in the engine. A range of inlet conditions were determined that would enable peak conditions in the engine to result in autoignition of the fuel. The autoignition data was then used in describing the ignition delay characteristics of the fuel and the range of interest, the so called negative temperature coefficient region. Autoignition experiments were performed in the engine and the data was analysed by the comparison of measured autoignition reactions with predicted reaction times; the predictions were calculated using the new empirical autoignition model. Direct analysis of the model resulted in good correlation of measured and predicted overall autoignition reaction times, with improved correlation of cool flame reaction times with initial temperature adjustment. Modification of initial temperature values in the indirect model application (whereby traces were generated using an engine model with autoignition prediction capabilities) resulted in similar observances. These initial results led {{to the conclusion that the}} temperature and Arrhenius parameter adjustments necessary to obtain a perfect fit in the autoignition model were indicative of errors involved in the temperature measurement or in the fuel metering. Recommendations for further work on the engine would be the investigation of a dynamometer system that would be free from noise transmission during operation and that would enable experimentation with lower engine speeds. Further work on the inlet system would be the installation of shielded thermocouples and a quicker acting <b>heater</b> <b>controller.</b> A fundamental change in fuel metering calibration is required.

40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} gaining {{increased}} attention as viable energy generators {{for a range}} of applications. To optimize performance, these systems require active coordination leveraging an understanding of the system dynamics. This thesis describes a reproducible process for modeling, calibrating, and experimentally validating system dynamics for control applications, applied to two membrane-based systems, namely a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack and a gas humidification system. A two-phase dynamic model that predicts the experimentally observed temporal behavior of a PEMFC stack and a methodology to experimentally identify tunable physical parameters, namely the membrane water vapor diffusion coefficient and the thickness of the liquid water film restricting the fuel cell active area, is presented. The temporal calculation of the species concentrations through the gas diffusion layers, the water vapor transport through the membrane, and the degree of water flooding in the gas channels, enables a prediction of temporal voltage degradation. The calibrated model is validated under anode flooding conditions for a 24 cell, 300 cm 2 stack with a supply of pressure-regulated hydrogen. To regulate the humidity of the supplied reactants to actively manage water within the PEMFC, a membrane based gas humidification system is designed and constructed. This apparatus utilizes a gas bypass and a series of eaters to regulate gas temperature while maintaining the desired relative humidity of the gas supplied to the PEMFC. To design and calibrate the <b>heater</b> <b>controllers,</b> as well as the fraction of air diverted through the bypass, a low order, control-oriented model based on first principles is developed. As with the fuel cell model, the humidification system model is parameterized and validated using experimental data under a wide range of operating conditions. A relative humidity estimator is employed, for the air-vapor mixture leaving the humidifier system (supplied to the PEMFC), to eliminate the need for a bulky and expensive humidity sensor.

On the other hand, the methods developed in this thesis are not limited to wind power balancing. Two major approaches were analysed - heating ventilation and air conditioning system control (mainly focused on, but not limited to, residential hot water heaters) and hybrid power system comprising of thermal and hydro power plants together with utility scale flow batteries. These represent the consumption side or the demand response mechanism. The first approach focused on modelling the behaviour of residential end users. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques such as neural networks and Box-Jenkins methodology were used to learn and predict energy usage. Both joint and individual dwelling behaviour was considered. Model predictive control techniques were then used to send the exact real-time price and observe the change in electricity consumption. Also, novel individual hot water <b>heater</b> <b>controllers</b> were modelled with the ability to forecast and look ahead the required energy, while responding to electricity grid imbalance. It proved to be possible to balance the generation and increase system efficiency while maintaining user satisfaction. For the second approach, the hybrid multi-power plant system was exploited. Three different power sources were modelled, namely thermal power plant, hydro power pant and flow battery. These sources were ranked by the ability to rapidly change the output of electricity. The power that needs to be balanced was then routed to different power units according to their response times. The calculation of the best power dispatch is proposed using a cost function. The aim of this research was to accommodate for the wind power imbalance without sacrificing the health of the power plants (minimising load variations for sensitive units) ...|$|R
25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID <b>controller</b> sets a <b>heater</b> temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the <b>heater.</b> The inner <b>controller's</b> error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|R

May 15 - 19, 2006, Orlando, FL. In this paper, we propose a framework to characterize the energy consumption of machines and their subcomponents (e. g., spindle, coolant pump, <b>controller,</b> <b>heater,</b> hydraulic system in injection molding machine, motors in these components). This framework serves as a key component in describing {{the environmental impacts of}} decisions in manufacturing operations design and control, especially at the sub-cellular level. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be utilized to investigate the inter-relationship of operational decisions and environmental impacts within a manufacturing plant. The paper concludes with examples of the proposed framework for energy data collection on a CNC milling machine...|$|R

PID controllers {{are widely used}} in commercial buildings to keep variables such as temperature, pressure and humidity at predefined setpoints. These controllers, {{when they do not}} include autotuners, must be carefully tuned. Also, one must consider the effect of interactions occurring among the control loops during the fine-tuning stage so one loop response is not improved to the detriment of another. This research emphasizes PI-control of dual duct systems. Three tuning methods (Ziegler and Nichols' sensitivity method, simplified IMC-PID method, and Bekker et al. method) were selected and tested on a small scale dual duct system with four decentralized control loops (cooling valve, fan speed, damper and <b>heater).</b> Each <b>controller</b> was tuned according to the best performing set of tuning parameters and the system was then operated under design conditions to observe the interactions among the control loops. Since interaction was minimum, a better understanding of interaction was obtained by introducing a sustained oscillation in each loop, one loop at a time. An oversensitive valve was found to have a severe effect on damper control loop and an oversensitive damper was found to interact with fan speed control. Considering these interaction effects, two sets of optimizing curves were developed for the dual duct system. The use of these curves improved some loop responses without rendering other loops unstabl...|$|R

In the quantum domain, {{there is a}} change of paradigm in feedback, since measurements modify {{the state of the}} system, most dramatically when the trajectory goes through superpositions of measurement eigenstates. Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of an arbitrary trajectory of a superconducting qubit by measurement-based feedback. The protocol benefits from the long coherence time (T 2 > 10 μs) of the 3 D transmon qubit, the high efficiency (82 %) of the phase-preserving Josephson amplifier, and fast electronics that ensure less than 500 ns total delay. At discrete time intervals, the state of the qubit is measured and corrected in case an error is detected. For Rabi oscillations, where the discrete measurements occur when the qubit is supposed to be in the measurement pointer states, we demonstrate an average fidelity of 85 % to the targeted trajectory. For Ramsey oscillations, which do not go through pointer states, the average fidelity reaches 76 %. Incidentally, we demonstrate a fast reset protocol that allows us to cool a 3 D transmon qubit down to 0. 6 % in the excited state...|$|R
40|$|Platelet {{incubators}} provide {{temperature controlled}} environments for laboratories that preserve platelets in liquid form {{at close to}} ambient temperature. Quality and shelf life of the stored platelets strongly depend on the storage temperature uniformity and continuous movement of the platelets provided by an agitator to avoid coagulation. Incubator manufacturers usually provide assurance that temperature uniformity within +/- 1 Â°C from the set point can be attained. Â Tight temperature tolerances are achieved with a combined vapor compression cooling system and an electric resistance heating system integrated into the incubator. Â Standard refrigerants currently employed in refrigerated laboratory equipment are HFCs with high GWPs. In the future, HFCs could be gradually replaced mostly by flammable natural refrigerants of the ASHRAE A 3 group such as R 600 a (isobutane), R 290 (propane) and R 170 (ethane) depending on the cooler size and application temperature. Flammable refrigerant charge is limited to 150 g or less which in some cases requires complete redesign of the refrigeration circuit. The focus {{of this study was}} to convert the refrigeration system of an existing platelet incubator to hydrocarbon refrigerant. The selected incubator is able to store 32 apheresis bags and based on the required cooling capacity R 600 a refrigerant was identified as the most suitable replacement for R 134 a. The baseline R 134 a system performance was experimentally evaluated at a wide range of ambient temperatures between 15 Â°C to 35 Â°C specified by the manufacturer and at 3 different cabinet set points: 20 Â°C, 22 Â°C and 27 Â°C. Attention was given to the energy consumption by distinguishing between contributions of individual components: compressor, fans, pulse heater, agitator, condensate tray <b>heater</b> and <b>controller.</b> Temperature uniformity was determined from measurements at 17 locations inside the cabinet over a 24 hour period. Subsequently, the refrigeration system was converted to R 600 a refrigerant and its performance was optimized by capillary tube size selection, refrigerant charge amount, evaporator fan speed and by replacing the electric condensate heater with a discharge gas loop. The redesigned machine required only 50 g of R 600 a refrigerant charge and resulted on average in 20 % lower energy consumption. Cabinet temperature uniformity was within the required +/- 1 Â°C for all tested conditions and uniformity of +/- 0. 5 Â°C at 15 Â°C and 25 Â°C ambient temperatures was confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} the {{transition}} from laminar to turbulent flow in a boundary layer of a flat plate is investigated using numerical simulations. The numerical model {{is based on the}} incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which is coupled with the energy equation through the temperature dependent viscosity. A fully implicit finite difference spectral method was used to solve the governing equations. The numerical model allows for the spatial evolution of the disturbances in a non-parallel boundary layer. Active control of wave packet disturbances in the non-isothermal boundary layer is studied in detail. Wave packet disturbances are created in the flow field by simulating the effect of thermally activated heater elements on the plate surface. Through a controlled spanwise variation of the temperature of the heater elements, two- and three-dimensional wave packet disturbances can be studied. The propagation and amplification of the wave packet disturbances in the boundary layer is examined. The heater elements on the plate surface act as locally strong heat sources causing thermal wakes within the boundary layer that spread in the downstream direction. A transfer function technique is used for the control strategy. The transfer function is based on the vorticity response to a finite temperature fluctuation at the heater strip and is obtained from the numerical simulations. With additional <b>heater</b> segments (<b>controller)</b> located downstream of an excitation source, the possibility of attenuating wave packet disturbances is investigated. With the numerical transfer function, a successful control strategy for the wave packet cancellation could be developed. Initially, for the low amplitude, two-dimensional disturbances in the transition process with the implemented control strategy the wave packet disturbances could be almost completely cancelled. For the attentuation of three-dimensional wave packet disturbances, the transfer function technique was extended to allow for spanwise variations. The attenuation of three-dimensional wave packets with the modified transfer function technique was almost equally as successful as for the purely two-dimensional flow disturbances. For the simulation of the three-dimensional flow development with no control applied, nonlinear interaction of wave components of the wave packet first appeared for the oblique modes in the low frequency range, which was also observed in experimental investigations. The attenuation of only the two-dimensional components of a three-dimensional wave packet disturbance delays the onset of the nonlinear interaction of the oblique spanwise modes in the lower frequency range...|$|R
