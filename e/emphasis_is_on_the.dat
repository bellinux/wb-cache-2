5|$|The kulintang {{repertoire}} has no fixed labels {{because the}} music {{itself is not}} considered a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is orally transmitted, the repertoire itself is considered something always {{in a state of}} flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren’t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, the labels they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> excitement and pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore the labels attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the ethos of self-directed learning, during {{sessions}} it encourages a shift in power from an academic tutor to the students in a PBL group. However, it will be seen that lectures, tutorials and clinical teaching sessions can {{play a part in}} problem-based learning - but the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> student to decide how these will enable them to fulfil their learning objectives, rather than passively absorb all information.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between pet shows and pet fashion shows. The pet fashion show's <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clothes, not on the dog. In countries all over the world, pet fashion shows are becoming increasingly popular they have become so important that in 2011 New York hosted the first Pet Fashion Week called Last Bark at Bryant Park. During these shows, well groomed pets strut down the runway wearing high fashion clothes. Some well known designers such as Alexander Wang have designed outfits for the dogs.|$|E

25|$|Research {{students}} constitute {{more than}} 70% {{of the students}} on the campus. Ph.D. degrees offered in 40 different disciplines. Research programs leading to doctoral degrees are the main thrust in many departments. The program has {{a limited amount of}} course work, essentially to prepare the student to carry out the research, but the main <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thesis work. The annual intake of research students is approximately 250 with several candidates sponsored from educational institutions and industries. The research students constitute the largest group (50%) on the campus.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} like Nada Klaić considered that Thomas the Archdeacon despised Slavs/Croats and {{that wanted to}} depreciate them as barbarians with Goths identification, however, until the time of Renaissance the Goths were seen as noble barbarians compared to Huns, Avars, Vandals, Langobards, Magyars and Slavs, and as such he would not identify them with the Goths. Also, in the Thomas the Archdeacon's work the starting <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> decadence of people from Salona, and as such scholars consider the emergence of newcomers Goths/Croats was actually seen {{as a kind of}} God's scourge for sinful Romans.|$|E
25|$|Striptease {{involves}} a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics {{such as the}} wearing of additional clothes or putting clothes or {{hands in front of}} just undressed body parts such as the breasts or genitalia. The <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude. The costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing, or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them.|$|E
50|$|The Christian Church {{performed}} {{marriages in}} the narthex {{of the church}} prior to the 16th century, when <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marital contract and betrothal. Subsequently, the ceremony moved inside the sacristy of the church.|$|R

500|$|Most of Godwin's {{works are}} based on themes or events taken from her own life. The characters, {{settings}} and narratives vary from novel-to-novel, but common topics have included family, the position of women in society and relationships, a woman's artistic and career pursuits, {{and the role of}} religious faith. According to The Intellectual in Twentieth-Century Southern Literature, Godwin's characters [...] "struggle intellectually to navigate the mazes of race, class, gender, family, faith and religion." [...] According to Contemporary Literary Criticism, [...] "she writes about issues pertaining to women - male-female roles, marriage, family, personal freedom, self-concept, and self-actualization." [...] Author Jane Hill said Godwin's books are about co-existing with authorities, the role of decision-making in life, careers as an artist, and the consequences of thwarted ambition. Much of her <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concept of the self and one's struggles with society.|$|E
500|$|The college's {{academic}} <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{liberal arts}} and the sciences, {{with a focus on}} preparing students for graduate and professional schools. Campus activities include various religious, political, and general interest clubs, as well as academic and professional-themed organizations. [...] The college has a strong history of competing literary societies, dating back before the union of Jefferson and Washington Colleges. [...] Students operate a college radio station, a campus newspaper, and a literary journal. [...] The athletic program competes in NCAA Division III. The football team has been particularly successful over its history, even competing in the 1922 Rose Bowl. [...] A large majority of students participate in intramural athletics. [...] Nearly all students live on campus and roughly one third are members of fraternities or sororities. A number of noteworthy alumni have attended the college or its predecessor institutions, including James G. Blaine, William Holmes McGuffey, Joseph Ruggles Wilson the father of President Woodrow Wilson, and Pete Henry.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> liberal arts, social sciences, law, basic science, agriculture, and medicine, but (partly as {{the result}} of a national educational reform programme) the curriculum was expanded to provide more technology-based and vocational courses and postgraduate training.|$|R

2500|$|The first, Sheaves of Wheat in a Field {{was painted}} July–August 1885 in Nuenen, Netherlands.

[...] This work was made several months after The Potato Eaters {{at a time when he}} was looking to free himself physically, emotionally and artistically from the gray colors of his art and life, moving away from Nuenen to develop, as author Albert Lubin describes, a more [...] "imaginative, colorful art that suited him much better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stubbs depicts Whistlejacket {{rising to}} a levade, {{but with his}} head turned towards the viewer, in a pose {{comparable}} {{to a number of}} earlier monumental equestrian portraits, including examples by Rubens and Velázquez, but in these the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rider. [...] Here the horse is alone and in a natural state, producing a [...] "romantic study in solitude and liberty". [...] Like many of Stubbs's other paintings of horses and other animals in the wild, including several versions of a horse attacked by a lion perched on its back, the painting is an early intimation of Romanticism, as well as a challenge to the lowly place animal painting occupied in the hierarchy of genres.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{kinds of}} stories call for {{different}} kinds of characters, tension, pacing, themes, and dialogue. [...] A fast-paced action adventure needs fast-paced dialogue in every scene to keep the story moving forward quickly. [...] Likewise, a literary story needs the dialogue to match {{the pace of the}} other elements in the story—it needs to move more slowly. [...] Genre stories generally move quickly, employing more dialogue and action and less slow-paced narrative, because they are generally plot-driven rather than character-driven, like literary and mainstream stories. [...] The <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> action that keeps the plot moving rather than the narrative that keeps the character growing. [...] It pays to know the characters because who they are determines how slowly or quickly they talk.|$|E

2500|$|Japanese {{animation}} studios were {{pioneers of}} many limited animation techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. Unlike Disney animation, where the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques {{make up for}} the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices. Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work. The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in Howl's Moving Castle and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking [...] "tremendously impressive".|$|E
2500|$|The above {{describes}} {{three stages}} as the spiritual {{order of the}} month of Tishrei unfolds: On Rosh Hashanah Jewish tradition maintains that God opens the books of judgment of creation and all mankind starting from each individual person, so that what is decreed is first written in those books, hence {{the emphasis on the}} [...] "ketivah" [...] ("writing"). The judgment is then pending and prayers and repentance are required. Then on Yom Kippur, the judgment is [...] "sealed" [...] or confirmed (i.e. by the Heavenly Court), hence the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "chatimah" [...] ("sealed"). But the Heavenly verdict is still not final because there is still an additional hope that until Sukkot concludes God will deliver a final, merciful judgment, hence the use of [...] "gmar" [...] ("end") that is [...] "tov" [...] ("good").|$|E
2500|$|Swing music, {{or simply}} swing, {{is a form}} of popular music {{developed}} in the United States that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> off–beat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb [...] "to swing" [...] is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Woody Herman, and Cab Calloway.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} truly free form. The air talent hand picked their music, and one could conceivably hear a {{classical}} piece {{followed by a}} psychedelic rock track followed by a jazz or blues tune. <b>The</b> station’s <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> “art” of mixing music, rather than company profit.|$|R

He preached that one's {{faith in}} Jesus assures that person {{a share in}} Jesus' life (salvation). He saw Jesus' death as being for the believers' benefit, not a defeat. Jesus died so that believers' sins would be forgiven.|$|R
