25|$|Affordability. The {{share of}} the water bill for 5 cubic meter per month and {{household}} was between 0.5% and 1.1% of income of poor households for the 11 largest utilities in 2007. The {{share of the}} sewer bill was between zero and 0.7%. Water and sewer bills were thus highly affordable. The highest combined share of water and sewer bill was found in Sana'a with 1,6%. The average share of total monthly household expenditure on water and sewerage is about 1.1%, which amounts to about YR 1,363, while the average monthly expenditure on qat is about eight times (YR 10,888) the amount paid for water, according to the <b>household</b> <b>budget</b> survey (2005–2006).|$|E
25|$|Water supply. Slightly {{more than}} half the {{population}} of Tanzania is estimated to have access to an improved water source, with stark differences between urban areas (about 79% in 2010) and rural areas (about 44% in 2010). In rural areas, access is defined as meaning that households have to travel less than one kilometre to a protected drinking water source in the dry season. Trends in access to water supply are difficult to discern due to conflicting and unreliable data. However, it seems that access increased during the 1990s, particularly in rural areas, but stagnated during the 2000s. According to data from the <b>Household</b> <b>Budget</b> Surveys 2000/2001 and 2007 access to an improved water source in mainland Tanzania even decreased from 55% in 2000 to 52% in 2007. Using a narrow definition, in 2007 around 34% of households had access to piped water, as opposed to 40% in 2000. However, using a broader definition of access that also includes standpipes and protected springs, there has been a slight increase in the proportion of households reporting a drinking water source within one kilometre. Estimates from the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) show a different trend. They show a slight decline in access from 55% in 1990 to 53% in 2010. According to these figures, access in rural areas stagnated, while in urban areas it decreased from 94% to 79% over the same period. The JMP estimates rely on extrapolations using, among others, data from the <b>Household</b> <b>Budget</b> Survey 2000/2001 and 2007, the Census of 2002 and the Demographic and Health Surveys of 1999, 2005 and 2010.|$|E

25|$|Concerning affordability, an {{analysis}} of the 2007 <b>household</b> <b>budget</b> survey shows that the wealthiest quintile of Tanzanians spends more than 4000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$3.10) per month for water, corresponding to about 1 percent of their income. Those in the poorest quintile spend only about 1000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$0.77) per month for water, but this represents 4.5 percent of their income. One of the reasons why the poor spend less in absolute terms on water is that they fetch water for free from wells and streams. The data are not differentiated between rural and urban areas, although {{it is likely that the}} urban poor who have no access to free water sources pay much more for water than those in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Sanitation. National <b>Household</b> <b>Budget</b> Surveys ask {{respondents}} {{about the}} type of sanitary facility they have. In 2007 93% of Tanzanians responded that they had some form of latrine, but only 3% had a flush toilet. International statistics that monitor {{the achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goal for sanitation are based on these numbers, but only after making some important adjustments in an effort to achieve comparability across countries. The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) defines improved sanitation as excreta disposal systems that are private and that separate human excreta from human contact. Shared latrines or open pit latrines are excluded from this definition. The JMP estimates that only about half the latrines in Tanzania can be considered improved sanitation systems. Based on that definition, access to improved sanitation is much lower than the population with access to any type of latrine. According to the JMP definition, access to improved sanitation was only 10% in 2010, up from 8% in 1990, with an increase in urban areas and a slight decrease in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Despite some {{legislation}} passed in 1985 to ensure equality, both the Equal Opportunity Law, which prohibits discrimination, and the Child-Care Leave Law, which gives parents unpaid leave {{to tend to}} children, then return to their old position or a similar one, lacked any real power to drive change. No penalties were issued for companies who ignored this, meaning, only women who take on the same burden as male employees, of working full-time, with no breaks for pregnancy or child rearing, are able to have any hope of advancement. Boards of directors, public servants, and judiciary branches of work are typically closed to any career woman not willing to work full-time and overtime regularly. The largest part {{of the labor force}} are not the full-time career women, but housewives who work part-time, supplementing the <b>household</b> <b>budget.</b> In fact, the government discourages housewives from making too much money, because if housewives make a certain amount, they lose their husband's dependent allowance. This limits the jobs women can do while married. In many instances of the Japanese work force, women who wish to receive equal pay and chances at promotion are expected to act like their salaryman counterparts. This is indicative of one of the problems women face when seeking employment in Japan. While equal in part, they still face discrimination. Many businesses lack the flexibility to offer work which fits the irregular schedules of housewives. There have been some strides forward however. The equal employment legislation of the 1980s did prohibit discrimination in the training, benefits, retirement, and dismissal, however, not in recruitment, hiring, or promotion.|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to providing standard reminders about remembering <b>household</b> <b>budgets,</b> does asking survey respondents about their discretionary income {{and its use}} affect their voting responses in a national advisory referendum survey?

The contingent valuation method is applied to estimate household willing-ness to pay (WTP) for a split-sample treatment: respondents who only received a standard reminder of <b>household</b> <b>budgets</b> (control group) versus respondents who received two mental accounting-type questions on discretionary income and its uses (treatment group).

40|$|PURPOSE Out-of-pocket {{cost sharing}} {{for health care}} {{expenses}} is a growing bur-den. Prior research has emphasized the medical consequences of cost sharing. This study investigates the range of social, medical, fi nancial, and sometimes legal disruptions from high out-of-pocket health expenses. METHODS We conducted open-ended, semistructured interviews with 33 insured patients (two-thirds covered by Medicare). All had chronic illnesses and sought philanthropic fi nancial assistance. RESULTS We found that high levels of cost sharing precipitated considerable anxiety and substantial debt problems, as well as disruptions of medical care. Participants described various borrowing strategies (eg, credit cards), legal prob-lems (eg, debt collections), and threats to their nonmedical <b>household</b> <b>budgets</b> (eg, food, housing). Participants described explicit and rank-ordered strategies for coping with new medical expenses. Participants understood their health benefi ts with exceptional detail but described considerable anxiety about changes to those benefi ts that could easily disrupt carefully managed <b>household</b> <b>budgets.</b> Benefi t designs that resulted in large a variations in fi nancial liability from month to month (eg, large deductibles or coverage gaps) imposed considerable fi nancial challenges. CONCLUSIONS As health care cost sharing grows, policy makers will {{need to consider the}} consequences of high cost sharing for families facing strained <b>household</b> <b>budgets.</b> Although the generosity of health insurance is important, continuity of benefi ts and month-to-month stability of fi nancial liability are also important and may be undervalued in policy discussions.

2500|$|For cost {{reducing}} resource efficiency, {{distinguishing between}} {{direct and indirect}} effects is shown in Figure 1 below. [...] The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and {{measured in terms of}} kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis. [...] An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing. [...] This shifts the <b>household</b> <b>budget</b> line rightwards. [...] The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income. [...] The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2. [...] The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect. [...] The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2. [...] The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically. In the manufacturing sector, {{it has been estimated that}} there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency. A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.|$|E
