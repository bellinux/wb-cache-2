50|$|Frank Hastings Griffin (July 16, 1886 - October 14, 1974) {{invented the}} double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> to rayon. <b>Artificial</b> <b>silk</b> was {{originally}} too soft for practical use, {{but with the}} double-godet it became usable as rayon in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing.|$|R
25|$|In April 1928 Glanzstoff Courtaulds began <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> {{production}} {{in the north of}} Cologne.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} price, Thai silk is usually 10 times more {{expensive}} than <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> {{stocking}} {{was produced}} in his laboratory there. He exhibited the material in the Paris Exhibition of 1900, where the German Empress ordered a gown made from the new material. In addition he made viscose filaments for electric lamps designed by Edison and Swan. [...] "Sir Joseph Swan said the substance looked like <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> and {{it was he who}} suggested we should manufacture it.|$|R
50|$|Ottoman made of {{pure silk}} is very {{expensive}} so <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> is used instead to create a cheaper alternative.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the first}} to patent <b>artificial</b> <b>silk,</b> {{although}} Georges Audemars had invented a variety called rayon in 1855.|$|R
50|$|Established in 1909, {{it became}} the largest {{supplier}} of rayon and the first company to make <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{basis of}} his wealth was that he {{invested}} in electric power and <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> businesses when those industries were in their infancy.|$|R
5000|$|After this tragedy, Little {{carried on}} in the {{business}} alone {{for a number of}} years. During these years he founded the Cellulose Products Company demonstrating that cellulose acetate could be used in producing nonflammable wire insulation and <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b> The company didn't do well financially, and when it was dissolved, Eastman Kodak purchased the company's patents for the first nonflammable motion picture film and the Lustron Company bought the <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> patents becoming the only American manufacturer of acetate silk.|$|R
50|$|In 1931, Henry Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert {{to produce}} <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> made with soybean fibers. They {{succeeded in making}} a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, {{hardened}} or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable {{in the making of}} suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon reached 5000 lb per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; DuPont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b>|$|R
5|$|Starting {{from the}} Long Depression (1873–1896), Lyonnais silk {{production}} had become totally industrialized, and hand looms were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry. The synthesis of aniline {{was used to}} make mauveine (aniline purple) dye and the synthesis of quinine was used to make indigo dye. In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated {{to the production of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> (viscose), which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, <b>artificial</b> <b>silk,</b> {{which was not}} {{suitable}} for hemstitching, made its appearance in the textile industry. This caused Karl Friedrich to turn to how some tasks {{in the production of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>silk,</b> such as the tying up of the hanks of thread into skeins prior to dyeing - termed fitzing in German - might be accomplished by machines. He devised plans for a fitz machine and set up a new workshop for its construction. In 1926, shortly before the first machine could be produced, Karl Friedrich Gegauf died.|$|R

25|$|Fremery and Urban {{decided to}} start making <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> (Glanzstoff), and {{patented}} {{a version of the}} Despeissis process {{with the addition of a}} practical method for spinning the fiber.|$|R
50|$|Louis-Marie Hilaire Bernigaud de Grange, Count (Comte) de Chardonnet (1 May 1839 - 11 March 1924) was a French {{engineer}} and industrialist from Besançon, and inventor of <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b>|$|R
50|$|Johann Urban (or Johannes Urban, 7 June 1863 - 13 November 1940) was an Austrian chemist and industrialist. He {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of the <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> industry.|$|R
50|$|Applications of <b>artificial</b> spider <b>silk</b> biopolymers include {{using it}} for the coating {{of all kinds of}} {{implants}} and medical products as well as for artificial ligaments and tendons due to its elastic tendencies and also since it is a natural product which will synthesize well with the body. Furthermore, <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> biopolymers can be applicated in personal care products as well as in textile products.|$|R
50|$|Spiber is a Japanese-based company {{decoding}} {{the gene}} {{responsible for the}} production of fibroin in spiders and then bioengineering bacteria with recombinant DNA to produce the protein, which they then spin into their <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b>|$|R
50|$|The High Life (Das kunstseidene Mädchen; La Grande Vie) is a 1960 French, West German and Italian film {{directed}} by Julien Duvivier, {{based on the}} novel Das kunstseidene Mädchen (The <b>Artificial</b> <b>Silk</b> Girl) by Irmgard Keun.|$|R
50|$|Thai silk {{smells like}} hair when burned. The silk {{is similar to}} the {{composition}} of human hair and fingernails. When the flame is removed, Thai silk immediately stops burning. <b>Artificial</b> <b>silk</b> smells like plastic when burned.|$|R
40|$|Biomimetic {{spinning}} of <b>artificial</b> spider <b>silk</b> {{requires that}} the terminal domains of designed minispidroins undergo specific structural changes {{in concert with the}} β-sheet conversion of the repetitive region. Herein, we combine solution and solid-state NMR methods to probe domain-specific structural changes in the NT 2 RepCT minispidroin, which allows us to assess the degree of biomimicry of <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> spinning. In addition, we show that the structural effects of post-spinning procedures can be examined. By studying the impact of NT 2 RepCT fiber drying, we observed a reversible beta-to-alpha conversion. We think that this approach will be useful for guiding the optimization of <b>artificial</b> spider <b>silk</b> fibers...|$|R
50|$|Rockland Grist Mill {{dates to}} at least 1810, and {{has been used for}} a variety of purposes, {{including}} manufacture of calico, cotton spinning, production of wooden toys and <b>artificial</b> <b>silk,</b> food preservation additives and jewelry cleaning solutions.|$|R
50|$|As {{traditional}} Thai silk is hand woven, each {{silk fabric}} {{is unique and}} cannot be duplicated by commercial means. In contrast, <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> is machine woven, which means that {{every part of the}} fabric is identical and has the same color.|$|R
2500|$|Bemberg {{was using}} the [...] "stretch-spinning" [...] process invented by the chemist Edmund Thiele (1867–1927) to make {{cuprammonium}} rayon with equally fine filaments to the <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> of Hilaire de Chardonnet (1839–1924),and with better physical properties. The VGF product was not competitive.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>silk</b> or art silk is any {{synthetic}} fiber which resembles silk, but typically costs less to produce. Frequently, [...] "artificial silk" [...] {{is just a}} synonym for rayon. When made out of bamboo viscose it is also sometimes called bamboo silk.|$|R
50|$|Agnes Borrowman {{spent the}} early 1890s as a {{research}} assistant, learning about the synthesis of rubber, <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> and paper-making materials. She also worked at a retail pharmacy in Scotland, her hometown. When her boss died after World War One, she became the sole proprietor.|$|R
40|$|More than 400 {{million years}} of natural {{selection}} acting throughout the arthropoda has resulted in highly specialized and energetically efficient processes to produce protein-based fibers with properties that {{are a source of}} inspiration for all. As a result, for over 80 years researchers have been inspired by natural silk production in their attempts to spin <b>artificial</b> <b>silks.</b> While significant progress has been made, with fibers now regularly outperforming silkworm silks, surpassing the properties of superior silks, such as spider dragline, is still an area of considerable effort. This review provides an overview of the different approaches for <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> fiber spinning and compares all published fiber properties to date which has identified future trends and challenges on the road towards replicating high performance silks...|$|R
5000|$|The American Enka Company was {{established}} outside of Asheville, North Carolina in late September 1928 by a Dutch firm, the [...] (Netherlands <b>Artificial</b> <b>Silk</b> Company). The {{sound of the}} initial letters, N - K in Dutch of the parent firm's name is how Enka is derived.|$|R
50|$|The {{early years}} of the 20th century saw the {{manufacture}} of surgical threads which were woven rather than twisted. In 1907 a new <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> was produced specifically for the manufacture of Plauen lace. With the main factory unable to cope with demand, another was set up at Mundelsheim in 1910. A new product was added to the Amann range in 1919 with the manufacture of schappe silk (silk waste) and in 1921 an extension was built to house the colour dyeing plant. The latter was overseen by Johannes Mecheels, whose son, Otto Mecheels, went on to establish the Hohenstein Institute, a textile research centre situated at the edge of Bönnigheim. In 1923, mercerised cotton thread was produced, followed two years later by crocheting thread made from <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b>|$|R
50|$|Research {{has since}} {{continued}} {{with the help}} of Randy Lewis, a professor formerly at the University of Wyoming and now at Utah State University. He was also able to successfully breed spider goats in order to create <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b> There are now about 30 spider goats at a university-run farm.|$|R
60|$|A short {{description}} of it. A conjecture about {{the reason why}} Silk is so susceptible of vivid colours: and why Flax and Hair is not. A conjecture, that it way perhaps be possible to spin a kind of <b>artificial</b> <b>Silk,</b> out of some glutinous substance that may equalize natural Silk.|$|R
50|$|Out of Parliament, Oliver {{worked as}} a Barrister for the Transport and General Workers Union. He acted for the union at an inquest into the {{poisoning}} deaths of three workers at the British Celanese <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> factory at Spondon in 1934. At the 1935 general election he regained his seat by 10,601 votes.|$|R

By 1935, every Ford car had soy involved in its manufacture. For example, soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles, as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before.|$|R
