40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a cultural learning {{approach to the}} evolution of agents to play the game of connect–four. Each agent has a neural network responsible for perceiving the current board configuration and selecting an appropriate next move. Populations evolve through population learning, a process of Darwinian evolution, using genetic algorithms. Cultural learning is implemented by selecting highly fit agents as teachers to instruct the next generation. Teachers communicate with pupils through a hidden layer in each neural network (the verbal input/output layer) and pupils attempt to replicate utterances by back–propagation. Experiments are conducted comparing the performance of <b>populations</b> <b>employing</b> <b>population</b> learning alone and <b>populations</b> <b>employing</b> both <b>population</b> and cultural learning. ...|$|R

Examining health outcomes with cross-sectional data, researchers always have to challenge causality in observed associations. Selection bias is a common problem of population-based studies. With <b>employed</b> <b>populations</b> under observation, like in the lidA study, health related selection out of the labour market is most prominent.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{learning}} models are commonly {{employed in the}} simulation of social be-haviour. These include population learning, lifetime learning and cultural learning. Pop-ulation learning allows populations as a whole to evolve over time, typically through a Darwinian model of natural selection. Lifetime learning allows individuals to acquire knowl-edge during their lifetimes and cultural learning allows individuals to pass this knowledge to their peers or the next generations. This work examines the effects of cultural learning on both the fitness and diversity of a population of neural network agents. A <b>population</b> <b>employing</b> <b>population</b> learning alone and one <b>employing</b> both <b>population</b> and cultural learning are assigned three benchmark tasks: the 5 bit-parity problem, the game of tic-tac-toe and the game of connect-four. Each agent contains a genome which encodes a neural network controller used by the agent to perceive and react to environmental stimuli. Results show that the addition of cultural learning promotes improved fitness and sig-nificantly increases both genotypic (the genetic make up of individuals) and phenotypic (the behaviour of individuals) diversity in the population...|$|R

2500|$|During the First World War, Devonport Dockyard {{provided}} {{employment to}} around 20,000 workers, {{but after the}} war {{the ending of the}} naval arms race, the need to economise on government expenditure (culminating in the Geddes Axe), and the Great Depression jointly led to large declines in its workforce, down to a low of under 11,000 by 1933. Despite this, Plymouth suffered less than cities that were dependent on commercial shipbuilders: in 1932 unemployment in Plymouth was 20.6% compared to 30.7% in Glasgow and 34.2% in Barrow-in-Furness. A number of representations were made to the Admiralty for alleviating the high unemployment, including transferring part of the Dockyard's workforce and facilities to a commercial employer, converting part of the yard into a commercial port and the use of dockyard labour and facilities to do commercial work under the Admiralty's control. Only the last of these suggestions was adopted, and only to a limited degree.
