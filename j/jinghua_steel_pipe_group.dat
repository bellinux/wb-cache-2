40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of economical construction of infrastructures has recently increased. The application of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> to bridge piers is {{considered as one}} of the effective methods. Spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> have been seldom used for bridge piers. Currently, spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> have been mainly used as the foundations of buildings or bridges and are relatively economical because they are produced in large quantities in factories. However, roll forming processes of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> are different from those of bending roll pipes which have been generally used as bridge piers, so that seismic performance of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> may be different from that of bending roll pipes. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} grasp the ultimate strength and the ductility of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes.</b> In this study, the finite element analysis was conducted for grasping the elasto-plastic behavior of hollow spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes.</b> Based on the analysis results, the seismic performance of hollow spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> under compressive axial force and bending moment was examined and the influences of the structural parameters on the seismic performances of the spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> are discussed...|$|R

The {{exploitation}} of high acid wells is facing severe corrosion {{challenges in the}} A and B gas fields in Sichuan, thus using lined <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> is a reliable and cost-effective anti-corrosion measure. However, lined <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> welding involves dissimilar steel welding, and anti-corrosion performances will be affected if the welding process is unreasonable. So {{it is necessary to}} make evaluation for corrosion of lined <b>steel</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this paper, taking welding gap of L 245 / 825 lined <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> as example, the anti-SSC performances of L 245 / 825 straight and ring welding gaps in NACE A solution were studied by CR method, and anti-cracking performances of them were evaluated by laboratory experiments.

Cathodic protection (CP) method {{is the most important}} in order to prevent underground corrosion. In this project, Cathodic Protection by using sacrificial anodes technique will be used to the underground steel pipeline. In this project a study of the performance of magnesium and zinc anodes have been carried out. Besides that, in order to know the effect of coating to the corrosion rate, the specimens of <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> have been coats using paint. All of the specimens were buried in the soil with depth 0. 2 m, pH 5. 49. Each sample undergoes underground exposure for 28 days before the surface morphology investigation was conducted using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). After the exposure period, cleaning process for all specimens follows prior to the final analysis. Corrosion rates were calculated using weight loss methods for all of the specimens. Magnesium sacrificial anode gives better protection to the <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> compare to the zinc anode. The result of the corrosion rate for cathodically protected coated <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> by using magnesium anode was lowest which is 0. 80 mpy compared to the cathodically protected coated <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> with sacrificial zinc anode, the corrosion rate is 2. 32 mpy. The result for coated <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> without using any anode is 2. 71 mpy. The magnesium anode performance yield similar result to the cathodicaly protected for uncoated <b>steel</b> <b>pipe.</b> The corrosion rate for coated <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> is around 0. 80 mpy to 2. 71 mpy which is lowest compare to corrosion rate for uncoated <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> is around 9. 86 mpy to 15. 68 mpy.
