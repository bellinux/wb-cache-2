Measurements of its lithium content suggest that the star has used up all of its helium and is now fusing lithium in the shell around its core. With this, its {{estimated}} age is 8.5 billion years, over twice the age of the Sun, but this age may vary to any point between 4.4 and 14 billion years in age because of the <b>high</b> <b>uncertainty</b> surrounding this aspect of the star's age.|$|E
25|$|Granger Morgan et al. (2009) {{suggested}} {{two related}} decision-making management strategies {{that might be}} particularly appealing when faced with <b>high</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> The first were resilient strategies. This seeks to identify a range of possible future circumstances, and then choose approaches that work reasonably well across all the range. The second were adaptive strategies. The idea here is to choose strategies that can be improved as more is learned as the future progresses. Granger Morgan et al. (2009) contrasted these two approaches with the cost–benefit approach, which seeks to find an optimal strategy.|$|E

It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. e.g. about issues like tobacco smoke, ozone depletion, global warming or acid rain. However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in a climate of <b>high</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.|$|E

500|$|The M7.3 {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} the strike-slip White Wolf Fault in the southern San Joaqin Valley. Historically, the left-lateral fault has had a component of reverse slip, {{and at the time}} of the July mainshock the ratio of reverse/left-lateral slip was about 1.2:1. The epicenter of the shock was at the [...] fault's southwestern end, at a point where it may end, or merge with the east–west trending Pleito thrust fault. The White Wolf Fault (as illuminated by the aftershocks) was found to be curved, with less dip on the northeast end, though that zone also had a higher strike-slip component. Other distinct characteristics on that end of the fault were the shallower shocks and the less overall slip. If the total fault displacement came about as a result of the same type of large-displacement shocks like the one in 1952, the recurrence interval was proposed to be 170–450 years. The 1995 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities gave a (<b>high</b> <b>uncertainty)</b> slip rate estimate of 2mm per year.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effect of {{uncertainty}} as reflected by financial market variables on subjective well-being. The analysis is based on Eurobarometer surveys, covering 20 countries over the period from 2000 to 2013. Individuals report lower levels of life satisfaction in times of <b>higher</b> <b>uncertainty</b> approximated by stock market volatility. This effect is heterogeneous across respondents: The probability of being unsatisfied is higher for respondents who are older, less educated, and live in one of the GIIPS countries of the euro area. Furthermore, <b>higher</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in combination with a financial crisis increases the probability of reporting low values of life satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|People who are <b>high</b> in causal <b>uncertainty</b> doubt {{their own}} ability to {{understand}} the causes of social events. In three studies, we {{examined the effects of}} target and perceiver causal uncertainty on attitudes toward the target. Target causal uncertainty was manipulated via responses on a causal uncertainty scale in Studies 1 and 2, and with a scenario in Study 3. In Studies 1 and 2, we found that participants liked the low causal uncertainty target more than the <b>high</b> causal <b>uncertainty</b> target. This preference was stronger for low relative to <b>high</b> causal <b>uncertainty</b> participants because <b>high</b> causal <b>uncertainty</b> participants held more uncertain ideals. In Study 3, we examined the value individuals place upon causal understanding (causal importance) as an additional moderator. We found that regardless of their own causal uncertainty level, participants who were high in causal importance liked the low causal uncertainty target more than the <b>high</b> causal <b>uncertainty</b> target. However, when participants were low in causal importance, low causal uncertainty perceivers showed no preference and <b>high</b> causal <b>uncertainty</b> perceivers preferred the <b>high</b> causal <b>uncertainty</b> target. These findings reveal that goal importance and ideals can influence how perceivers respond to causal uncertainty in others...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a firm that}} faces a declining profit stream for its established product.

In the presence of an exit option, earlier work determined the optimal timing to invest, where it was shown that <b>higher</b> <b>uncertainty</b> might accelerate investment timing. In the present paper the firm also decides on capacity. This extension leads to monotonicity, i. e. <b>higher</b> <b>uncertainty</b> delays investment timing. We also find that higher potential profitability of the innovative product market increases the incentive to invest earlier, where, however, we get the counterintuitive result that the firm invests in smaller capacity. Finally, if quantity has a smaller negative effect on price, the firm wants to acquire a larger capacity at a lower investment threshold...|$|R
