40|$|Abstract—This study uses GIS (Geographic Information Systems) {{to conduct}} an {{evaluation}} of the degree of the sufficiency of public green spaces such as parks and urban green areas as an indicator of <b>the</b> density of <b>metropolitan</b> areas, <b>in</b> particular <b>the</b> Chubu <b>metropolitan</b> area, <b>in</b> Japan. To that end, it first grasps the distribution situation of green spaces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three <b>metropolitan</b> areas <b>in</b> Japan, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chubu <b>metropolitan</b> area, using GIS digital maps. And based on this result, it conducts a GIS evaluation of the degree of sufficiency of public green spaces and arranges the result for every distance belt from the central part to compare and exam for every distance belt away from <b>the</b> center <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chubu <b>metropolitan</b> area. Furthermore, after pointing out the insufficient areas of public green spaces based on the result, it also proposes the improvement policy which can be introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chubu <b>metropolitan</b> area...|$|R
