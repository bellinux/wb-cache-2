2500|$|Ionospheric {{resistance}} has {{a complex}} nature, {{and leads to}} a secondary Hall current flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, {{so most of the}} observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral <b>electrojet.</b> An auroral <b>electrojet</b> index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. Kristian Birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named [...] "auroral electrojets" [...] (see also Birkeland currents).|$|E
2500|$|The {{worldwide}} solar-driven wind {{results in}} the so-called Sq (solar quiet) current system in the E region of the Earth's ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) ( [...] altitude). Resulting from this current is an electrostatic field directed west–east (dawn–dusk) in the equatorial day side of the ionosphere. At the magnetic dip equator, where the geomagnetic field is horizontal, this electric field results in an enhanced eastward current flow within ± 3 degrees of the magnetic equator, known as the equatorial <b>electrojet.</b>|$|E
30|$|Our {{goal here}} is to {{investigate}} the possibility of wind driven <b>electrojets</b> {{in the vicinity of}} cusps in the nightside ionosphere of Mars and to estimate the magnitude of the possible <b>electrojets.</b>|$|R
30|$|A brief gedanken {{experiment}} {{suggests that}} this trend will reverse if the driving neutral wind direction is reversed; for a uniform southward neutral wind, the current generated magnetic field will decrease the ambient crustal field north of the <b>electrojets</b> and enhance the ambient field south of the <b>electrojets.</b> As discussed in Section 5, these current generated perturbation magnetic fields may change the magnetic topology and thus significantly impact the ionospheric electrodynamics.|$|R
40|$|Enhancements in the auroral <b>electrojets</b> {{associated}} with magnetospheric substorms result {{from those in}} either the electric field or the ionospheric conductivities, or both. Their relative importance varies significantly, even during a single substorm, depending on the location {{as well as on}} the substorm phases. It is predicted that different parts of the <b>electrojets</b> tend to respond in different ways to substorm activity. The unprecedented, unique opportunity for CLUSTER spacecraft observations of electric/magnetic fields and precipitating particles, combined with radar measurements of ionospheric quantities and with ground magnetometers, will provide us with crucial information regarding the physical nature of the separation between the &quot;electric field-dominant'' and &quot;conductivity-dominant'' auroral <b>electrojets.</b> This study also discusses the implications of these two auroral-electrojet components in terms of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions...|$|R
2500|$|A Birkeland {{current is}} a set of {{currents}} that flow along geomagnetic field lines connecting the Earth’s magnetosphere to the Earth's high latitude ionosphere. In the Earth’s magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field and by bulk motions of plasma through the magnetosphere (convection indirectly driven by the interplanetary environment). The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in the magnetosphere (e.g. during substorms). [...] Small scale variations in the upward current sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons which, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the Auroras Borealis and Australis. In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland currents close through the region of the auroral <b>electrojet,</b> which flows perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere. [...] The Birkeland currents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets. [...] One pair extends from noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector. [...] The other pair extends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector. [...] The sheet on the high latitude side of the auroral zone {{is referred to as the}} Region 1 current sheet and the sheet on the low latitude side is referred to as the Region 2 current sheet.|$|E
5000|$|The term 'auroral electrojet' is {{the name}} given to the large {{horizontal}} currents that flow in the D and E regions of the auroral ionosphere. Although horizontal ionospheric currents {{can be expected to}} flow at any latitude where horizontal ionospheric electric fields are present, the auroral <b>electrojet</b> currents are remarkable for their strength and persistence. There are two main factors in the production of the <b>electrojet.</b> First of all, the conductivity of the auroral ionosphere is generally larger than that at lower latitudes. Secondly, the horizontal electric field in the auroral ionosphere is also larger than that at lower latitudes. Since the strength of the current is directly proportional to the vector product of the conductivity and the horizontal electric field, the auroral <b>electrojet</b> currents are generally larger compared to those at lower latitudes. During magnetically quiet periods, the <b>electrojet</b> is generally confined to the auroral oval. However during disturbed periods, the <b>electrojet</b> increases in strength and expands to both higher and lower latitudes. This expansion results from two factors, enhanced particle precipitation and enhanced ionospheric electric fields.|$|E

30|$|Regarding the auroral <b>electrojets,</b> {{they are}} a {{specific}} class of concentrated current flows which are most intense {{in the region of}} brightest auroral luminosity. This leads us to the simple view that precipitating energetic particles would enhance ionospheric conductivities, and cause auroras, along with carrying field-aligned currents. If this chain of processes were all genuine, then the growth and decay of the auroral <b>electrojets</b> would be determined by those only of the auroras (Kamide and Richmond 1991; Kamide and Kokubun 1996).|$|R

In several cases, the PCB location in relation to the Harang discontinuity was examined, and comparisons to satellite imagery data of the auroral oval were made. For some of the events, the ionospheric reconnection electric field could be estimated as a measure of the nightside reconnection rate and its variation was studied...|$|R

30|$|Before we can {{estimate}} {{the magnitude of}} wind-driven <b>electrojets,</b> we must first calculate the primary currents as done by Fillingim et al. (2010).

50|$|An <b>electrojet</b> is an {{electric}} current which travels around the E {{region of the}} Earth's ionosphere. There are two electrojets: above the magnetic equator (the equatorial <b>electrojet),</b> and near the Northern and Southern Polar Circles (the Auroral Electrojets). Electrojets are Hall currents carried primarily by electrons at altitudes from 100 to 150 km. In this region the electron gyro frequency (Larmor frequency) {{is much greater than}} the electron-neutral collision frequency. In contrast, the principal E region ions (O2+ and NO+) have gyrofrequencies much lower than the ion-neutral collision frequency.|$|E
