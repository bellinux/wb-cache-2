5|$|After {{twenty years}} of career struggles and obscurity, Thelonious Monk had become a jazz star with a {{residency}} at the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. In his first stable job in years, he helped transform the small bar {{into one of the}} city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of Monk's music. His employment there was a result of an appeal by his manager Harry Colomby to the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to restore Monk's cabaret card. Monk was stripped of the card in 1951 when he was convicted of narcotics possession; he had refused to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police after they discovered Powell's <b>glassine</b> envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet in the car of Powell's female companion.|$|E

40|$|Our micromechanical {{experiments}} {{show that}} at physiological temperatures type I collagen fibril has several basic {{features of the}} glassy state. The transition out of this state [softening transition] essentially depends on the speed of heating v, e. g., for v= 1 C/min it occurs around 70 C and is displayed by a peak of the internal friction and decreasing Young's modulus. The softening transition decreases by 45 C upon decreasing the heating speed to v= 0. 1 C/min. For temperatures 20 - 30 C the native collagen fibril demonstrates features of mechanical <b>glassines</b> at oscillation frequencies 0. 1 - 3 kHz; in particular, the internal friction has a sharp maximum {{as a function of}} the frequency. This is the first example of biopolymer <b>glassines</b> at physiological temperatures, because well-known glassy features of DNA and globular proteins are seen only for much lower temperatures (around 200 K).

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{competition}} between interactions on different length scales, as relevant {{for the formation of}} stripes in doped Mott insulators, can cause a glass transition in a system with no explicitly quenched disorder. We analytically determine a universal criterion for the emergence of an exponentially large number of metastable configurations that leads to a finite configurational entropy and a landscape dominated viscous flow. We demonstrate that <b>glassines</b> is unambiguously tied to a new length scale which characterizes the typical length over which defects and imperfections in the stripe pattern are allowed to wander over long times.

40|$|Magnetic {{susceptibility}} of {{two types}} of perovskite compounds A(Fe 0. 5 M 0. 5) O 3 A=Ba,Sr with M=Nb and Sb differing {{in the degree of}} chemical ordering was studied between 2 and 380 K. In the low temperature region, these compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic and spin-glass transition at T = 16 − 30 K. For the ordered compounds (M = Sb) the inverse susceptibility depends on T linearly up to the highest temperatures used. This enables the determination of the Weiss temperature θ and effective moment of the Fe 3 + ion expressed by a number of Bohr magnetons, peff. In contrast to it, the compounds with M = Nb are characterized by a higher degree of the <b>glassines</b> and by a concave character of the inverse susceptibility vs T dependence in the high temperature region. In these cases, the values of peff and θ could be estimated only very roughly by extrapolation to higher temperatures. The observed behavior was qualitatively explained from the Curie-Weiss law taking into account a distribution of the values θ, which reflects the presence of different exchange interactions between the Fe 3 + ions. The disordered samples (M = Nb) exhibit a roughly two times larger |θ|/TN ratio values as compared to the ordered (M = Sb) ones...|$|R
500|$|No Stairway is {{the debut}} studio album of <b>Glassine,</b> the musical project of Danny Greenwald, first {{released}} online and later issued on cassette worldwide by the label Patient Sounds, in April and August 2015, respectively. The title is {{a reference to}} a line from the 1992 film Wayne's World. The album garnered significant attention from music journalists for its compositional and production technique. In two Guitar Center stores, Greenwald tapped people playing instruments on his iPhone, and used snippets of these low-quality trackings as loops or synth patches, playing some of them through effects pedals or 4-track machines. The [...] "dystopian" [...] environment of Guitar Center shops and his desire to record something without a budget while in New York City is what inspired his idea to use samples of recordings of people playing instruments and build compositions out of them. On Facts year-end list of best Bandcamp releases, No Stairway came in at number 19.|$|E
500|$|No Stairway {{was first}} self-released on Bandcamp and Glassine's {{official}} SoundCloud page on April 17, 2015. In the same year, on August 6, record label Patient Sounds distributed the album on cassette. The {{title of the}} album is {{a reference to the}} line [...] "No stairway, denied" [...] from the 1992 comedy film Wayne's World. Live at Guitar Center, an album by Brookyln musician Noah Wall that also used Guitar Center recordings, was released slightly before the <b>Glassine</b> album on April 6. When Greenwald and Patient Sounds accidentally found out about Wall's record, he almost didn't want to release No Stairway, feeling [...] "gutted" [...] someone had already made an album with an identical concept to his project. However, when the label made Wall aware of Greenwald's release, he was very excited about the album and his support got Greenwald motivated again to distribute his record. Greenwald has not sent No Stairway to the company despite suggestion to do so from his relatives.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the middle}} {{years of the}} 1890s, Unitarian book and {{magazine}} publisher Charles H. Kerr of Chicago became attracted to the ideas of first populism and then Marxist socialism.

2500|$|Born in Santiago, Dominican Republic in 1961, Polanco-Rodríguez {{was raised}} in Manhattan after his family immigrated legally in 1969. According to the DEA, in 1982 Polanco-Rodriguez began {{developing}} a small group that sold high quality cocaine outside his apartment near the corner of Audubon Avenue and West 174th Street. American and Dominican law enforcement officials have different theories about how he began selling crack. One is that Jamaican gang members he helped organize {{introduced him to the}} drug in June 1985, a few months after it first appeared in Los Angeles. Another theory is that the Medellín Cartel in Colombia recognized Polanco-Rodriguez's marketing talents and taught him how to cook the drug. Yet another theory is that while on vacation in the Dominican Republic he accidentally created the drug and had his drug addict brother smoke it and began to sell it when he saw its effects. [...] He called his product Based Balls and merchandised the drug in heat-sealed <b>glassine</b> envelopes. His sellers offered discounts on the weekends and distributed business cards inscribed with Cop and Go. While doing this, he was building an empire in the Dominican Republic, hiring elderly women to hand-carry cash back to Santo Domingo. He laundered his profits through a wire-transfer storefront in Washington Heights as well as through a pharmacy, a nightclub and a finance company he set up in his homeland.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Glassine</b> is also {{recommended}} {{for protecting the}} surface of stored acrylic paintings. Philatelists use <b>glassine</b> envelopes to store stamps, and stamp hinges are made of <b>glassine.</b> Amateur insect collectors use <b>glassine</b> envelopes to store specimens temporarily in the field before they are mounted in a collection. Entomologists collecting for research may likewise use such envelopes to store whole specimens in the field. <b>Glassine</b> envelopes are used to carry pharmacy reformulated drugs and illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin.In the mid-20th century, potato chips were packaged in <b>glassine</b> bags. <b>Glassine</b> {{is also used to}} pack firecrackers, as it is moisture resistant. It is used for its transparent qualities to fold origami tessellations. <b>Glassine</b> is an outer covering on paperboard tubes, particularly those used in model rocketry, for water protection.

50|$|Greaseproof {{paper is}} paper that is {{impermeable}} to oil or grease and is normally used in cooking or food packaging. Normally greaseproof paper {{is produced by}} refining the paper stock and thus create a sheet with very low porosity. This sheet is supercalendered to further improve the density, creating a paper called <b>glassine.</b> The <b>glassine</b> is treated with starches, alginates or CMC in a size press to fill pores or treat the paper chemically to make it fat repellent. Basis weights are usually 30-50 g/m².|$|E
5000|$|Stockbooks {{consist of}} a number of stiff pages, made up with {{horizontal}} pockets of manilla paper, <b>glassine</b> paper or clear film, into which stamps are placed. Collectors can insert stamps side by side in a row or can overlap stamps when individual viewing is not necessary. The pages, usually double-sided, are bound into book form. The most popular sizes comprise between 4 and 32 double-sided pages with each page interleaved with a <b>glassine,</b> or clear, sheet to prevent stamps on adjacent pages from touching.|$|E
