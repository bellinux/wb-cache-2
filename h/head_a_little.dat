500|$|Mrs. Davis {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of her husband's capture as described below: [...] "Just before day the enemy charged our camp yelling like demons... I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off I threw over his <b>head</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the show, Lana Lang is {{characterized}} as the girl next door. As Kreuk describes her, she is the [...] "beautiful, popular girl who is really lonely". She has a [...] "hole in her heart", because of the loss of her parents, and feels empathy for everyone. Kristin feels that deep down the character is a [...] "tough girl", and that Lex manages to bring that side of her out more. For instance, he convinces her to fight back against a rival coffee shop that is spreading rumors about The Talon â€“ the coffee shop that she joint owns with Lex. Unfortunately, that tough side is not seen in the first season. According to Kreuk, the character was never placed in situations where she could show her outgoing side, because she was left to communicate primarily with Whitney and Clark. Kreuk thinks that Lana [...] "lived in her <b>head</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit"; she was intelligent enough to read classical books, but would also read romantic novels [...] "on the sly".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Gus {{installing}} a surveillance camera into the meth lab {{stemmed from the}} idea of Walter and Gus employing what Gilligan called [...] "brinkmanship and gamesmanship" [...] against each other after their falling {{out at the end of}} the third season. Gilligan commented: [...] "What's one way Gus can amp up the story there? How can he mess with Walt's <b>head</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit?" [...] The footage shown from the first-person perspective of the camera is actual footage from the real camera, including the numbers shown at the top and bottom of the screen. This is why that shot is shown in pillarbox and in lower quality than the rest of the episode, which was shot in 35 mm film. The episode features a subplot with Marie engaging in acts of kleptomania, which had been a major part of her character during the first season. Catlin said it was conceived early on that Marie would act this way while brainstorming the ideas for Marie coping with Hank's difficult recovery. Gilligan described Marie's acts of stealing as a respite for her: [...] "She's looking for another life, but she's not actively ready to leave her husband or anything like that. ... We liked the quirkiness of it." [...] Betsy Brandt said [...] "Open House" [...] was her favorite episode of the season to shoot.|$|E

2500|$|Woodbury {{achieved}} one of {{her last}} triumphs when on 7 August 1914, [...] "in {{one of the most}} important ... incidents of the year", she towed to safety the steamer Bay State, which, with 250 passengers and a crew of 104, had run aground [...] "in a very exposed position" [...] at Portland <b>Head.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> under a year later, on 19 July 1915, Woodbury was placed out of commission, a few months after the creation of the United States Coast Guard, and a few days before the commission of her $225,000 replacement [...] Woodburys decommission ended a remarkable 51 years with the Revenue Cutter Service, making her one of the longest serving cutters in the organization's history.|$|E

6000|$|Now, it was evident, as Miss Knag laughed, that {{something}} {{struck her as}} being exceedingly funny; and as the young ladies took their tone from Miss Knag--she being the chief--they all got up a laugh without a moment's delay, and nodded their <b>heads</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and smiled sarcastically to each other, as much as to say how very good that was! ...|$|R

They spent all their spare time {{stealing}} at St. Winifred's, when they weren't praying or getting drunk at pubs. Well, that was only a week ago, and the <b>Head's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit shy of us. He called it constructive deviltry. Stalky invented it all." ...|$|R
