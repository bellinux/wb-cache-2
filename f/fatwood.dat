A few decent natural tinders are birch bark, cedar bark, and <b>fatwood,</b> where available; followed by dead, dry pine needles or grass; a more comprehensive list is given in the article on tinder. Though not natural, steel wool makes excellent tinder and can be started with steel and flint, or a 9 volt battery without difficulty.|$|E

50|$|Coniferous tree sap is a viscous liquid, that {{contains}} terpene, a volatile hydrocarbon. Over time the evaporation of the terpene changes {{the state of}} the sap; it slowly gets thicker until it hardens into resin. New <b>fatwood</b> leaks the sticky sap, while in aged <b>fatwood</b> the sap has hardened and is no longer sticky. At every stage of the aging process, <b>fatwood</b> will burn readily, even when wet.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{uses for}} <b>fatwood</b> include {{production}} of turpentine; when <b>fatwood</b> is cooked {{down in a}} fire kiln, the heavier resin product that results is pine tar. The steam that vaporizes from this process is turned into a liquid that becomes turpentine.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} use of <b>fatwood</b> from stumps stemmed from its {{use to make}} pitch and pine tar. In 1648, a company was formed in Sweden called Norrländska Tjärkompaniet (The Wood Tar Company of North Sweden), and was given exclusive export rightspinetar - see separate topic- not <b>fatwood</b> by the King of Sweden.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{flammability}} of terpene, <b>fatwood</b> is prized {{for use as}} kindling {{in starting}} fires. It lights quickly even when wet, is very wind resistant, and burns hot enough to light larger pieces of wood. A small piece of <b>fatwood</b> can be used many times to create tinder by shaving small curls and using them to light other larger tinder.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fatwood,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "fat lighter," [...] "lighter wood," [...] "rich lighter," [...] "pine knot," [...] "lighter knot," [...] "heart pine" [...] or [...] "lighter'd", {{is derived from the}} {{heartwood}} of pine trees. This resin-impregnated heartwood becomes hard and rot-resistant. The stump (and tap root) left in the ground after a tree has fallen or has been cut is an excellent source of <b>fatwood.</b> Other locations, such as the joints where limbs intersect the trunk, can also be harvested. Although most resinous pines can produce <b>fatwood,</b> in the southeastern United States the wood is commonly associated with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), which historically was highly valued for its high pitch production.|$|E

50|$|There {{are between}} 105 and 125 species {{classified}} as resinous pine trees around the world. Species usable for <b>fatwood</b> are distributed across a range including Eurasia, where {{they range from}} the Canary Islands, Iberian Peninsula and Scotland east to the Russian Far East. From the Philippines, Norway, Finland and Sweden (Scots Pine), and eastern Siberia (Siberian Dwarf Pine), and south to northernmost Africa. From the Himalaya and Southeast Asia, with one species (Sumatran Pine) just crossing the Equator in Sumatra,. In North America, they range from 66°N in Canada (Jack Pine), to Central America to 12°N in Nicaragua (Caribbean Pine). The highest diversity in the genus occurs in Mexico and California. In the sub-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, including Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, where the trees are not indigenous but were introduced. Anywhere there is a pine tree or pine stump, there can be <b>fatwood</b> {{that can be found}} on top of the ground, but is more concentrated and preserved in stumps.|$|E

5000|$|The stumps and taproots of old trees become {{saturated}} with resin {{and will not}} rot. Farmers sometimes find old buried stumps in fields, even in some that were cleared a century ago, and these usually are dug up and sold as <b>Fatwood,</b> [...] "fat lighter" [...] or [...] "lighter wood" [...] which is in demand as kindling for fireplaces, wood stoves, and barbecue pits. In old growth pine the heartwood of the bole is often saturated in the same way. When boards are cut from the fat lighter wood, they are very heavy and will not rot, but buildings constructed of them are quite flammable and make extremely hot fires.|$|E
50|$|In the United States {{the pine}} tree, Pinus palustris, {{known as the}} Longleaf pine, once covered as much as 90000000 acre but due to clear cutting was reduced by between 95% and 97%. The trees grow very large (up to 150 feet), taking 100 to 150 years to mature and can live up to 500 years. The wood was prized and cutting {{resulted}} in many {{hundreds of thousands of}} stumps that are very resinous, do not rot, and eventually become <b>fatwood.</b> This ushered in a new industry for many years. There is still a market for the wood, but supplies are less abundant. Due to the length of growing time, the Pinus taeda, also called the Loblolly pine, replaced it for commercial replanting, with a maturity of only 38 to 45 years.|$|E
5000|$|Pitchwood is the {{resinous}} wood which decays last from dead conifers. It {{can be found}} on the ground where conifer tree trunks have fallen and decayed. The parts of the deadwood that would form the knots in lumber, i.e. the places where branches entered the trunk, are impregnated with resin which has the combustibility of wood soaked in lighter fluid. Pitchwood can also be found in the stumps left in the ground when conifers die. These stumps contain spires of resin-impregnated wood, called <b>fatwood,</b> which can easily be lighted using only a single match or lighter. By shaving the pitchwood into small splinters, it will readily ignite. Pitchwood does not absorb water, and so will ignite in any weather when sheltered from rain and wind. In the southeastern United States, it is called [...] "fat lighter" [...] or [...] "lighter'd" [...] (a shortening of lighter-wood).|$|E
