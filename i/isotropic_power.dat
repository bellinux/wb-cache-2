The observations show that the cross-shock potential jump correlates well with the shock strength but shows very little correlation with other shock parameters. Assuming that the electrons obey an <b>isotropic</b> <b>power</b> law equation of state, the correlation of the potential jump with the shock strength follows naturally from the increased shock compression and an apparent dependence of the power law exponent on the Mach number which the observations indicate. It is found that including a Mach number dependence for the power law exponent in the electron equation of state in the simple model produces a potential jump which better fits the observations.

Simple estimates of the scattering of 3. 11 kHz radiation from electron density fluctuations indicate that, if the radiation had originated from the distance of the heliopause, the scattering would be so large that no roll modulation should be observed. Here we show that these earlier scattering estimates were too high because they ignored the latitude variation of scattering and the inner scale of the electron density fluctuation spectrum. With these two effects properly included the expected scattering is consistent with the observations and the postulate that the radiation originates from near the nose of the heliosphere. 1...|$|E

The framework is applied to an <b>isotropic</b> <b>power</b> hardening plasticity using real load/displacement data from multiple steel buckling tests. M. J. D.

As a consequence the estimate of the global minimum is sensitive to the amount of experimental data and experimental noise. The framework includes the verification step, where the estimate of the global minimum is verified on a different geometry and loading. A tensile test was used for verification in this work.

For short time the tempered Lévy fight exhibits the dynamics of Lévy fight while after sufficiently long time it turns to normal diffusion. The generator of tempered β-stable Lévy process is the tempered fractional Laplacian (Δ+λ) ^β/ 2 [W. H. Deng, B. Y. Li, W. Y. Tian, and P. W. Zhang, Multiscale Model. Simul., in press, 2017].

These Jets are most powerful at Supernova birth, blazing, once on axis, to us and flashing GRB detector. The trembling of the thin jet (spinning, precessing, bent by magnetic fields) explains naturally the observed erratic multi-explosive structure of different GRBs and its rare re-brightening. The jets are precessing (by binary companion or inner disk asymmetry) and decaying by power law on time scales to a few hours. GRB blazing occurs inside the observer cone of view only a seconds duration times; because relativistic synchrotron (or IC) laws the jet angle is thinner in gamma but wider in X band.
