First, the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>holism</b> advocates a transformative approach to learning. Rather than seeing education as a process of transmission and transaction, transformative learning involves a change in the frames of reference that a person may have. This change may include points of view, habits of mind, and worldviews. Holism understands knowledge as something that is constructed by the context in which a person lives. Therefore, teaching students to reflect critically on how we come to know or understand information is essential. As a result, if [...] "we ask students to develop critical and reflective thinking skills and encourage them to care about the world around them they may decide that some degree of personal or social transformation is required." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{policies}} and practices of early childhood teaching in Aotearoa New Zealand have been an ongoing site of political, economic, social and cultural contestation. Competing values and beliefs regarding experiences of both {{the child and the}} teacher have been central to the contesting. Helen May (2001, 2009) tracks these tensions through the waxing and waning of particular landscapes or paradigms, each of which can be seen to have contributed to the growth of the early childhood sector, its purpose, operations, manifestations, and its arguably tenuous cohesion as an educational sector. This paper provides a brief overview of the various paradigms, their purposes, and their spheres of influence (recognising that other papers in this special issue will contribute to a very detailed picture of early childhood education in Aotearoa) before analysing the discourses of child health in relation to the early childhood curriculum. Health is woven into the strands and principles of Te Whāriki (Ministry of Education [MoE], 1996). Yet, this paper questions whether teachers and student teachers are attuned to what it means to have health as {{a key part of the}} curriculum, and explores whether health is a marginal consideration in the curriculum. The paper engages Foucault’s work, exploring tensions between pedagogical and medical disciplines in relation to the professionalisation of early childhood teaching. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>holism</b> is then discussed as an approach to early childhood education curriculum discussions with reference to the participatory approaches to the development of Te Whāriki...|$|E

5000|$|For various reasons, {{many parents}} today {{are looking to}} {{alternative}} schools that offer different philosophies of education than mainstream schools. The diversity of alternative schools sets them apart from mainline education. Each school has its own methods and approaches to teaching. Therefore, each alternative school may have different beliefs about what education should include. Consequently, there are several types of alternative schools that have holistic values in their philosophies of education. While these schools have elements <b>of</b> <b>holism</b> incorporated in their values {{it would be fair}} to say that these schools could be placed on a continuum on how [...] "holistic" [...] they actually are (that is to say, some would have more holistic elements than others). Also, public and other types of private schools do not appear in the following list but that does not mean that there are no holistic values in their individual philosophies of education.

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to map the history of holistic education because many feel that the core <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>holism</b> are not new but [...] "timeless and found {{in the sense of}} wholeness in humanity's religious impetus". On the other hand, the roots of holistic education {{can be traced back to}} several major contributors. Originating theorists include Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Thoreau, Bronson Alcott, Johann Pestalozzi, Friedrich Fröbel, and Francisco Ferrer. More recent theorists are Rudolf Steiner, Maria Montessori, Francis Parker, John Dewey, John Caldwell Holt, George Dennison Kieran Egan, Howard Gardner, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Carl Jung, Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, Paul Goodman, Ivan Illich, and Paulo Freire. With the <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> these pioneers in mind, many feel that the core <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> holistic education did not truly take form until the cultural paradigm shift that began in the 1960s.

40|$|For {{almost three}} decades 'holistic health care' has been a widely invoked term. It is called upon as an {{antidote}} to mechanistic science, as justification for the use of alternative therapies, as instruction to good practice and even as a boundary marker in establishing professional identity. In the service of these intentions it has assumed various meanings. The first aim {{of this study is to}} identify from the literature, the illusion of shared meaning that saturates this term and to expose the implications of this lack of clarity. The elusive nature of the meanings attributed to holism and the problem of determining an appropriate method of pursuing these meanings is addressed. A particular understanding of conceptual analysis and practical reasoning are defended as adequate tools. The group of ideas from which the term holism can be distinguished, individualism, dualism and reductionism, form the context of the examination of understandings of wholeness. Eight distinctions of wholeness are examined and the common conceptual feature of 'purpose' is suggested. This requires considerable justification which is provided by an exploration of the notion of 'partness'. Recourse to the seminal work of Smuts (1926) is sought and the derivation of the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>holism</b> from evolution theory is explored. A key understanding explored is the nature of emergent properties and their role in the holistic doctrine, 'the whole is more than the sum of the parts'. Employment of the word holism in social science, philosophy, and biology is examined and a number of fallacies about holism exposed. With a somewhat clearer understanding of holism, and a working notion of wholeness, theories of health are discussed as contenders for a philosophical basis for 'holistic health care'. While several show some congruence, it is argued that the Foundations Theory of Health can be shown to demonstrate the characteristics of work for wholeness identified in this work. The conclusion that holistic health care is in essence working creatively with incipient wholes, is explained and justified by a discussion about how a health worker might become more holistic in her practice...|$|E
40|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ???<b>holism???</b> is {{generally}} {{described as a}} contextual framework in which any given ???whole??? is understood as {{more than the sum}} of its various parts. The ideology of holism is herein defined in a precise formulaic manner as a composite conception consisting of (a) an initial notion of a given One or Whole, (b) a conception of the One as emanating, producing or subdividing into Many various parts, and (c) an interrelation or Harmony of all parts within a given totality. This tripartite formula may be universally recognized independent of the context in which it is framed, e. g., in terms of the natural phenomenal world, abstract principles or ideals, or mythic thought. Yet this whole-system model is not new but is implicit in the most ancient, revered worldviews articulated across different cultures, and which I have elected to call a ???sacred aesthetic???. While the etymology of the term ???holism??? originated with the Greek holos translated as whole, entire, complete, all, the philosophical principles that underpin this ideology can be traced even further back to the distant past of ancient Egypt. This thesis provides an analysis of early documented sources of holistic thought starting with the familiar Western philosophical tradition of Plato, then following earlier strains of this ideology back to the kosmos of the ancient Greek physikoi or natural philosophers, the abstract mathematical reasoning of Pythagorean thought, and ultimately the symbolic mythopoeic cosmogonies of the ancient Egyptians. The fundamental premises of holism are thus demonstrated to be shared, core concepts that may be commuted across disciplines, cultures or historical periods. The establishment of common ground provides a foundation for comparative philosophical analysis and discourse across diverse contexts. More specifically, this thesis presents a unique recognition of this ancient underlying model that opens up a connective dialogue between both Greek philosophy and the earlier roots of holistic philosophy in ancient Egypt, whereby each can be seen to complement the other while simultaneously demonstrating parallels between analytic, metaphoric, and symbolic visual expressions...|$|E
50|$|Collectivism {{is often}} portrayed as the polar {{opposite}} of individualism, the economic, political, social or cultural {{autonomy of the}} individual within society; but given the different interpretations of individualism, from egocentric perspectives to more integrative ones, this apparent opposition is not necessarily true. For example, worker cooperatives operate on a collective basis but require the direct input of each individual member. While the <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>holism</b> posit that a sum is greater than its parts, this does not necessarily imply that a collectivity is greater or {{more powerful than the}} individuals that make it up, but instead that the collective energies of all individuals involved produce something that goes beyond each person (whereas, in authoritarian collectivities, power accrues to a person or group who is supposed to embody the collective). Theoretically, collectivism goes beyond considering the individual as the prime mover of society, but instead considers the numerous associations individuals voluntarily form as society's basis. In doing so it recognizes society as a collection of individuals and so remains with the understanding that any collective organization is fundamentally composed of individuals.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author tries {{to examine the}} {{background}} of the contemporary destruction of natural environment. Even a superficial analysis suggests that the problem of destruction of life on Earth, which is especially noticeable in the context of Western societies, is not just a problem that could be looked up in one dimension or horizon (for example, economical or political), but it requests deeper analysis of cultural and scientific models which lie down in the very bottom of phenomenon of destruction. Therefore the author analyzes the concept of knowledge as a basis of Western science. The central <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> this paper is that the knowledge, which is founded up on mechanicism, particular approach and commercial imperative, is necessarily destructive. This kind of destruction can be seen in destruction of natural environment which is, in the same time, the destruction of cultural patterns. Consequently, a new paradigm of knowledge should be made and it should be founded up on the <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>holism,</b> integrative thinking and respect for the life. The author suggests that the new paradigm could be developed in the framework of integrative bioethics which offers thematic and methodological potential of binding many diverse areas of intellectual work. Integrative bioethics also opens a possibility of activism which is essentially important for effective solving of problems of destruction of life...|$|R

"May 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Populations in the Sahel are among the most vulnerable to climate change and variability (CCV). The increased temperatures and rainfall variability predicted by General Circulation Models (GCM) threaten Sahel livelihoods by exacerbating aridity and existing environmental, political, and economic challenges. In addition to the broader issues of poverty and environmental degradation, lack of awareness of the problem contributes to regional vulnerability. This project explores local awareness of environmental change to evaluate the vulnerability of the Futa Tooro, a Sahel region in Northern Senegal, to climate change. Using semi-structured open-ended interviews of four Futa villages, local understanding of CCV and perceptions of ongoing environmental changes was investigated to gauge potential for local adaptation strategies that effectively accommodate the experienced change. Details concerning the sources for environmental knowledge are also gathered to identify factors influencing local perception of and response to environmental change. Participant responses show diverse explanations of causes for currently perceived environment changes, although explanations are consistently attributed to <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>holism</b> and the fatalism of Allah's will.

5000|$|Since {{the concept}} <b>of</b> {{semantic}} <b>holism,</b> as explained above, {{is often used}} to refer to theories of meaning in natural languages but also to theories of mental content such as the hypothesis of a language of thought, the question often arises as to how to reconcile the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> semantic <b>holism</b> (in the sense of the meanings of expressions in mental languages) with the phenomenon called externalism in philosophy of mind. Externalism is the thesis that the propositional attitudes of an individual are determined, at least in part, by her relations with her environment (both social and natural). Hilary Putnam formulated the thesis of the natural externalism of mental states in his The Meaning of [...] "Meaning". In it, he described his famous thought experiment involving Twin Earths: two individuals, Calvin and Carvin, live, respectively, on the real earth (E) of our everyday experience and on an exact copy (E') with the only difference being that on E [...] "water" [...] stands for the substance [...] while on E' it stands for some substance macroscopically identical to water but which is actually composed of XYZ. According to Putnam, only Calvin has genuine experiences that involve water, so only his term [...] "water" [...] really refers to water.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{attempts}} {{to give some}} substance to local holism, a picture that seems to fit Wittgenstein’s analysis of the working of language. Any form <b>of</b> <b>holism</b> has to solve the well-known paradox <b>of</b> semantic <b>holism,</b> as discussed in philosophy of language: if meaning is holistic there is no possibility of sharing meaning. In the paper I show different answers to this paradox, from atomism to different forms <b>of</b> molecularism and <b>holism.</b> In this quick overview, I try to check {{to what extent the}} different answers to the paradox are coherent with the main <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> later//the second/ / Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein seems to be far from the global holistic thinker he is often considered to be; his ideas are more akin to a form <b>of</b> local <b>holism.</b> However, for local holism to work, even in Wittgenstein's case we need some general restrictions given by rules to navigate across contexts. 1. What Quine and Davidson took from Wittgenstein and the paradox <b>of</b> <b>holism.</b> The work <b>of</b> Wittgenstein is apparently characterized by a strong attitude towards a holistic view of language. Even in Tractatus logico-philosophicus- considered a program for logical atomism- we find reference to Frege's context principle: names have meaning only {{in the context of a}} sentence (TLP 3. 3).

5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> semantic <b>holism,</b> in spite <b>of</b> the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, {{it is impossible to}} understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|R
40|$|This thesis assesses whether communitarian {{critique}} {{can still}} inform contemporary liberal political theory. The {{suggestion is that}} although liberalism has correctly rejected calls for a politics of 'community', it has ignored one important aspect of that critique, namely emphasis on the social embeddedness of the individual. Investigation of this hypothesis proceeds in two stages. The first involves reconsideration of the liberal-communitarian debate {{in the light of}} Charles Taylor's distinction between ontological and normative issues. This reveals how the arguments for social embeddedness (or ontological holism) fit in with more traditional appeals to community. Further analysis <b>of</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ontological <b>holism</b> emphasises the potentially philosophical or empirical character of holist claims. The second stage of the argument ascertains whether liberal theory should heed communitarianism's recommendation of a more holist approach. Analysis of liberal texts reveals that liberal theorists already do adopt such an approach, however they do so in a piecemeal fashion, and generally without reference to supporting empirical evidence. Given the assumption that liberal theory is not expressly Utopian, some attention to limiting empirical factors would seem to be required. To back up this claim a case-study of liberal tolerance is undertaken, comparing the theoretical and social psychological accounts of inter-group toleration and its development. This comparison reveals that liberal tolerance is too narrow in scope, failing to absorb some of the most virulent forms of inter-group antagonism (such as gender- or race-based antipathy). Further, social psychological study shows that socially intolerant attitudes may be at least as harmful as, political ones, as they undermine the development of self-respect. Overall, important conclusions are reached as to the theoretical changes required of liberalism if it is to adopt a more thoroughly holist approach. Attention to the operation of factors at the localised rather than national level is vital, as is attention to empirical detail. Thus the 'politics of locality' complements traditional focus on the nation-state. </p...|$|R
