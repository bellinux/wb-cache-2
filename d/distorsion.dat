40|$|Physico-chemical and {{immunological}} {{studies have}} been done in order to further characterize the <b>distorsions</b> induced in DNA by the interstrand cross-links formed between the antitumor drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cis-DDP) and two guanines on the opposite strands of DNA at the d(GC/GC) sites. Bending (45 degrees) and unwinding (79 +/- 4 degrees) were determined from the electrophoretic mobility of multimers of 21 - 24 -base pairs double-stranded oligonucleotides containing an interstrand cross-link in the central sequence d(TGCT/AGCA). The <b>distorsions</b> induced by the interstrand cross-link in the three 22 -base pairs oligonucleotides d(TGCT/AGCA), d(AGCT/AGCT) and d(CGCT/AGCG) were compared by means of gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism, phenanthroline-copper footprinting and antibodies specifically directed against cis-DDP interstrand cross-links. The four different technical approaches indicate that the <b>distorsions</b> are independent of the chemical nature of the base pairs adjacent to the interstrand cross-link. The general conclusion is that the interstrand cross-link induces a bending and in particular an unwinding larger than other platinum adducts and the <b>distorsions</b> are independent {{of the nature of the}} bases (purine or pyrimidine) adjacent to the d(GC/GC) site...|$|R

Accuracy of rectification was checked by use of stereo aerial photographs in terms of residual y-parallaxes. The result showed residual y-parallaxes of ± 1 pixel (± 50 μm) and sometimes ± 2 pixels were observed.
