5|$|In {{his review}} of the Director's Cut, IGN's Brian Albert, despite noting {{inconsistencies}} in enemy behavior, shared much of his praised with the original version {{in addition to the}} added gameplay mechanics and improved boss battles. GameSpot's VanOrd again noted dated facial animations and poor AI, but generally praised other aspects of the Director's Cut, particularly pointing out the improvements to boss battles. Bramwell, again writing for Eurogamer, particularly praised the revamped boss battles and the inclusion of additional content such as The Missing Link that did not function properly as a standalone release. He also echoed much of his praise for the original game. Michael <b>Gapper</b> of Official Nintendo Magazine stated that all the changes made to the game for the Director's Cut had improved it for the better, praising its gameplay balance and freedom of choice in addition to the new features.|$|E
500|$|In a {{commentary}} in the Financial Times entitled [...] "Olympus's deceit was dishonourable", John <b>Gapper</b> noted that [...] "It {{is still possible}} {{to believe that the}} accused trio of directors... thought they were behaving honourably... failure discreetly and not to make their predecessors lose face." [...] He noted that accounting scandals were not uniquely Japanese, but that it was [...] "a nice piece of corporate satire to conceal losses by exploiting the widespread habit of paying too much for acquisitions and writing them down [...] the 'advisory fee' was especially creative". <b>Gapper</b> criticised the weakness in governance, particularly how 12 out of 15 directors were either executives or former executives of the company, and that Hideo Yamada, head of the Audit Board, was complicit in the scam. He also noted that auditors KPMG and Ernst & Young would have to answer tough questions about why the manipulation was never discovered or properly questioned.|$|E
500|$|The {{generic name}} {{is derived from}} the Greek words ancistro (hooked) and [...] odon [...] (tooth), and the {{specific}} name comes from the Latin [...] piscis (fish) and voro (to eat); thus, the scientific name translates into [...] "hooked-tooth fish-eater". Common names include variants on water moccasin, swamp moccasin, black moccasin, cottonmouth, <b>gapper,</b> or simply viper. Many of the common names refer to the threat display, where this species will often stand its ground and gape at an intruder, exposing the white lining of its mouth. Three subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.|$|E
5000|$|The Very Persistent <b>Gappers</b> of Frip, George Saunders (McSweeney's, 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|In 2000, George Saunders wrote The Very Persistent <b>Gappers</b> of Frip. The children’s story {{tells the}} tale of a young girl named Capable, and her struggles to find how to survive when her {{monetary}} substance is emaciated and her neighbors refuse to offer her help. This essay is an examination of <b>Gappers</b> through multiple lenses: through the criticism of Saunders’ work, theoretical concepts applied to <b>Gappers,</b> and through the pedagogical morality that is presented. This three-prong analysis first reviews previous criticism on Saunders’ work to create the framework through which to understand Saunders as an author. The critical analyses of Saunders’ works reveals similar themes class struggle, reality, and human relationships. After discussing previous criticism, the essay addresses the simulacra, proposed by Baudrillard and applied in the criticism, as a key theoretical concept that informs how Capable constructs her reality within <b>Gappers,</b> and, more importantly, how Capable retains meaning within that reality. The final section of this essay considers the different pedagogical impacts <b>Gappers</b> might have on both children and adults. While adult readers may more easily pick up on Saunders’ themes of class struggle, children are more receptacle to Gappers’ themes of friendship, forgiveness, and literacy...|$|R

500|$|Competitive {{multiplayer}} {{was well}} received by critics. [...] Chris Watters of GameSpot welcomed the new armor abilities and gameplay tweaks introduced in multiplayer. [...] He praised the continuing robustness of Custom Game options and {{the accessibility of}} level editing in Forge. [...] CVG's <b>Gapper</b> stated that the new scoring system alone made Halo 4 multiplayer {{the best in the}} series, emphasising that recognition for assists and completing objective tasks was a positive change. [...] Polygon writer, Arthur Gies, said that the new game mode Dominion was the best addition to Halo multiplayer since the introduction of Xbox Live. [...] He also thought that the multiplayer component was more approachable to people outside of the core player-base without dumbing anything down.|$|E
500|$|The weaving of a storyline {{with its}} {{missions}} made Project Sylpheed unique; shooters rarely did so. TeamXbox's Andy Eddy called the story [...] "absolutely {{the best part}} of the game", and several of his colleagues agreed. [...] The focus on relationships made it more complex and easier to relate to than those found in other shooters, and Halverson praised the game for lacing a [...] "mission-based space opera" [...] with [...] "real emotion". [...] Again, differing opinions are not uncommon; Hardcore Gamers Thomas Wilde was disappointed to find the game akin to an exaggerated science-fiction soap opera. [...] Others found the story clichéd and uninteresting, especially for those who have watched plenty of [...] "Japanese video game drama". [...] According to Dahlen, it is a [...] "story of warring fleets of strippers and Muppet-boys determined to wipe each other out of the galaxy." [...] <b>Gapper</b> wished that the story's cutscenes stop interrupting his enjoyment of shooting the enemies.|$|E
500|$|... 1UP.com {{reviewer}} Jose Otero {{was critical}} of Halo 4s story, writing that {{the ending of the}} game [...] "doesn't make a lot of sense". He also remarked that while the narrative tied the main plot lines together well, it was disappointing {{to see some of the}} smaller story points were ignored entirely. Both G4 and Official Xbox Magazine agreed that the plot became convoluted on occasions and might be difficult to understand for new players of the franchise. [...] G4 reviewer, Adam Rosenburg, also stated that while the soundtrack had some memorable moments, he was disappointed that composer Neil Davidge had chosen to ditch the familiar theme of previous games. [...] Michael <b>Gapper</b> of Computer and Video Games drew a comparison between Halo 4 and Halo 2. [...] He stated that the hardware limitations of the Xbox 360 had negatively impacted Halo 4s campaign, in the same way that they had throttled Bungie's ambitions for Halo 2 on the original Xbox. He explained that although the game was visually stunning, this had detracted from the scale and spectacle that was present in Halo 3s campaign. He found the spaces within the campaign to be narrow and constrained which led to a lack of tactical options in encounters.|$|E

500|$|The 1980s was {{a period}} of fast growth for the video game industry. [...] The shooter genre was enjoyed by gamers, who loved its fast paced action and high score boards that allowed them to compete with each other. [...] Influential shooters, such as R-Type and Radiant Silvergun, {{revolutionized}} the genre by introducing new elements to the gameplay. [...] Although not as innovative, Silpheed won critical acclaim and attracted a following by allowing players to customize their ships' weapons. [...] The popularity of shooters began to wane in the 1990s as gamers turned their attention to video games that featured the latest technology3D computer graphics. [...] Members of the industry believed the genre was about to fade into obscurity or already in the throes of its demise. [...] Project Sylpheeds announcement gave them pause and led them to wonder if the new game would rejuvenate the genre. Project Sylpheed lets players fly starfighters and dogfight many enemies in the vastness of space; however, G4tv's reviewer, David Francis Smith, said that the game's designers had [...] "no idea how to create structured, intelligible action in such a big area." [...] Several of his colleagues agreed, finding the game flawed in the design of its missions. [...] They were disappointed that most missions, in the words of Xbox Worlds Michael <b>Gapper,</b> tasked them to [...] "fly, shoot, rearm, [...] shoot more" [...] endlessly. [...] Reviewers were also irked that they were not informed about the secondary objectives in a mission; the goals were only revealed after the reviewers had completed them unawares. [...] Further frustration arose from the fact that certain time limits were only displayed on nearing expiration. [...] Other reviewers had no qualms with these flaws, stating that the intense dogfights more than compensate such shortcomings; Game Informers Andrew Reiner wrote that the [...] "rewarding quick-trigger combat and thrill of overcoming the worst of odds makes Project Sylpheed a memorable play for gamers who daydream of galaxies far, far away." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 November, protesters held [...] "Bank Transfer Day", marching on {{banks and}} other {{financial}} institutions to urge Americans to move their money from big corporate banks to smaller community credit unions. It was reported that an estimated 600,000 people took their money out of major banks. On 11 November, Remembrance Day in Canada, police forcibly removed tents from Victoria Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia and arrested 15 protestors. On the night of 14 November, a coordinated crackdown was undertaken by authorities around the world, with several camps being forcibly cleared including Zuccotti Park in New York, Oakland, Oregon, Denver and Zurich. For {{some of the other}} camps such as the one at St Pauls in London, no physical action was taken, but on 15 November authorities stepped up legal action to gain authorization for a forcible eviction. Financial Times editor Richard Lambert suggested that the shift to confrontational tactics by authorities {{would be more likely to}} spur on the movement rather than cause it to disband. However, John <b>Gapper,</b> chief business commentator at the FT, offered a different view. <b>Gapper</b> said that it may be advantageous that the camps were being closed down, as they were beginning to alienate even members of the public who were initially fully sympathetic with the movement. During a demonstration at UC Davis on 18 November 2011, campus police Lieutenant John Pike used pepper spray on seated students. The incident drew national attention and led to further demonstrations, petitions, and calls for Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi to resign. (See: UC Davis pepper-spray incident) On 22 November, occupiers mic checked President Obama to draw his attention to the treatment they had received from the police, including thousands of arrests.|$|E
