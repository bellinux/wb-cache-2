2500|$|The Federal Reserve {{plays a role}} in the nation's {{retail and}} {{wholesale}} payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clientsindividuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the <b>Fedwire</b> Funds Service and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the <b>Fedwire</b> Securities Service.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Fedwire</b> is {{real-time}} {{gross settlement}} (RTGS) system that operates from 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to 6:30 p.m and allows its subscribing 11,000 institutions to transfer funds. [...] The <b>Fedwire</b> service is {{operated by the}} Federal Reserve Information Technology (FRIT) facility at EROC. <b>Fedwire</b> also houses the primary (XRF) backup facility with the secondary backup facility in Richmond.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the <b>Fedwire</b> {{system which}} is part of a {{regulatory}} body, CHIPS is owned by the financial institutions that use it. For payments that are less time-sensitive in nature, banks typically prefer to use CHIPS instead of <b>Fedwire,</b> as CHIPS is less expensive (both by charges and by funds required). One of the reasons is that <b>Fedwire</b> is a real-time gross settlement system, while CHIPS allows payments to be netted.|$|E
50|$|The {{computer}} room {{was the first}} to house a <b>Fedwire</b> communications switch.|$|E
5000|$|UPICs {{only work}} for NACHA's Automated Clearing House (ACH) credit transactions. <b>Fedwire</b> credits cannot use UPICs.|$|E
50|$|CHIPS {{differs from}} the <b>Fedwire</b> payment system in three key ways. First, it is privately owned, whereas the Fed {{is part of a}} {{regulatory}} body. Second, it has 47 member participants (with some merged banks constituting separate participants), compared with 9,289 banking institutions (as of March 19, 2009) eligible to make and receive funds via <b>Fedwire.</b> Third, it is a netting engine (and hence, not real-time).|$|E
50|$|Formally {{known as}} the Federal Reserve Wire Network, <b>Fedwire</b> is a {{real-time}} gross settlement funds transfer system operated by the United States Federal Reserve Banks that enables financial institutions to electronically transfer funds between its more than 9,289 participants (as of March 19, 2009). Transfers can only be initiated by the sending bank once they receive the proper wiring instructions from the receiving bank. These instructions include: the receiving bank's routing number, account number, name and dollar amount being transferred. This information is submitted to the Fed via the <b>Fedwire</b> system. Once the instructions are received and processed, the Fed will debit the funds from the sending bank's reserve account and credit the receiving bank's account. Wire transfers sent via <b>Fedwire</b> are completed in the same day, while some are completed instantly.|$|E
5000|$|Institutional formal value {{transfer}} systems, e.g. SWIFT (International), domestic real-time {{gross settlement}} (RTGS) {{systems such as}} LVTS (Canada), <b>Fedwire</b> (USA), CHAPS (UK) ...|$|E
50|$|Domestic bank-to-bank {{transfers}} {{are conducted}} through the <b>Fedwire</b> system, which uses the Federal Reserve System and its assignment of routing transit number, which uniquely identify each bank.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sending bank}} transmits a message, via a secure system (such as SWIFT or <b>Fedwire),</b> to the {{receiving}} bank, requesting that it effect payment {{according to the}} instructions given.|$|E
5000|$|Non-immediate {{transfer}} of funds between accounts at different financial institutions (when a real-time transfer is required, a wire transfer using a system such as the Federal Reserve's <b>Fedwire</b> is employed instead) ...|$|E
50|$|The ABA RTN is {{necessary}} for the Federal Reserve Banks to process <b>Fedwire</b> funds transfers, and by the Automated Clearing House to process direct deposits, bill payments, and other such automated transfers.|$|E
50|$|Banks in the United States use SWIFT to send {{messages}} to notify banks {{in other countries}} that a payment has been made. Banks use the CHIPS or <b>Fedwire</b> system to actually effect the payment.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Fedwire</b> {{system has}} grown since its inception, seeing growth in both number of {{transfers}} and total transaction dollar value of about 79% and 207% respectively between 1996 and 2016. In 2016, roughly 148.1 million transfers were valued at $766.7 trillion dollars.|$|E
5000|$|FedACH is the Federal Reserve Banks' Automated Clearing House (ACH) service. In 2007, FedACH {{processed}} about 37 million transactions per {{day with}} an average aggregate value of about $58 billion. (For comparison, in 2007, <b>Fedwire</b> processed about 537,000 transfers per day valued at nearly $2.7 trillion.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, <b>Fedwire</b> was taxed to its limit {{with the result}} that it was often subject to [...] "throttle," [...] which means that it took {{messages}} from the banks more slowly than its normal speed. From a user's point of view, throttle was like being put on hold every time one sent a message to the Fed. In 1983, the Fed made a major upgrade of the automated system it uses to support <b>Fedwire.</b> Because the major banks could not tolerate a long breakdown in their computer operations, the Fed designed its internal systems so that the maximum down time for a breakdown would be limited to a few minutes or a few hours at most. In an effort to improve operational efficiency even more, in the 1990s, the Reserve Banks consolidated most mainframe computer operations and centralized certain payment applications. More recently, the Reserve Banks have taken advantage of the flexibility and efficiency that Internet protocol (IP) and distributed processing technologies offer. These technologies have improved reliability and efficiency of <b>Fedwire</b> greatly. Today, three data processing centers support the <b>Fedwire</b> services. One site supports the primary processing environment with on-site backup. A second site serves an active, [...] "hot" [...] backup facility with on-site backup. A third site serves as a [...] "warm" [...] backup facility. The three data processing centers are located a considerable distance from one another (i.e., hundreds of miles) in order to mitigate the effects of natural disasters, power and telecommunication outages, and other wide scale, regional disruptions. In addition, all three data processing centers have appropriate security and include various contingency features, such as redundant power feeds, environmental and emergency control systems, dual computer and network operations centers, and dual customer service centers.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} also {{housed the}} Culpeper Switch, {{which was the}} central switching station of the Federal Reserve's <b>Fedwire</b> electronic funds transfer system, {{which at the time}} connected only the Fed's member banks. The Culpeper Switch also served as a data backup point for member banks east of the Mississippi River.|$|E
50|$|More {{recently}} {{with the advancement}} in mobile technologies, many alternative modes of electronic funds transfers have emerged. These alternative modes are changing the way people make payments in that fewer and fewer people are using traditional banking methods to transfer money. Rather than transfer money from bank to bank, they are opting to transfer the funds directly to the other party via a mobile application. With fewer people using traditional banks, and fewer people transferring money from bank to bank, the volume of transactions going through <b>Fedwire</b> {{on a daily basis}} is also likely to decline. With this type of electronic funds transfers, corporations act much like the Fed by using their commercial bank accounts for processing and transferring payments between individuals. Many of these systems like PayPal, Venmo and Google Wallet are accessible on mobile devices and are much cheaper for consumers than a wire sent via the <b>Fedwire</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the {{daylight}} overdraft (also called intraday overdraft) {{is a system}} in which “allows qualifying banks to overdraw on their Federal Reserve accounts in order to make payments via <b>Fedwire.</b> Banks can acquire overdrafts throughout the day to make payments, but must ensure that their accounts are not in a negative position {{at the end of the}} day.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On September 13, 2010, the Financial Management Service {{started to}} use Credit Gateway as a deposit {{program for the}} receipt of federal agency <b>Fedwire</b> and Automated Clearing House credit transactions. It {{is an effort to}} {{modernize}} the collections and cash management programs of the US Department of the Treasury and is being implemented in multiple phases over the course of two years.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Reserve {{plays a role}} in the nation's {{retail and}} {{wholesale}} payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clientsindividuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the <b>Fedwire</b> Funds Service and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the <b>Fedwire</b> Securities Service. Because of the large amounts of funds that move through the Reserve Banks every day, the System has policies and procedures to limit the risk to the Reserve Banks from a depository institution's failure to make or settle its payments.|$|E
5000|$|CHIPS {{provides}} real-time, {{immediate and}} final settlement of payment messages continuously {{throughout the day}} similar to <b>Fedwire.</b> During the business day, system participants can send their payments to CHIPS. Funds are released by available funds on hand (no overdrafts are permitted) or through offsetting. A “Balance Release Algorithm” continuously searches the queue of unreleased payments and uses this patented off-setting algorithm to match and release payments.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Reserve {{established}} Mount Pony {{under the}} NPO where {{billions of dollars}} in currency was stored in a hardened bunker. The cash was to be used to restart the economy east of the Mississippi River in case of a nuclear war. The facility also housed the central switching center for the Federal Reserve's <b>Fedwire</b> system until 1988 when all money was removed, switching was decentralized, and the site deactivated as a NPO facility.|$|E
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), operated by The Clearing House Payments Company, a private company, <b>Fedwire</b> {{is the primary}} U.S. network for large-value or time-critical domestic and international payments, and {{it is designed to}} be highly resilient. In 2012, CHIPS was designated a systemically important financial market utility (SIFMU) under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, which means that CHIPS is subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Federal Reserve Board.|$|E
50|$|Another form of {{financial}} stress testing is the stress testing {{of financial}} infrastructure. As part of Central Banks' market infrastructure oversight functions, stress tests {{have been applied}} to payment and securities settlement systems. Since ultimately, the Banks need to meet their obligations in Central Bank money held in payment systems that are commonly operated or closely supervised by central banks(e.g. CHAPS, <b>FedWire,</b> Target2, which are {{also referred to as}} large value payment systems), it is of great interest to monitor these systems' participants' (mainly banks) liquidity positions.|$|E
50|$|The Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) is a United States private {{clearing}} house for large-value transactions. By 2015 it was settling well over US$1.5 trillion {{a day in}} around 250,000 interbank payments in cross border and domestic transactions. Together with the <b>Fedwire</b> Funds Service (which is operated by the Federal Reserve Banks), CHIPS forms the primary U.S. network for large-value domestic and international USD payments where it has a market share of around 96%. CHIPS transfers are governed by Article 4A of Uniform Commercial Code.|$|E
5000|$|A netting engine consolidates all of {{the pending}} {{payments}} into fewer single transactions. For example, if Bank of America is to pay American Express US$1.2 million, and American Express is to pay Bank of America $800,000, the CHIPS system aggregates this to a single payment of $400,000 from Bank of America to American Express [...] - [...] only 20% of the $2 million to be transferred actually changes hands. The <b>Fedwire</b> system would require two separate payments for the full amounts ($1.2 million to American Express and $800,000 to Bank of America).|$|E
50|$|Until 1981, <b>Fedwire</b> {{services}} were provided free and were {{available only to}} Federal Reserve member banks. The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 required most Federal Reserve Bank financial services to be priced, while giving nonmember depository institutions direct access to these priced services. Fees were now applicable to several services, including funds transfers and securities safekeeping. Banks are charged a gross transfer fee of $0.82 for every transaction, however there is a three tiered discount schedule which results in actual transaction fees costing between $0.034 and $0.82 per transaction depending on transaction volume.|$|E
50|$|A bank {{transfer}} (also {{known as a}} wire transfer or credit transfer) is a method of transferring money from one person or institution (entity) to another. A wire transfer {{can be made from}} one bank account to another bank account or through a transfer of cash at a cash office. A bank wire transfer is often the most expedient method for transferring funds between bank accounts. The transfer messages are sent via a secure system (such as SWIFT or <b>Fedwire)</b> utilizing IBAN and BIC codes. Online {{bank transfer}} systems in Europe are popular alternative payment methods, where the bank transfer is authorized by the consumer who logs onto his bank website and authorizes the funds transfer for payment to a merchant.|$|E
50|$|Prior {{to modern}} {{financial}} market technologies and {{methods such as}} depositories and securities held in electronic form, securities settlement involved the physical movement of paper instruments, or certificates and transfer forms. Payment was usually made by paper check upon receipt by the registrar or transfer agent of properly negotiated certificates and other requisite documents. Physical settlement securities still exist in modern markets today mostly for private (restricted or unregistered) securities {{as opposed to those}} of publicly (exchange) traded securities; however, payment of money today is typically made via electronic funds transfer (in the U.S., a bank wire transfer made through the Federal Reserve's <b>Fedwire</b> system). Physical/paper settlement involves higher risks, inasmuch as paper instruments, certificates, and transfer forms are subject to risks electronic media are not, such as loss, theft, clerical errors, and forgery (see indirect holding system).|$|E
5000|$|Different wire {{transfer}} systems and operators provide {{a variety of}} options relative to the immediacy and finality of settlement and the cost, value, and volume of transactions. Central bank {{wire transfer}} systems, such as the Federal Reserve's <b>FedWire</b> system in the United States {{are more likely to}} be real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. RTGS systems provide the quickest availability of funds because they provide immediate [...] "real-time" [...] and final [...] "irrevocable" [...] settlement by posting the gross (complete) entry against electronic accounts of the wire transfer system operator. Other systems such as CHIPS provide net settlement on a periodic basis. More immediate settlement systems tend to process higher monetary value time-critical transactions, have higher transaction costs, and a smaller volume of payments. A faster settlement process allows less time for currency fluctuations while money is in transit.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{founding}} of the Federal Reserve banking system, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Manhattan's financial district has been where monetary policy in the United States is implemented, although policy is decided in Washington by the Federal Reserve Bank's Board of Governors. The New York Fed is the largest, in terms of assets, and the most important of the twelve regional banks. It is responsible for the second district, which covers New York State and the New York City region, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The New York Fed is responsible for conducting open market operations, the buying and selling of outstanding US Treasury securities. In 2003, <b>Fedwire,</b> the Federal Reserve's system for transferring balances between it and other banks, transferred $1.8 trillion a day in funds, of which about $1.1 trillion originated in the Second District. It transferred an additional $1.3 trillion a day in securities, of which $1.2 trillion originated in the Second District. The New York Federal Reserve is the only regional bank with a permanent vote on the Federal Open Market Committee and its president is traditionally selected as the Committee's vice chairman. The bank also has the largest gold repository in the world, larger even than Fort Knox. Its vault is 80 feet (25 m) beneath the street and holds $160 billion worth of gold bullion.|$|E

40|$|The Federal Reserve's <b>Fedwire</b> funds {{transfer}} service - the biggest large-value payments {{system in the}} United States - has long displayed a peak of activity in the late afternoon. Theory suggests that the concentration of late-afternoon <b>Fedwire</b> activity reflects coordination among participating banks to reduce liquidity costs, delay costs, and credit risk; as these costs and risk change over time, payment timing most likely will be affected. This article seeks to quantify how the changing environment in which <b>Fedwire</b> operates has affected the timing of payment value transferred within the system between 1998 and 2006. It finds that {{the peak of the}} timing distribution has become more concentrated, has shifted to later in the day, and has actually divided into two peaks. The authors suggest that these trends can be explained by a rise in the value of payments transferred over <b>Fedwire,</b> the settlement patterns of the private settlement institutions that use the system, and an increase in industry concentration. Although the study's results provide no specific evidence of heightened operational risk attributable to activity occurring later in the day, they point to a high level of interaction between <b>Fedwire</b> and private settlement institutions.
