5|$|After Grant {{retired from}} the screen, he became more active in business. He {{accepted}} {{a position on the}} board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the {{antimicrobial}} activity of black cumin (Nigella sativa) extracts <b>in</b> inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Black cumin was extracted by using steam distillation, single solvent extraction, and continuous solvent extraction. Ethanol extract was <b>the</b> best extract <b>in</b> inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> bacteria while both aqueous and hexane extracts were less effective as antimicrobial agents. Ethanol extract, essential oil, and ethyl acetate extract have a broad antimicrobial spectrum. The chemical composition of the essential oil was analyzed using a GC-MS technique. The major component of black cumin essential oil was para-cymene, followed by trans-anethole, alloaromadendrene,á-thujene, and thujyl alcohol {{along with many other}} components <b>in</b> minor amounts. <b>The</b> Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value of ethanol extract <b>in</b> inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Salmonella typhimurium was 0. 084 % (w/w), of essential oil <b>in</b> inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Bacillus cereus was 1. 72 % (w/w), of ethyl acetate extract <b>in</b> inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Staphylococcus aureus was 1. 88 % (w/w) and of methanol extract <b>in</b> inhibiting <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1. 88 % (w/w) ...|$|R

5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> {{a certain type of}} structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley {{was born}} on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter's Street, Bethnal Green in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake. William Bottomley's {{background}} is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family of well-known radical agitators—her brother George Jacob Holyoake was {{a founder of the}} Secularist movement and in later life a leading figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Co-operative societies. Among Holyoake's close associates was Charles Bradlaugh, who founded the National Republican League and became a controversial Member of Parliament. A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.|$|E
5|$|In {{his major}} {{theoretical}} statement, 'Opera and Drama' (1852), Wagner {{objected to the}} music of Meyerbeer, asserting its superficiality and incoherence in dramatic terms; this work contains Wagner's well-known put-down of Meyerbeer's operas as 'effects without causes'. It also contains the sardonic crack that ' never could have dreamt that it would some day occur to the Bankers, for whom he had always made their music, to make it for themselves'. 'Jewishness in Music' was reissued in 1869, (after Meyerbeer's death) in an extended form, with a far more explicit attack on Meyerbeer. This version was under Wagner's own name – and as Wagner had by now a far greater reputation, his views obtained far wider publicity. These attacks on Meyerbeer (which also included swipes at Felix Mendelssohn) are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> German anti-Semitism.|$|E

5|$|Scottish kinship in {{this period}} was agnatic, with descent judged through a common ancestor, helping to create the surname system in the Borders and the clans in the Highlands, with these systems {{beginning}} to break down in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries respectively. There was considerable concern over the safety of children. The abolition of godparents in the Reformation meant that baptism became a mechanism for emphasising the role and responsibilities of fathers. Wet-nurses were used for young children, but in most families mothers took the primary role in bringing up children, while the Kirk emphasised the role of the father for older children. After the Reformation there was an increasing emphasis on education, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> a parish school system, but its effects were limited for the children of the poor and for girls. Most children left home for a period of life-cycle service, as domestic or agricultural servants or as apprentices before marriage.|$|E

5|$|Weymouth's esplanade is {{composed}} of Georgian terraces, which have been converted into apartments, shops, hotels and guest houses. The buildings were constructed in the Georgian and Regency periods between 1770 and 1855, designed by architects such as James Hamilton, and were commissioned by wealthy businessmen, including those that were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Bath. These terraces form a long, continuous arc of buildings which face Weymouth Bay along the esplanade. The earliest purpose-built hotel there was the first incarnation of the Royal Hotel. The esplanade features the multi-coloured Jubilee Clock, erected in 1887 to mark the 50th year of Queen Victoria's reign. Statues of Victoria, George III and Sir Henry Edwards, Member of Parliament for the borough from 1867 to 1885, and two war memorials stand along the Esplanade.|$|E
5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 1272, Edward I reestablished royal power, overhauling {{the royal}} finances and {{appealing to the}} broader English elite by using Parliament to authorise the raising of new taxes and to hear petitions concerning abuses of local governance. This political balance collapsed under Edward II and savage civil wars broke out during the 1320s. Edward III restored order once more {{with the help of}} a majority of the nobility, exercising power through the exchequer, the common bench and the royal household. This government was better organised and on a larger scale than ever before, and by the 14th century the king's formerly peripatetic chancery had to take up permanent residence in Westminster. Edward used Parliament even more than his predecessors to handle general administration, to legislate and to raise the necessary taxes to pay for the wars in France. The royal lands—and incomes from them—had diminished over the years, and increasingly frequent taxation was required to support royal initiatives. Edward held elaborate chivalric events in an effort to unite his supporters around the symbols of knighthood. The ideal of chivalry continued to develop throughout the 14th century, reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> knightly orders (including the Order of the Garter), grand tournaments and round table events.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} art from what is now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the Neolithic period. From the Bronze Age there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and cup and ring marks. More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the Iron Age. Elaborately carved Pictish stones and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages. The development of a common style of Insular art across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells. Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin. The influence of the Renaissance {{can be seen in}} stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty. The Reformation removed a major source of patronage for art and limited the level of public display, but may have helped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> secular domestic forms, particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls. Although the loss of the court {{as a result of the}} Union of Crowns in 1603 removed another major source of patronage, the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant, with figures such as George Jamesone and John Michael Wright.|$|E
