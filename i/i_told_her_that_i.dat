60|$|Rectus couldn't; but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} the language tolerably well, {{and asked her}} why she wished to know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother {{took the}} oranges {{out of the}} knapsack, and then I pulled it up again. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had plenty more for myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I persisted; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> greatly desired {{that she}} should speak a few {{sentences}} in Burmese into my instrument. I had a certain reason for this which I would explain afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{wanted to}} know what you did--how you spent your time. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you had no profession, that you did nothing except play cricket and polo, and hunt and shoot, she seemed most unaccountably surprised. She {{appeared}} almost incredulous when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you seldom came to London, and still more seldom went abroad. I wonder what she had in her head?" ...|$|R
60|$|Outside of the ladies' tent I {{came upon}} Miss Thorn, stowing a large basket. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{we had taken}} that {{precaution}} the night before.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just because}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{we ought to}} wait until you remembered us," [...] the slighter young woman, with the very obvious peroxidised hair, protested.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too," [...] Mr. Armstrong agreed; [...] "and now {{let us go}} in. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should speak to you this evening, and she must be waiting anxiously for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] Mary assured him, laughing. [...] "It {{was one of}} the first things she mentioned. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should ask any one to tea I liked she was {{positively}} indignant." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fanny's good-humoured face cleared up. 'Yes, ma'am, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was quite}} sure that Miss Gillian would not go for to do {{anything}} wrong, {{and that it could}} be easy explained; but people has tongues, you see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your {{mother was}} saying to me down in the county that she hoped you {{attended}} to the business. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{there was nothing to}} attend to.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Jim," [...] she announced. [...] "Miss Alison Leigh. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if ever {{she wanted}} a home out here she was to come to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; {{she asked}} for Mr. Philip first, and when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he was out, {{she asked for}} you, sir. I have shown her into the study." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My sister," [...] she answered. [...] "It {{was to try}} {{and save}} her life that I wanted the money. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not get it, she gave up and died. Your uncle killed her. Come." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would not}} bid her goodby; I should find {{a moment to}} come back the next morning. Her cousin, who had put on his sombrero again, flourished it off at me {{by way of a}} bow, upon which I took my departure.|$|E
60|$|In {{the second}} place, I am under no {{obligation}} to Mr. Gracedieu's daughter which forbids me to make use of her portfolio. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> only consented to receive it, under reserve of my own right of action--and her assent to that stipulation was expressed in the clearest terms.|$|E
6000|$|... “And so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{the great}} lady in grey. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{my sister had}} given it to me and that surely God would not let her take it away again.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{unless you}} wish to draw it out. She told me, some time ago, why she placed it in your name; and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{there would be no}} difficulty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{consulted}} me, dear mother, {{five minutes}} since," [...] said Valentin, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{such a beautiful}} woman--she is beautiful, you will see--had no right to bury herself alive." ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{got over}} the fender now, and I had got over my suspicion. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} she {{had given me a}} faithful account of herself, and that we had both been hapless instruments in designing hands. She thanked me, and said I was a good fellow.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Harry, I did {{not treat}} it as a {{business}} transaction, and I did not make any formal proposal. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved her, {{and she said she}} was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is nothing to me compared with her." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{object of}} my journey was {{accomplished}} when the nimble matron {{had no more}} to show me. As I shook hands {{with her at the}} gate, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought justice had not used her very well, and that the wise men of the East were not infallible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Silence {{would have}} been unfair. I don't think it {{would have been}} kind either. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she must be {{prepared}} for the world passing a very severe judgment on her father..." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{always used}} the French form of my name, {{because she said}} it sounded ridiculous in English, for a white man, though <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the English was nearer the Greek in sound.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is up stairs, {{and you are}} to go to <b>her.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{we should}} keep you {{for a quarter of}} an hour, and you have not been here half that time yet." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{change in}} my manner was of course remarked by Mrs. Roylake's ready observation. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been annoyed, and offered no other explanation. Wonderful to relate, she showed no curiosity and no surprise. More {{wonderful}} still, at every fair opportunity that offered, she kept out of my way.|$|E
60|$|I {{read her}} letter many times. I {{wrote to her}} before I slept. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been in sore need of her help; that without her I was not, and I never had been, what she thought me; but that she {{inspired}} me to be that, and I would try.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} by my wife on the sofa, {{and put the}} ear-rings in her ears; and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feared we had not been quite as good company lately, {{as we used to}} be, and that the fault was mine. Which I {{sincerely}} felt, and which indeed it was.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a}} {{statuette}} of a god named Osiris and very, very ancient, probably quite {{five thousand}} years old, a statement at which she smiled a little; also that it came from Egypt.|$|R
6000|$|... "She stepped {{very quietly}} {{out of the}} sledge, my lord, the moment <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> we had arrived. She asked no questions, and walked {{straight}} into the hut. Meseemed that the jongejuffrouw knew exactly where she was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know; but {{she said}} that, to triumph over the mysteries she wished to teach me, I must free myself from earthly love and cares. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that,</b> if Arthur is married, I would think of it." ...|$|R
60|$|She sighed, and put {{her head}} back in its old {{position}} on my bosom. Sad misgivings about what the end would be weighed upon my mind, but still distrusting myself, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would do as she wished. She thanked me, and we passed gradually into talking of other things.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I grovelled; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{accused her}} (as regards my son) of {{nothing worse than}} an excess of good nature. She helped him to pass his time--he ought to be immensely obliged. Also {{that it would be}} a very happy moment for me too when I should hand her over to Mr. Porterfield.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a plague}} {{the old woman}} is with her letters! <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hated correspondence, but she {{persists}} in writing every month or so, though she never gets any reply except, 'My dear Aunt: Thanks for your letter. I am {{glad to hear that}} you are well.--Your affectionate nephew.' Well, I suppose I must read it through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This was {{the ruined}} cathedral, {{built at the}} time when the entire {{population}} was converted, and it was a large order; but I was afire with love, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the church <b>I</b> would build would be even bigger.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she {{was wrong}} then. She {{ought to have been}} {{thinking}} of her life, and not only of her life but {{of the life of the}} man who was speaking to her too. She let me finish, then shook her head impatiently.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that,</b> {{acting on}} Santa Coloma's advice, {{given to me}} before the fight, I was going on to the Lomas de Rocha to see a person named Florentino Blanco in that place, who would {{probably}} be able to procure me a passport from Montevideo.|$|R
