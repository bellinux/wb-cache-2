40|$|This {{contribution}} aims to give {{additional information}} on {{the background of the}} computational results presented in paper 19 of this conference. The simulation program used for this contribution is Materials StudioTM (MS), Version 7. 0. 2 by BIOVIA (formerly Accelrys Inc., San Diego) [1]. The method employed is molecular dynamics (MD), applied on two-phase simulation systems: They contain a crystalline part made from ammonium perchlorate (AP) or Aluminum (Al) and an amorphous part made from the plasticizers dioctyladipate (DOA), azide group terminated short chain <b>glycidylazide</b> <b>polymer</b> (GAP-A), or hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), as a prepolymer for polyurethane binders. The force field used throughout is COMPASSTM II[2, 3], which is described to yield reliable interaction properties between organic and inorganic substances. The methods applied for the generation of simulation systems, for the multiple step dynamics runs, and the subsequent analysis routines employed are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A review, with 4 refs. on thermodn. {{parameters}} in formulation and prodn. of gun propellants {{in connection}} with the application of energetic plasticizers, energetic binders, and new energetic compds. to improve their performance. Thermodn. data for the energy-output of energetic materials such as flame temp., mol no., mean mol. wt., heat of explosion, and specific energy are given. The replacement of conventional plasticizers by several energetic plasticizers is discussed. The thermodn. parameters were calcd. for different propellant formulations. Nitramine propellants with different binder systems such as polybutadiene (PB), <b>glycidylazide</b> <b>polymer</b> (GAP), and cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) were investigated in a closed bomb to evaluate the energy-output and the reaction products by gas anal. The performance of the propellants was discussed {{in connection with}} heat of formation, O balance, and the kind of polymeric binder system. Energetic compds. such as NTO, CL- 20, TNAZ, ANTA, and ammo nium dinitramide (ADN) were calcd. by the ICT thermodyn. code, to assess the energy-output and to improve the performance...|$|E
40|$|Composite rocket {{propellants}} (CRP) contain oxidizer {{particles and}} fuel particles in an elastomeric binder matrix. The oxidizing agent is mostly ammonium perchlorate and the elastomer is hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) based polyurethane. For some purposes, aluminum (Al) particles are added. The components differ widely {{in terms of}} crystallinity, thermal expansion behaviour and polarity. Especially under broad temperature variations insufficient resilience leads to detachment or dewetting of filler material from the binder. The ageing of such material was successfully characterized by DMA (dynamic mechanical analysis) measurements. The loss factor shows characteristic changes in shape and intensity. The shape of the loss factor is also determined by the intermolecular interactions between binder elastomer and filler materials [1 - 3]. Also the transitions between non-glassy and glassy states of polymer binders and plasticizers are strongly determined by intermolecular interaction forces [4]. This work intends to contribute to elucidating this aspect. Molecular dynamics simulations (MD) procedures are employed for a determination of binder-oxidizing agent compatibility. MD {{is based on the}} approximation of atoms as point masses and point charges. Iterative solution of classical equations of motion with interatomic forces yields correct structure and energies within simulated volume elements. The procedure uses the crystal structure of the oxidant and the molecular topology of the elastomer as input parameters, at given temperature and pressure. First, sets of representative crystal surfaces are identified, which are then loaded with a bulk of adsorbate molecules, means binder and plasticizer molecules. From simulation runs at experimental conditions, the energy of interaction is extracted. Results are compared to those from solution microcalorimetry. This methods provides with the thermal response upon mixing AP powders with uncured HTPB, or plasticising agents as dioctyl adipate (DOA), and azido-terminated <b>glycidylazide</b> <b>polymer</b> (GAP-A). Although originally designed for measurement of heats of solution, the setup is used to measure the heat of immersion within saturated solutions...|$|E
