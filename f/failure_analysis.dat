Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for <b>failure</b> <b>analysis</b> in the semiconductor industry.|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of a reinforced concrete beam {{with respect to}} the limit state of crack width under monotonically increasing short-time loading conditions is estimated using the Monte Carlo technique and <b>failure</b> rate <b>analysis.</b> Using both methods the reliabilities of 24 beams whose test results are available in the literature and three beams tested in the laboratory have been determined for a limiting crack width of 0. 2 mm. A comparison of the reliabilities obtained using <b>failure</b> rate <b>analysis</b> with those obtained directly from Monte Carlo simulation shows good agreement.

40|$|<b>Failure</b> {{behavior}} <b>analysis</b> is a {{very important}} phase in developing large distributed embedded systems with weak safety requirements which do graceful degradation in case of <b>failures.</b> Today, the <b>analysis</b> will usually be done by standard methods like FTA and FMEA considering the existence of faults, only. Gradations of errors are not regarded, although this {{is a very}} coarse system behavior approximation. In contrast to that, our advanced <b>failure</b> behavior <b>analysis</b> yields more sophisticated and graded results. We obtain comprehensive results by assigning a quality description to all the information in a system and extending the pure information flow to an information quality flow, that models system failure behavior, too. We model this information quality flow by object-oriented hierarchical petri nets. Large parts of these nets can automatically be generated from the existing behavioral system structure. A net simulator enables us to perform all the sophisticated analyses we need to examine the failure behavior. ...|$|R
