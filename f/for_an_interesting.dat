5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot to be interesting because it explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story did not contribute much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed their motives in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel like it was retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy at times, the expressive facial animations kept the cinematics captivating.|$|E

25|$|Sin and Punishment was co-developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 and Treasure. Development began around 1997 when Treasure {{wrote the}} {{original}} proposal and submitted it to Nintendo. The original inspiration {{to develop the}} game was {{the design of the}} Nintendo 64 controller. In {{the early days of the}} system's lifespan, Nintendo had suggested two ways of holding the controller, a left and right position. Due to the success of Super Mario 64 which released alongside the console in 1996, many games followed in its trails and featured the same right positioning it used. Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, began discussing with his team how the left positioning was underutilized and thought it could make <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> game, and so started developing a new game to use this position. Nintendo warned Treasure that the left positioning would feel unnatural to players at first, however Treasure was already expecting this. Nintendo was also planning a controller accessory at the time with a movement sensor. The team considered adapting the sensor for the game, but ultimately decided against it as it would have lengthened an already dragging development process. The sensor technology was not finalized by Nintendo until the release of the Wii in 2006.|$|E

Beghe portrayed exorcist Ray Purvis in the 2008 horror film One Missed Call. In 2009, Beghe had a guest-starring {{role on the}} television show Californication.

[...] "Bates, played by Jason Beghe, made <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> character {{and the fact that}} he didn't get as much screen time as some of the other characters is a shame," [...] wrote Danny Gallagher of TV Squad. In October 2009, Beghe was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for the filming of the movie The Next Three Days, directed by Paul Haggis.

The film minor praise from The Morning Telegraph <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> story and plot and another review in The Moving Picture World liked the novelty of the film's premise. Though The New York Dramatic Mirror gives the most detailed review because it recognizes that the film is not as appealing as other Thanhouser films and recognizes that an obvious error in the production when Marie Eline picks up a seemingly weightless bag of gold.

[...] The film looks to have made its way into Canada with the Province making a series of advertisements for The Lucky Shot, but one states the film is a comedy in and another contains only a partial summary.

[...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable to really get into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E

[...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-up, calling the song as [...] "a dramatic affair that demonstrates how pop and country can intersect {{with each other and}} offer decent results." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] ""Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] would be a suitable fit for a Foreigner or Whitesnake album, and, though nowhere near a classic, it’s an instant entrant into the [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] category." [...] Reviewing the album for Billboard, Gary Graff described the song as being part of an [...] "array of such bittersweet, emotionally ambivalent goodbye songs". Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave the song three-and-a-half stars out of five and praised both Aldean and Clarkson's fine voice, [...] "making <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> combination: Jason's rough, slightly nasal voice against Kelly's cleaner, forceful tone." [...] In a different perspective, Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe graded the production of the song as [...] "C", lambasting the song for its musical element, writing [...] "the sheer volume of noise that invades the track with the first chorus takes us straight into Monster Ballads territory." [...] He concluded his review by emphasizing that [...] "this isn’t country music. It just isn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Christian Hoard {{summarized}} {{the record and}} the mixed reviews simply as [...] "DeLonge yanks heartstrings with so-so results" [...] and saw the atmospheric elements as excessive. Spin had a similar sentiment: [...] "Here, his three sidemen elevate [...] emo tendencies to something grander and more timelessly romantic—though somewhat less exciting. Blender scrunitized {{the composition of the}} album as it contains the [...] "duller" [...] aspects of Blink-182 accompanied with U2-influenced guitar chimes.Many critics arraigned the album to be pretentious and contrasted Angels & Airwaves with Blink-182. The A.V. Club journalist Kyle Ryan described his experience with We Don't Need to Whisper as 50 minutes of DeLonge demonstrating his musical skills. English magazine Uncut discerned his departure from Blink-182 and the album's serious tone. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the differences in musical style between both bands, but remained polarized about the album and commented that [...] "It may not make for a successful record, but it does make <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> one, particularly in how DeLonge's desire to be taken seriously has led him to use the serious music of his adolescence as a signifier that he's serious now, but We Don't Need to Whisper is too doggedly dour and amorphous {{to be more than a}} curiosity."The album sold 127,000 copies its first week, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in a Video, Best Special Effects in a Video and Best Editing in a Video for [...] "The Adventure," [...] as well as Best Band of 2006 for We Don't Need to Whisper.|$|E
