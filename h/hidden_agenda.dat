25|$|Between 2005 and 2008 {{this issue}} was {{compounded}} by the discovery that key elements of Martin Allen's <b>Hidden</b> <b>Agenda</b> trilogy were based on twenty-nine forgeries located in the UK National Archives. These forged papers explicitly implicated Bedaux high in the elite echelons of the Third Reich. As part of the police investigation into the case, Allen denied knowledge of the forgeries and 'suggested he {{was the victim of}} a conspiracy'.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Laudrup {{completed}} a controversial move from Barça to Real Madrid after he fell-out with Johan Cruyff. On this, Laudrup stated {{he did not}} have a <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda.</b> It was the year before the 1994 FIFA World Cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.|$|E

The actions of the ineffectual cell of underground terrorists are overlaid with a soundtrack filled with newscast, voiceovers, music and gibberish. The political theme of the film aroused controversy.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{charter airlines}} were suspicious of BEA's motive {{to enter the}} IT market and some feared that the operator held a <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda</b> to destabilise this market by undercutting the independent carriers, none of which could match the corporation's financial resources and access to capital at the time. The independents moreover thought that BEA Airtours was meant {{to take on the}} corporations' excess staff as well as to absorb aircraft that were surplus to their requirements. They feared that this would lead to significant market distortions, creating excess capacity and further depressing the already low charter rates in a highly competitive market.|$|E
25|$|Some {{said that}} Chen's {{position}} on this issue was intended {{and to some degree}} succeeded in placating his pro-independence supporters without crossing any red lines that could trigger war with the PRC. His supporters saw these positions as creative and indicative of a willingness to compromise. However, it was also common among his opponents in Taiwan, as well as among policy makers in China and the pro-PRC United States politicians to see his statements in their own much darker terms. Many among his critics (especially those from the Pan-Blue coalition) believed that his positions and actions showed that his seemingly conciliatory statements were merely a smokescreen to advance a <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda</b> of advancing de facto Taiwan independence. These suspicions appeared to arise from the actions of his KMT predecessor Lee Teng-hui who now readily admits to secretly trying to advance de facto Taiwan independence during his presidential terms.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, a {{clash of}} alliances {{occurred}} over Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia following the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Bosnian Serb militant. Germany went {{to the side of}} its former rival-turned-ally, Austria-Hungary, and declared war on France and Russia. Following the German invasion of neutral Belgium the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. Initially, in Bavaria and all across Germany, recruits flocked enthusiastically to the German Army. At the outbreak of World War I King Ludwig III sent an official dispatch to Berlin to express Bavaria's solidarity. Later Ludwig even claimed annexations for Bavaria (Alsace and the city of Antwerp in Belgium, to receive an access to the sea). His <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda</b> was to maintain the balance of power between Prussia and Bavaria within the German Empire after a victory. Over time, with a stalemated and bloody war on the western front, Bavarians, like many Germans, grew weary of a continuing war.|$|E

500|$|For a {{long time}} the British were {{ambivalent}} in their attitude to Abd al-Rahman. He had provided valuable political assistance during World War I and in 1924. On the other hand, the Sudan Government found that his services had a <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda</b> and described his actions as [...] "evasive and obstructive". On balance the British found it best to treat Abd al-Rahman as an ally, although some felt that Governor-General Reginald Wingate (1900–18) was too lenient towards him. In September 1924 Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani, leader of the Khatmiyya movement and Abd al-Rahman's rival, said he would prefer Sudan {{to be part of}} the Egyptian kingdom than to be an independent monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman. At that time the British favored Sayyid Ali, whom they saw as a purely religious leader, while Sayyid Abd al-Rahman also had potentially dangerous political ambitions.|$|E
500|$|Further {{conspiracy}} theories {{were reported in}} the 2006 non-fiction book The Sion Revelation: The Truth About the Guardians of Christ's Sacred Bloodline by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince (authors of the 1997 non-fiction book The Templar Revelation, the principal source for Dan Brown's claims about hidden messages {{in the work of}} Leonardo da Vinci). They accepted that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion was a hoax created by Plantard, and that his claim that he was a Merovingian dynast was a lie. However, they insist that this was part of a complex red herring intended to distract the public from the <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda</b> of Plantard and his [...] "controllers". They argue that the Priory of Sion was a front organisation for one of the many crypto-political societies which have been plotting to create a [...] "United States of Europe" [...] in line with French occultist Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre's synarchist vision of an ideal form of government.|$|E
500|$|Dale's {{characters}} {{on most of}} the American television shows he has appeared on have shared similar character traits, which Dale describes as the [...] "go-to powerful guy" [...] role. Following his appearance as Senator Eaton in The Killing in 2011, reviewers commented on his tendency to play powerful, wealthy and mysterious characters in many shows. Maureen Ryan of TV Squad wrote that it was [...] "lovely to see Alan Dale playing a typically Alan Dale-ian character. He's always so great at playing That Sketchy Wealthy Guy With a <b>Hidden</b> <b>Agenda,</b> which he has now played on, I believe, 87 different shows. And he always does it well." [...] Coincidentally, Dale's characters in Neighbours, The O.C. and Ugly Betty have all been killed off by a fatal heart attack. Christopher Rosen of The New York Observer wrote in 2008 that [...] "with his square jaw and seemingly no nonsense attitude, Mr. Dale is the go-to actor when casting directors need a conservative-looking authoritarian. When he comes onto the screen, audiences immediately take him seriously, since he radiates rich, smug and serious. He demands your respect." [...] Rosen says that Dale is [...] "not even...a particularly good actor" [...] but is [...] "fine enough" [...] and [...] "bring a no frills, no gimmicks style to his roles," [...] and [...] "manages to give a consistent performance in every show he appears on." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{guidelines}} for a check-up recommend routine screening not triggered by specific symptoms for some known {{risk factors and}} diseases in the general population. Patients' perceptions and expectations regarding a check-up exam may differ from these principles. However, quantitative and qualitative data about the discrepancy between patient- and provider expectations {{for this type of}} clinic consultation is lacking. Methods For a year, we prospectively enrolled 66 patients who explicitly requested a "check-up" at our medical outpatient division. All patients actively denied upon prompting having any symptoms or specific health concerns at the time they made their appointment. All consultations were videotaped and analysed for information about spontaneously mentioned symptoms and reasons for the clinic consultation ("open agendas") and for cues to <b>hidden</b> patient <b>agendas</b> using the Roter interaction analysis system (RIAS). Results All patients initially declared to be asymptomatic but this was ultimately the case in only 7 out of 66 patients. The remaining 59 patients spontaneously mentioned a mean of 4. 2 ± 3. 3 symptoms during their first consultation. In 23 patients a total of 31 <b>hidden</b> <b>agendas</b> were revealed. The primary categories for <b>hidden</b> <b>agendas</b> were health concerns, psychosocial concerns and the patient's concept of disease. Conclusions The majority of patients requesting a general check-up tend to be motivated by specific symptoms and health concerns and are not "asymptomatic" patients who primarily come for preventive issues. Furthermore, physicians must be alert for possible <b>hidden</b> <b>agendas,</b> as one in three patients have one or more hidden reasons for requesting a check-up. </p...|$|R
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{said that}} he [...] "liked the script very much, and I think I stayed fairly close to the {{original}} draft. I liked it because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which I wish we could have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda</b> of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of December 24, 2004 (three months after the crash of Flight 815), two members of a science team from the Kahana {{freighter}} anchored offshore—Daniel and Charlotte—who landed on the island three days earlier with a <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda,</b> sneak off to find the Tempest. [...] Juliet and the crash survivors' leader Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) notice their absence from the beach camp and pursue them. [...] After hearing the whispers, Harper approaches Juliet. [...] She tells her that Daniel and Charlotte intend to kill everyone on the island by deploying a lethal gas at the Tempest and that Ben's orders are for Juliet to kill them. [...] On a trek back to the beach in the morning, Kate encounters Daniel and Charlotte and is knocked unconscious by the latter. Jack and Juliet come across Kate and they split up: Juliet continues for the Tempest alone, as Jack minds Kate. Inside the station, Juliet finds Daniel in a hazmat suit at a computer. [...] After a standoff, Daniel and Charlotte convince Juliet {{that they are not}} going to kill anyone; they are neutralizing the gas in case Ben decides to use it again, as he had twelve years earlier in an Others-led purge of Dharma. [...] Jack arrives at the Tempest and Juliet explains that those on the freighter came to the island to wage war against Ben and she expects him to win. [...] She fears for Jack because Ben thinks that she belongs to him, but Jack shows no worry and kisses her.|$|E
500|$|Straczynski viewed [...] "sitting {{down and}} ferreting out [...] story" [...] as {{a return to}} his journalistic roots. He also drew on his {{experience}} writing crime drama for the procedural elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case {{that it was difficult}} to work out how to tell it. To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time—1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." [...] Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was {{the only person in the}} story without a <b>hidden</b> <b>agenda,</b> and it was her tenacity—as well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system—that had attracted him to the project. He said, [...] "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did." ...|$|E
