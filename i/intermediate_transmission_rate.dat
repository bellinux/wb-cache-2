They provide the ability to reconstruct the source at different fidelity from the same bit-stream, hence allowing a progressive reconstruction of the source. This property makes such source coders useful for applications like telemedicine and telebrowsing of image databases. It is desirable to have the same property of progressive reconstruction of the image in the presence of chan [...] ...|$|R

At the same time, small open economies can have a substantial monetary policy transmission through the exchange rate channel. In order to understand this setting, we explore a unified treatment of monetary policy transmission and exchangerate pass-through.

40|$|Interactions between {{individual}} organisms are often structured in space. Population spatial structure has important ecological consequences. Theoretical {{evidence suggests that}} the evolutionary effects can be equally significant, especially for exploitative species. With only a few exceptions, this theory focuses on pathogens. I review the existing literature to show that evolutionary spatial effects are strongest when host and pathogen dispersal are local and when host reproduction is relatively low. Under these conditions, the pathogen is subject to a competition-persistence tradeoff (increased competitive ability comes at the cost of decreased persistence) that favors the evolution of <b>intermediate</b> pathogen <b>transmission</b> <b>rates.</b> Although existing literature clearly demonstrates that spatial structure impacts pathogen evolution, lacking is a comprehensive understanding of the role of host and pathogen ecology. Through comprehensive simulations of spatial host-pathogen models I show that the predicted pathogen <b>transmission</b> <b>rate</b> differs from the non-spatial prediction depending on the host reproduction rate, infected host death rate, and the shape or existence of a transmission-virulence tradeoff. In conjunction, I show that the effects of spatial structure cannot be fully understood through a commonly used quantitative method. The effect of spatial structure on pathogens is postulated to extend to true predators. However, true predators are characterized by ecology that is unique relative to pathogens. Through additional simulations of spatial predator-prey models I show the influence of three unique aspects of ecology on true predator evolution: the prey conversion efficiency (the ratio of predators produced per prey consumed), the magnitude of predator death relative to the prey death rate, and the rate of predator movement. Despite their unique ecology, however, there are consistent trends in the influence of common aspects of ecology. Based on how spatial structure influences true predator evolution, spatial structure may also influence the evolution of entire food webs. Using simple population dynamic models I show that randomly constructed three and five species food webs are predicted to be evolutionarily unstable in both spatial and non-spatial contexts. However, I suggest spatial structure is still likely to play an important evolutionary role and should be considered more carefully in studies of evolutionary food web assembly...|$|R
40|$|Models of {{infectious}} diseases are characterized by a phase transition between extinction and persistence. A challenge in contemporary epidemiology is {{to understand how the}} geometry of a host's interaction network influences disease dynamics close to the critical point of such a transition. Here we address this challenge with the help of moment closures. Traditional moment closures, however, do not provide satisfactory predictions close to such critical points. We therefore introduce a new method for incorporating longer-range correlations into existing closures. Our method is technically simple, remains computationally tractable and significantly improves the approximation's performance. Our extended closures thus provide an innovative tool for quantifying the influence of interaction networks on spatially or socially structured disease dynamics. In particular, we examine the effects of a network's clustering coefficient, as well as of new geometrical measures, such as a network's square clustering coefficients. We compare the relative performance of different closures from the literature, with or without our long-range extension. In this way, we demonstrate that the normalized version of the Bethe approximation-extended to incorporate long-range correlations according to our method-is an especially good candidate for studying influences of network structure. Our numerical results highlight the importance of the clustering coefficient and the square clustering coefficient for predicting disease dynamics at low and <b>intermediate</b> values of <b>transmission</b> <b>rate,</b> and demonstrate the significance of path redundancy for disease persistence...|$|R
40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} demand for data communication methods, {{power line communication}} has become an interesting alternative method for data communication. Power line communication falls into two categories: one for data transmission between sites in the power grid {{and the other for}} home or office networking. When considering home or office networking, existing methods are either too slow for tasks other than simple automation, or are very fast with a higher cost than necessary for the desired function. The objective in this work is to develop a lower cost communication system with an <b>intermediate</b> data <b>transmission</b> <b>rate.</b> At first glance, power line communication looks like a good option because of the availability of power outlets in every room of a building. However, the power conductors were installed solely for the purpose of distributing 60 Hz mains power and, for data signals, they exhibit very high attenuation, variable impedance and there is radio frequency shielding. Furthermore, many of the 60 Hz loads produce radio frequency interference that impedes data communication. Previous research has shown that much of the noise is time synchronous with the 60 Hz mains frequency and that the majority of data errors occur during these periods of high noise. This work develops a power line communication protocol that coordinates transmissions and uses only the predictable times of lower noise. Using a central control strategy, the power line 60 Hz mains signal is divided into 16 timeslots and each timeslot is monitored for errors. The central controller periodically polls all stations to learn which timeslots have low noise and it then controls all transmissions to make the best use of these good timeslots. The periodic polling allows the system to adapt to changes in electrical loading and noise. This control strategy has been achieved with modest complexity and laboratory measurements have shown throughput approaching 70 % of the modem bit rate...|$|R

Malaria transmission is perennial with Plasmodium falciparum, accounting for greater than 80 % of malaria cases.

The anthropophagic mosquito Anopheles fluviatilis was identified as the main vector for malaria transmission.

Parasite prevalence and malaria incidence rates decrease with age, suggesting that residents of San Dulakudar develop immunity to malaria.
