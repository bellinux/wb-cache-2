However, a number of them, including Hatam Kadirov and Zair Muratov, were captured, transported to the Netherlands, abused and killed. Their bodies were buried in Rusthof cemetery near Amersfoort. For some time, these 101 victims were not identified, apart from {{the fact that they were}} Soviets, until an investigation by journalist Remco Reiding. Their plight was also studied by Uzbek historian Bahodir Uzakov of Gouda, South Holland.

5000|$|As he {{examines}} his surroundings and options, Jerome realizes that his rifle is pointed right at him.

60|$|Now {{the back}} of the tent drops into place, and all is {{darkness}} again--whatever it is is inside the tent with him. He hears it creeping close to him--now it is beside him. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and waits for the mighty paw. Upon his upturned face falls the gentle touch of a soft hand groping in the dark, and then a girl's voice in a scarcely audible whisper pronounces his name.|$|R

60|$|To {{this the}} Sergeant made no objections; {{and as the}} wind grew lighter, as usual with the advance of night, {{and there were no}} {{immediate}} obstacles to the navigation, he made a bed of a sail on deck, and was soon lost in the sound sleep of a soldier.

50|$|Nichol is {{stepping}} through his daily paces in Loblaw’s airy, white test kitchen. Seven product-development staff hover watchfully.
