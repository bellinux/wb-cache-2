500|$|<b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the {{letterpress}} thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and {{yet there}} were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of 'the solitary rocks and promontories' by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape-- ...|$|E

I know that my life has been {{somewhat}} different from some others during my time on Earth, but it has always been an honest effort, and has fulfilled the teaching that my immigrant parents gave me: ‘Try to leave the Earth in better condition than you found it.’" ...|$|E
2500|$|Romasanta {{admitted}} 13 murders {{explaining that}} he had been cursed and had committed them after transforming into a wolf."The first time I transformed, was in the mountains of Couso. I came across two ferocious-looking wolves. I suddenly fell to the floor, and began to feel convulsions, I rolled over three times, and a few seconds later I myself was a wolf. I was out marauding with the other two for five days, until <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own body, the one you see before you today, Your Honour. The other two wolves came with me, who I thought were also wolves, changed into human form. They were from Valencia. One was called Antonio and the other Don Genaro. They too were cursed... we attacked and ate a number of people because we were hungry." [...] Manuel Blanco RomasantaThe prosecutor, Luciano Bastida Hernáez, asked Romasanta to demonstrate the transformation for the court to which he replied that the curse only lasted for thirteen years and that he was now cured as that time had expired the previous week.|$|E

60|$|This was {{the first}} prayer, if I might call it so, that I had made for many years. But <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> journal.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> notes. Soon {{afterwards}} {{the telephone}} rang again.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own room--and {{lay down}} in bed, waiting to be composed.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> thoughts. They WERE {{a damned}} human lot. It was an {{excellent}} word in that connection....|$|E
60|$|Never could <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> native land. <b>To</b> {{the end of}} my days I {{must remain}} in exile. Yet even these {{thoughts}} failed <b>to</b> dampen <b>my</b> ardor.|$|R

60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> palace I {{found that}} the rumor already had reached Dejah Thoris, so I told her all that I had heard.|$|E

60|$|After {{this last}} {{specimen}} of my host's taste in curiosities, I pursued my investigation no further. <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> chair, {{and waited for}} the truffles.|$|E

60|$|One {{instance}} of his superior judgment I {{am about to}} quote to thee, O Vikram, after which <b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> tale; for thou art truly a warrior king, very likely to imitate the innovations of the great general Rajeshwar.|$|R

60|$|With a heavy heart <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> palace where I dwelt. At sundown I ate {{according}} to my custom, and dismissed those who waited upon me to the servants' quarters. There were but two of them for my private life was simple. Then I slept till past midnight and rising, went into the courtyard where I found the eight Chanca captains disguised as litter-bearers and with them the litter. I led them to an empty guard-house and bade them stay there in silence. After this <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> chamber and waited.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sermon for {{one more}} word: Natural desire gives you no right to any {{particular}} woman: that comes with love only, and don't be too ready to believe in love: there are many shams: the true love will not allow you to reason about it.|$|R

60|$|Accepting this as {{a mandate}} to go on, <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room in the University Club and went to bed, but not to sleep. For hours I tossed and turned in self-questioning, self-accusing fury.|$|E
60|$|I {{attended}} the theatre that night. When <b>I</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hotel, a quiet man in dark clothes, who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief, appeared, magically, at my side.|$|E
