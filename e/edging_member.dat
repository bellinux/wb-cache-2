Each rib projected forwards of the front spar and was fitted into the U-section of a rigid leading <b>edge</b> <b>member.</b> The trailing <b>edge</b> was formed without a rigid member. The wings were set at a dihedral angle, each main spar being rigidly fixed to the main frame at the required angle.

40|$|Based on {{a series}} of alternating, displacement-controlled load tests on ten one-third scale models, to study the {{behaviour}} of the interface of a hybrid shear wall system, it was proved that the concept of hybrid construction in earthquake prone regions is feasible. The hybrid shear-wall system consists of typical reinforced concrete shear walls with composite <b>edge</b> <b>members</b> or flanges. Ten different anchorage bar arrangements were developed and tested to evaluate the column-shearwall interface behaviour under cyclic shear forces acting along the interface between column and wall panel. Finite element models of the test specimens were developed that were capable of capturing the integrated concrete and reinforcing steel behaviour in the wall panels. Special models were  developed to capture the interface behaviour between the edge columns and the shear wall. A comparison between the experimental results and the numerical results shows excellent agreement, and clearly supports the validity of the model developed for predicting the non-linear response of the hybrid wall system under various load conditions...|$|R

Three different effective widths are used for metallic rudder. For composite rudder, lowest possible effective width is used and stiffness is compared, to that of metallic rudder with highest possible effective width. Because of three connections: lower at fuselage, middle and top of the fin, the beam is treatedas indeterminate structure. The beam analysis is based on influence coefficient method. It is to be noted that the bending stiffness of 7 7 composite rudder is matched well to that of metal,lic,...|$|R
