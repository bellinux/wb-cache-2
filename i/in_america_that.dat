However, the land was unsuitable, the colony failed and was moved {{to what is now}} Salem.

5|$|Lord Rockingham, {{with the}} support of Pitt and the King, {{repealed}} Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act, but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created Earl of Chatham. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>that</b> statues of them both were erected in New York City. Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and the Duke of Grafton took over the government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the general election, and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. Wilkes was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner-up as the victor. Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after World War II, {{a group of young}} New York artists known as the New York School formed the first truly {{original}} school of painting <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>that</b> exerted a major influence on foreign artists: abstract expressionism.

The abstract expressionists abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects to concentrate on instinctual arrangements of space and color and to demonstrate the effects of the physical action of painting on the canvas.|$|E

25|$|By 1822, {{two years}} later, the General Synod {{had failed to}} act decisively {{in the case of}} Ten Eyck and Classis Montgomery. As a result, the Rev. Dr. Solomon Froeligh of the Dutch Reformed Church of Hackensack-Schraalenburgh, New Jersey (Classis Paramus) became {{convinced}} that the toleration of heretical doctrine, a lack of church discipline at all levels, and the widespread profanation of the sacraments put the denomination beyond possibility of reform. In his view, all the marks of a true church had been erased. Accordingly, in meetings that took place on October 2224, 1822, Froeligh began a movement of secession from the Dutch Reformed Church <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>that</b> would result in the establishment of the True Reformed Dutch Church (sometimes called the True Reformed Protestant Dutch Church).|$|E
