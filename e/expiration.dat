5000|$|... 40 {{quarterly}} <b>expirations</b> and 4 serial <b>expirations</b> {{are listed}} in the Eurodollar contract.This means that on 1 January 2011, the exchange will list 40 quarterly <b>expirations</b> (March, June, September, December for 2011 through 2020), the exchange will also list another four serial (monthly) <b>expirations</b> (January, February, April, May 2011). This extends tradeable contracts over ten years, which provides an excellent picture of the shape of the yield curve. The front month contracts are among the most liquid futures contracts in the world, with liquidity decreasing for the further out contracts. Total open interest for all contracts is typically over 10 million.|$|R

40|$|Evidence from Lockup <b>Expirations</b> We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that insider trading impairs market liquidity, by analyzing intraday trades and quotes around 1, 497 IPO lockup <b>expirations</b> in the period 1995 - 1999. We find that, while lockup <b>expirations</b> are associated with considerable insider trading for some IPO firms, they have little effect on effective spreads. By contrast, two other liquidity measures, quote depth and trading activity, improve substantially. In the 23 percent of lockup <b>expirations</b> where insiders disclose share sales, spreads actually decline. These findings indicate that {{a large body of}} well-informed, blockholding insider traders can enter a market from which they had previously been absent, and substantially change trading volume and share price, without impairing market liquidit...|$|R

30|$|Methods: Respiratory {{flow and}} capnography signals were {{analysed}} in eleven patients on pressure support ventilation, each ventilated at 3 – 5 pressure support levels. Part {{of these data}} have been published previously (1). Flow signals were analysed to calculate {{the average number of}} incomplete <b>expirations</b> over a 20 breath window. CO 2 signals were analysed to calculate the variability (2 *SD) in ETCO 2 over the same window. Data including 2350 sets of 20 breaths were categorized according to the analysis of flow into 3 groups, few incomplete <b>expirations</b> (< 2 in 20), some incomplete <b>expirations</b> (2 – 18 in 20) and many incomplete <b>expirations</b> (> 18 in 20); and the variability of ETCO 2 was calculated for each of these groups. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare median ETCO 2 variability between groups.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Positive expiratory {{pressure}} (PEP) is regularly {{used as a}} self-administered airway clearance technique. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the need to teach the correct use of the PEP device and to measure the progress of the success rate of the maneuver after training. METHOD: A PEP system (PariPEP-S Sytem) was used to generate PEP in 30 healthy volunteers. They were instructed by a qualified physical therapist to breathe correctly through the PEP device. Then they were evaluated during a set of ten <b>expirations.</b> Two other evaluations were performed at day 2 and day 8 (before and after feedback). The mean PEP and the success rate were calculated for each set of <b>expirations.</b> The number of maneuvers needed to obtain a correct use was calculated on the first session. RESULTS: An optimal PEP was reached after 7. 5 SD 2. 7 attempts by all subjects. Success rates and mean pressures were similar between the different sets of <b>expirations</b> (p= 0. 720 and p= 0. 326, respectively). Pressure variability was around 10 %. After one week, 30 % of subjects generated more than two non-optimal pressures in the set of ten <b>expirations.</b> No difference in success rate was observed depending on the evaluations. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that good initial training on the use of the PEP device and regular follow-up are required for the subject to reach optimal {{expiratory pressure}}...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous mucus {{clearance}} and {{the effect}} of forced <b>expirations</b> and coughing on mucus clearance were investigated in eight patients with chronic airflow obstruction and low elastic recoil pressure (emphysema group: mean FEV 1 45 % predicted) and in seven patients with chronic airflow obstruction and normal elastic recoil pressure (chronic bronchitis group: mean FEV 1 57 % predicted). Mucus clearance was measured in a central and a peripheral lung region by a radioactive aerosol tracer technique. Spontaneous mucus clearance from the peripheral lung region was higher in the patients with emphysema than in those with chronic bronchitis. There was no difference in central mucus clearance between the two groups. Mucus clearance from the peripheral lung region increased significantly during forced <b>expirations</b> and coughing in the patients with chronic bronchitis but not in those with emphysema. It is concluded that in patients with chronic airflow obstruction and regular sputum production spontaneous peripheral mucus clearance is greater in those with decreased elastic recoil pressure. Physiotherapy that includes forced <b>expirations</b> and coughing can enhance mucus clearance in such patients when elastic recoil pressure is normal but is unlikely to be effective when elastic recoil pressure is decreased...|$|R
