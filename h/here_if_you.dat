Each {{of them is}} a towering monument to nothingness". The Alternative Press opined that the EP was not [...] "a progression from the gorgeously devastated Frigid Stars and I couldn't be happier. Codeine have hit upon a formula so pure and righteous it would be tragic for them to deviate from it." [...] The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review, explaining that [...] "There's not a lot going on here, but songs such as [...] "Realize" [...] and [...] "Hard to Find" [...] are hardly nothing." [...] and that tracks such as [...] "W." [...] allow Codeine to achieve [...] "both earthly aggression and unearthly calm." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin, reviewed the single [...] "Realize", stating that the song [...] "inches along as if Codeine's still wondering whether it's worth the effort". The b-side [...] "Broken-hearted Wine" [...] was described as a song that [...] "coolly walks a delicate line between delibitating sadness and cartoon regret." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 28, 2006, Jackson {{spoke at}} a meeting in Dallas and {{addressed}} the subject of government contracting. [...] He recounted that a prospective HUD contractor had made a [...] "heck of a proposal" [...] and was selected upon the basis of that proposal, but upon thanking Jackson for being selected the bidder, mentioned that he did not like President Bush. [...] As a result, Jackson said, the bidder who had criticized Bush did not receive the contract: [...] "Brother, you have a disconnect—the President is elected, I was selected.
