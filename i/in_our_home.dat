[...] Jennie Tuttle Hobart remembered, [...] "When this attractive young law student appeared <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>home</b> I, then a young girl in my teens, unexpectedly played a rôle of importance by losing my heart to him". [...] The two were married on July 21, 1869. [...] The Hobarts had long been Democrats; Garret Hobart's marriage into the Republican Tuttle family converted him to that party.

500|$|In November 2011, it was {{revealed}} on Tegan and Sara Quinn's official website that they were writing new material for their seventh studio album: [...] " [...] are back <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>home</b> studios working away at more songs. We’re {{really looking forward to}} making a new record now. Our hope is to be in the studio by early 2012." [...] "I'm Not Your Hero" [...] was written for the album, which was later named Heartthrob and recorded between February and May 2012. Sara, who wrote the lyrics, said the song was based on her life as a teenager when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her future. She claimed the lyrics were about her political views from watching The West Wing, her identity and her sexuality. Tegan stated that when Sara showed the song to her and the producers, it was initially more of a love song and much more acoustic and slow than the final mix that would be released, and said she [...] "was haunted by it almost immediately. I found the verses to be quintessential Sara." ...|$|E

Much as he hated Bolshevism, Bunin never endorsed the idea of foreign intervention in Russia.

After announcing that the lead single would contain a guest musician, on September 13 the band officially announced that Tarja Turunen was set to appear as a special vocalist on the title song. The EP was released on September 27. On 25 and 26 October, den Adel and Westerholt presented an unknown number of songs of the upcoming album to the press.
