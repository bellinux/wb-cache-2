500|$|The poem {{was praised}} for its {{universal}} aspects, and Gray {{became one of}} the most famous English poets of his era. Despite this, after his death only his elegy remained popular until 20th-century critics began to re-evaluate his poetry. The 18th-century writer James Beattie was said by Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet to have written a letter to him claiming, [...] "Of all the English poets of this age, Mr. Gray is most admired, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> justice; yet there are comparatively speaking but a few who know of anything of his, but his 'Church-yard Elegy,' which is by no means the best of his works." ...|$|E
500|$|WALL-E won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was {{nominated}} for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing at the 81st Academy Awards, which it lost to Slumdog Millionaire (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), The Dark Knight (Sound Editing), and Milk (Original Screenplay). Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination, {{but it was not}} nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted WALL-E to the Best Animated Feature category. Peter Travers commented that [...] "If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E." [...] Only three animated films, 1991's Beauty and the Beast and Pixar's next two films, 2009's Up and 2010's Toy Story 3, have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. A reflective Stanton stated he was not disappointed the film was restricted to the Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film's positive reception, and eventually [...] "The line [...] is just getting so blurry that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> each proceeding year, it's going to be tougher and tougher to say what's an animated movie and what's not an animated movie." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to get to that place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E

2500|$|The British poet Roy Fisher (b. 1930) {{uses the}} term in his poetry sequence, [...] "Six Texts For a Film", in Birmingham River (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994). [...] "Birmingham's what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with.</b> / It's not made {{for that sort of}} job,/ but it's what they gave me. / As a means of thinking, it's a Brummagem/ screwdriver" [...] (lines 1–4).|$|E
2500|$|Young-adult {{readers and}} authors, {{including}} Green himself, {{have been critical}} of the terms. Green has voiced his disagreement with the idea that he is single-handedly responsible for launching or promoting any one individual's career. Green has commented on these arguments: [...] "My concern is that popular work by women receives far more vitriolic criticism from the public (like, in terms of number of demeaning jokes...) than popular work created by men... Also, I would like to see equal attention given to the sexism in popular work by men, from Nicholas Sparks to for instance J. D. Salinger. Catcher in the Rye—although I like it very much—is profoundly and disturbingly misogynistic and yet seems to get a critical pass both online and off. This happens a lot, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> books by men, and I don't want male writers (including me!) to get that pass." [...] Relating to this issue, Green has stated that he identifies as a feminist.|$|E
2500|$|In early January 2013, {{the band}} {{announced}} that their fifth album {{would be released}} later in the year, and labelled the album The Chase. Fans assumed their fifth album would be titled this, however, the band later {{announced that it was}} only a [...] "working title" [...] and the new album does not have a name. Healy said: [...] That's the working title, it's not the actual one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> the whole Chasing The Saturdays and chasing success, we'll call it that for now. But it's not the definite title. We'll have another single and then the album. We've finished it though. The official artwork for the album was released on 4 September 2013, as well as the official title, Living for the Weekend. The album artwork features all five members of the band, before Rochelle Humes and Frankie Sandford's pregnancies. Healy explained that the title of the album came from the band's name The Saturdays. She explained by saying everybody [...] "lives for the weekend" [...] and the band's name is in the weekend, which made the title even more relevant.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the trial}} he {{presented}} {{the case for}} Kantor as follows, [...] "My Lord, {{it is difficult to}} reply in a restrained fashion. My learned friend must not use words such as 'Communist' lightly, when he refers to Kantor. Kantor is not a Communist. My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that are not there. His complaint in count one is not that they found files with evidence. Oh not, he says that 'we found files with nothing in them', not in Kantor's office, but in the office of Wolpe. Then my learned friend [...] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor. It is not Kantor! Why I say it is so difficult to be restrained, is that my learned friend has thrown in everything that concerns every accused in this case, and says 'that is why I don't want Kantor to get bail.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent lyrics in {{the song}} include, [...] "I heard you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?"; [...] "Heaven is a place on earth with you/ Tell me {{all the things you}} want to do"; and [...] "open up a beer... and play a video game?" [...] In an {{interview}} for British online magazine The Quietus, Del Rey stated that the inspiration for the song came from her ex-boyfriend, commenting, [...] "I think we came together because we were both outsiders. It was perfect. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> that contentment also comes sadness. There was something heavenly about that life– we'd go to work and he'd play his video games– but also it was maybe too regular." [...] The singer also stated that she used lower vocals for [...] "Video Games" [...] because she felt that the public did not see her as a serious artist. Thematically, the lyrics have been labeled as antifeminist. Of the musical composition, MTV lauded the cinematic atmosphere of the song, adoring its feathery violins, echoing electronic thumps, and melancholic crescendos — wound into a dramatic exhibition.|$|E
