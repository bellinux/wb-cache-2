The morphometric lneasurements of this specimen matched wilh those of the syntype Of R. ncellifrra deposited in the British Museum and Rnjn orellifern recorded by Samuel (1903) ...|$|E

So deliciously"—his <b>eye</b> <b>skated</b> lifelessly over his guest—"dressed, always.

50|$|The {{operculum}} papillare is {{the iris}} {{found in the}} <b>eyes</b> of elasmobranchs (<b>skates,</b> sharks and rays). It can undergo pupillary light reflex {{to such an extent}} that the eye is essentially shut off. It is sometimes called the golden iris because of the shine it sometimes causes.|$|R
50|$|On March 31, 2015, Miller {{suffered}} two lacerations, one on {{his right}} cheek, and one above his right <b>eye,</b> after the <b>skate</b> of Mark Stone of the Ottawa Senators struck him in the face. The four-inch long cut required 60 stitches to close the lacerations. He did not sustain damage to his eye or his vision.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe clearnose skate (Raja eglanteria) {{develops}} {{in an almost}} opaque eggcase and lays its eggs in pairs. One sibling from each of eight pairs of skates was removed from its eggcase during embryonic development, while the other sibling developed inside the eggcase. The refractive development of the eyes at hatching was examined to see if ambient light exposure during embryonic development could influence the refractive states of hatchlings. Measurements included refractive states, ocular dimensions and lens focal properties. The differences in measurements {{between the two groups}} were not significant, which would indicate that environmental light does not influence the refractive development of the embryonic <b>skate</b> <b>eye...</b>|$|R
