5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have drawn}} much {{attention}} to Madagascar and its endangered species. In this capacity, they act as flagship species, the most notable {{of which is the}} ring-tailed lemur, which is considered an icon of the country. The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive ecotourism, which especially helps local communities living {{in the vicinity of the}} national parks, since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of Ranomafana National Park, <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> and other revenue from long-term research can rival that of ecotourism.|$|E

40|$|In much {{of studies}} on spatial {{mismatch}} between residential and employer locations, job accessibility has been measured. However, the apparent disadvantages of the traditional measurement methods on the studies of Chinese cities have been noted.   This paper proposed an optimized method for job accessibility measurement by introducing the weigh coefficient of <b>job</b> <b>opportunity,</b> which quantifies the degree of uneven distribution of <b>job</b> <b>opportunity</b> in the Chinese cities. Take Nanjing city for example, this new method {{was used to measure}} the spatial distribution of <b>job</b> <b>opportunity,</b> investigate the spatial patterns and analyze the influences of job accessibility on commuting behavior.

5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would {{be threatened by}} global competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles from these two nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 <b>job</b> <b>opportunities.</b> This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E

Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions, Bryn Mawr College in the United States and Somerville College at the University of Oxford in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.|$|E

5|$|The video, {{which cost}} Jackson $150,000 to create after CBS refused to finance it, was filmed on Los Angeles' Skid Row—mainly on {{locations}} on East 5th Street—around March 9, 1983. To add authenticity {{to the production}} but also to foster peace between them, Jackson had the idea to cast members of rival Los Angeles street gangs Crips and Bloods. In addition to around 80 genuine gang members, the video, which is noted for opening up many <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> for dancers in the US, also featured 18 professional dancers and four breakdancers. Besides Jackson, Michael Peters, and Vincent Paterson, the cast included Michael DeLorenzo, Stoney Jackson, Tracii Guns, Tony Fields, Peter Tramm, Rick Stone, and Cheryl Song.|$|E
5|$|Under Confucianism {{the typical}} family was patriarchal because men had the {{capability}} {{to pass on the}} family name and carry on the lineage of the ancestors; women were expected to be subservient. Adoption of Western family values in the twentieth century challenged traditional Chinese values. Nationalism contributed to the changes of customs and status of women. Nationalist revolutionary Qiu Jin promoted feminism through various essays and speeches, as well as through her Chinese Women's Journal. Jin chastised wife beating, female infanticide, arranged marriages, and foot binding. She eventually began teaching at a girls' school. Around this time, many other schools for girls opened in China. This led to increased <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> for women in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned. Many Iraqi Christians (Assyrians/Chaldeans) however settled temporarily or permanently in Jordan. Immigrants also include 15,000 Lebanese who arrived {{following the}} 2006 Lebanon War. Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. The effects are largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees do not live in camps. The refugee crisis effects include competition for <b>job</b> <b>opportunities,</b> water resources and other state provided services, along with the strain on the national infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|During the Internet bubble {{that led}} up to 2000, heavy {{investments}} in undersea fibre-optic cables linked Asia {{with the rest of the}} world. The fall that followed the economic boom resulted in the auction of cheap fiber optic cables at one-tenth of their original price. This development resulted in widely available low-cost communications infrastructure. All of these investments and events, not to mention a swell of available talent, resulted in India becoming almost overnight the centre for outsourcing of Business process. Within this sector and events, the ITES-BPO sector has become a big employment generator especially amongst young college graduates. The number of professionals employed by IT and ITES sectors is estimated at around 1.3million as of March 2006. Also, Indian IT-ITES is estimated to have helped create an additional 3 million <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> through indirect, induced and in helpful manner have created employment.|$|E
5|$|In {{planning}} the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing {{the relocation of}} an estimated 1,500 people. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was Fort Yukon, which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye, which lobbied against the project. The Tundra Times, an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly {{in opposition to the}} project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam. Don Young, Alaska's representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected to the Alaska Legislature in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration encouraged Japanese {{businessmen and}} settlers to the expand phosphate mining and copra production, which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era. During this time, new infrastructure was built between towns—including road and harbour facilities, and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out. Immigration from Japan, Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified {{as a result}} of new <b>job</b> <b>opportunities.</b> A state-owned enterprise, Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Colonization Corporation) was formed in 1936 to streamline the islands' economic activities with the administration objective of developing the islands' self-sufficiency capabilities. In the late 1930s, Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea, and stopped by Palau from October to April. The influx of pearl divers from Japan {{led to the development of}} the island's tourist industry, and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés, geisha houses and liquor houses in Koror to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April.|$|E

5|$|Vietnamese {{migrant workers}} started to arrive from 1992 onwards {{due to the}} {{creation}} of new <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> by the UNTAC administration. At the same time, the UNTAC administration allowed the opening of political offices and political parties such as FUNCINPEC and the BLDP began to propagate anti-Vietnamese sentiments among the populace to shore up electorate support in the 1993 general elections. In November 1992, the Khmer Rouge which controlled northwestern parts of Cambodia, passed a resolution to target systematic killings of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians. The first guerrilla-style attacks by the Khmer Rouge on Vietnamese civilians started in December 1992, and Khmer Rouge soldiers justified the killings by claiming that some of the civilians were Vietnamese soldiers in disguise. The spate of killings by Khmer Rouge prompted some 21,000 ethnic Vietnamese to flee to Vietnam in March 1993.|$|E
5|$|Wax was {{particularly}} involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations (MCCR). The MCCR {{was formed in}} 1958 {{by a group of}} Memphis city leaders, with a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> for blacks. Wax served as the MCCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces. Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior business executives convinced stores to hire black salespeople, Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis War on Poverty Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, the Home Office {{published}} a report evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills. The majority of women were not in work, reflecting a lack of <b>job</b> <b>opportunities</b> but also a lack of childcare provision.|$|E
