50|$|Nail prick is also simply called <b>horse</b> <b>shoe</b> <b>nail</b> {{misplacement}}. <b>Horse</b> <b>shoe</b> <b>nail</b> misplacement {{has several}} names and the terminology {{is not always}} used with exactly the same meaning. It is also called to puncture, to pinch, to prick, or to quick a horse. Quicking or nail-quicked is used both for the actual penetration (pricking) into the area with sensitive tissue of the horse's hoof and about a close nail that exerts pressure on the sensitive tissue. Colloquially it is also called hot nail.|$|E
50|$|The {{hamlet of}} Massie {{sits in the}} valley of the Bighead River and had {{settlers}} in the area in the 1840s. Charles Winter bought 200 acres in 1854 and the land was apportioned to various people after that. The sawmill was built in 1859 and the grist mill was built in 1863. By 1866 it also had a post office, blacksmith shop, <b>horse</b> <b>shoe</b> <b>nail</b> factory and a school house. There were approximately 100 people living in Massie in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Commerce {{continued}} to be {{an essential part of}} the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from <b>horse</b> <b>shoes</b> to <b>nails.</b> By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} annual {{price series}} for rye and barley in Östergötland {{during the period}} 1592 - 1735. Prices of wheat, oats, animal products, building materials, iron, <b>nails,</b> <b>horse</b> <b>shoes</b> and <b>horse</b> <b>shoe</b> <b>nails</b> from about the mid- 17 th century up to 1735 are also presented and analysed. New data has been excerpted from four hospitals and about fifty parishes in Östergötland. Prices from other provinces have also been excerpted for the study. This nes data is compared to already published prices from Sweden´s capital and from several provinces in central parts of the western national region of Sweden of that time. This area constituted Sweden´s core region. By linking the studies results to previous research, a description is made of the price developments for rye, butter and tallow up to 1775, that is, during Sweden´s period of great power and age of freedom. A principal result for the roughly 150 years primarily covered by the thesis {{is that it was}} chiefly the prices of rye and barley, the most important food at the time, that fluctuated in twelve cycles. Periodically there were large fluctuatons. The price cycles for corn (half rye, half barley) had an average amplitude of somewhat more than 100 % and a duration of 11 years on average. The prices were on average higher further north in the country. The causes of the price fluctuations are complex. During the major part of the period studied, Sweden was at war or in armistice period, which occupied {{a large part of the}} male population. Politically, increasingly great power was gradually concentrated to the king and autocracy was introduced, culminating at the end of Charles XII´s regency. The peasantry was burdened by high taxes and other onuses. After the middle of the 17 th century the country was no longer self-subsistent but largely dependent on corn import. The production of foddstuffs decreased, partly through a smaller part of the country´s resources beeing used for production, and partly due to bad harvests. Recurrent epidemics reduced the population even up to the early 18 th century...|$|R
40|$|From the {{following}} two phenomena the question arises whether shoeing horses regularly with iron <b>horse</b> <b>shoes</b> and <b>nails</b> may determine a compression of the circumflex artery of the sole and the area it supplies initiated by the direct pressure of the shoeing and thus be the cause for various acute and chronic dysfunctions occurring in hoof shoeing. The first phenomena is the often observed clammy movement of newly shod horses {{and the second is}} the detectable extinction of blood vessel patterns in the corium of the hoof when compressed by a hoof examination forceps. From 31 horses with healthy hooves that died or were euthanized at the Equine hospital of the Free University of Berlin, 71 specimens of hooves were obtained. The specimens were divided in three Groups: 28 of the formerly unshod specimens were shod by different techniques (tightly studded, loosely studded, and normally studded but weakened hoof sole), 18 of the specimens were already shod when obtained and left that way and 25 of the formerly unshod stayed unshod as reference group. The circumflex artery of the sole has been displayed by a radiographic contrast agent study of the coffin bone. Subsequently, the angiograms were examined for disruptions of the contrast filling in the circumflex artery of the sole. The results of this study did not reveal a correlation between filling defects at the circumflex artery of the sole and shoeing. Twelve percent (3 / 25) of the unshod reference group, 5, 6 % (1 / 18) of the previously shod and 7, 1 % (2 / 28) of the experimentally shod specimen showed at least one disruption of the circumflex artery of the sole. Shoeing horses with iron <b>horse</b> <b>shoes</b> and <b>nails</b> using correct shoeing technique could not produce a compression of the circumflex artery of the sole - even in specimens with thin soles. The experimental assembly did not allow any conclusion as to whether a compression of the circumflex artery of the sole relevant to blood flow could be induced when body weight of the horse and strain of movement are taken into consideration. Furthermore, pathophysiologic mechanism of tissue due to shoeing such as local inflammation triggering contraction of blood vessels and reduction of blood flow could not be observed with this study design. In vivo angiographic studies would be necessary to further evaluate these important questions...|$|R
