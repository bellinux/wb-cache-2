40|$|This article {{presents}} the results obtained from monitoring a VAV system with highly diversified zone occupancy density are presented in the article. The investigated VAV system meets the load for 72 zones (68 perimeters and 4 interiors) consisting of classrooms, offices, conference rooms, etc. with highly <b>diversified</b> <b>occupancy</b> densities from 1. 875 to 2. 5 m 2 /person for the classrooms and from 10 to 15 m 2 /person for the offices. The monitoring shows that the CO 2 concentration can exceed the set point in the critical rooms. Simulation results are also presented in the article {{to show that it}} is often impossible to adjust the operation of such VAV systems because the adjusted System Outdoor Air Fractions, % OA, can reach 100 % even where the zone CO 2 concentration is not respected. The presented monitoring and simulation results were obtained in the winter, with the VAV system operating at partial load and with the minimum outdoor air flowrate required by the economizer system. As shown in the article, to respect the zone set point CO 2 concentration in such period, the VAV system must operate mostly at a %OA equal to 100 % instead of its minimum value. To circumvent this, the supply zone air flow rate may have to be designed taking into account the CO 2 concentration resulting from the critical zones occupancy density...|$|E
