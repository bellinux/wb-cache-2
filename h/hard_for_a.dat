5|$|All the seeded players {{received}} a bye {{into the second}} round. Seven seeded players were ousted from the second round including third seed Jelena Janković, who was defeated by Gisela Dulko, and eighth seed Marion Bartoli, who lost to qualifier Anastasiya Yakimova. Second seed Dinara Safina, Vera Zvonareva and Ana Ivanovic were among the nine seeded players who were eliminated in the third round. Three times former champion and fifth seed Venus Williams faced stiff competition from Agnieszka Radwańska in fourth round. Williams lost the first set but prevailed in later sets to win the match. Li Na and Ekaterina Makarova also fought <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place in the quarterfinals, with Li coming out strong in the three set match, winning.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, Manmohan had {{determined}} {{to pursue a}} literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations {{but to do so}} when his father lacked money required that he studied <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it was simply too <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, and a tall and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.|$|E

5|$|An Allied council met on 1 December {{to discuss}} {{proposals}} for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making {{contact with the}} enemy and securing the southern flank that held the communication line to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was more cautious and, as mentioned, he was seconded by Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Russians and the Allied troops. The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief-of-Staff, Franz von Weyrother. This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The Russian Imperial Guard was held in reserve while Russian troops under Bagration guarded the Allied right. The Russian Tsar rudely stripped the authority of Commander-in-chief M. I. Kutuzov {{and gave it to}} Franz von Weyrother. In the battle, Kutuzov could only command the IV Corps of the Allied army, although he was still the de facto commander because the Tsar was afraid to take over in case his favoured plan failed.|$|E
25|$|This motivates {{the concept}} of a problem being <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{complexity}} class. A problem X is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.|$|E

25|$|In England Brogdens were {{offering}} better terms than the New Zealand government, {{mainly in the}} sense that they paid most of the necessary costs themselves, relying on promissory notes from the immigrants, whereas the government wanted substantial payments in advance which were <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> working man to find.

25|$|Staveley was {{promoted}} to full admiral on 29 October 1982 on appointment as Commander-in-Chief Fleet and NATO Commander-in-Chief, Channel and Commander-in-Chief Eastern Atlantic. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1984 Birthday Honours, he became First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff on 2 August 1985.

25|$|The Chiefs {{took the}} ball back and fought <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> winning field goal, driving into Dolphins {{territory}} where Okoye's 26-yard burst moved {{the ball to the}} 26-yard line. But on the next play, a holding call wiped out his 12-yard run and pushed the team back 10 yards. As the final seconds of the game approached, the Chiefs could only make it back to the 34. Lowery, who had made his last 22 field goals, attempted a game winner from 52 yards out, but it fell just short.|$|E
50|$|The {{security}} of a password-protected system depends on several factors. The overall system must, of course, be designed for sound security, with protection against computer viruses, man-in-the-middle attacks and the like. Physical security issues are also a concern, from deterring shoulder surfing to more sophisticated physical threats such as video cameras and keyboard sniffers. And, of course, passwords should be chosen {{so that they are}} <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> attacker to guess and <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> attacker to discover using any (and all) of the available automatic attack schemes.

25|$|The Symphony Hall organ, a 4,800-pipe Aeolian-Skinner (Opus 1134) was {{designed}} by G. Donald Harrison, installed in 1949, and autographed by Albert Schweitzer. It replaced the hall's first organ, built in 1900 by George S. Hutchings of Boston, which was electrically keyed, with 62 ranks of nearly 4,000 pipes set in a chamber 12 feet deep and 40 feet high. The Hutchings organ {{had fallen out of}} fashion by the 1940s when lighter, clearer tones became preferred. E.

25|$|The {{fact that}} Atlantis is a lost land has {{made of it}} a metaphor for {{something}} no longer attainable. For the American poet Edith Willis Linn Forbes (1865-1945), “The Lost Atlantis” stands for idealisation of the past; the present moment can only be treasured once that is realised. Ella Wheeler Wilcox finds the location of “The Lost Land” (1910) in one’s carefree youthful past. Similarly, for the Irish poet Eavan Boland in “Atlantis, a lost sonnet” (2007), the idea was defined when “the old fable-makers searched <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> word/ to convey that what is gone is gone forever”.|$|E

25|$|The Cougars {{opened the}} season at home, hosting the Northern Illinois Huskies, who played a very {{physical}} game, with the visitors from the Mid-American Conference racking up 14 fouls and 3 yellow cards. In the 17th minute, the normally stingy SIUE defense turned over the ball on a straight giveaway that NIU's Molina took and passed to Voss, who fired a booming shot from 25 yards out that left Dal Santo no chance for a save, and the Huskies took a 1–0 lead that held through halftime. The Cougars returned from the break fired up and working <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> shot. When the Huskies were called for a handball inside the 18 yard box in the 57th minute, Ledbetter stepped up and fired in the penalty shot to tie the score. For the remainder of regulation time and through two extra time periods, the two offenses jockeyed {{to find a good}} shot, and the defenses turned away attack after attack. After 110 minutes, the game ended in a 1–1 draw.|$|E
25|$|D.C.'s homestand {{continued}} with a match against the Eastern Conference leading Philadelphia Union. United {{took the lead}} when Kemp intercepted a pass in the defensive end, raced through the Union defense and beat the goalie to the far post. However, the Union tied the game on a free kick just before halftime. The visitors took the lead when Acosta was dispossessed {{as he tried to}} dribble out of the defensive end and former United star Chris Pontius continued a remarkable renaissance in his first season away from D.C. and put the Union ahead. United's coach, Ben Olsen was ejected late in the second half for protesting one of many uncalled fouls on Acosta. Despite missing their leader, United pushed <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tying goal. Despite having a couple of apparent goals waved off by the officials, the team finally found the tying goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time, when Birnbaum got his head {{on the end of a}} service into the box by Nyarko. Despite being only a draw, it was a very emotional goal for the players and fans, but the home draw meant the team remained outside of playoff contention.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E
