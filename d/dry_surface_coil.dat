40|$|A {{problem with}} high-field MRI {{is the lack}} of B 1 homogeneity, {{particularly}} signal cancellation in the outer parts of the head. Here we attempt to correct this by adding <b>surface</b> <b>coils.</b> To adjust the mutual coupling, we vary the resonance properties of the added coil. A new agar-based head phantom was built, and two <b>surface</b> <b>coils</b> were built and tuned. The <b>surface</b> <b>coils</b> were placed in various configurations against the phantom to modify the B 1 field with their presence, while images were taken using a 16 -rung birdcage coil to transmit and receive. Trials were taken with various spacings between the <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> and the phantom, while the resonance of the <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> was either shifted in frequency by changing the voltage across a varactor diode, or detuned using a resonant detuning circuit. It was discovered that with a 1 cm spacing and a <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> tuned just above resonance, SNR near the <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> could be improved by upwards of 400 %, with the trade-off of a reduced signal in other areas {{on the periphery of the}} head. Other configurations could achieve better B 1 homogeneity at the expense of reduced SNR throughout the head. Future studies will explore the possibility of using more than one <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> to improve SNR in more places on the periphery of the head. by Elizabeth K. Zakszewski. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Purpose: Going to {{ultrahigh}} field MRI (e. g., 7 Tesla [T]), the nonuniformity of the B_ 1 {{field and}} the increased radiofrequency (RF) power deposition become challenging. While <b>surface</b> <b>coils</b> improve the power efficiency in B_ 1, its field remains nonuniform. In this work, an RF pulse was designed that uses the slab selection to compensate the inhomogeneous B_ 1 field of a <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> without {{a substantial increase in}} specific absorption rate (SAR). Theory and Methods: A breast <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> was used with a decaying B_ 1 field in the anterior- posterior direction of the human breast. Slab selective RF pulses were designed and compared with adiabatic and spokes RF pulses. Proof of principle was demonstrated with FFE and B_ 1 maps of the human breast. ResultsIn vivo measurements obtained with the breast <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> show that the tilt optimized flip uniformity (TOFU) RF pulses can improve the flip angle homogeneity by 31 %, while the SAR will be lower compared with BIR- 4 and spokes RF pulses. ConclusionBy applying TOFU RF pulses to the breast <b>surface</b> <b>coil,</b> we are able to compensate the inhomogeneous field, while keeping the SAR low. Therefore stronger T- 1 -weighting in FFE sequences can be obtained, while pulse durations can remain short, as shown in the human breast at 7 T. Magn Reson Med 74 : 482 - 488, 2015.

40|$|A {{high-temperature}} superconductor (HTS) {{was used}} on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) receiver coils to improve image quality because of its intrinsic low electrical resistivity [1], [2]. Typical HTS <b>coils</b> are <b>surface</b> <b>coils</b> made of HTS thin-film wafers. Their applications are severely limited by {{the field of view}} (FOV) of the <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> configuration, and the improvement in image quality by HTS coil is also reduced as the ratio of sample noise to coil noise increases. Therefore, previous HTS coils are usually used to image small in vitro samples, small animals, or peripheral human anatomies [3]-[5]. We used large-size HTS coils (2. 5 -, 3. 5 -, and 5. 5 -in mean diameter) to enhance the FOV and we evaluated their performance through phantom and human MR images. Comparisons were made among HTS <b>surface</b> <b>coils,</b> copper <b>surface</b> <b>coils,</b> and cool copper <b>surface</b> <b>coils</b> in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity profile of the images.

We then selected several human body parts, including the wrist, feet, and head, to illustrate the advantage of HTS coil over copper coil when used in human imaging. The results show an SNR gain of 200 % for 5. 5 -in HTS coil versus same size copper coils, while for 2. 5 - and 3. 5 -in coils it is 250 %. We also address the various factors that affect the performance of large size HTS coils, including the coil-to-sample spacing due to cryogenic probe and the coil-loading effect. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-two asymptomatic volunteers were MR-imaged using a 2 -channel <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> (standard TMJ coil) and a 32 -channel head coil at 3. 0 T (Philips Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). Imaging protocol consisted of an oblique sagittal PDw-TSE sequence (TR/TE, 2700 / 26 ms). For quantitative assessment, a spherical phantom was imaged using the same sequence including a noise scan and a B 1 + scan. Signal-to-noise-ratio-(SNR) -maps and B 1 + maps were calculated on a voxel-wise basis. For qualitative evaluation, all volunteers underwent MR imaging of both TMJs with the jaw in closed position. Two independent blinded readers assessed accuracy of TMJ anatomical representation and overall image quality on a 5 -point-scale. Quantitative and qualitative measurements were compared between coils using t-tests and wilcoxon-rank test, respectively.

40|$|The use of <b>surface</b> <b>coils</b> in {{magnetic}} resonance imaging offers significant improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio over volume coils for many applications. However, the inhomogeneous reception profile of <b>surface</b> <b>coils</b> hampers their usefulness by introducing significant nonuniformities or intensity variations which can vary by greater than six-fold across the sample. In this study, we evaluated an automatic technique for retrospective correction of intensity variations observed in a high-resolution <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> MR image of the rat brain obtained using an adiabatic {{magnetic resonance}} imaging sequence. The images are shown to have a coefficient of variation less than 12 % following application of this correction algorithm.

To assess if 3 T MRI can {{be further}} {{improved}} by adding <b>surface</b> <b>coil</b> imaging, {{in the context of}} detection and characterization of cerebral lesions in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods. Twenty five patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery were examined with high resolution 3 T MRI. The patients were MRI-negative (n = 15), or had unclear findings (n = 10), on previous MRI at 1. 0 - 1. 5 T. <b>Surface</b> <b>coils</b> were applied over the suspected epileptogenic zone after imaging in the head coil.

A major downside of <b>surface</b> <b>coils</b> is their inherent radiofrequency (RF) B 1 heterogeneity across the FOV, decreasing with increasing distance from the coil and giving rise to image distortions due to non-uniform spatial responses. A robust way to compensate for B 1 inhomogeneities is to employ adiabatic inversion pulses, yet these are not well adapted to all imaging sequences - including to single-shot approaches like echo planar imaging (EPI). Hybrid spatiotemporal encoding (SPEN) sequences relying on frequency-swept pulses provide another ultrafast MRI alternative, that could help solve this problem thanks to their built-in heterogeneous spatial manipulations.
