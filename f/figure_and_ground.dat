In return Fantuzzi adopted a number of technical tricks developed by engravers and translatable to etching, very likely with instruction from Davent. [...] His early style is [...] "rather brutal in appearance" [...] when copying Giulio Romano, and [...] "angular and restless" [...] when copying Rosso Fiorentino, but he moved to a gentler and more harmonious style closer to Primaticcio. [...] Suzanne Boorsch says that his early style was [...] "full of energy but lacked discipline, so that in some of the prints a violent light and strokes in many directions cause <b>figures</b> <b>and</b> <b>grounds</b> to be confused...

40|$|ABSTRACT—The {{question}} of whether or not figure-ground segmentation can occur without attention is unresolved. Early theorists assumed it can, but the evidence is scant and open to alternative interpretations. Recent research indicating that attention can influence figure-ground seg-mentation raises the question anew. We examined this issue by asking participants to perform a demanding change-detection task on a small matrix presented on a task-irrelevant scene of alternating regions organized into fig-ures <b>and</b> <b>grounds</b> by convexity. Independently of any change in the matrix, the figure-ground organization of the scene changed or remained the same. Changes in scene organization produced congruency effects on target-change judgments, even though, when probed with surprise ques-tions, participants could report neither the figure-ground status of the region on which the matrix appeared nor any change in that status. When attending to the scene, par-ticipants reported figure-ground status and changes to it highly accurately. These results clearly demonstrate that figure-ground segmentation can occur without focal at-tention. Figure-ground segmentation is the process by which the visual system organizes a visual scene into <b>figures</b> <b>and</b> their back-grounds. This is one of the most important visual processes because figure-ground distinctions are fundamental to the visual perception of objects and to visuomotor behavior. Gestalt psychologists, who were the first to recognize the importance of figure-ground segmentation, distinguished <b>figures</b> <b>and</b> <b>grounds</b> in terms of their phenomenal appearance (Koffka, 1935; Rubin, 1915 / 1958). Figures appear to have a definite shape, so that their bounding contours are assigned as belonging to them. Grounds are shapeless near the contours they share with <b>figures</b> <b>and</b> appear to continue behind the figures near those contours. Much of the research on figure-ground percep-tion has been concerned with identifying the properties that determine which regions will appear as figures. For example, smaller regions are likely to be perceived as figures (Rubin, 1915 / 1958), as are symmetrical regions (Bahnsen, 1928), con...|$|R

40|$|Comics, also {{commonly}} called graphic novels, graphic narratives, graphic stories and sequential art {{to name a}} few, suggest an uncertainty about its definition. I define comics by what I believe is its chief signifier, juxtaposed narrative images, {{but what does it}} mean to say this? I aim to explore this by producing a work specifically for a gallery space, which may highlight the disparities and commonalities in the methodologies and modes of encounter between comics and the visual arts, specifically the concept of reading. I make reference to narrative fresco cycles as a source and comparison. From this, I propose some properties that can be extrapolated to any work that uses images in juxtaposition that contain recognisably identical elements such as <b>figures</b> <b>and</b> <b>ground.</b> Comics' images generate within a reader a sense of time occurring, and a 'feel' for a place-key components of narrative. This 'reading' generates an immersion in the depicted images, principally through developing a relationship between the reader and the characters similar to that between people, primarily by utilising two visual languages we use every day: facial expressions and body language. This is an intersection where the literary arts merge with the visual in a distinct way...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary popular discourses about Islam, shari’a and Islamic {{law in the}} West {{is often}} filled with the issues of terrorism, anti-democracy, human rights {{violation}} and women’s minor status in Islam, which all lead into negative perception. Unlike such popular views, Western scholars perceive shari’a from various perspectives. They are quite critical to shari’a in a positive sense. This article discusses Western scholarly discourses on shari’a by comparing the thoughts and works of two most prominent figures, Wael B. Hallaq and M. Barry Hooker, who always concern with shari’a, Islamic law and related social issues, such modernity, colonialism and legal system. Based {{on the model of}} the study of public <b>figure</b> <b>and</b> <b>grounded</b> its main data on Hallaq’s and Hooker’s main work, this study shows that these two scholars promote idealistic and contextual perception on shari’a.

The contextual view regards shari’a as flexible Islamic religious or legal norms that are adaptable to the changing social and political environments so they are easily transferrable into the educational, legal and political system in a country like Indonesia, entailing what is called “national mazhab”...|$|R

50|$|How {{does the}} brain decide in a visual scene which item is the <b>figure</b> <b>and</b> which {{are part of}} the ground? This perceptual {{decision}} can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size helps us distinguish between the <b>figure</b> <b>and</b> the <b>ground,</b> since smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can help us distinguish figure from ground, because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue, because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. But it's at times difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is really part of neither, it equally defines both the <b>figure</b> <b>and</b> the background.|$|R
