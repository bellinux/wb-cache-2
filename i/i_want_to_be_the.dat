500|$|In 1994, {{ski flying}} {{returned}} to a newly independent Slovenia, where the hill in Planica had been reprofiled {{with the aim of}} allowing for jumps of more than 200m. The FIS was strongly against this and initially threatened to cancel the event on the grounds that its regulations on hill design had been violated. Negotiations between the organisers in Planica and the FIS managed to defuse the situation, allowing that year's Ski Flying World Championships to take place. Before the event, Espen Bredesen said: [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first , but I think that [...] or [...] are also possible." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{filming of}} Lizzy Borden's movie Forced Entry, which {{included}} several simulated rapes, {{was covered in}} the PBS Frontline documentary American Porn which aired on February 7, 2002; the makers of the documentary were repulsed and walked off the set. Zicari was interviewed in the documentary; he defended the company's content and challenged Attorney General John Ashcroft {{to take action against}} him. Zicari stated in an interview for the program, [...] "We've got tons of stuff they technically could arrest us for. I'm not out there saying <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> test case. But I will be the test case. I would welcome that. I would welcome the publicity.

2500|$|Although Knievel never {{attempted}} to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash. [...] During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, [...] "I don't {{care if they}} say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that thing {{off the edge of}} the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first. If they'd let me go to the moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there." [...] For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon. Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.|$|E

2500|$|He {{became his}} country's first ever medallist at the World Junior Championships in Barcelona, missing his {{aim of the}} {{championship}} record but still winning {{by a margin of}} more than half a second in 44.85. [...] Acknowledging his quick progression, he said: [...] "so far only Americans have finished in under 44 seconds, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first from somewhere else". He was beaten to that distinction by Grenada's Kirani James in the 400m final at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Santos was next to finish after James, however, as he ran within 0.01 of his personal best time to claim an unexpected Olympic silver medal. His was the third ever medal for the Dominican Republic, coming just 45 minutes after Felix Sánchez won his second Olympic gold. A team of Gustavo Cuesta, Felix Sánchez, Joel Mejia and Santos appeared to have qualified for the 4 × 400 m relay final, but the second baton change was outside of the changeover zone and the team was disqualified.|$|E
