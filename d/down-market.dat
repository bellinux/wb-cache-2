5|$|The square was {{originally}} a gentrified residential area, with tenants including Frederick, Prince of Wales and artists William Hogarth and Joshua Reynolds. It became more <b>down-market</b> {{in the late}} 18th century as Leicester House was demolished and retail developments took place, becoming a centre for entertainment. Several major theatres were established in the 19th century, which were converted to cinemas towards {{the middle of the}} next. Leicester Square holds a number of nationally important cinemas such as the Odeon Leicester Square, Empire, Leicester Square and the now closed Odeon West End, which are frequently used for film premieres, The nearby Prince Charles Cinema is popular for showing cult films and marathon film runs. The square remains a popular tourist attraction, including hosting events for the Chinese New Year.|$|E

Toledo’s administration sought to improve access to affordable housing through subsidies, loans, down payments, land titling, and encouraging financial institutions to reach further <b>down-market.</b> Most of these efforts were grouped under the Fondo Mivivienda, which was a program started in 1999.|$|E

MacKenzie introduced features such as nightly editions of 'Topless Darts' (featuring topless women playing darts on a beach), 'The Weather in Norwegian' (with a young, typically blonde and bikini-clad Scandinavian woman presenting weather forecasts in both English and Norwegian), other weather forecasts featuring dwarfs bouncing on trampolines and stock exchange reports presented by Tiffany, a young female presenter who would strip to her underwear as she read out the latest share prices. A large amount of airtime was given over to tarot card readers and astrologers.

40|$|Performance {{of active}} fund {{managers}} {{continues to be}} examined in finance literature. Current convictions are that different investment styles perform {{at different stages of}} the market cycle. Specifically, active manager 2 ̆ 7 s claim that performance is better in bear markets rather than in bull markets. Therefore, this paper examines whether active managers risk adjusted performance is superior in <b>down-markets</b> rather than in up-markets. The performance of 58 mutual funds is examined, as well as the performance of the Fama and French 25 portfolios sorted by size and book-to-market equity. Performance is measured by Jensen 2 ̆ 7 s (1 968) alpha and Fama and French (1 993) and Carhart (1 997) asset-pricing models. The results show little evidence of manager 2 ̆ 7 s outperformance. The results also show no evidence to performance being superior in <b>down-markets</b> rather than in up-markets. Rather, the number of positive alphas is greater in bull markets; however differences between the two market stages are not statistically significant. ii...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an empirical study of shortfall optimization with Barra Extreme Risk. We compare minimum shortfall to minimum variance portfolios in the US, UK, and Japanese equity markets using Barra Style Factors (Value, Growth, Momentum, etc.). We show that minimizing shortfall generally improves performance over minimizing variance, especially during <b>down-markets,</b> {{over the period}} 1985 - 2010. The outperformance of shortfall is due to intuitive tilts towards protective factors like Value, and away from aggressive factors like Growth and Momentum. The outperformance is largest for the shortfall that measures overall asymmetry rather than the extreme losses. ...|$|R

A distinguishing feature of our paper is that our tests allow for a conditional relationship between systematic risk (beta) and returns in our tests, i. e., conditional on whether the excess market return is positive or negative. We find strong {{evidence in support of}} a conditional beta/return relationship which in turn reveals conditionality in the pricing of idiosyncratic risk. We find that idiosyncratic risk is significantly negatively priced in stock returns in <b>down-markets.</b> Although perhaps initially counter-intuitive, we describe the theoretical support for such a finding in the literature. Our results also reveal a strong role for liquidity, size and momentum factors in explaining the cross-section of U. K. stock returns...|$|R

500|$|The fear {{of nuclear}} war with the Soviet Union, along with less expressible qualms about {{radioactive}} fallout from America's own atomic tests, energized many of the era's genre films. Science fiction, horror, and various hybrids of the two were now of central economic importance to the low-budget end of the business. Most <b>down-market</b> films of the type—like many of those produced by William Alland at Universal (e.g., Creature from the Black Lagoon [...] ) and Sam Katzman at Columbia (e.g., It Came from Beneath the Sea [...] )—provided little more than thrills, though their special effects could be impressive. But these were genres whose fantastic nature {{could also be used}} as cover for mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies. Director Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), released by Allied Artists, treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting, allegorical fashion. The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), directed by Bert I. Gordon, is both a monster movie that happens to depict the horrific effects of radiation exposure and [...] "a ferocious cold-war fable [...] spins Korea, the army's obsessive secrecy, and America's post-war growth into one fantastic whole." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{new system}} of {{government}} in Athens opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like Themistocles, who previously {{would have had no}} access to power. Moreover, the new institutions of the democracy required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. Themistocles was to prove himself a master of the new system; [...] "he could infight, he could network, he could spin... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible." [...] Themistocles moved to the Ceramicus, a <b>down-market</b> part of Athens. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to interact more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens: [...] "he wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter's name, Themistocles had set his eyes on a radical new constituency" [...] However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of Athens. He began to practice law, the first person in Athens to prepare for public life in this way. His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used {{in the service of the}} common people, gained him further popularity.|$|E
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{explores the}} cross-sectional relationship between stock returns and some firm-specific characteristics in the Chinese A-share {{market for the}} period 1994 to 2002. First, our results indicate that beta lacks explanatory power even when its effect is examined alone in the regression analysis. We also find that size has the most significant effect in capturing variations in stock returns over the whole period. Moreover, while previous studies {{have concluded that the}} A-share market is driven by market rumour and individual investors&# 039; sentiment, this analysis suggests that the book-to-market ratio is also significantly priced. Finally, the use of beta as a measure of systematic risk in China remains unsupported when the beta effect is re-examined in up-markets and <b>down-markets</b> respectively...|$|R
40|$|Active {{investment}} managers provide {{two types}} of return: the return generated from market exposure or “beta ” and the return that comes from selection skill or “alpha. ” Active “beta ” returns typically come from market timing. That is, increasing market exposure in up-markets and decreasing it in <b>down-markets.</b> Passive beta returns come from index fund exposure. “Alpha ” comes from security selection within an asset class. As such, the value-added from a true alpha strategy does not depend upon {{the direction of the}} market. A true stock-picker, for instance, would have a beta of 1. 0 relative to their market benchmark, and all value-added would come from their “active risk ” or stock picking. Portable alpha refers to the process of separating the alpha from the beta and then applying it to other portfolios. Our focus here is to show how investors can obtain portable alphas via traditional long-only strategies and explore the effects of implementing portable alphas in a variety of investment scenarios and provide a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks. ...|$|R
40|$|The pricing of {{financial}} assets {{lies at the}} heart of modern financial theory. Pricing functions value assets by the cash flow they produce and the risk associated with this cash flow. The pioneering work of Sharpe, Linter and Black (SLB) developed an asset pricing function that prices assets with the knowledge of only 1 type of risk—market risk. ^ By summing the n-dimensional concept of risk into a single metric (beta), the SLB model has tremendous appeal. However, the SLB model has been hit with numerous challenges during empirical analysis, thereby questioning its validity. These challenges, or anomalies, include size- and book-to-market-effects, plus the evidence of a January seasonal in the cross-section of asset returns. ^ It is difficult to apply ex post tests to a model that is based on ex ante expectations, such as the SLB model. This dissertation analyzes the power of the SLB model in an empirical model that recognizes its expectational nature. These tests show that the SLB model has explanatory power in the cross-section of returns, as the beta-effect is of equal magnitude and is symmetric across markets that are characterized with positive and negative risk-adjusted returns. This dissertation also shows that the size-effect is not symmetric across up- and <b>down-markets,</b> thereby questioning its role as a proxy for risk. Finally, this dissertation finds that the book-to-market effect does not show intertemporal consistency. ...|$|R

2500|$|It is {{not clear}} that the term B movie (or B film or B picture) was in general use before the 1930s; in terms of studio production, however, a similar concept was already well {{establish}}ed. In 1916, Universal became the first Hollywood studio to establish different feature brands based on production cost: the small Jewel line of [...] "prestige" [...] productions, midrange Bluebird releases, and the low-budget Red Feather line of five-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time between fifty minutes and an hour. The following year, the Butterfly line, a grade between Red Feather and Bluebird, was introduced. During those two years, about half of Universal's output was in the Red Feather and Butterfly categories. According to historian Thomas Schatz, [...] "These low-grade westerns, melodramas, and action pictures...underwent a disciplined production and marketing process," [...] in contrast to the Jewels, which were not as strictly governed by studio policies. While the <b>down-market</b> branding was soon eliminated, Universal continued to focus on low and modestly budgeted productions. In 1919, wealthy Paramount Pictures created its own distinct low-budget brand: the company's Realart films were made attractive to exhibitors with lower rental fees than movies from the studio's primary production line. Indicating the breadth of the budgetary range at a single studio, in 1921, when the average cost of a Hollywood feature was around $60,000, Universal spent approximately $34,000 on The Way Back, a five-reeler, and over $1 million on Foolish Wives, a top-of-the-line Super Jewel. The production of inexpensive films like The Way Back allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel.|$|E
