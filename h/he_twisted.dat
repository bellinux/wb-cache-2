He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and <b>he</b> <b>twisted</b> her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
5|$|After the games, Evans {{returned}} to the United States to continue his studies and collegiate swimming career. Before the 1984 Olympics, Evans travelled to Hong Kong to train with Haller, who was coaching the British colony's swimming team. Evans revitalised himself under his favourite coach and {{returned to}} his old style of sprinting. <b>He</b> <b>twisted</b> his ankle later in Perth and missed some training time. He won the Australian 100m breaststroke championship to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and returned to Arizona to continue training. His Olympic campaign was placed in jeopardy when the ASU threatened to remove Evans from the team for skipping their training camp in Australia. The threat was withdrawn after Evans' father confronted the ASU and pointed out that his son was training, although in a different location. Before the Games, Evans joined the Australians for their final training camp at Stanford University in California. Evans arrived in Los Angeles with the same program as in Moscow; he entered both breaststroke events and the medley relay. Evans started brightly to win his heat of the 100m breaststroke in an Olympic record time of 1m 2.87s. His new mark did not last long—John Moffet broke it in a later heat to relegate Evans to the second-fastest qualifying time.|$|E

A six-person, 11-hour search of Thompson's home turned up various kinds of drugs and a few sticks of dynamite. All charges were dismissed after a pre-trial hearing.

After only scoring 5 runs in England's innings and an expensive start with the ball, he later took 3 wickets in 3 overs in his second spell as Bangladesh missed the follow-on target. Pakistan toured England in July and Shahzad was included in England's 12-man squad for the first Test. A week {{in advance of the}} Test, <b>he</b> <b>twisted</b> his ankle in a match for Yorkshire.

25|$|He {{was offered}} a {{professional}} contract with Swansea Town {{at the age of}} seventeen, and he immediately settled into the Second Division side. His debut came at Bramall Lane on 20 December 1952, in {{what turned out to be}} a 7–1 defeat to Sheffield United. However his progress was halted when <b>he</b> <b>twisted</b> his knee on National Service, though this injury came as he was messing around outside the cook house rather than on parade or in the 9th Battalion's march to the Army Cup. He went straight back into the first team upon his recovery, and he was played mostly at centre-half, or in his preferred position at right-half. He remained in the first eleven under Ron Burgess, who was appointed manager following McCandless' death in July 1955.|$|E

He missed 51 games {{as a result of the}} injury, but scored a goal and an assist on his return, a 4–1 victory over the Hartford Whalers. Despite missing the majority of the season, Reinhart was the Flames' offensive leader in the 1984 playoffs, leading the team and finishing first amongst all players who did not reach the finals with 17 points.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the ship}} was not damaged by Japanese forces, the Monterey {{was one of several}} ships damaged by the typhoon that hit Admiral William Halsey's Third Fleet on December 18–19, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three destroyers and over 800 men during the typhoon. The Monterey was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's {{aircraft}} tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide {{toward the edge of the}} deck.

500|$|Though Everton {{had won a}} {{place in}} the European Cup, English clubs were banned from European {{competitions}} following the Heysel Stadium disaster. Southall remained bitter over this, blaming UEFA for the tragedy and stating that the ban was a convenient way to break up English dominance of European competitions. Limited to domestic competitions, Everton won the FA Charity Shield with a 2–0 win over Manchester United; during the celebrations Southall wore a T-shirt saying [...] "I Love My Wife" [...] as a symbolic gesture following tabloid stories of an alleged affair. After getting sent off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October, Kendall criticised Southall in the press by saying he [...] "let the lads down". Despite this set-back, he agreed to sign a six-year contract in December, which was then the longest contract the club had ever issued. However, <b>he</b> <b>twisted</b> his ankle ligaments on international duty with ten league games left to play. In his absence, his deputy Bobby Mimms took his place, and Everton lost both the league title and the 1986 FA Cup Final to Liverpool.|$|E
500|$|Unusually for an Australian, Johnson bowled off-spin {{rather than}} the wrist spin {{normally}} associated with countrymen of his day. [...] Johnson had an atypical bowling action, with a [...] "rather staccato swing" [...] of his bowling arm. He bowled {{with a high degree}} of flight, causing opposing batsmen difficulties in judging where the ball would land. Making intelligent use of the wind, Johnson was able to make his deliveries float away from the batsman, changing from his standard off-break. According to E. W. Swanton, Johnson was [...] "probably the slowest bowler to achieve any measure of success in Test cricket". [...] His action was compared to a corkscrew; writer Ray Robinson saying that [...] "to coax turn from firm Australian pitches <b>he</b> <b>twisted</b> the ball almost hard enough to screw a doorknob off". [...] There were doubts about the legality of his bowling action; his English rival, Trevor Bailey claimed Johnson threw every delivery. [...] Johnson was never no-balled for throwing, having played cricket in front of umpires from Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, India and Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|In November 1999, Overmars scored {{his first}} hat-trick for Arsenal, {{at home to}} Middlesbrough. His {{performance}} was lauded by journalist Lynne Truss, who wrote in The Times, [...] "Overmars was in top Jack Russell form, bounding after the ball and prepared to savage anybody who tried {{to take it away}} from him." [...] <b>He</b> <b>twisted</b> his ankle in action for Arsenal against Sheffield Wednesday in January 2000 and was out of action for six weeks. Unlike the previous two seasons, Arsenal never did pose a serious threat to Manchester United, who went on to retain the league in 1999–2000. Overmars had suggested before the campaign that Arsenal were as strong as their rivals, [...] "especially in attack where we now have so many more options". Arsenal ended the league season strongly, winning eight games in a row between March and May to move from fifth to second place. In April 2000, Overmars scored the winning goal against Everton and was the standout performer in the game. His final game for Arsenal was the 2000 UEFA Cup Final against Galatasaray, which they lost 4–1 on penalties after a goalless draw.|$|E

500|$|Dougan {{was signed}} by Aston Villa in July 1961 for a fee of £15,000. He {{was signed by}} manager Joe Mercer as a {{replacement}} for Gerry Hitchens, who had been sold on to Inter Milan earlier in the summer for £85,000. Teammate Peter McParland later commented that [...] "when Derek came to us at Aston Villa I think it was {{at a time when he}} was not taking the game particularly seriously". After returning from watching his [...] "Villans" [...] teammates win the 1961 League Cup Final at Villa Park on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate Bobby Thomson was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving. In November 2010 – three years after Dougan's death, Thomson claimed that Dougan had drunkenly pulled a deerstalker hat over his eyes, causing him to crash the car. Dougan recovered after three months on the sidelines and ended the 1961–62 season with 12 goals in 27 matches. <b>He</b> <b>twisted</b> his knee midway through the 1962–63 campaign after slipping in the street, and ended the season with 14 goals from 33 games.|$|E
500|$|Success {{finally came}} in the 2001–02 season. Arsenal regained the league, beating Manchester United at Old Trafford in the {{penultimate}} {{game of the season}} to complete the club's second double under Wenger; Arsenal defeated Chelsea 2–0 to win the FA Cup four days prior. Bergkamp played in 33 league matches, setting up 15 goals, one of which was against Juventus in the second group stage of the Champions League. Holding off two markers, <b>he</b> <b>twisted</b> and turned before feeding the ball to Freddie Ljungberg in the penalty box to score. Bergkamp headed in the winner against Liverpool in a FA Cup fourth-round tie on 27 January 2002, but was shown a red card for a two-footed lunge on defender Jamie Carragher, who himself was sent off for throwing a coin into the crowd. He was subsequently banned for three matches (two league, one FA Cup round). Bergkamp appealed for his ban, but was unsuccessful. He made his return against Newcastle United on 3 March 2002. Early in the match, Arsenal midfielder Robert Pirès played a low pass from the left flank to Bergkamp in the edge of the opponent area with his back to goal. Under pressure from his marker Nikos Dabizas, Bergkamp controlled the ball with one flick and went around the other side before placing the ball precisely into the bottom right-hand corner to score. Wenger described the goal as [...] "unbelievable", adding [...] "It was not only a magnificent goal but a very important one – I enjoyed it a lot". Bergkamp featured in nine out of the last ten league games, forming a productive partnership with Ljungberg.|$|E
500|$|The Longhorns were {{in control}} of the Iowa State game almost from the very {{beginning}} and they routed the Cyclones 56–3, the worst loss for the Cyclones since 1997. Lined up in the spread offense on the first play from scrimmage, Colt McCoy scrambled away from a blitz and threw a pass to Jordan Shipley for a 58-yard touchdown. The offensive line provided great protection for Colt McCoy, who called most of the plays without huddling and directed the Longhorns to touchdowns on his first five series. He completed 23 of 30 passes for 298 yards, 4 touchdowns, and no interceptions. His most athletic play came early in the third quarter when he evaded three defenders on a play from the Cyclones' 20-yardline. <b>He</b> <b>twisted</b> around and managed to stay upright long enough to throw a pass to Nate Jones in the end zone. He capped off his performance by making his first rushing touchdown of the season, a career-long, 44-yard run in the third quarter. The play was designed to be a screen pass to the fullback. Mack Brown said, [...] "Colt was as good today as I've ever seen him." [...] Brown also praised McCoy for taking on more of a leadership role with the team. The Austin American-Statesman said, [...] "Colt McCoy is shedding his sophomore slump. In the past two games, he is 42 of 56 passing for 622 yards with six passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown and just one interception. That translates to a quarterback rating of 200.1." [...] However, against Baylor on October 20, Colt would go on to throw 2 interceptions and 1 touchdown, and against Nebraska the following week, McCoy completed less than 50% of his passes and threw another interception. On the day after Thanksgiving, McCoy was 17 of 32 with 1 interception, while be sacked 4 times in the 38-30 loss to Texas A At the conclusion of the 2007 regular season, Mccoy had thrown for 21 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.|$|E

[...] The same play was hardly to be expected so soon, and in exactly the same way. [...] Yet, that was the strategy. [...] Wells ran to the sideline as before and threw diagonally down the field as before to Borleske. [...] Michigan now had four yards to go. [...] Every spectator on his feet, the Minnesota crowd crying, 'hold,' 'hold.' [...] It was a serious moment for both sides, and they took time to breathe and collect themselves for the supreme effort. [...] Wells was hurled against center, but the whole Minnesota team got into the defense and stopped the play about where it had started. [...] The next attack was deceptive.
