5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I am playing a horn.
