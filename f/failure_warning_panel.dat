5000|$|In July 2016 Hornby {{released}} three {{versions of}} the HA /class 71 (all with working pantograph); these being E5001 (green, red stripes post-1963 rainstrips and with small <b>warning</b> <b>panel),</b> 71 012 (blue full yellow ends), E5022 (green, red stripes and without yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> or post-1963 rainstrips). A further version was produced exclusively for the NRM, this being E5001 (green, red stripe, post-1963 rainstrips but without yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels).</b> More versions are expected in 2017.|$|R

5000|$|When first introduced, the REPs {{appeared}} in overall rail blue livery with small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> and small aluminium BR arrows below their side cab windows. The yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> were subsequently enlarged {{to cover the}} whole cab front. They were repainted during the early 1970s into blue and grey, losing their aluminium arrows in the process, as these had been the cause of damage to carriage washing plants; the 1974 builds emerged in blue and grey livery from new. Surviving REPs saw an application of Network SouthEast flashes from 1986 onwards, while the Class 442 [...] "Wessex Electrics" [...] were being built.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels,</b> now {{characteristic}} of British railways, {{were added to}} the fronts of diesel and electric locomotives and multiple units in order to increase the safety of track workers.|$|R
50|$|Of {{those that}} were repainted blue, numbers 7007, 7010, 7034, 7036, 7046, 7047, 7051, 7052, 7056, 7057 and 7059 (at least) did not receive the full yellow end, only the small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{the initial}} batch of Westerns was {{being built in}} 1961-2, British Rail was {{considering}} a new unified corporate colour scheme but had not yet made a final decision on what it would be. As a result, {{some of the early}} locomotives were painted in experimental liveries: D1000 was rolled out of Swindon Works in November 1961 painted in Desert Sand. Initially the numbers, borne on the left hand cab when viewed from the side, were painted in white but soon individual numbers and letters, looking like they were cast but apparently made of wood, were fitted. This was in turn replaced by the final design of cast nameplate and numberplate; metal with a black background. This livery was later altered by the addition of a small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel</b> and black roof. After this, D1001 was delivered in all over maroon livery with yellow buffer beams and D1002-D1004 in all over green and small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel.</b> The remaining deliveries were all in maroon, with small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> after D1010 and D1043 of the Crewe built locomotives. Exceptions to this were the initial Crewe-built batch D1035-D1038 which were in green with red backgrounds to the nameplates and D1015, outshopped in the experimental [...] "golden ochre" [...] livery with small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels.</b> On one end of D1015, the yellow panel was embellished by the addition of a yellow band which extended sideways from each of the top corners and round and onto the cabside for a short distance, resembling a T shape.|$|R
50|$|A trimmer <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> was {{triggered}} at 14:07:15, and at 14:08, engine dislodging indicators were also triggered. The flight engineer warned {{the crew to}} operate the throttle slowly.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Preserved no. D5301 {{painted in}} {{original}} green livery without yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> inside the shed on the Lakeside & Haverthwaite Railway on 31 May 2005. This {{was one of}} the final locomotives in traffic, being withdrawn in late 1994.|$|R
50|$|The Class 306 trains were {{withdrawn}} in {{the early}} 1980s, and one unit, 306017, has been preserved. It has been repainted in a near original green livery, albeit with a yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel</b> on the front to comply with present-day safety regulations.|$|R
50|$|During the mid 1960s rail blue appeared, {{and white}} cab roofs were {{gradually}} dispensed with and buffer beams became black. Initially the yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> were expanded {{to cover the}} complete lower front of the driving cabs and later the whole cab fronts became yellow.|$|R
50|$|They were {{delivered}} in an unlined medium shade of Brunswick green with white cab roofs and yellow speed whiskers. The whiskers were replaced {{during the early}} 1960s by split yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels,</b> one {{either side of the}} central character train describer which remained green.|$|R
50|$|A power <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> that alerts {{the user}} by {{flashing}} a temperature display. It may display the maximum temperature reached during the power failure, and whether frozen food has defrosted or may contain harmful bacteria.|$|R
25|$|The Vale of Rheidol Railway {{remained}} steam operated {{past the}} general end of steam traction in 1968, and accordingly the three remaining Vale of Rheidol Railway locomotives received the Rail Blue colour scheme, being all blue with black smokebox and red bufferbeam, and no yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{pilot scheme}} {{locomotives}} were delivered in overall green livery with a grey roof and black below the body. D5000 was delivered {{with a narrow}} light grey stripe at waist level while the remainder had a broad light grey stripe at solebar level. This light grey stripe may have appeared bluish and {{has been described as}} pale blue or eggshell, but in most illustrations it appears to be off-white. At first green liveried locos had plain green ends, but this was changed from 1962 to small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels,</b> and then from 1967 to full yellow ends, some locos receiving these while still in green livery. At least five locos were repainted in two-tone green livery (applied along with the small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel)</b> in a similar manner to Class 47s and some Class 25s.|$|R
50|$|As delivered, the {{locomotives}} {{were painted}} black (as {{in the main}} photograph). From the late 1950s onwards Brunswick green was adopted, with small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> on the cab ends. From the late 1960s until withdrawal, the Class 76s started to appear in British Rail monastral blue with yellow cab ends.|$|R
50|$|The first full-production locomotive, HD300-1, {{delivered}} in January 2012, while broadly {{identical to the}} prototype HD300-901 locomotive, incorporates a few minor improvements, including changes to the headlamps, a wider front-end <b>warning</b> <b>panel</b> to reduce snow build-up on the steps, and larger windows in the driving cab doors to improve visibility.|$|R
5000|$|To {{mark the}} {{impending}} {{withdrawal of the}} class, the first two locomotives (26007 and 26001) were repainted into 1960s style BR green with small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> in 1992, at which point 26001 became {{the first and only}} Class 26 to be named (Eastfield, to commemorate the closure of that depot).|$|R
5000|$|When first built, the Hymeks {{were given}} a more {{elaborate}} livery {{than many of the}} contemporary British Railways diesel classes. The main body of the locomotive was the standard dark Brunswick green, but with a lime green stripe along the bottom of the bodywork. The roof was medium grey, and the finishing touch was to paint the window surrounds in ivory white. In the early 1960s, yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> were added to {{the lower part of the}} front ends, in accordance with BR's then-new policy. Following the corporate identity campaign and the change of name to British Rail plus introduction of the [...] "double arrow" [...] logo in 1964, some locomotives received all-over BR Rail blue with small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels.</b> This was quickly changed by the return of off-white window surrounds. The final variation was BR blue with full yellow ends, the yellow being extended around the cab side windows.|$|R
50|$|It {{was named}} by the wife of Lord Wavell Wakefield and used on {{permanent}} way duties throughout the year and passenger work in the summer. It was originally painted maroon with yellow, later with various bright red stripes, then blue with yellow ends and DRS styled motifs, and currently carries British Railways Brunswick Green livery with small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels,</b> similar to a British Rail Class 20.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} originally {{carried a}} dark red livery, with light yellow stripes around {{and below the}} cab windows. The stripes were later replaced with yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> (resembling stylised wings) below the cab windows. From the early 1990s onwards this livery was replaced by an off-white livery with red stripes. Nowadays the locomotives are refitted with a white-green livery {{to go with the}} current company colours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ride was}} {{originally}} named Discovery Mountain, but this name was changed {{shortly before the}} opening, for marketing reasons. This is why the letters [...] "DM" [...] still existed in the building {{for a very long}} period of time. (on the bridge over the Nautilus lake, on safety <b>warnings</b> <b>panels</b> or some devices). The majority of them were replaced by [...] "SM" [...] in the 2015 refurbishment.|$|R
5000|$|On delivery, the Class 37s {{were painted}} in plain green with a grey roof, the 'late' (post-1956) British Railways crest and a D prefix to their running number. Some {{locomotives}} were delivered as the small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel</b> was introduced, earlier locomotives being given these panels during works visits. Towards the late 1960s, the yellow {{was extended to}} the full height of the nose.|$|R
25|$|Tornado is {{required}} to pass the 2006 European Interoperability of the conventional rail system Directive, achieved through compliance with the National Notified Technical Rules (formerly the Railway Group Standards). Certification of Tornado is being managed by the trust's UK Notified Body, DeltaRail Group Ltd. Tornado is exempted from portions of the regulations, as are many mainline steam locomotives, such as from {{the need for a}} yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel,</b> or crumple zones.|$|R
50|$|Bear mainly pulls {{passenger}} trains, {{and sometimes}} pulls the Express if Gordon {{is not able}} to do so. He wears the two-tone green livery he would have carried when built (all-over British Railways loco green, with a narrow band of a lighter, lime green along the bottom of the sides, cream-white cab window surrounds, and a small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panel).</b> When he arrived he wore British Rail 'Rail Blue' livery.|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> from late 1963 the motor coaches of all Southern Region 2 and 3-car units were equipped with an inverted black triangle {{in order to provide}} an early visual indication to station staff that there was no brake van {{at the other end of}} the unit. As units such the 4 CAP stock had a brake van at each end of the unit they were not so equipped.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rest of the}} 6L units (1014-19) {{were built}} in late 1957 and early 1958. The Hastings Units {{operated}} almost all passenger trains on the Hastings Line from April 1958. The 6B units (1031-37) were then conctructed, with unit 1031 making a test run to [...] on 14 May 1958. All were in service by August of that year. From 1962, small yellow <b>warning</b> <b>panels</b> were painted {{on the ends of}} the motor coaches. Unit 1018 bring the first so painted.|$|R
