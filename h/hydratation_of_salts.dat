Large amounts <b>of</b> <b>salt,</b> most often sodium chloride, are applied every year. Most <b>of</b> this <b>salt</b> is removed through drainage or traffic spray processes but a certain amount may be suspended, after drying of the road surface, {{into the air and}} will contribute to the concentration of particulate matter. Though some measurements <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations are available near roads, the link between road maintenance salting activities and observed concentrations <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> in ambient air is yet to be quantified. In this study the NORTRIP road dust emission model, which estimates the emissions of both dust and salt from the road surface, is applied at five sites in four Nordic countries for ten separate winter periods where daily mean ambient air measurements <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations are available. The model is capable of reproducing many <b>of</b> the <b>salt</b> emission episodes, both in time and intensity, but also fails on other occasions. The observed mean concentration <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> in PM 10, over all ten datasets, is 4. 2  μg/m 3 and the modelled mean is 2. 8  μg/m 3, giving a fractional bias of − 0. 38. The RMSE of the mean concentrations, over all 10 datasets, is 2. 9  μg/m 3 with an average R 2 of 0. 28. The mean concentration <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> is similar to the mean exhaust contribution during the winter periods of 2. 6  μg/m 3.

Additional sensitivity studies showed that the accurate logging <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> applications is a prerequisite for predicting salt emissions, as well as good quality data on precipitation.
