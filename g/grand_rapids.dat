5|$|In {{the first}} {{tentative}} Interstate numbering plans, the freeways in Michigan now numbered I-96 and I-196 {{were supposed to}} be part of the I-94 corridor, and the freeway between Muskegon and <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> was to be I-94N. Later, the initial approvals by the federal government routed I-96 from Benton Harbor north to <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> and then east to Detroit, and I-196 was the spur route from <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> to Muskegon. The first segment of freeway built was a relocated section of US16 near Coopersville and Marne. The freeway opened at the end of 1957 or in early 1958, and the first markers for I-196 were erected in 1959. The full Grand Rapids–Muskegon I-196 freeway was completed and opened to traffic in December 1962, connecting to an I-96 freeway that led east toward Lansing; the US16 corridor was a continuous freeway with two different Interstate designations. Before the Grand Rapids–Benton Harbor segment was completed, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD), predecessor to the modern MDOT, petitioned federal highway officials to switch the Interstate designations west of <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids.</b> Permission for this switch was granted in 1963, and the signs were changed in January 1964. Consideration was also made to name the Grand Rapids–Benton Harbor freeway I-67. The previously completed I-196 was redesignated as an extension of I-96, and the completed freeway segments southwest of <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> were redesignated I-196; I-67 was rejected by the American Association of State Highway Officials.|$|E

5|$|A Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) {{designation}} {{was created}} in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> area in 1945. This designation ran from the corner of 28th Street and Chicago Drive along Byp. US16 and Byp. US131 on 28th Street. At East Beltline Avenue, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 turned north back to M-21. M-21A in Flint was turned over to local control in 1948, decommissioning the number. The Byp. M-21 routing was replaced by M-21 in 1953. The former routing in <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> became Bus. M-21 instead.|$|E

5|$|As {{it existed}} before the {{designation}} was removed, M-114 {{started at the}} corner of BYP US16 (28th Street) and what is now East Beltline Avenue in Paris Township (now Kentwood) and ran northward. The trunkline intersected the mainline for US16/M-50 at Cascade Road and the mainline for M-21 at Fulton Street near East <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> in <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> Township. Further north, the highway split into two. In Plainfield Township, a leg of M-114 continued west along the modern 3Mile Road through an intersection with US131 to terminate at Coit Avenue near the Grand River and the other leg continued north to a terminus with US131 at Northland Drive and Plainfield Avenue.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} farther north, {{and closer to}} <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids,</b> it is lined with more commercial and light industrial properties. The unincorporated suburb of Cutlerville lies to the east as US131 approaches M-6, the South Beltline Freeway, and meets in the largest freeway interchange in West Michigan. Gaining a third lane in each direction, the interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8km) in width and over a mile (1.6km) in length and encompasses 27bridges and 18retaining walls. US131 continues north through the city of Wyoming to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> north of M-11 (28th Street).|$|E
5|$|Business M-21 (Bus. M-21) was a {{business}} route of M-21 in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> area. It started at an interchange between Chicago Drive and I-196/M-21 in Grandville and followed Chicago Drive easterly through downtown Grandville. From there, the highway ran along industrial areas {{on the north side}} of Wyoming, running parallel to the I-196 freeway. At the intersection with Clyde Park Avenue, Bus. M-21 turned northward along Grandville Avenue and entered the city of <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids.</b> At Franklin Street, the business route turned eastward and terminated at US131.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway16 (Bus. US16) was a {{business}} route in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> area in the 1950s and 1960s. When US16 was rerouted to replace Byp. US16 around the southern and western sides {{of the city in}} 1953, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated as the business loop. That loop followed Remembrance Avenue southeasterly to Leonard Avenue in Walker Township. From there, the loop turned easterly on Leonard over the Grand River to Monroe Avenue before turning south parallel to the river along Monroe into downtown. In downtown <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids,</b> Bus. US16 turned eastward on Fulton Avenue into East <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids.</b> There the loop followed Cascade Road into Cascade Township where it reconnected to US16 at the intersection with 28th Street. Bus. US16 lasted until 1962 when US16 was decommissioned in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, Byp. US131, {{along with}} the other various bypass routes, was {{designated}} along the <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> beltline system, replacing M-114. Byp. US131 followed the south beltline (28th Street) and East Beltline Avenue between Division Avenue and Plainfield Avenue, allowing north–south traffic to bypass downtown <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids.</b> In late 1949, M-37 was rerouted onto 28th Street between Kalamazoo and East Beltline/Broadmoor avenues. Then in 1953, US131 was rerouted onto the beltlines to replace its bypass route; the former mainline through downtown was redesignated Bus. US131.|$|E
5|$|Contenders seeking {{designation}} {{as the new}} Capitol included Ann Arbor, Jackson, <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids,</b> and Shiawassee Township in Shiawassee County. At {{one point}} during the debate, Marshall officials were so certain of its selection that they built a governor's mansion. After extensive debate, State Senator Joseph H. Kilbourne of Ingham County proposed that the nearly uninhabited Lansing Township be made the seat of government. The legislature agreed, with the location north of Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, and east of <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> being deemed a suitable compromise. The legislature renamed it as the Town of Michigan, though by 1848 the original name of Lansing was restored.|$|E
5|$|I-296 {{begins at}} the I-196 {{interchange}} west of the Grand River and downtown <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids.</b> For a short distance, the three northbound lanes are {{on the left and}} the three southbound lanes are on the right, contrary to the normal traffic arrangement in the US. This anomaly is reversed north of the ramps for I-196 as the southbound lanes go over the northbound lanes. Running parallel to the Grand River on the west bank, the freeway designation begins across the river from the 6th Street Bridge Park and Belknap Hill north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum and the DeVos Place Convention Center. The west side of the freeway faces residential neighborhoods and the east side borders commercial businesses and the river. South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a line of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> Eastern Railroad. After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy median. The freeway leaves <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> and enters Walker north of Ann Street.|$|E
5|$|I-96 {{has four}} related, {{auxiliary}} Interstate highways that connect the main freeway to downtowns and other cities. I-196 {{is a relatively}} long freeway spur, beginning at I-96 east of downtown <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> and heading west through downtown to Holland, and then south to I-94 near Benton Harbor. The unsigned I-296 connects I-96 north of downtown <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> with I-196 in downtown, and is signed as US131. I-496 is a loop through downtown Lansing, which I-96 bypasses to the south, and I-696 is a northern bypass of Detroit, connecting I-96 in Novi with I-75 in Royal Oak and I-94 in St. Clair Shores.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{named the}} Muskegon, Grand Traverse and Northport State Road, {{and later the}} Newaygo and Northport State Road, today's modern highway {{can be traced back}} to the 19th century and earlier. The southernmost section between <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> and Battle Creek {{parallels}} an early Indian trail. The modern highway was formed by July 1, 1919 along this segment. By the 1940s, a second section of highway was designated M-37, creating a gap between it and the original section. This gap was eliminated in the 1950s, completing the M-37 corridor in the state. Additional changes to the routing were made through the <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> area into the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The current freeway {{numbered}} I-196 is {{the second}} {{in the state to}} bear the number. Originally to be numbered as part of the I-94 corridor in the state, the Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids freeway was given the I-96 number in the 1950s while another Interstate between Muskegon and <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> was numbered I-196. That I-196 was built in the late 1950s and completed in the early 1960s. The first segment of the current I-196 was opened as I-96 near Benton Harbor in 1962. Michigan officials requested a change in 1963, which reversed the two numbers and the subsequent segments of freeway opened northward to Holland and from <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> westward under the current number. The gap between Holland and Grandville was filled in the 1970s, and a section of freeway that runs through downtown <b>Grand</b> <b>Rapids</b> was rebuilt as a wider freeway in 2010.|$|E
