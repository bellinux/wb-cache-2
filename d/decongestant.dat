The use of nasal <b>decongestants,</b> however, may lead to serious consequences. For this study, university students majoring in the health field were evaluated in terms of their profile regarding the use of nasal <b>decongestants.</b> Additionally, health sciences seniors were evaluated regarding their level of knowledge concerning the correct and proper use of nasal <b>decongestants.</b> Among the 71. 8 % of respondents who had already used topic nasal <b>decongestants,</b> 64. 3 % had used this medication for at least 15 days and 64. 6 % had started using it due to nasal obstruction. The gathered data indicate that the pharmacist was the main health professional reported as having provided patients with guidance on how to use this medication. A five-point Likert Type intensity scale (3. 6 ± 0. 08) shows that a regular level of knowledge has been observed among the students. Most of the students polled were concluded to incorrectly use topic nasal <b>decongestants.</b> Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that the future health professionals are not well prepared to promote health education for patients concerning the rational use of nasal <b>decongestants...</b>|$|R

The same vasoconstriction action can also result in hypertension, which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine.|$|E

500|$|Amphetamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine; its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, {{when it was}} independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have sympathomimetic properties. Amphetamine had no medical use until late 1933, when Smith, Kline and French began selling it as an inhaler under the brand name Benzedrine as a <b>decongestant.</b> Benzedrine sulfate was introduced 3years later and was used to treat {{a wide variety of}} medical conditions, including narcolepsy, obesity, low blood pressure, low libido, and chronic pain, among others. During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. As the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of amphetamine. [...] For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a scheduleII controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In spite of strict government controls, amphetamine has been used legally or illicitly by people from a variety of backgrounds, including authors, musicians, mathematicians, and athletes.|$|E

500|$|Narcissus {{products}} {{have received a}} variety of other uses. The Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus listed narcissus root in De Medicina among medical herbs, described as emollient, erodent, and [...] "powerful to disperse whatever has collected in any part of the body". N. tazetta bulbs were used in Turkey as a remedy for abscesses in the belief they were antiphlogistic and analgesic. Other uses include the application to wounds, strains, painful joints and various local ailments as an ointment called ‘Narcissimum’. Powdered flowers have also been used medically, as an emetic, a <b>decongestant</b> and for the relief of dysentery, {{in the form of a}} syrup or infusion. The French used the flowers as an antispasmodic, the Arabs the oil for baldness and also an aphrodisiac. In the eighteenth century the Irish herbal of John K’Eogh recommended pounding the roots in honey for use on burns, bruises, dislocations and freckles, and for drawing out thorns and splinters. N. tazetta bulbs have also been used for contraception, while the flowers have been recommended for hysteria and epilepsy. A homeopathic medicine made from bulbs was prescribed for bronchitis and whooping cough. In the traditional Japanese medicine of kampo, wounds were treated with narcissus root and wheat flour paste; the plant, however, does not appear in the modern kampo herb list.|$|E

A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, (actually more similar to norepinephrine,) was identified by Japanese chemists in the Ma Huang plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma. [...] Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929.
