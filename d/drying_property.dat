40|$|Iodine {{value is}} defined as the number of centigrams of iodine per gram of oil sample. <b>Drying</b> <b>property</b> of fatty oils mainly depends on the type of {{unsaturated}} fatty acids and relative amounts of each type of fatty acid in a unit weight of oil. Iodine value of fatty oil is a quantitative measure of unsaturation and hence fatty oils are categorized into drying oil, semidrying oil and non-drying based on iodine value. Fatty oils with iodine value above 150 mgg-l are called drying oils and iodine value in between 150 mgg-l and 120 mgg-l are semi drying oils, whereas fatty oils having iodine values below 120 mgg' are classified as non-drying oils...|$|E
30|$|The {{iodine value}} of the {{essential}} oil was 82  mg I 2 / 100  mg. The iodine value measures the degree of unsaturation in oil and {{could be used in}} quantifying the amount of double bonds present in the oil which reflects the susceptibility of oil to oxidation. It is useful in predicting the <b>drying</b> <b>property</b> of oils, and the moderate value obtained places the oil between non-drying and semi-drying oil; hence, the oil can be used in industries as feedstocks. Low iodine number implies the presence of few unsaturated bonds and hence low susceptibility to oxidative rancidity (Fox and Stachowiak 2007). Therefore, the lower the iodine value, the lower the degree of unsaturation and hence the lower the tendency of the oil to undergo oxidative rancidity.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} lacquer saps were {{prepared}} by prepolymerization under oxygen atmosphere. The prepolymerization process was investigated by GPC, UV-Vis, FT-IR, NMR, and microscope. The {{results showed that}} the polymerization of urushiol monomer was accelerated. The content of monomer in the lacquer sap swiftly decreased from 82. 68 % to 47. 75 % in 0. 5 [*]h. The mechanism of polymerization was complex and was involved in the coupling reaction of phenyl ring, the addition reaction of the unsaturated carbon-carbon double bond groups with urushiol hydroxyl groups, and other reactions that occurred on the side chains. In addition, the prepolymerization also improved significantly the <b>drying</b> <b>property</b> of lacquer film, especially at low relative humidity. At the same time, the sizes of the water drops in the lacquer saps significantly decreased with increasing the stirring time and the surface of lacquer film became smoother, which resulted in its excellent gloss (109 – 125). Due to the prepolymerization, the pencil hardness and the thermal stability of lacquer film were slightly improved as well...|$|E

The basic properties include density, shrinkages, modulus of rupture (MOR), compression parallel to grain (C//), wood strength and anatomical structures.

The initial-final drybulb temperature and wetbulb depression for kuda wood are 50 - 70 ºC and 3 - 30 ºC respectively, while the corresponding figures for waru wood are 65 - 80 ºC and 6 - 30 ºC, and for mindi besar wood are 55 - 80 ºC and 4 - 30 ºC. These drying schedules, however, still need further trial prior to their implementation in the factory-scale operation.
