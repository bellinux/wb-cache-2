25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

2500|$|She {{would end}} up loathing Italia Conti saying, [...] "I hated the {{pressure}} {{that many of the}} children were under.

2500|$|Rand's {{stated goal}} for writing the novel was [...] "to show how desperately {{the world needs}} prime movers and how viciously it treats them" [...] and to portray [...] "what happens to the world without them". The core idea for the book came to her after a 1943 {{telephone}} conversation with a friend, who asserted that Rand owed it to her readers to write fiction about her philosophy. Rand replied, [...] "What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on strike? What if all the creative minds of the world went on strike?" [...] Rand then began Atlas Shrugged to depict the morality of rational self-interest, by exploring {{the consequences of a}} strike by intellectuals refusing to supply their inventions, art, business leadership, scientific research, or new ideas {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|E

2500|$|Burr's weight, {{always an}} issue for him in getting roles, became a public {{relations}} problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his Tonight Show monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson's guest from then on, and told Us Weekly years later: [...] "I have been asked {{a number of times}} to do his show and I won't do it. Because I like NBC. He's doing an NBC show. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on I'd have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he's done about me, but bad jokes he does about everybody who can't fight back because they aren't there. And that wouldn't be good for NBC." [...] In later life, his distinctive physique and manner {{could be used as a}} reference that would be universally recognized. One journal for librarians published a writer's opinion that [...] "asking persons without cataloging experience to design automated catalogs … is as practical as asking Raymond Burr to pole vault." [...] A character in a 1989 short story refers to Burr as [...] "grossly overweight" [...] in Ironside.|$|E
2500|$|Frustrated, {{she left}} Decca and signed with United Artists, where she teamed with the {{producer}} Allen Reynolds, who offered her the creative freedom she wanted {{and helped her}} develop her own style and phrasing. The first album, Crystal Gayle, was released in 1974 and produced her first top-ten country hit, [...] "Wrong Road Again" [...] (number 6). By 1976, she had the first of her 20 number one country singles with [...] "I'll Get Over You", which also became her first single on Billboard's Hot 100 (number 71) and adult contemporary chart (number 40). The following year, she had two more top-2 country hits, [...] "You Never Miss a Real Good Thing (Till He Says Goodbye)" [...] (number 1) and [...] "I'll Do It All Over Again" [...] (number 2), before achieving her greatest success. Gayle recalled what her sister Loretta Lynn had said: [...] "'You record what I couldn't record — you do MOR, middle of the road', [...] "and {{that was the best}} advice I could get.

2500|$|Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine {{said that}} the saddest thing about 20 Y.O. was Jackson's {{decision}} to make a terrible R instead of great dance music, which would likely pay off. He also referred to Jam and Lewis's production as [...] "ice-cold beats [...] have melted into a lugubrious, lukewarm pudding—at under an hour, it still feels almost {{twice as long as}} Janet. and The Velvet Rope." [...] With a C+ rating, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine called it [...] "half-decent" [...] and went to say, [...] "there's precious little to get, well, excited about here. Janet commits the ultimate sin of making an album that’s thoroughly mediocre. Apart from the sticky ear-candy of [...] "So Excited," [...] there’s little I’d miss here <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> six months without it. This doesn’t sound like rejuvenation—it sounds like the beginning of the end." [...] The Village Voices music critic Miles Marshall Lewis commented that Jackson's last two albums also talked excessively about sex, and with the new release, it was getting tired. Evan Serpick from Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying [...] "If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison." [...] Angus Batey, writing for Yahoo! Music UK, remarked that in Jackson's producers desire to take Jackson back to her roots, they made not a great album for Jackson, but a facsimile of one; correct in all the details, but lacking substance and soul. Robert Christgau gave it a [...] "dud" [...] score (...) [...] Additionally, 20 Y.O. earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R Album in 2007.|$|E
