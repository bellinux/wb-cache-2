25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeaker,</b> uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a voice coil to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, a magnetic field is created by the electric current in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied electrical signal coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|One simple {{combination}} is two simple sources {{separated by a}} distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair {{is known as a}} doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this {{combination is}} similar to that of a very small <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.|$|E

5000|$|Microphones can {{be thought}} of as {{speakers}} in reverse. The sound waves strike the thin diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. [...] Microphone diaphragms, unlike speaker diaphragms, tend to be thin and flexible, since they need to absorb as much sound as possible.

5000|$|Among {{the vast}} and often rapid {{changes that have}} taken place over the last century of audio recording, it is notable that there is one crucial audio device, invented {{at the start of the}} [...] "Electrical Era", which has survived {{virtually}} unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s: the electro-acoustic transducer, or loudspeaker. The most common form of electro-acoustic speaker is the <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> - effectively a dynamic microphone in reverse. This device typically consists of a flattened conical acoustic diaphragm (usually made of a stiff paper compound) suspended in a metal ring, at the apex of which a moving-coil magnet is attached. When an audio signal from a recording, a microphone, or an electrified instrument is fed through an amplifier to a loudspeaker, the electrical impulses drive the speaker magnet backward and forward, causing the speaker cone to vibrate, and this movement generates the audio-frequency pressure waves that travel through the air to our ears, which hear them as sound. Although there have been numerous refinements to the technology, and other related technologies have been introduced (e.g. the electrostatic loudspeaker), the basic design and function of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> has not changed substantially in 90 years, and it remains overwhelmingly the most common, sonically accurate and reliable means of converting electronic audio signals back into audible sound.|$|E

Crossover filters are designed, to switch between reproduction methods, through analytical analysis of aliasing artifacts in multizone reproductions. By realising the designed crossover filters, wideband acoustic contrast between zones is significantly improved. The trade-off between acoustic contrast and the bandwidth of the reproduced soundfield is investigated. Results show that by incorporating the proposed hybrid model the whole wideband bandwidth is spatial-aliasing free {{with a mean}} acoustic contrast consistently above 54. 2 dB, an improvement of up to 24. 2 dB from a non-hybrid approach, with as few as 16 <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> and one parametric loudspeaker...|$|R

40|$|Multiactuator Panels (MAPs) {{are flat}} {{loudspeakers}} {{that can be}} used to build arrays for Wave Field Synthesis (WFS), alternatively to classical <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> The sound radiation of these loudspeakers is a complex superposition of excited modes that vary strongly with frequency. Therefore, the characteristic MAP spectrum is very irregular and needs to be equalized to obtain a flat, colorless response. In this paper, an efficient digital equalization method is applied successfully to the problem of spectral equalization of MAPs. It is based on a chain of second-order sections of infinite impulse response parametric filters with very low computational cost. The method compensates for the measured MAP response in order to achieve a desired frequency response. The equalization process has been applied to a large MAP prototype, comprising a large number of exciters within a panel. A dedicated exciter equalization and its consequences on the filtered responses have been addressed. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The Fessenden {{oscillator}} somewhat {{resembled a}} modern dynamic microphone or <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> in overall construction. A circular metal plate, clamped at its edge, {{in contact with}} the water on one side, was attached on the other side to a copper tube, which was free to move in the circular gap of a magnet system. The magnet system had a direct-current winding to provide a polarizing magnetic field in the gap, and an alternating current winding that induced currents in the copper tube. These induced currents produced a magnetic field that reacted against the polarizing field. The resulting force was communicated to the membrane and in turn provided acoustic vibrations into the water.|$|E

Ionizing the air between twoelectrodes produces a plasma, an ionized gas, that under the right circumstances can produceacoustic sound waves, making it a loudspeaker. As plasma loudspeakers differ greatly fromconventional loudspeakers and have some unique properties that might provide solutions tosound reproduction problems that conventional loudspeakers can not, there may be applicationswhere plasma loudspeakers are favorable to conventional loudspeakers.

50|$|This {{relative}} lack of loud bass is often remedied with a hybrid design using a <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeaker,</b> e.g. a subwoofer, to handle lower frequencies, with the electrostatic diaphragm handling middle and high frequencies. Many feel that the best low frequency unit for hybrids are cone drivers mounted on open baffles as dipoles transmission line woofers or horns, since they possess roughly the same qualities (at least in the bass) as electrostatic speakers, i.e. good transient response, little box coloration, and (ideally) flat frequency response. However, {{there is often a}} problem with integrating such a woofer with the electrostatics. This is because most electrostatics are line sources, the sound pressure level of which decreases by 3 dB for each doubling of distance. A cone speaker's sound pressure level, on the other hand, decreases by 6 dB for each doubling of distance because it behaves as a point source. This can be overcome by the theoretically more elegant solution of using conventional cone woofer(s) in an open baffle, or a push-pull arrangement, which produces a bipolar radiation pattern {{similar to that of the}} electrostatic membrane. This is still subject to phase cancellation, but cone woofers can be driven to far higher levels due to their longer excursion, thus making equalization to a flat response easier, and they add distortion thereby increasing the area (and therefore the power) under the frequency response graph, making the total low frequency energy higher but the fidelity to the signal lower.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of ultra-low heat capacity nanostructured materials revived {{the interest in}} the thermo-acoustic (TA) loudspeaker technology, which shows important advantages compared to the classical <b>dynamic</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> as they feature a lower cost and weight, flexibility, conformability {{to the surface of}} various shapes, and transparency. The development of the TA loudspeaker technology requires accurate physical models connecting the material properties to the thermal and acoustic speaker's performance. We present here a combined theoretical and experimental analysis of TA loudspeakers, where the electro-thermal and the thermo-acoustic transductions are handled separately, thus allowing an in-depth description of both the pressure and temperature dynamics. The electro-thermal transduction is analyzed by accounting for all the heat flow processes taking place between the TA loudspeaker and the surrounding environment, with focus on their frequency dependence. The thermo-acoustic conversion is studied by solving the coupled thermo-acoustic equations, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, and by exploiting the Huygens-Fresnel principle to decompose the TA loudspeaker surface into a dense set of TA point sources. A general formulation of the 3 D pressure field is derived summing up the TA point source contributions via a Rayleigh integral. The model is validated against temperature and sound pressure level measured on the TA loudspeaker sample made of a Silver Nanowire random network deposited on a polyimide substrate. A good agreement is found between measurements and simulations, demonstrating that the model is capable of connecting material properties to the thermo-acoustic performance of the device, thus providing a valuable tool for the design and optimization of TA loudspeakers...|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{telegraph}} {{and telephone}} systems, which used completely {{different types of}} equipment, most radio receivers were equally suitable for both radiotelegraph and radiotelephone reception. In 1903 and 1904 the electrolytic detector and thermionic diode (Fleming valve) were invented by Reginald Fessenden and John Ambrose Fleming, respectively. Most important, in 1904-1906 the crystal detector, the simplest and cheapest AM detector, was developed by G. W. Pickard. Homemade crystal radios spread rapidly during the next 15 years, providing ready audiences for the first radio broadcasts. One limitation of crystals sets {{was the lack of}} amplifying the signals, so listeners had to use earphones, and it required the development of vacuum-tube receivers before loudspeakers could be used. The <b>dynamic</b> cone <b>loudspeaker,</b> invented in 1924, greatly improved audio frequency response over the previous horn speakers, allowing music to be reproduced with good fidelity. AM radio offered the highest sound quality available in a home audio device prior to the introduction of the high-fidelity, long-playing record in the late 1940s.|$|R
