50|$|The Blank's powers {{derive from}} his hi-tech field <b>{{generator}}</b> <b>belt.</b> The generator produces an obscuring force field which completely conceals his features and provides virtually total protection against {{all forms of}} damage. The force field also allows the Blank to easily escape entanglements, wrestling holds, {{and other forms of}} attack. The field must be recharged every 12 hours by the charger built specially for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|The {{block of}} the Twin Spark {{was the same}} 2.0 L {{that had been a}} part of Alfa's road and race car history since the 1930s. The engine {{featured}} fuel injection, controlled by a Bosch Motronic system as well as a chain-driven DOHC cylinder head, a single cooling fan and <b>generator</b> <b>belt,</b> improved reliability and reduced parasitic friction. The battery of all 164s was placed in the trunk to achieve a near 50:50 weight distribution.|$|E

50|$|In this type, an {{electrical}} generator is {{installed on the}} ground and a separate cable or belt, trailing behind the wing, transfers the power to a sprocket on the ground, which rotates the rotor of the <b>generator.</b> The separate <b>belt</b> extends at approximately the speed of the wing. Because of the high speed of that belt, the gearbox is not required.|$|R
50|$|Other {{classical}} electrostatic machines like a Wimshurst {{machine or}} a Bonetti machine can easily produce more current than a Van de Graaff generator for experiments with electrostatics and have {{positive and negative}} outputs. For these generators, however, corona discharge from exposed metal parts at high potentials and poorer insulation result in smaller voltages. In an electrostatic generator, the rate of charge transported (current) to the high-voltage electrode is very small, so the maximal voltage is obtained when the leakage current from the electrode equals the rate of charge transport. In the Van de Graaff <b>generator,</b> the <b>belt</b> allows the transport of charge into {{the interior of a}} large hollow spherical electrode. This is the ideal shape to minimize leakage and corona discharge, so the Van de Graaff generator can produce the greatest voltage. This is why the Van de Graaff design has been used for all electrostatic particle accelerators.|$|R
50|$|Flat belts {{were widely}} used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in line {{shafting}} to transmit power in factories. They were also used in countless farming, mining, and logging applications, such as bucksaws, sawmills, threshers, silo blowers, conveyors for filling corn cribs or haylofts, balers, water pumps (for wells, mines, or swampy farm fields), and electrical <b>generators.</b> Flat <b>belts</b> are still used today, although {{not nearly as much}} as in the line-shaft era. The flat belt is a simple system of power transmission that was well suited for its day. It can deliver high power at high speeds (500 hp at 10,000 ft/min, or 373 kW at 51 m/s), in cases of wide belts and large pulleys. But these wide-belt-large-pulley drives are bulky, consuming lots of space while requiring high tension, leading to high loads, and are poorly suited to close-centers applications, so V-belts have mainly replaced flat belts for short-distance power transmission; and longer-distance power transmission is typically no longer done with belts at all. For example, factory machines now tend to have individual electric motors.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{generator}} was a [...] direct current machine. Main control was via notched {{engine speed control}} (350, 465, 590, and 680 rmp), with finer control via secondary lever. The engine was fitted with a governor preventing overspeed, and electric overload protection. An 80-volt battery was used to energise the {{main generator}}, as well powering the electric control system and lights, and was also used to start the engine with the generator in motor mode; the battery was automatically charged when the engine was idling. An air compressor was powered via a belt drive from the <b>generator</b> via a <b>belt</b> drive; compressed air-operated Westinghouse double-wheel tread brakes, as well as sanding equipment and the whistle.|$|R
5000|$|Early cabooses {{were nothing}} more than flat cars with small cabins erected on them, or {{modified}} box cars. The standard form of the American caboose had a platform at either end with curved grab rails to facilitate train crew members' ascent onto a moving train. A caboose was fitted with red lights called markers to enable the rear of the train to be seen at night. This has led to the phrase [...] "bringing up the markers" [...] to describe the last car on a train (these lights were officially what made a train a [...] "train"). Originally lit with oil lamps, with the advent of electricity, later caboose versions incorporated an electrical <b>generator</b> driven by <b>belts</b> coupled to one of the axles, which charged a lead-acid storage battery when the train was in motion.|$|R

50|$|The entire game {{takes place}} in the mythical land of Perathia. It is a vast world that is split into six {{elemental}} realms, one for each elemental force. In the center is Town, the hub of the elemental realms and home of Azurik and the Temple of the Elements. The temple consists of a tall tower with four floors. The first floor has two elevators leading to the next floor and {{in the center of the}} room is a gate to the Life realm, which will become active when the Azurik gains three of the four missing pieces of the Life disc. The second floor contains another elevator in the center of the room which leads to the third floor. Around the elevator are ten objects that Azurik can gain each time he collects ten or more obsidian jewels. The third floor is an empty room with three elevators that lead to the top floor. The top floor is where the elemental discs were held prior to Balthazar's betrayal. The disc holder comprises a machine in the center with different colored lights indicating where each disc is put. On the grounds of the temple are four large objects representing each element. A floating spherical rock represents the earth realm, a complicated fan system represents the air realm, a bowl of lava represents the fire realm, and a large fountain represents the water realm. Each object will do a specific function once Azurik has completely restored a disc and put it in its proper place. There is no specific time period mentioned in the game, but the architecture and the opening movie suggest a time of primitive technology, although some signs of advanced machines like large drills, tunnel borers, <b>generators,</b> conveyor <b>belts,</b> mine carts, and electrical equipment are seen throughout the realms and the Temple of the Elements.|$|R
