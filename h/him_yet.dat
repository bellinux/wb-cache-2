5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with <b>him.</b> <b>Yet</b> I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Guderian, von Kleist, his {{immediate}} superior, had contacted Loerzer and banned Guderian's proposed long systematic approach {{in favour of}} one big assault. Guderian complained. Kleist ignored <b>him.</b> <b>Yet,</b> the following morning, Loerzer rejected Kleist's method and went ahead with the agreed rolling bombing as discussed with Guderian. Loerzer would later say that the official order from Hugo Sperrle had arrived too late to make changes.|$|E
5|$|Though Brownlee {{was no more}} {{enthusiastic}} than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give <b>him</b> <b>yet</b> another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed hydroelectricity projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a course that was eventually followed in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian (r.117–138AD) {{reaffirmed the}} Roman-Parthian border at the Euphrates, {{choosing not to}} invade Mesopotamia due to Rome's now limited military resources. Parthamaspates fled after the Parthians revolted against <b>him,</b> <b>yet</b> the Romans made him king of Osroene. Osroes I died during his conflict with Vologases III, the latter succeeded by Vologases IV of Parthia (r. c.147–191AD) who ushered {{in a period of}} peace and stability. However, the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166AD began when Vologases invaded Armenia and Syria, retaking Edessa. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.161–180AD) had co-ruler Lucius Verus (r.161–169AD) guard Syria while Marcus Statius Priscus invaded Armenia in 163AD, followed by the invasion of Mesopotamia by Avidius Cassius in 164AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} the Aksumite Kingdom {{declined}} after the 6th century due {{to the rise of}} other regional states in the Horn of Africa. Modern scholars continue to debate the identity and provenance of the legendary or semi-legendary figure Gudit (fl. 10th century), a queen who is traditionally believed to have overthrown the Kingdom of Aksum. The legend is found in the 13th-century chronicle of the monk Tekle Haymanot, who compiled historical writings gathered from various Ethiopian churches and monasteries. The chronicle alleges that, after being exiled from Axum, she married a Jewish king of Syria and converted to Judaism. The Scottish travel writer James Bruce (1730–1794) was incredulous about the tale and believed she was simply a Jewish queen. Carlo Conti Rossini (1872–1949) hypothesized that she was an ethnic Sidamo from Damot, whereas Steven Kaplan argues she was a non-Christian invader and historian Knud Tage Andersen contends she was a regular member of the Aksumite royal house who shrewdly seized the throne. The latter is more in line with another legend that claims Dil Na'od, the last king of Aksum, kept his daughter Mesobe Werq in isolation out of fear of a prophecy that her son would overthrow <b>him,</b> <b>yet</b> she eloped with the nobleman Mara Takla Haymanot from Lasta who eventually killed the Aksumite king in a duel, took the throne and founded the Zagwe dynasty. The latter {{remains one of the most}} poorly understood periods of Ethiopia's recorded history. What is known is that the early Zagwe kings were polytheistic, eventually converted to Christianity, and ruled over the northern Highlands of Ethiopia, while Islamic sultanates inhabited the coastal Ethiopian Lowlands.|$|E

25|$|Both Plato and Aristotle {{argue against}} some of Protagoras's claims {{regarding}} relativity; however, {{they argue that the}} concept provides Protagoras with too convenient an exemption from his own theory and that relativism is true for <b>him</b> <b>yet</b> false {{for those who do not}} believe it. They claim that by asserting that truth is relative, Protagoras then could say that whatever further theory he proposed must be true.|$|E

25|$|Once again, Frank Norman was Colten's opponent, but the {{incumbent}} {{had the advantage}} because the community leadership lined up solidly behind <b>him.</b> <b>Yet,</b> Colten seemed unsure {{as to whether he}} could win again and took nothing for granted.

25|$|Liberace was a {{conservative}} in his politics and faith, eschewing dissidents and rebels. He believed fervently in capitalism {{and was also}} fascinated with royalty, ceremony, and luxury.

25|$|Waller's {{attack was}} not unexpected, and Prince Maurice had made {{ready to meet}} <b>him.</b> <b>Yet,</b> the first rush of the rebels carried the entrenchments of Speen Hill.

But meantime, Manchester, {{in spite of the}} entreaties of his staff, had not stirred from Clay Hill.

25|$|The 1948–49 season saw Blackpool {{attain a}} sixteenth-placed League finish, {{although}} injuries to both Mortensen and the supplying Matthews meant {{a lack of}} firepower up front. Many players left the club, such as Jimmy McIntosh, Murdoch McCormack, George Farrow and Tommy Lewis. Incomers included Rex Adams from amateurs Oxford City, Willie Wardle from Grimsby Town, Ewan Fenton, Jackie Wright, and a giant of a goalkeeper from Hibernian, George Farm. Farm was only playing third-string football for the Edinburgh club when Blackpool signed <b>him,</b> <b>yet</b> {{he went on to}} become a regular in Joe Smith's starting elevens, breaking several appearance records along the way.|$|E
25|$|Becoming desperate, Elle and Sage visit Elle's ex-husband Karl, whom Elle has {{not seen}} in decades. She tells him she needs to borrow the money for rent, and he {{requests}} a kiss in return. This leads to an argument over how Elle ended their relationship, but when she pleads with him, he agrees {{to hand over the}} cash. When he asks her to be honest about the reason for needing the money, she tells him that Sage needs an abortion, and Karl becomes angry and emotional. Elle once aborted his child without telling <b>him,</b> <b>yet</b> went on to give birth to a baby born from a one-night stand. She explains that she wanted a child but not a husband, and Karl angrily insists he will not pay for an abortion.|$|E
25|$|Quite haphazardly, Wise {{instituted a}} major {{innovation}} when introducing family pews in 1851, after his Albany congregation purchased a local church building and retained sitting arrangements. While it was gradually adopted even by many Orthodox in America and remained so {{well into the}} 20th Century, the same was not applied in Germany until after World War II. Wise attempted to reach consensus with the traditionalist leader Rabbi Isaac Leeser in order to forge a single, unified American Judaism. In the 1855 Cleveland Synod, he was at first acquiescent to Leeser, but reverted immediately after the other departed. The enraged Leeser disavowed any connection with <b>him.</b> <b>Yet</b> Wise's harshest critic was Einhorn, who arrived from Europe in the same year. Demanding clear positions, he headed the radical camp as Reform turned into a distinct current.|$|E
