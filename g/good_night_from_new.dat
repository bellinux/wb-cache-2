500|$|Their show {{together}} was The Two Ronnies, a sketch show which aired for twelve series and eight specials between 1971 and 1987, to immediate success. The show, {{as described by}} Anthony Hayward of The Independent, was [...] "a cocktail of comedy sketches, playlets, songs and parodies, a long-winded Corbett monologue and a singing star, sandwiched between the opening and closing news summaries." [...] The usual format consisted of many sketches between the two, an ongoing filmed serial, a solo character sketch from Barker, Corbett's monologue, a musical number, a special guest, bookended by joke news items, delivered from a desk by the two {{in the style of}} newsreaders, before ending with the catchphrase [...] "It's <b>good</b> <b>night</b> <b>from</b> me – and it's <b>good</b> <b>night</b> <b>from</b> him." [...] This was a set format which was used for almost the entirety of the show's run. The end catchphrase and newsreader characters were devised because Barker found it difficult to appear as himself: Corbett explained that Barker [...] "was a very private man, a quiet man ... He found it almost impossible to talk directly, as himself, to an audience." [...] Each also had their own solo segments to help ensure they were not totally associated as a double act. Filming took place over four months of each year. After outdoor and serial sketches were filmed on location, the studio material was filmed on Sunday evenings at BBC Television Centre in front a live audience; the musical finale was filmed the day before without the audience.|$|R

We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft.

500|$|In addition, {{there were}} several {{connections}} with SNL: Fey, Morgan, Dratch, Bill Hader, Louis-Dreyfus, Parnell, and director McCarthy-Miller are all SNL alumni (fellow alumnus Will Ferrell was asked to reprise his recurring [...] "Bitch Hunter" [...] character, but had a scheduling conflict); the show was filmed in SNLs Studio 8H before a live audience; the ending sequence was a <b>good</b> <b>night</b> <b>from</b> the cast while the credits scrolled (and the credits used the same font as SNL); and promos {{leading up to the}} episode were voiced by long-time SNL announcer Don Pardo. The music for the episode—both for the TGS sequences and incidental underscore—was provided live by the SNL house band under the direction of Fey's husband Jeff Richmond and Leon Pendarvis. Furthermore, long-time SNL producer Lorne Michaels attended the rehearsal and performances to give his advice. Each commercial break during the show was predicated on an emergency commercial break on TGS, including a fictional commercial and a fake NBC technical difficulties screen.|$|R

5000|$|Soon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson {{performed}} a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two {{also had to}} keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, who {{were sitting in the}} audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he [...] "must have offered them too much money." [...] Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not work {{in the same way as}} a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker's, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972.

5000|$|Even {{before all}} of the {{information}} above came to light, the Old Stone Arch Bridge that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 as a national landmark.

This part of the story I confess I did not believe, since it seemed to me impossible that anyone could ride upon that mad rogue, Jana. Yet, as subsequent events showed, it was in fact true. I suppose that in certain hands the beast became tame. Or perhaps it was drugged.|$|R

50|$|WTMJ {{spent much}} of its life {{operating}} at 5 kW from Brookfield, which was still powerful enough to cover much of eastern Wisconsin and northern Illinois.

WTMJ was granted permission in 1995 to upgrade to 50 kW days and 10 kW <b>nights</b> <b>from</b> a <b>new</b> six-tower site in Union Grove, south of Milwaukee. The station's signal is directed generally north during both daytime and nighttime operation. During the day, four-towers are used.
