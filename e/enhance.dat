The non-turbid image is <b>enhanced</b> to generate a second <b>enhanced</b> image when a poor contrast/lightness score is associated therewith. When the second <b>enhanced</b> image has a poor contrast/lightness score associated therewith, this image is <b>enhanced</b> to generate a third <b>enhanced</b> image. A sharpness measure is computed for one image that is selected from (i) the non-turbid image, (ii) the first <b>enhanced</b> image, (iii) the second <b>enhanced</b> image when a good contrast/lightness score is associated therewith, and (iv) the third <b>enhanced</b> image.

30|$|Firstly, the {{original}} gray scale image {{is subjected to}} the transformation function in Eq. (1) to obtain a supposed <b>enhanced</b> image. The transformation function is applied based {{on a set of}} initial parameter values selected by the CSO algorithm in a random manner. These parameter values are used in the transformation function in order to obtain a supposed <b>enhanced</b> image. This <b>enhanced</b> image is then passed to the EF were a specific value is computed for the <b>enhanced</b> image as described in Section 2.3. This EF value is one of several possible values computed for different <b>enhanced</b> images belonging to a population of possible <b>enhanced</b> images. Thus, each <b>enhanced</b> image in the population is subjected to the transformation function using different sets of parameter values and then passed to the EF to obtain a fitness value. The best (or largest) EF value from among a population of different <b>enhanced</b> images is selected per generation (or iteration). The iteration proceeds until no better value is obtained. Thus, the <b>enhanced</b> image that produces the highest EF value after several number of iterations (or generation) is outputted as the best <b>enhanced</b> image.|$|R
