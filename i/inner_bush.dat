40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that a twin groove {{arrangement}} {{will provide a}} more effective lubrication and a cooler operation than a single groove one, but little evidence {{has been found in}} support of this claim. Furthermore, there are no experimental works, to the authors’ knowledge, that compare the performance of single and twin axial groove bearings with the same geometry. An experimental assessment of a journal bearing with either two axial grooves located at +/- 90 º or just one single groove at + 90 º to the load line was performed. The comparison was made by using the same bearing for both groove configurations but the oil feeding to the - 90 º groove was shut with a valve in one of the cases in order to emulate a single groove bearing. Measurements of total and partial lubricant flow rate through each groove, shaft locus, <b>inner</b> <b>bush</b> surface temperature, oil outlet temperature and electrical motor consumption were performed. For the range of applied loads tested the twin groove journal bearing displayed a lower maximum temperature but a higher outlet temperature and eccentricity than the single groove journal bearing. Also the measured total flow rate in the bearing was approximately the same for the single and the twin groove arrangements. For the twin groove bearing, the partial flow rate through each groove varied dramatically with increasing load: At high eccentricities the flow being supplied to the active land of the bearing through the + 90 º groove was much lower than that supplied to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. Actually, the measured flow rate at the + 90 º groove was almost zero for the highest load tested, with nearly all the lubricant being fed to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. This means that under heavy load operation, the existence of an extra groove at - 90 º to the load line might actually deteriorate lubrication effectiveness when compared with a single groove arrangement...|$|E

In groups, students designed and built small temporary installations which were site-specific to an <b>inner</b> city <b>bush</b> site in Brisbane, and involved a day and night mode. These movies document both the site and installation, and are accompanied by 2 ̆ 7 soundtracks 2 ̆ 7 made by the students, based on edited sounds sourced from the site.

5000|$|The Stud Cattle Pavilion (70 x 9 metres) {{consists}} of a long building (45.7 metres) and a shorter building (18.3 metres) separated by an open area (6 metres) with a small parade ground outside the northern entrance which is shaded by a mature Albizia (Albizia julibrissin [...] ). Both buildings are of similar rural vernacular construction with <b>inner</b> and outer <b>bush</b> timber pole columns supporting a gable roof of corrugated galvanised steel sheeting on sawn hardwood rafters and beams and are painted white internally. The side walls are clad in painted corrugated galvanised steel on timber rails fixed to the outer bush timber poles with openings, for light and ventilation, covered in an open steel mesh spaced along their length. Bolted along the rails are various styles of forged iron and steel rings for tethering cattle. A skillion roofed storage area {{has been added to}} the southern side of the longer building.|$|R

40|$|Floating bush journal {{bearings}} {{are widely used}} to support small-sized high-speed rotating machinery. When　the supplied pressure is low, the bearing shows peculiar phenomena. As the shaft rotational speed increases, the bush rotational speed levels off and {{the disappearance of the}} oil whip is observed. They can be explained qualitatively by applying the hydrodynamic lubrication model with the axial oil film rupture being considered. However, the predictions are in quantitatively poor agreement with the measurements. This experimental report shows the effect of the circumferential oil groove and holes into the inner oil film and the slope of the <b>bush</b> <b>inner</b> side end, which are not considered in the theoretical model, on the bush rotational speed and the high-speed stability. It is found that the bush rotational speed levels off at a lower shaft rotational speed, resulting in the lower bush speed, and that the oil whip disappears at a lower shaft speed, when the supplied pressure is lower. The groove, the driving torque of which cannot be negligible, lowers the bush rotational speed and heightens largely the stability in high-speed region. The effect of the hole, the geometry in the groove and the slope is small...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to establish which polymer material is best suited as the material for bushes used in high force small oscillating angular contact applications as typically found in a large sugar mill coupling. A Tribometer {{as well as a}} designed and manufactured Bearing Testing Machine, which simulates and accelerates the wear caused in the intended application, was used to determine the wear rates and coefficients of friction for seven polymer materials. Materials were selected for their superior mechanical and thermal properties. The Tribometer was fitted with a linear reciprocating rig, so as to simulate the small oscillating movement prevalent in the intended application. Each Tribometer test ran for a duration of two hours with a frequency of 33. 1 Herts and a normal loading of 40 N. Bearing Testing Machine tests were done under similar constraints but with 30 kN loading present on the surface of a <b>bushes</b> <b>inner</b> race. These tests had a longer duration of 24 or 48 hours or until intense wearing occurred. Initially both testing methods will be analysed independently of each other in order to try and identify a relationship between the wear rate and coefficient of friction for the different polymers. The different testing methods’ results will be compared to each other in order to establish if a correlation between the materials tested could be found...|$|R
40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, <b>inner</b> plate, <b>bush,</b> pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled <b>bushes</b> of the <b>inner</b> block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the <b>bush</b> during <b>inner</b> block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset plate, the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an offset plate. The holes in the offset plate are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible to identify the stress distribution, its concentration and also to quantify the stress and strain [2 - 3] at any point in the chain plate. This paper explains how transmission photoelastic technique is used to estimate the stress distribution and its concentration zones in a complex chain plate when it isloaded. An epoxy chain plate model was made through the casting method using a Perspex mould [2 - 3]. A loading fixture was used to load the model during stress freezing in the furnace. The integrated fringe pattern of the offset chain plate is shown in Figure 2. Slices are cut in the offset zone to understand the nature of the stress distribution. A Simple photoelastic analysis of this has revealed a wealth of information to take suitable decision on the design of such plates taking into account the constraints in manufacturing...|$|R
