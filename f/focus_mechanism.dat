50|$|The zoom and <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> is internal: {{the lens}} does not {{physically}} {{extend beyond the}} camera housing when focusing and zooming. Startup is under one second, as the lens {{does not need to}} be extended.|$|E
50|$|The Dual speed focuser is a <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> used in {{precision}} optics such as {{advanced amateur}} astronomical telescopes and laboratory microscopes.|$|R
5000|$|Microscope Automation {{products}} that includes motorised microscope stages, automated <b>focus</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> filter wheels, shutters, illumination systems and automated slide loading systems.|$|R
50|$|Many modern cameras now use {{automatic}} <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{which use}} ultrasonic motors to move internal {{elements in the}} lens to achieve optimum focus.|$|R
50|$|The {{stage of}} an {{inverted}} microscope is usually fixed, and focus is adjusted {{by moving the}} objective lens along a vertical axis to bring it closer to or further from the specimen. The <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> typically has a dual concentric knob for coarse and fine adjustment.|$|E
5000|$|Toggle {{focus is}} very rarely used (e.g. Carson Bandit 8x25 [...] ). It {{provides}} a one-handed <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in a relatively}} large toggle, making it quick and easy to operate [...] "in the field" [...] with gloves but can be rather over-sensitive and difficult to fine tune.|$|E
50|$|The EOS 7s / 30V / ELAN 7NE (Japanese/Asia-Pacific European/North American product names) and the EOS 33V / ELAN 7N (Asia-Pacific Europe/North America) are 35 mm film single-lens reflex cameras from Canon of Japan, {{launched}} in April 2004. The 7s/30V/ELAN 7NE employ Canon's Eye Controlled <b>Focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> while the 33V/ELAN 7N do not. These cameras were the replacements for the earlier EOS 30/33 model.|$|E
30|$|Step 3. When the <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> stops, {{the images}} are {{collected}} and the evaluation function values f(m)(m[*]=[*] 1, 2, 3 …, show it had detected the peak point m Pm) and MTF values Mm at the Nyquist frequency are calculated, If Mm[*]≥[*]M, the place is the focus position, and then the focusing process is completed. If Mm[*]<[*]M, the place is the local peak point, and then the <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> continues to <b>focus</b> with the step length L 1 according to the initial state. If the focus function value in the new location {{is greater than the}} max{f(1), f(2)… f(m)}(m[*]=[*] 1, 2, 3 …), it has been out of the scope of local peaks, and then <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> continues along the opposite direction (the direction of the focal length decreasing); otherwise, it moves along the direction of the focal length increasingly.|$|R
50|$|A {{dual speed}} <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is often {{combined}} with a Crayford focuser, forming a Dual speed Crayford focuser in order to eliminate backlash during fine focusing.|$|R
50|$|The {{anamorphic}} {{section of}} the original Iscorama was the template for subsequent Iscorama adapters, all of which shared its 1.5× horizontal stretch ratio, patented <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and adjustable anamorphic alignment capability. The ISCO anamorphic <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was unique in that the taking lens was simply set to infinity and then focus was adjusted using the anamorphic adapter alone. This was a major advance on competing manufacturers' designs, all of which required that focus was calibrated simultaneously on both the taking lens and the adapter.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{all modern}} lenses for SLRs and DSLRs provide {{automatic}} focus. The autofocus sensor(s) and electronics are {{actually in the}} camera body, and this circuitry provides electrical power and signals to a motor inside the lens that adjusts the focus. (Some older autofocus systems {{are based on a}} motor in the camera body and using a mechanical connection to the <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the lens.) ...|$|E
50|$|The DA* lenses are {{designed}} for use with Pentax digital SLR cameras. DA* lenses have higher quality optics and feature {{a higher level of}} weather sealing (AW) than most DA lenses (WR). The DA* lenses are more expensive and generally feature improved light transmission and larger aperture openings for better low light performance. Some DA* lenses also feature both body driven screw drive focusing and the Pentax SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) lens based <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} ability to capture images in RAW format, the FZ30 {{improves}} upon its predecessor - the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 - by adding a screw mount to accept 55mm lens filters, and contains a fully internal zoom and <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism,</b> meaning the lens does not physically extend or retract outside of the camera housing. This non-extending lens offers the added feature of a reduced startup time: 1 second as opposed to 3-5 for the FZ20. The FZ30 also boasts an improved control layout, with revisions made based on feedback by users of the FZ20. However, the fixed lens added greatly {{to the size of}} the camera.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Prototyping and Focused Discriminating (PFD) strategy for pattern recognition. This strategy takes {{benefits from the}} duality between model generation and discrimination. Both collaborate through a <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that detects the conflicts between the class models and drive the discrimination. Classifiers based on this collaboration benefit from a set of useful properties. The Mélidis system illustrates this strategy and extends its possibilities, using a fuzzy framework. As shown by experiments, the resulting system provides an interesting compromise between accuracy and compactness. Experiments also demonstrate {{the interest of the}} new strategy and of its <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R
30|$|Step 4. Follow step 2 {{and carry}} out focusing. When the maximum is detected, the <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is stopped. The {{movement}} direction and step length are judged as is described in step 3.|$|R

50|$|The Centa Vision was {{the only}} 2× {{horizontal}} stretch anamorphic adapter with an Iscorama style form-factor that ISCO ever produced, and closely resembled the Iscorama 42 visually. ISCO-manufactured Centa Visions were always multicoated. Confusingly, ISCO also marketed a batch of re-branded Kowa Prominar 16-H lenses under the Centavision name. These were manufactured by Kowa in Japan, and were optically identical to the other versions of this lens (Kowa 8Z, Kowa for Bell & Howell, Elmoscope II), but differed physically in three respects: the ISCO version included a front filter thread (72mm), had a standard diameter rear mounting thread (49mm), and featured a dual unit metric/imperial focus scale. The Kowa-manufactured version of the Centavision utilised a standard anamorphic <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism,</b> rather than ISCO's patented system.|$|E
50|$|Nikon and Pentax both {{chose to}} extend their {{existing}} lens mounts with autofocus capability, retaining {{the ability to use}} older manual-focus lenses with an autofocus body, and driving the lens <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a motor inside the camera. Later, Nikon added Silent Wave Motor (SWM) mechanisms into its lenses, supporting both focusing schemes until the introductions of the entry-level Nikon D40 and Nikon D40X in 2006. Pentax introduced its Supersonic Drive Motor (SDM) in 2006 with Pentax K10D model and two lenses (DA*16-50/2.8 AL ED IF SDM and DA*50-135/2.8 ED IF SDM). Since then all Pentax DSLR support both SDM and the motor inside the body. Earlier SDM lenses support both systems as well. The first SDM lens that did not support the old focusing system was the DA 17-70/4 AL IF SDM (2008).|$|E
5000|$|The lens is focus-by-wire, {{using the}} {{autofocus}} motor even for manual focus. The motor is quiet, suitable for video use ("MSC"- movie and stills compatible). Unlike other focus-by-wire systems, the lens offers two manual focus modes. In the traditional focus-by-wire mode, the <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> operates {{the same way}} as other Micro Four Thirds lenses. The focus ring can be moved to engage a [...] "snap focus" [...] mode, which displays a distance scale for zone focusing, and provides a feel similar to mechanical focus systems. The [...] "snap focus" [...] mode makes this the first auto-focus capable Micro Four Thirds lens with a distance scale. The front element does not rotate, allowing the consistent use of polarized filters; a 46mm filter thread lets users share filters with many of Panasonic's lenses.|$|E
40|$|We review {{possible}} facilities {{which are}} suitable for studying new concepts in acceleration and <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Two facilities are discussed in detail. The Argonne National Laboratory Wakefield Linac is nearing completion and should begin experiments on wakefield processes in the Fall of 1986. A Laser Accelerator Tes...|$|R
5000|$|... "Tromboning" [...] {{involved}} {{holding a}} small object at varying distances from one's eyes, inhaling {{as it was}} moved in and exhaling as it was moved out. The program's manual stated that [...] "Tromboning exercises the <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> improves control of the extraocular muscles and stimulates the flow of nutrients inside the eyes".|$|R
5000|$|Polaroid {{integral}} film packs usually {{contain a}} flat [...] "Polapulse" [...] electrical battery, which powers {{systems in the}} camera, including exposure and <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> electronic flash, and a film ejection motor. The inclusion of the battery within the film pack ensures that a fresh battery is available with each new pack of film.|$|R
5000|$|By {{utilizing}} the iris sphincter muscle, some species move the lens back and forth, some stretch the lens flatter. Another mechanism regulates focusing chemically and independently of these two, by controlling {{growth of the}} eye and maintaining focal length. In addition, the pupil shape {{can be used to}} predict the focal system being utilized. A slit pupil can indicate the common multifocal system, while a circular pupil usually specifies a monofocal system. When using a circular form, the pupil will constrict under bright light, increasing the focal length, and will dilate when dark in order to decrease the depth of focus. [...] Note that a focusing method is not a requirement. As photographers know, focal errors increase as aperture increases. Thus, countless organisms with small eyes are active in direct sunlight and survive with no <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> at all. As a species grows larger, or transitions to dimmer environments, a means of focusing need only appear gradually.|$|E
5000|$|Panavision used {{a second}} add-on adapter lens that {{was linked to}} the focus {{position}} of the prime lens. This changed the anamorphic ratio along with focus position, which resulted in the area of interest on-screen having a normal-looking geometry. Later cylindrical lens systems used two sets of anamorphic optics to achieve the required change in aspect ratio: one more robust [...] "squeeze" [...] system that was coupled with a slight expansion sub-system. The expansion sub-system was counter-rotated in relation to the main squeeze system, all in mechanical interlinkage with the <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the prime lens. This combination changed the anamorphic ratio and minimized the effect of anamorphic mumps in the area of interest in the frame. Though these techniques were regarded as a fix for the anamorphic mumps, they were a compromise. Cinematographers still needed to be careful with their framing of the scene so that effects of the change in aspect ratio were not readily apparent.|$|E
50|$|The flange focal {{distance}} of 47 mm is fairly large, meaning that few other systems' lenses {{can be adapted}} to fit on a Leica R and retain infinity focus, but R lenses can be converted to other systems. The distance is only 0.5 mm larger than the Nikon F-mount, which is not sufficient to make a workable adapter, however, at least one Nikon camera has been modified with a Leica R bayonet mount to take R lenses, and at least two manufacturers make replacement mounts, allowing many Leica R lenses to be used directly on various camera systems, such as Nikon F mount cameras.For this purpose, the cams need to be removed, which is not always possible (e.g. early Elmarit-R f/2.8 35mm). The mounting flange may then need to be machined to allow free movement of the remaining cam.Sometimes, it is wise to refit the inner black anti-reflection ring, to avoid reflections within the <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> (e.g. Elmarit-R f/2.8 90mm or Elmarit-R f/2.8 135mm). A further point of consideration is whether the protrusion on the rear lens block will engage with the mirror of the target SLR. For some Nikon cameras, this may be an issue.|$|E
50|$|The Leica II {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1932, with a built in rangefinder coupled to the lens <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This model has a separate viewfinder (showing a reduced image) and rangefinder. In 1932 the flange to filmplane was standardised to 28.8mm, first implemented on Leica model C, and the Leica Standard the next year.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{models were}} copied {{in whole or}} in part by the U.S.S.R., mostly models which were {{intended}} for filming animation or special effects process plates, or for high-speed filming. In a few cases, the U.S.S.R. added spinning mirror-shutter reflex focusing and viewing, thereby deleting the Mitchell-designed rackover <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the Mitchell-designed side viewer.|$|R
5000|$|There are [...] "focus-free" [...] or [...] "fixed-focus" [...] {{binoculars}} {{that have}} no <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> other than the eyepiece adjustments that {{are meant to be}} set for the user's eyes and left fixed. These are considered to be compromise designs, suited for convenience, but not well suited for work that falls outside their designed range.|$|R
40|$|Design-centered {{learning}} environments offer great promise for providing effective, grounded learning experiences. Learners {{are given a}} set of design criteria and a library of components which they use to design artifacts that will satisfy the specified criteria. Despite their appeal, design-centered {{learning environments}} are plagued with complexities that can overwhelm learners. To address this problem, we have developed a proactive problem-solving <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> that helps learners cope with the complexities inherent in design-centered learning. By exploiting a rich model of the design context, the <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> selects design problems and intervenes with multimedia advice. The mechanism has been implemented in Design-A-Plant, a design-centered learning environment for botanical anatomy and physiology. Formative evaluations with middle school students are encouraging...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{framework}} of encoder-decoder with attention for sequence labelling based spoken language understanding. We introduce Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory - Long Short Term Memory networks (BLSTM-LSTM) as the encoder-decoder model to fully utilize the power of deep learning. In the sequence labelling task, the input and output sequences are aligned word by word, while the attention mechanism cannot provide the exact alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a novel <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> for encoder-decoder framework. Experiments on the standard ATIS dataset showed that BLSTM-LSTM with <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> defined the new state-of-the-art by outperforming standard BLSTM and attention based encoder-decoder. Further experiments also show that the proposed model is more robust to speech recognition errors. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{wireless}} {{medium must}} be effectively shared in an ad hoc network. The multihop nature of the network demands it, with packets often requiring several transmissions {{in order to reach}} their destination. This paper describes a mechanism for improving the IEEE 802. 11 MAC specifically for ad hoc networks. The Forward <b>Focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> uses the forwarding nature itself to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the forwarding process. A simulation-based performance evaluation reveals that the approach can yield significant improvements in network throughput...|$|E
50|$|All optics {{are subject}} to {{manufacturing}} tolerances; even with perfect manufacture, optical trains experience thermal expansion. <b>Focus</b> <b>mechanisms</b> must accommodate part variations; even custom-built systems may have some means of adjustment. For example, telescopes such as the Mars Orbiter Camera, which are nominally set to infinity, have thermal controls. Deviations from its operating temperature are actively compensated to prevent shifts of focus.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{important}} relationship between 3 C 273 and 3 C 279, the first two extragalactic sources detected at over 100 MeV energies, is their superluminal nature.
