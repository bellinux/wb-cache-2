5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> {{of the hands of}} the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E
5|$|By October 1918, Austria {{prepared}} to transfer her entire fleet to Yugoslavia {{in order to}} <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of Italian hands. On November 10, 1918, one day before the armistice, Yugoslav officers with scratch crews sailed Radetzky and Zrínyi out of Pola. As they cleared the breakwater at Pola, they sighted the approaching Italian fleet. The two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spolato. They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of USN submarine chasers in the area did. However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored {{the transfer of the}} Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy; instead, the ships were to be ceded to Italy. Radetzky and Zrínyi were broken up in Italy between 1920–21; Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand survived until 1926, when she too was scrapped in Italy.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Crittenden {{remained}} {{an outspoken critic}} of Jackson and his successor, Martin Van Buren. He supported Henry Clay's plan for distributing proceeds from the sale of public lands among the states, and also joined Clay in opposing the administration-backed Second Seminole War. One of the few administration proposals he supported was the recognition of the new Republic of Texas. During this period of Crittenden's service in the Senate, the issue of slavery rose to prominence. Crittenden was regarded as a moderate on the issue, seeking to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of politics altogether. In 1836, he resisted petitions by the Quakers to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C., but he also opposed radical pro-slavery measures such as John C. Calhoun's proposal to ban abolitionist literature from being delivered by mail in the Southern states.|$|E

5|$|Wales {{came close}} to {{qualifying}} for the 1986 FIFA World Cup despite losing their opening qualifying games away to Iceland and Spain. Wales then beat Iceland at Ninian Park, before recording a surprise 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park with a single Ian Rush goal. A 3–0 win over Spain at the Racecourse Ground meant that Wales could secure qualification by beating Scotland in their final qualification game at Ninian Park, though a draw would not be enough. The game ended in a 1–1 draw after a late Davie Cooper penalty cancelled out Mark Hughes's opener; Southall got a hand to the penalty, but could not <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> However, {{the result of the}} game was put into perspective when Scotland manager Jock Stein suffered a heart attack {{at the end of the}} game and died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of friendship.|$|E

The English lyrics were by Gifford Cochran and Jerrold Krimsky. That production, however, was not successful, closing after a run of only ten days. In the best known English translation, from the Marc Blitzstein 1954 version of The Threepenny Opera, which played Off-Broadway for over six years, the words are:Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear,And he shows them pearly whiteJust a jack-knife has Macheath, dearAnd he <b>keeps</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of sight.|$|R
5|$|By October 1918, Austria {{prepared}} to transfer her entire fleet {{to the newly}} created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (later to become the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in order to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of Italian hands. On 10 November 1918, one day before the Allied Armistice with Germany, and six days after the Austrians and Italians agreed to the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Yugoslav officers with scratch crews sailed Radetzky and Zrínyi out of Pola. Once outside Pola, the ships spotted heavy units of the Italian fleet; the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south to escape. A squadron of US Navy submarine chasers operating off the city of Spalato accepted the surrender of Radetzky and Zrínyi. However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored {{the transfer of the}} Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy which had already taken place; instead, the ships were ceded to Italy. Radetzky was broken up in Italy between 1920 and 1921.|$|E

25|$|By {{this point}} Haile Melekot was {{discouraged}} and gravely sick. His brother Seyfe, dissatisfied with his indecision, led the army south from Wollo to Menz then to Tegulet, abandoning Haile Melekot. The local governors were {{no match for}} the Emperor, and either were defeated or (like the governor of Efrata) went over to Tewodros' side. Rebellious Oromo burned Angolalla. The Negus of Shewa was horrified to learn that his mother Bezabish and his grandmother Zenebework (respectively widow and mother of the late Sahle Selassie) had crossed to the camp of Tewodros II and paid him homage in exchange for a guarantee that their personal lands would not be touched.

Singapore Airlines has, instead, welcomed the liberation of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route which it dominated together with Malaysia Airlines for over three decades, accounting for about 85% of the over 200 flight frequencies then operated. A highly lucrative route for LCCs due to its short distance and heavy traffic as the fourth-busiest in Asia, bringing Singapore Airline's capacity share on the route down to about 46.7%, Malaysia Airlines' down to 25.3%, and increase to 17.3% to the three LCCs now permitted on the route, and the remainder shared by three other airlines as of 22 September 2008. Singapore Airline's capacity share will drop further from 1 December 2008 when the route is opened up completely to liberalisation, when it announced plans to share its capacity with sister airline SilkAir. Malaysia Airlines, the main opponent to liberalisation of the route and deemed to be the party which stands to lose the most, will continue to codeshare with both Singapore Airlines and SilkAir on the route.|$|E

25|$|Most {{buffer stock}} schemes work {{along the same}} rough lines: first, two prices are determined, a floor and a ceiling (minimum and maximum price). When the price drops close to the floor price (after a new rich vein of silver is found, for example), the scheme {{operator}} (usually government) will start buying up the stock, ensuring that the price does not fall further. Likewise, when the price rises close to the ceiling, the operator depresses the price by selling off its holding. In the meantime, it must either store the commodity or otherwise <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the market (for example, by destroying it). If a basket of commodities is stored, their price stabilization can in turn stabilize the overall price level, preventing inflation. This scenario is illustrated on the right. Taking the market for wheat as an example, here, in years with normal harvests (S1) the price is within the allowed range and the operator {{does not need to}} act. In bumper years (S3), however, the prices begins to fall, and the government must buy wheat to prevent the price from collapsing; likewise, in years with bad harvests (S2), the government must sell its stock to keep prices down. The result is far less fluctuation in price. Price stability then leads to greater joint welfare (the sum of consumer and producer surplus.|$|E
