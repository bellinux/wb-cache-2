500|$|From August 2, {{the conference}} debated whether Peng should be disciplined, what {{punishment}} Peng should receive, {{and for what}} reasons. On August 16 the conference passed two resolutions. The first resolution condemned Peng {{as the leader of}} an [...] "anti-Party clique", and called for Peng's removal from the positions of Defense Minister and Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission. The resolution did not eject Peng from the Communist Party, and it allowed Peng to retain his position in the Politburo, but he was excluded from Politburo meetings for years. The second resolution recognized Mao's dominance within the Party and subtly {{called for an end to}} the policies of the Great Leap Forward. After Mao had rallied the rest of the Party against him, Peng's options were limited to stubbornly standing his <b>ground,</b> <b>engaging</b> in a humiliating self-criticism, or suicide. After private discussion with other senior leaders, Peng considered the prestige of Mao and the unity of the Party and agreed to make a self-criticism, which was publicly reviewed at the conference, in which he admitted that he had made [...] "severe mistakes" [...] associated with his [...] "rightist viewpoint", that he had been a follower of Li Lisan and Wang Ming, and in which he openly implicated his supporters in his [...] "mistakes". After the conference, Peng said privately to Zhou Enlai regarding his self-criticism: [...] "For the first time in my life, I have spoken out against my very heart!" [...] Mao purged most of Peng's supporters from important offices following the conference, almost completely isolating Peng politically for the rest of his life. Peng later reflected that he was confused that Mao could have interpreted his private letter as a political attack, and wondered why, after thirty years of working together, Mao could not have discussed the matter privately with him, if Peng had indeed made the mistakes Mao claimed he did.|$|E

Their business ’ profitability and reputation depend greatly {{on their ability to}} accurately estimate the cost of running their fleet and delivering services to their clients. This project utilises historical cost data from Downer EDI Mining to produce cost profiles and models for their mining equipment consumables which include buckets and bodies (B&B) and <b>ground</b> <b>engaging</b> tools (GET). Such models are used by estimators to produce tenders and predict future costs in running their fleet. An investigation is also made into the factors that contribute to the wear and subsequent costs of consumables. Findings suggest that the wear and costs of most mining equipment consumables are related to their size. In some cases there was also a significant correlation to the number of hours of work, suggesting that older machines tend to incur higher costs. Finally, it was also found that equipment subject to intense exposure with abrasive material have GET costs related to the abrasion index of the material...|$|E

Heat transfer depends upon thermal properties of the soil, such as specific heat, conductivity and thermal diffusivity.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to realize minimum of a 2 x {{increase}} in wear life of <b>ground</b> <b>engaging</b> components used on mining machines, two potentially cost effective processes were explored {{for the production of}} tailored, highly abrasion resistant materials: (1) hybrid pressure casting of steel composites, and (2) arc lamp fusing of thermal spray coatings. Steel composites comprised of cermet or oxide hard particles were successfully produced using pressure casting processes, although a cost effective process has not yet been identified for oxide particles. Both composites achieved project wear targets in high stress gouging wear, but the cermet composites did not meet the targets in impact wear, due to poor matrix toughness resulting from particle dissolution. Oxide composites had superior toughness and are expected to meet impact wear goals. Arc lamp processing of thermal spray coatings was successfully demonstrated to produce a metallurgical bond at the coating interface. Functionally graded materials were developed and successfully fused to allow for the accommodation of thermal process stresses in an intermediate layer. Ultimately, three functionally graded materials were identified as having high stress, three-body abrasion resistance sufficient to exceed project goals...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of Unmanned Agricultural Ground Vehicles (UAGVs) {{has been}} on the in- crease in recent decades as UAGVs have great {{potential}} in agricultural applications, and thus UAGVs are expected to rule farms in the future. The use of UAGVs benefits from replacing human operators to do tiresome as well as hazardous work, thus reducing the risk. It can also significantly improve the efficiency to solve food shortages due to the dramatic growth of world. Path Tracking has been an important topic in the development of UAGVs, however the automatic guidance of farm vehicle becomes more difficult and challenging than that of standard mobile robots as farm vehicles are subjected to significant disturbances due to rough terrain and <b>ground</b> <b>engaging</b> operations. The controller of autonomous farm vehicles is required to be sufficiently robust to both guarantee high path tracking accuracy and stability. This thesis mainly researches path tracking control methods for three kinds of UAGVs in the presence of significant wheel slip. In path tracking, UAGVs are guided to follow a de- sired path from an initial position while the controller keeps minimizing offsets with respect to the reference path. To achieve the accuracy required in agriculture, this work utilizes offset models derived based on kinematic models, which take both lateral and longitudinal slips into account. A model predictive controller with receding min-max optimization is then proposed {{to address the problem of}} wheel slip in UAGVs. This adaptive min-max model predictive controller provides both robustness and adaptation for path tracking. The superior performance of the proposed controller is verified by kinematic simulation, dynamic simulation as well as field testing, compared to that of the classical model predictive control. Then, the proposed controller is also compared with a well-known robust sliding mode controller and a well-performing backstepping controller, which is carried out by implementing controllers on a UAGV at Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute. Results from simulations and experiments validate that the proposed adaptive min-max model predictive controller ensures the required accuracy and robustness in the presence of wheel slip without any slip measurement or estimation.
