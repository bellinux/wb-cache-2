GTRI employs around 1,765people, and is involved in approximately $305million in research annually for more than 200clients in <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} value of {{contracts}} coming to the station significantly increased during World War II; the 1943–1944 budget {{was the first in}} which <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government</b> contracts exceeded the station's other income, most notably, its state appropriation. Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station's appropriation by 40%, but increased support from <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government</b> eventually compensated for lower state funding. World War II is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially telecommunications and electronic warfare; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were a study on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy–sponsored radar research.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored research, with the 1943–1944 budget being the first in which <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government</b> contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state appropriation). Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the state had cut the station's appropriation by 40 percent, but increased support from <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government</b> eventually counteracted low state support. The electronics and communications research that Directors Gerald Rosselot and James E. Boyd attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research.

5|$|The {{university}} historically pioneered {{research and}} training collaborations between academia, <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government.</b> In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm. In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses. On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration {{with the federal government}} on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.|$|E

25|$|The {{strategic}} plan also encouraged research collaborations with <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government</b> partners. In 2016, {{as part of}} a broadbased effort to solve the critical problem of antibiotic resistance, the US Department of Health & Human Services selected the Boston University School of Law (LAW)—and Kevin Outterson, a BU professor of law—to lead a $350 million trans-Atlantic public-private partnership to foster the preclinical development of new antibiotics and antimicrobial rapid diagnostics and vaccines.|$|E
25|$|Another {{function}} of the foundation was {{the promotion of the}} field of chemistry and its contributions to society. This goal required the identification and funding of chemical research in academia, <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government.</b> It also required seeking out donors to fund research deemed important. An example of Herty’s efforts occurred in 1928, when Herty worked on behalf of his alma mater, UGA, to fund a research professorship and laboratory equipment for Professor Alfred Scott to study the turpentine-derivative resene.|$|E

25|$|The Australian economy {{stood in}} sharp {{contrast}} to war-ravaged Europe, and newly arrived migrants found employment in a booming manufacturing <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government</b> assisted programs such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme. This hydroelectricity and irrigation complex in south-east Australia consisted of sixteen major dams and seven power stations constructed between 1949 and 1974. It remains the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia. Necessitating the employment of 100,000 people from over 30 countries, to many it denotes the birth of multicultural Australia.|$|E
25|$|There was resistance, {{much of it}} from Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. But {{there was}} also a pattern of denial, {{cover-up}} and cozy bureaucratic collusion between <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>government,</b> the last especially notorious in Japan but by no means limited to that country. Even then, pro-nuclear power forces could prevail only by managing to instill in the minds of Japanese people a dichotomy between the physics of nuclear power and that of nuclear weapons, an illusory distinction made not only in Japan but throughout the world.|$|E
