40|$|The {{field of}} Bloodstain Pattern Analysis has had many {{achievements}} {{since the mid}} 1900 ’s, such as using computers in a physical crime scene. However, the computer aided programs that are in use today are sometimes bulky, many times expensive, and always require {{a large amount of}} training to be used properly. In addition to this problem, many investigators use the same formula of determining the angle of incidence on every type of surface, planar or not, which creates mistakes in their findings. Using a technological approach, this investigation examined a new approach for collecting data from bloodstains. This examination answered the researcher’s question of, “Will the theory of cylindrical <b>drop</b> <b>paths</b> to determine angle of incidence be as accurate and precise on planar surfaces as the industry standard?” Testing the Cylindrical Capture Method and the digital caliper method against the true angle of 187 bloodstain samples, this research showed that the Cylindrical Capture Method is a valid way of collecting the angle of incidence of passive bloodstains and yields results comparable to and often better than, the current digital caliper method. ...|$|R

40|$|The Navy's Impact Burial Model (IMPACT 35) {{predicts the}} {{cylindrical}} mine trajectory in {{air and water}} columns and burial depth and orientation in sediment. Impact burial calculations are derived primarily from the sediment characteristics and from the mine's three-dimensional air and water phase trajectories. Accurate burial prediction requires that the model's water phase trajectory reasonably mimics the object's true trajectory. In order to determine what effect varying the shape to more closely match real-world mines has on the shape's water phase trajectory, Mine Drop Experiment II was conducted. The experiment consisted of dropping four separate types of scaled shapes (Sphere, Gumdrop, Manta, and Rockan) into a water column, and the resultant falls were filmed from two nearly orthogonal angles. Initial drop position, initial velocities, and the drop angle were controlled parameters. The Sphere and Gumdrop shapes tended to have smooth arcing <b>drop</b> <b>paths.</b> The Manta shape dropped much more slowly than the Sphere or Gumdrop shapes. The Manta {{had a tendency to}} either fall in a spiral with its bottom parallel to the bottom or on its side in a twisting motion. The Rockan tended to either flip or swoop as it entered the water but then settle in a slow spin with its primary length parallel to the bottom. The dispersion of all four shapes at the selected depth of 2. 5 m was wide and variable. The data collected from the experiment can be used to develop and validate the mine Impact Burial Prediction Model with operational, non-cylindrical mine shapes...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{geographic}} routing in wireless networks {{has gained}} attention due to several advantages of location information. Location information eliminates {{the necessity to}} set up and maintain explicit routes. These advantages allow scalability especially in dynamic and unstable wireless networks. However, no matter which technologies or techniques a location system uses, its measurements will have some amount of quanti able inaccuracy depending on environment andsystem. These inaccuracies may a ect the performance and even correctness of geographic routing. However, thus far, these impacts have not been studied in-depth. In this paper, we analyze the impact of location inaccuracy on geographic routing. Our study shows the signi cant impact of location inaccuracy on the performance of geographic routing in terms of packet <b>drops,</b> non-optimal <b>paths</b> and routing loops...|$|R

With the advent of access technologies aiming to provide solutions to the last mile problem, there needs to be a method by which an ISP can study TCP connections over such equipment. TCP in itself has been designed to be stable and has been proven to be stable over many access technologies. But in many cases, the connections are not stable enough from a customer’s perspective. Our effort has been to develop a TCP connection monitoring methodology that the ISP can study the rate at which connections are lost. We develop a connection monitoring tool (ConMon) that measures round trip time and throughput apart from detecting connections <b>drops.</b> The <b>path</b> to the end point is also traced in order to study reasons for possible connection drops.

5000|$|Knowledge of the {{projectile}} <b>drop</b> and <b>path</b> {{has some}} practical uses to shooters {{even if it}} does not describe the actual trajectory of the projectile. For example, if the vertical projectile position over a certain range reach is within the vertical height of the target area the shooter wants to hit, the point of aim does not necessarily need to be adjusted over that range; the projectile is considered to have a sufficiently flat point-blank range trajectory for that particular target. Also known also as [...] "battle zero", maximum point-blank range is also of importance to the military. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing their weapon's sights on the center of mass of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. The current trend for elevated sights and higher-velocity cartridges in assault rifles is in part due to a desire to extend the maximum point-blank range, which makes the rifle easier to use.|$|R
25|$|A {{principal}} {{benefit of}} modeling {{is the ability}} to explicitly compare models: Rather than simply returning a value for each component, the modeler can compute confidence intervals on parameters, but, crucially, can <b>drop</b> and add <b>paths</b> and test the effect via statistics such as the AIC. Thus, for instance to test for predicted effects of family or shared environment on behavior, an AE model can be objectively compared to a full ACE model. For example, we can ask of the figure above for height: Can C (shared environment) be dropped without significant loss of fit? Alternatively, confidence intervals can be calculated for each path.|$|R
40|$|Traditional routing {{protocols}} based on link-state information (e. g., OSPF, OLSR, FSR, LVA and STAR) form a network topology through {{the exchange of}} link-state information by flooding or by reporting partial topology information and compute shortest routes to each reachable destination using a path-selection algorithm like Dijkstra's algorithm or the BellmanFord algorithm. However, in an on-demand link-state routing protocol, no one node needs to know the paths to every other node in the network. Accordingly, when a node chooses a next hop for a given destination, it must be true that the next hop has reported a path to the same destination; otherwise, packets sent through that node would be <b>dropped.</b> Traditional <b>path</b> selection algorithms do not consider this constraint and cannot be used for computing shortest paths in emerging on-demand link-state {{routing protocols}} based on hop-by-hop packet forwarding rather than source routing. In this paper, we present a new path-selection algorithm that computes shortest paths with the above on-demand routing constraint. This algorithm has 2) complexity, which can be less complex than Dijkstra's algorithm (O(n 2)) when d n (d: density of the graph and n: number of nodes) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using a {{numerical}} model of solar radiative transfer that is calibrated against benchmark computations, it is shown that atmospheric water vapor, {{together with the}} microphysical characteristics of water <b>drops</b> (liquid water <b>path</b> and effective radius), {{plays an important role}} in the total solar spectrum reflection and absorption in overcast skies. For any specific cloud type, the water vapor column above the cloud and the presence of saturated water vapor inside the cloud contribute significantly to atmospheric absorption. These factors also affect the relationship between the net shortwave fluxes at the top and bottom of overcast atmospheres, in particular, inhibiting a general universal linkage between these two quantities. Thus neglect of details concerning the vertical location, extent, and microphysical aspects of clouds can lead to biases in the inference of surface irradiance using top-of-the-atmosphere measurements. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of stochastic methods in pedigree analysis has enabled geneticists to tackle computations intractable by standard deterministic methods.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I present {{a simple and}} {{efficient}} queue management (EQM) technique based on optimal bandwidth allocation for networks. Each router calculates the bandwidth share (throughput) (1) of each interfering flow at a link using link capacity and Interface IP Address (see RFC 3630) or round trip time (RTT) and congestion window size of the flows which are carried in the packets. The sources send packets and the routers in the <b>path</b> <b>drop</b> or allow the packets based on a certain probability and label the non-dropped packets with the allowable optimal throughput for the next round. Each router in the path modifies this label and the sources eventually adjust their sending rates based on the allowable throughput they get from the returning ACKs. In this way EQM finds the fair bandwidth allocation and gives fair queue management. I also a prove that EQM can converge to a stable point...|$|R
