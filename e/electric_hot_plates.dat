3000|$|Various casting methods (Plaster, Moulage, Faxfilm (Cowres, Davm L, Dodge, James K. A Method for Comparison of Tool Marks, 1948; Science and Practice Committee Report, 1949), {{plasticine}} (Kirk, 1953; O'hara & Osterbtrn, 1949), thermoplastics (Kirk, 1953), wax and electroplating (Tarko, 1948)) {{have been}} proposed for reproduction and comparison of individual characteristics marks on fired cartridge cases {{as an aid to}} firearms and tool mark identification. Most of the proposed methods had little or limited success due to time-consuming techniques and unsatisfactory results. In 1938, Moritz proposed a technique utilizing cellulose acetate with an acetone or amyl-acetate vehicle for the reproduction and comparison of the individual characteristics on cartridge cases, bullets and breech faces (Morrrz, 1938; Biasotti, 1956). The only advantage of the technique was preparation of flexible, translucent cast that could be flattened and viewed by transillumination thus reducing or obviating the difficulties inherent in the direct observation of curved or inaccessible surfaces by reflected illumination. Later, Faxfilm (trade name) became a commercial adaptation of the technique proposed by Moritz. It had larger application in studying the quality of finish on machined metal parts. The use of Faxfilm in law enforcement work has been reported, but literature on its practical application is meager (Science and Practice Committee Report, 1949; Biasotti, 1956). Cowles and Dodge have reported the successful application of Faxfilm to tool mark recovery and comparison and have pointed out its limitations when applied to deep impressions or to painted surfaces (Cowres, Davm L, Dodge, James K. A Method for Comparison of Tool Marks, 1948). Later another method for to form replicas of the fired bullets were proposed using sheets of vinyl thermoplastic varying in thickness from 0.030 to 0.125 " [...] (depending on the depth of the mark). The disadvantage of the method was the application of heat (100 to 125  °C.) and pressure (Kirk, 1953). An infrared lamp or <b>electric</b> <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> were used for heating. These replicas were flattened and viewed by transillumination as either a positive or negative image. Accurate, reproducible replicas, free from air bubbles, shrinkage, and warping were obtained. However, the necessity of applying heat and pressure simultaneously, which may not be a serious disadvantage in the laboratory, makes this method rather impractical to use at the crime scene in the recovery of tool marks. Another material commonly used for lifting firing pin impression is plasticine, it is also used for replication of rifiling marks of fired bullet (Jain et al., 2004).|$|E

The detailed operation {{procedures of the}} new method are as follows: About 0. 05 similar to 0. 10 g of powdered (200 mesh) coal sample {{was placed in a}} glass beaker, 10 mL of nitric acid (HNO 3) and 2 mL of perchloric acid (HClO 4) were added to the beaker in sequence, then the beaker was covered with a watching glass and placed in a fume cupboard standing overnight. The beaker was placed on an <b>electric</b> <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> (180 degrees C) for sample decomposition the next day. The beaker was moved away from the <b>electric</b> <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> when white smoke arose in the beaker, the sample color turned white or grey and the solution turned clear. Three milliliter of hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution (6 mol. L- 1) was added to the beaker after the temperature of the beaker returned to room temperature. The beaker was heated on the <b>electric</b> <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> again, and then moved away when white smoke started arising again. One milliliter of HCl was added in the beaker after the temperature of the beaker returned to room temperature. After that, the digested sample was transferred to a 25 mL test tube which was filled with ultrapure water to the tube's full volume. This solution was used for Se determination directly. Three milliliter of the Se test solution prepared above was transferred to a 15 mL glass test tube, 1 mL of thiourea/ascorbic acid solution (2. 5 g. mL(- 1)) and 1 mL of the concentrated HCl was added to the 15 mL test tube. The test tube was then filled with ultrapure water to its full volume. The solution was used for As determination after shaking well and 40 min standing. Finally, Se and As concentrations in these prepared solutions were measured by using the AFS- 9780 instrument (Beijing Haiguang Instrument Co., LTD, Beijing, China). Two Chinese Coal Certified Reference Materials (GBW 11115 and GBW 11117) were tested using this method, and the recoveries of As were 99. 7 %similar to 100. 3 % and the relative standard deviation (RSD) for As and Se were 5. 6 %similar to 6. 0 % and 11. 1 %similar to 13., respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) of the method for Se and As determination were 0. 01 and 0. 05 mu g. L- 1, respectively.

40|$|Supply {{web based}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{was used to}} assess {{environmental}} impacts of Elovena oat flakes, produced by RavintoRaisio in Finland. Data for the system model were acquired from the field, as empirical investigation of the real processes, thus providing a reliable basis to analyse the sources of environmental impacts (hot spots) and to consider respective improvement possibilities. The assessment took account of all stages of the most important product and distribution systems of oat flakes concerned from the production of farm inputs and raw material to the retail stores and, finally, to the porridge consumed. The environmental load from farm operations was the primary cause for global warming, eutrophication, acidification and photochemical ozone creation potential in production chain. However, traditional porridge cooking caused multiple carbon dioxide emissions compared to the production chain of flakes. Most of the environmental impacts of the system can be affected by choosing the porridge cooking method. The air emissions of porridge cooked in microwave were essentially smaller than when using traditional <b>electric</b> <b>hot</b> <b>plate.</b> The study generated knowledge improving the efficiency of production chain, which {{can be used as a}} basis for product improvement measures in the long term and according to the goals of sustainable development. Some improvements have been made in the production chain. Biogas has replaced heavy fuel oil in the generation of steam used for producing oat flakes.

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{activity of}} Hypericum perforatum {{was assessed using}} models of inflammation, nociception, and gastric mucosal injury in rats. H. perforatum was given systemically as well as orally. When administered systemically, H. perforatum (50 – 300 mg/kg, s. c.) produced a dose-related and significant inhibition of the edematogenic response to s. p. injection of carrageenan. The percentages of maximal inhibition by the above doses were 53. 7, 61. 3, and 75. 3 %, respectively (compared to 90 % after 50 mg/kg fluoxetine and 60. 7 % after 72 mg/kg etodolac). In tests of nociception, H. perforatum, administered orally, displayed antinociceptive activity in the tail <b>electric</b> stimulation and <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> tests. The antinociceptive activity was observed with 25 mg/kg and a maximal increase in <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> latency by 50 % (compared to 73. 2 and 77. 8 % increases by 5 or 10 mg/kg fluoxetine, respectively). In contrast, the acetic acid–induced (0. 6 %, i. p.) writhing was significantly reduced by fluoxetine or etodolac, but not H. perforatum. Also, the nociceptive response caused by i. p. injection of capsaicin (1. 6 μg/paw) was unaffected by H. perforatum, but reduced by fluoxetine. Injection of H. perforatum (50, 125, or 250 mg/kg, s. c.) to pylorus-ligated rats, decreased gastric acid secretion, but increased indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal lesions dose dependently. These results demonstrate that H. perforatum exhibits antiedematogenic and antinociceptive properties, which may be of value {{for the management of}} inflammatory painful conditions.

When the temperature of <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> reaches the preset value, the thin film heat flux sensor senses the heat flow from <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> to cold plate. Heat flux sensors detect the amount of heat flow from hot surface to cold surface through fabric. The heat flow value and thickness are used to calculate fabric conductivity and finally the thermal resistance.|$|R

The <b>hot</b> <b>plate,</b> called the sole plate, {{is made of}} aluminium or stainless steel polished to be as smooth as possible; it is sometimes coated with a low-friction heat-resistant plastic to reduce friction below that of the metal plate. The heating element is controlled by a thermostat that switches the current on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The invention of the resistively heated electric iron is credited to Henry W. Seeley of New York City in 1882. In the same year an iron heated by a carbon arc was introduced in France, but was too dangerous to be successful. The early electric irons had {{no easy way to}} control their temperature, and the first thermostatically controlled electric iron appeared in the 1920s. Later, steam was used to iron clothing. Credit for the invention of the steam iron goes to Thomas Sears. The first commercially available electric steam iron was introduced in 1926 by a New York drying and cleaning company, Eldec, but was not a commercial success. The patent for an electric steam iron and dampener was issued to Max Skolnik of Chicago in 1934. In 1938 Skolnik granted the Steam-O-Matic Corporation of New York the exclusive right to manufacture steam-electric irons. This was the first steam iron to achieve any degree of popularity, and led the way to more widespread use of the electric steam iron during the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R

To the problem of choosing design parameters, the orthogonal experimental design method was used, the simulation software ANSYS was applied, the design parameters on the various conditions were analyzed, Then a regression model was obtained based these simulation data. It is consistent between the result of regression model {{and the result of}} simulation. The regression model indicates a better choice direction of the design parameters of <b>hot</b> <b>plate.</b> IEEE Beijing Sect...|$|R
