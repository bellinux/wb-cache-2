25|$|Tokoroa's {{man-made}} Lake Moana-Nui {{was created}} in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large earthmoving equipment and a concrete dam wall with a <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early extreme sport unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} {{full-face}} mask exist, and {{the procedure for}} clearing them depends on the construction. They will automatically drain through the exhaust port of the demand valve provided the water can get to it, {{but this is not}} always possible, and in models which use an internal mouthpiece, the procedure is the same as with a half mask. Models which use an oral/nasal internal seal will usually drain to the demand valve or an additional <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> at a low point when the diver's face is roughly upright or face down, and these will clear during normal breathing for small leaks, and may be cleared of major flooding by using the purge button on the demand valve to fill the mask with air.|$|E
500|$|According to the Smithsonian, Roper's first {{velocipede}} of 1867–1869 used {{a purpose}} built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine, but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame, and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame {{built by the}} Hanlon Brothers, who made and demonstrated boneshakers at fairs and circuses, although the Smithsonian's Roper has an iron frame. It had a wheelbase of [...] and two [...] diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden s with wooden spokes. It had a rigid, forged iron fork, and a solid handlebar with wooden grips. Unlike the modern twistgrip, where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around the handlebar to open the throttle, the Roper velocipede's entire bar was rotated with both hands, {{and it had a}} dual function. When turned forward, the throttle opened, and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel. The seat doubled as the water reservoir; or the water tank can be described as saddle shaped. A hand pump transferred water from this tank to the boiler. The boiler was between the wheels with a [...] "nautical looking" [...] chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider, with the firebox in the lower half of this housing, all of which hung from the frame with a spring to absorb shock, while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing {{to the back of the}} frame. There were three water level cocks on the left side, near the water pump, and a <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> on the bottom. The two cylinders, with bores of about [...] were located on either side of the frame, from the upper part of the boiler near the chimney, connecting to [...] cranks on the rear wheel. Exhaust steam, conveyed by tubing to the base of the chimney, provided a forced draft.|$|E

50|$|Inside the submarine, the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> {{is opened}} {{to drain the}} water from the chamber and {{equalize}} the pressure to that within the submarine. The pressure inside the chamber will quickly force all water from the chamber out the <b>drain</b> <b>valve.</b> Lowering the pressure inside the chamber will also force the outer hatch shut again because of greater sea pressure outside the submarine.

50|$|The valves {{required}} {{for oil and}} gas separators are oil discharge control valve, water-discharge control <b>valve</b> (three-phase operation), <b>drain</b> <b>valves,</b> block valves, pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.|$|R

An assembly (10) of monogroove heat pipe legs (15) can be operated automatically as either heat acquisition devices or heat discharge sources. The liquid channels (27) of the heat pipe legs (15) are connected to a reservoir (35) which is filled and drained by respective filling and <b>draining</b> <b>valves</b> (30, 32). Information from liquid level sensors (50, 51) on the reservoir (35) is combined (60) with temperature information (55) from the liquid heat exchanger (12) and temperature information (56) from the assembly vapor conduit (42) to regulate filling and draining of the reservoir (35), so that the reservoir (35) in turn serves the liquid supply/drain needs of the heat pipe legs (15), on demand, by passive capillary action (20, 28) ...|$|R
5000|$|When air at {{atmospheric}} pressure is compressed, it contains much more water vapor than the high-pressure air can hold. Relative humidity {{is governed by}} the properties of water and is not affected by air pressure. Management of the excessive moisture is a requirement of a compressed air distribution system. System designers must ensure that piping maintains a slope, to prevent accumulation of moisture in low parts of the piping system. <b>Drain</b> <b>valves</b> may be installed at multiple points of a large system to allow trapped water to be blown out. Taps from piping headers may be arranged at the tops of pipes, so that moisture is not carried over into piping branches feeding equipment. [...] Piping sizes are selected to avoid excessive energy loss in the piping system due to excess velocity in straight pipes at times of peak demand, or due to turbulence at pipe fittings.|$|R

40|$|Building 247 -F at SRS was {{a roughly}} 110, 000 ft{sup 2 } two-story {{facility}} designed and constructed {{during the height}} of the cold war naval buildup to provide additional naval nuclear fuel manufacturing capacity in early 1980 s. The building layout is shown in Fig. 1. A photograph of the facility is shown in Fig. 2. The manufacturing process employed a wide variety of acids, bases, and other hazardous materials. As the cold war wound down, the need for naval fuel declined. Consequently, the facility was shut down and underwent initial deactivation. All process systems were flushed with water and drained using the existing process <b>drain</b> <b>valves.</b> However, since these drains were not always installed at the lowest point in piping and equipment systems, a significant volume of liquid remained after initial deactivation was completed in 1990. At that time, a non-destructive assay of the process area identified approximately 17 (+/- 100 %) kg of uranium held up in equipment and piping...|$|R
40|$|The Velocity Control Propulsion Subsystem (VCPS) was {{designed}} the propulsion required for trajectory and lunar orbit corrections of the spacecraft. A GFE clamp assembly physically attaches the VCPS to the spacecraft and {{the unit is}} ejected after completing the required corrections. The VCPS is physically and functionally separated from the spacecraft except for the electrical and telemetry interfaces. A GFE transtage provides the superstructure on which the VCPS is assembled. The subsystem consists of two 5 foot pound rocket engine assemblies, 4 propellant tanks, 2 latching valves, 2 fill and <b>drain</b> <b>valves,</b> a system filter, pressure transducer, gas and propellant manifolds and electrical heaters and thermostats. The RAE-B VCPS program covered the design, manufacture and qualification of one subsystem. This subsystem was to be manufactured, subjected to qualification tests; and refurbished, if necessary, prior to flight.

40|$|Reliable {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) draining methods {{are needed to}} treat hydrocephalus, a chronic debilitating brain disorder. Current shunt implant treatments are characterized by high failure rates that are to some extent attributed to their length and multiple components. The designed valve, made of hydrogel, steers away from such protracted schemes and intends to provide a direct substitute for faulty arachnoid granulations, the brain’s natural CSF <b>draining</b> <b>valves,</b> and restore CSF draining operations within the cranium. The valve relies on innate hydrogel swelling phenomena to strengthen reverse flow sealing at idle and negative pressures thereby alleviating common valve failure mechanisms. In vitro measurements display operation in range of natural CSF draining (cracking pressure, P[subscript T] ~ 1 – 110 mmH[subscript 2]O and outflow hydraulic resistance, R[subscript h] ~ 24 – 152 mmH[subscript 2]O/mL/min), with negligible reverse flow leakage (flow, Q[subscript O] > − 10 µL/min).

50|$|Chicoutimi cleared Faslane on 4 October 2004 on her homeward {{journey to}} Canada. Since Faslane was a nuclear {{submarine}} base, Chicoutimi {{was forced to}} travel on the surface for {{the first stage of}} the passage. On 5 October Chicoutimi was passing through a gale with 6 m seas. During a watch change at 0300 sea water entered the conning tower. The lower hatch prevented the water from entering the sub; however, the drain in the tower failed to operate. When the lower hatch was opened, the water fell into the sub. However, the water was pumped overboard and the incident noted. The <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> required repair before diving. At 1052 two crew entered the tower to perform repairs. The upper hatch was opened. However, after roughly 25 minutes, another tool was needed from within the sub. When the lower hatch was opened, the submarine was rocked by a large wave, throwing roughly 500 gallons of sea water into Chicoutimi. Electrical explosions and fire erupted soon afterward, spreading quickly. In order to fight the fire, all systems aboard the submarine were shut down, leaving the submarine dead in the water. An attempt to restore auxiliary power caused another fire to break out. At 1912, attempts to remove smoke by starting an oxygen generator caused another fire. Nine sailors were injured, three seriously.|$|R
5000|$|... 7-122. GENERAL. The word {{safetying}} {{is a term}} universally used in {{the aircraft}} industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, <b>drain</b> cocks, <b>valves,</b> and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, cotter pins, and self-locking nuts. Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{unprecedented}} Soviet {{requests for}} Western technological aid {{with the development}} of the Tu-144. The request was made despite obviously not helping to foster Soviet technological prestige, {{which was one of the}} key purposes of the Tu-144 programme. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-Aérospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 air intakes. (The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of air intakes and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the air intakes, fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear spray guards (aka water deflectors or [...] "mud flaps" [...] that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips). These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers. Soviet approaches were also reported in British mainstream press of the time, such as The Times.|$|R
