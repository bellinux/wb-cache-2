40|$|This paper {{describes}} for {{the first}} time a new lithofacies that formed in the passage zone during the construction of pahoehoe lava-fed deltas in the north and NE coastal areas of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Atlantic Ocean). These lavafed deltas, which are Pliocene in age, present similar lithofacies associations to those previously described in the literature, except for two distinct features: low abundance of hyaloclastites and a new lithofacies in the passage zone. This new lithofacies, which we propose to name ‘polygonal <b>feeder</b> <b>tubes</b> filled with hydroclasts’, comprises metre-scale lava <b>feeder</b> <b>tubes</b> with decimetre-scale coherent poorly vesicular and aphanitic rinds of polygonal morphology, filled with closely packed hydroclasts generated in situ.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has examined competitive behavior in rats.

One possibility is that the response is a traditional operant. Although there is no explicit contingency with reinforcement, rats that do not engage in the response are unlikely to consume pellets. Alternatively, the competitive response might represent a species-specific foraging mode, controlled by the competitive foraging environment but not controlled by its consequences. The present experiments utilize an omission procedure, in which engaging in competitive responses cancels delivery of reinforcement. In Experiment I {{there was no difference in}} the rate of competitive response between the omission phase and the baseline phases. Although it would be tempting to conclude from these results that the behavior is not subject to its consequences, additional explanations must first be ruled out.

Trocadores de calor constituídos de microcanais paralelos são considerados uma boa solução tecnológica em resposta à crescente demanda por sistemas compactos, que necessitam de alta dissipação de calor, garantindo ainda a redução de custos de materiais e o uso de menor quantidade de fluidos refrigerantes. O presente trabalho está subdividido em dois estudos experimentais, partes A e B, que se complementam e que têm como objetivo estudar o comportamento termo-hidráulico no {{interior}} desses componentes providos de microcanais. Na parte A, a ebulição convectiva do fluido refrigerante R 134 a é analisada no interior de nove microcanais paralelos, de seção transversal circular, posicionados na horizontal, com diâmetro interno e comprimento de 0, 77 mm e 150 mm, respectivamente. A caracterização do início da ebulição (ONB) e os comportamentos do coeficiente de transferência de calor por convecção e da queda de pressão por atrito, obtidos experimentalmente, são analisados em função de diferentes variáveis, como: padrão de escoamento bifásico, título de vapor, xv, fluxo de calor, q?; velocidade mássica, G, grau de subresfriamento, ?Tsub, e pressão de entrada no tubo distribuidor, pent. Os resultados experimentais obtidos são também parametricamente comparados com os métodos de previsão da literatura. As faixas das condições de teste são as seguintes: 0 Abstract : Heat exchangers {{consisting of}} parallel micro-channels {{are considered a}} good technological solution {{in response to the}} increasing demand for compact systems which require high heat flux dissipation, ensuring a decrease in the material costs and the use of a lower quantity of refrigerants. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the thermo-hydraulic behavior inside these components provided by microchannels. This study is divided into two experimental studies (A and B) which are complementary. In part A, the convective boiling of the refrigerant R 134 a is analyzed within nine parallel microchannels of circular cross section, positioned horizontally, with internal diameter and length of 0. 77 mm and 150 mm, respectively. The characterization of the onset of nucleate boiling (ONB), along with the behavior of the convective heat transfer coefficient and friction pressure drop, obtained experimentally, is carried out considering different variables: two-phase flow pattern; vapor quality, xv; heat flux, q"; mass velocity, G; subcooling degree, ?Tsub, and inlet manifold pressure, pent. The experimental results are also parametrically compared with prediction methods described in the literature. The ranges for the test conditions are as follows: 0 <xv < 0. 89, 600 <pent < 900 kPa, 1. 0 <?Tsub < 20. 1 K, 5. 0 <q"< 220 kW/m 2 and 250 <G< 1001 kg/m 2 s. The experimental results show that the flow pattern has a strong influence on the heat transfer coefficient, and that different heat transfer mechanisms are associated with each of the flow patterns observed, whereas the frictional pressure drop is a direct function of the mass velocity, vapor quality and pressure of the system. In part B, the two-phase flow distribution, using as the working fluid a mixture of air and water, is analyzed inside a circular header coupled to nine branched parallel microchannels of circular cross-section with internal diameter and length of 0. 8 mm and 150 mm, respectively. The flow distribution of the liquid phase among the nine branched channels was observed according to the position and orientation of the header, the branched channels and the <b>feeder</b> <b>tube,</b> as well as the mass velocity and gas quality. In this second study, fifteen different assembly configurations (header, <b>feeder</b> <b>tube</b> and branched channels) were investigated, for mass velocities of 200, 400 and 600 kg/m 2 s and gas quality values of 0 to 0. 75. The results show that the effect of the gas quality on the liquid distribution changes considerably depending on the configuration (feeder tube-header-channels). The distribution profile of the liquid flow among the branched channels in each configuration tested is dependent on the joint action of the patterns of the phase distribution inside the header and the flow inside the <b>feeder</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|E

Flow models representative of leading edge impingement, impingement with crossflow (midchord cooling), pin fins, feeder supply tube, and a composite {{model of a}} complete airfoil flow system were tested. Test conditions were set by varying pressure level to cover the Mach number and Reynolds number range of interest in advanced turbine applications.

The 3 D facies architecture and internal heterogeneity of the Skye Lava Field, for example, provides important insights into the evolution of the British Tertiary Igneous Province, and valuable information to aid in the exploration of potential offshore reservoirs underlying significant flood lavas along the North Atlantic margin. The volcanic stratigraphy of the Talisker Bay area of Skye comprises: (1) lower compound-braided lavas (flow lobes, 3 m thick); (2) transitional lavas (flows, 8 m thick); (3) upper tabular-type lavas (flows, 20 m thick), representing a relative increase in eruptive volume. A 3 D model of the lava sequence was reconstructed using detailed digital geological mapping, revealing estimated volumes of: the lower sequence (12. 7 km 3), the transitional sequence (7. 4 km 3) and the upper sequence (17. 0 km 3). The lower sequence lavas formed on the flanks of a shield volcano and were sourced from the NE. Volcanological features such as lava <b>feeder</b> <b>tubes,</b> pahoehoe textures and lobes indicate a scale of volcanism similar to that of present-day Hawaii.

Several conditions at the distributor inlet are varied including quality, mass flux, and orientation in gravity and the resulting superheat profiles of the evaporator circuit outlets are recorded. To examine possible effect of cone misalignment <b>feeder</b> <b>tubes</b> are switched in several steps and the data shows that there is imbalance in both the evaporator and distributor. It is observed that the imbalanced refrigerant distribution does not change over various operating conditions and is the result of complex interactions between the distributor and the evaporator. Valves are installed on the feeder lines to create an ideal refrigerant distribution, indicated by uniform superheats at the outlets of the evaporator circuits, by adding a pressure drop in order to quantify the reduction in COP and capacity due to imperfect distribution. Using the valves to make the outlet superheat profile uniform improves the system and recovers most of the lost performance. Additionally, the air distribution is made poor by blocking parts of the evaporator face. The impact of air imbalances on system performance is smaller than those of refrigerant. COP declines faster than capacity. Blocking entire refrigerant circuits rapidly deteriorates performance, compared to the same blockage area spread over all circuits. Moreover, the performance of the evaporator in terms of UA, LMTD, epsilon, and NTU, declines faster than overall system performance in terms of COP and capacity...|$|R

A <b>tube</b> <b>feeder</b> was used for all groups, delivering either pellets or meal (trough length 64 cm; two integrated drinkers). Results: Mean ADG was 5 % higher when pigs were fed pellets rather than meal (P =. 06). Whatever the diet, ADG was lower in G 50 than in G 40 (P <. 05). In groups fed meal, ADG was lower in G 40 than in G 30 (P <. 001). Average time using the feeder was 4. 7 minutes per hour for pigs fed pellets, and 7. 3 minutes per hour for pigs fed meal (P =. 003).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis research is to apply state-of-the-art experimental and data analysis techniques {{to the study of}} gas-liquid pipe flows, with a focus on conditions occurring in header-feeder systems of nuclear reactors under different accident scenarios. Novel experimental techniques have been proposed for the identification of the flow regime and measurement of the flow rates of both phases in gas-liquid flows. These techniques were automated, non-intrusive and economical, which ensured that their use would be feasible in industrial as well as laboratory settings. Measurements of differential pressure and the gas and liquid flow rates were collected in vertical upwards air-water flow at near-atmospheric pressure. It was demonstrated that the probability density function of the normalized differential pressure was indicative of the flow regime and using non-linear dimensionality reduction (the Elastic Maps Algorithm), it was possible to automate the process of identifying the flow regime from the differential pressure signal. The relationship between the probability density function and the power spectral density of normalized differential pressure with the gas and liquid flow rates in air-water pipe flow was also established and a machine learning algorithm (using Independent Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks) was proposed for the estimation of the phase flow rates from these properties. The proposed methods were adapted for use with single and dual conductivity wire-mesh sensors in vertical upwards and downwards air [...] water flows. A thorough evaluation of the performance and measurement uncertainty of wire-mesh sensors in gas-liquid flows was also performed.

40|$|The twin summits of Preshal More and Preshal Beg, near Talisker, Isle of Skye, {{comprise}} the erosional {{remnants of a}} thick (at least 120 m) compound olivine tholeiite lava, or flow field, that ponded in palaeo-valleys within the Palaeocene lava field of west-central Skye. This unique flow field constitutes the Talisker Formation and is the youngest preserved extrusive unit of the Skye Lava Field. The lava inundated a complex of palaeo-valleys incised into the higher stratigraphical levels of the existing lava field, and remnants of the original sedimentary fill of these valleys still exist, the Preshal Beg Conglomerate Formation. The lava displays spectacularly well-developed two-tier (colonnade-entablature) columnar joint sets that formed {{as a consequence of}} slow, uninterrupted cooling through its base and sidewalls, aided by groundwater circulation and water ingress (from displaced drainage) directed into the lava's interior by master-joint systems.

Lava surface units have been examined in the field and with visible-, thermal-, and radar-wavelength remote sensing datasets for Mauna Ulu, and with radar data for the Venusian study areas. For the Mauna Ulu flow field, visible characteristics are related to color, glass abundance, and dm- to m-scale surface irregularities, which reflect the lava flow regime, cooling, and modification due to processes such as coalescence and inflation. Thermal characteristics are primarily affected by the abundance of glass and small-scale roughness elements (such as vesicles), and reflect the history of cooling, vesiculation and degassing, and crystallization of the lava. Radar characteristics are primarily affected by unit topography and fracturing, which are related to flow inflation, remobilization, and collapse, and reflect the local supply of lava during and after unit emplacement. Mauna Ulu surface units are correlated with pre-eruption topography, lack a simple relationship to the main <b>feeder</b> lava <b>tubes,</b> and are distributed with respect to their position within compound flow lobes and with distance from the vent. The Venusian lava flow fields appear to have developed through emplacement of numerous, thin, simple and compound flows, presumably over extended periods of time, and show a wider range of radar roughness than is observed at Mauna Ulu. A potential correlation is suggested between flow rheology and surface roughness. Distributary flow morphologies may result from tube-fed flows, and flow inflation is consistent with observed surface characteristics. Furthermore, the significance of inflation at Mauna Ulu and comparison of radar characteristics indicates that inflation may, in fact, be more prevalent on Venus than at Mauna Ulu. Although the Venusian flow fields display morphologies similar to those observed within terrestrial flow fields, the Venusian flow units are significantly larger...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{are confronted}} with {{potential}} stressors at zoos compared to in the wild, such as visitors and lack of environmental stimulation. This study included two projects conducted on the drills at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna where I investigated: 1) the effect of visual barriers on the behaviour of the drills and if the visual barriers can moderate the visitor effect on the drills and 2) how outdoor-only access together with feeding enrichment (frozen fruit and <b>tube</b> <b>feeders)</b> affects the behaviour of the drills. 1 / 0 - sampling method was used when observing the behaviours of the drills with 1 minute-intervals. Resting/Sleeping increased, while social agonistic behaviour and stereotypies decreased with visual barriers. A moderated visitor effect was shown in resting/sleeping and social affiliative behaviour in the drills with visual barriers. However, social agonistic behaviour and visitor interaction were still affected by visitors after {{the installation of the}} visual barriers, implying that the drills still find visitors stressful to some extent and that further alterations on the observation area viewing the indoor enclosure is recommended for the welfare of the drills. With outdoor-only access together with feeding enrichment, locomotion, foraging/eating and body-shaking increased, while resting/sleeping, social affiliative and agonistic behaviour, stereotypies, visitor interaction, scratching and self-grooming decreased. This suggests that outdoor-only access and feeding enrichment improve the behaviour of the drills and would be a valid option during summer season for the drills at Parken Zoo. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of two cleaning and disinfection programs on broiler performance and on the microbiological status of the facilities. This trial was an observational study of comparative character. Two experiments were conducted, with 960 birds each. Both experiments were carried out in a positive-pressure broiler house. Broilers were distributed in pens equipped with a bell drinker and a <b>tube</b> <b>feeder</b> each. In the first experiment, new wood shavings were used as litter material, and in the second, reused wood shavings were used. Two treatments with 16 replicates of 30 birds each were evaluated. The regular treatment consisted of dry and wet organic matter removal, followed by washing. The European treatment consisted of dry organic matter removal, humidification, washing with water under high pressure, detergent application, rinsing, and application of two combined disinfectants: glutaraldehyde 250 g/L + formaldehyde 185 g/L; p-chlor-m-cresol 210 g/L. Biosecurity measures were adopted during daily management tasks to prevent cross contamination between treatments. The effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated by microbiological analysis performed before and after treatment applications, as well as by broiler performance results. Live performance results were similar between both treatments when broilers were reared on new litter. When reused word-shavings were used as litter material, the European treatment promoted better broiler performance. The European treatment was more effective than the regular treatment in reducing total microbial counts in the facilities when reused wood shavings were used as litter material, and positively influenced broiler performance...|$|R
