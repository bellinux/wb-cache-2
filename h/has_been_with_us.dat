25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.|$|E

"One" [...] was {{released}} as the album's third single in February 1992 as a benefit single, {{with all of}} the band's royalties being donated to different AIDS research organisations for each country in which the single {{was released}}. The group's manager Paul McGuinness commented on their decision: [...] "The band feels that [...] is the most pressing issue of the day, and we really have to focus people's attention to the AIDS plague that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> for 10 years." [...] To promote safe sex, U2 sold condoms bearing the album title Achtung Baby at their Zoo TV Tour concerts. The cover of the single release is a photograph by David Wojnarowicz. The photograph depicts buffaloes falling off a cliff after being chased by Native American hunters. The single's liner notes explain that Wojnarowicz [...] "identifies himself and ourselves with the buffalo, pushed into the unknown by forces we cannot control or even understand".|$|E
