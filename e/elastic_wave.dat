50|$|Machine tool {{monitoring}} {{is explained}} with Acoustic Emission (AE) Sensors. AE Sensor is commonly {{defined as the}} sound emitted as an <b>elastic</b> <b>wave</b> by a solid when it is deformed or struck, caused by the rapid release of localized stress energy. Therefore, it is an occurrence phenomenon which releases elastic energy into the material, which then propagates as an <b>elastic</b> <b>wave.</b> The detection frequency range of acoustic emission is from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz and typically falling off at several MHz. AE {{can be related to}} an irreversible release of energy. It can also be generated from sources not involving material failure including friction, cavitation and impact. The three major applications of AE sensors phenomena are: a) Source location - determine the locations of occurrence of an event b) Material mechanical performance - evaluate and characterize materials/structures; and c Health monitoring - monitors the safety operation.|$|E
50|$|Elastodynamics is {{the study}} of elastic waves and {{involves}} linear elasticity with variation in time. An <b>elastic</b> <b>wave</b> is a type of mechanical wave that propagates in elastic or viscoelastic materials. The elasticity of the material provides the restoring force of the wave. When they occur in the Earth as the result of an earthquake or other disturbance, elastic waves are usually called seismic waves.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Wedge <b>elastic</b> <b>waves</b> are {{localised}} vibration modes, both symmetric and anti-symmetric, propagating along tips of elastic wedges. Their existence has been first predicted numerically in 1972 by Lagasse, {{and then they}} have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in a large number of works. The essentially one-dimensional nature of these waves makes them ideally suitable for ultrasonic non-destructive inspection of edges in wedge-like and plate-like structures of different forms and shapes, such as turbine blades, cutting tools, etc. In the present paper, propagation of wedge <b>elastic</b> <b>waves</b> in wedges of different types is discussed, with the emphasis on the theory of antisymmetric mode propagation in slender wedges developed by the present author using the geometrical acoustics approach. This theory is powerful enough to be applicable to wedges of arbitrary shapes, curved wedges and truncated wedges. In all these cases, with the exception of ideal linear elastic wedges, wedge <b>elastic</b> <b>waves</b> are dispersive. Theory of scattering of wedge <b>elastic</b> <b>waves</b> on small defects located on sharp wedge edges is considered as well using perturbation theory approach.
