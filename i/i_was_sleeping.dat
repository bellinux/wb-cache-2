While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping,</b> no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, but I think you need another mattress. I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E
2500|$|Trump recalls {{some of his}} romantic exploits, [...] "Beautiful, famous, successful, married — I’ve {{had them}} all, secretly, the world’s biggest names." [...] Trump {{reflects}} on how such exploits made him feel at the time, [...] "Oftentimes when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> {{with one of the}} top women in the world I would say to myself, thinking about me as a boy from Queens, 'Can you believe what I am getting?'" [...] He explained that he was successful in his endeavors with women due to some unknown quality he possessed, [...] "The women I have dated over the years could have any man they want; they are the top models and most beautiful women in the world. I have been able to date (screw) them all because I have something that many men do not have. I don’t know what it is but women have always liked it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Great Heavens!' he said: 'here have <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> {{away while}} Nyleptha was nearly murdered -- and all through me, too. What a fiend that Sorais must be! It would have served her well if Umslopogaas had cut her {{down in the}} act.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah--I see! Well, my time <b>is</b> up. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{staying here}} to-night, and thought I {{could do no}} less than call, after our mutual affliction. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sleeping</b> {{at the place where}} <b>I</b> used to <b>be</b> barmaid, and to-morrow I go back to Alfredston. Father is come home again, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> living with him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes! and I dreamt it last night, too,' {{continued}} Cadurcis. 'I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> in the uninhabited rooms here, and {{the door}} opened, and you walked in with a light.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there no}} one nearer than that?" [...] Reuben asked. [...] "Why, he lives about halfway between where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> last night, {{and my own}} place. It must be seventy miles away." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I cannot {{leave this}} {{viridian}} room. The door is locked and barricaded from the outside. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sleeping</b> behind the camera, and yes- I've got a shower.

6000|$|... "She {{is living}} {{up at the}} garage, sir," [...] Robert answered. [...] "Besides, she is deaf. I'll tell her that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sleeping</b> in the house to-night as you are not very well. And forgive me, sir--her ladyship left a message. She hoped you would lunch with her to-morrow." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ah, sir,' replied Hans calmly, 'in {{order to}} have gained so much money you must have lain awake all night, but I have earned a hundred times that amount while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> soundly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{disturbed}} nobody, Nelly,' he replied; 'and I {{gave some}} ease to myself. I shall {{be a great}} deal more comfortable now; and you'll {{have a better chance of}} keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed her? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen years--incessantly--remorselessly--till yesternight; and yesternight I was tranquil. I dreamt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about boots Mahatma, except that they are hard things with iron on them which kick one out of one's form if one sits too close. Once that happened to me. Well, my form was under a particularly fine turnip that had some dead leaves beneath the green ones. I chose it because, like the brown earth, they just matched the colour of my back. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> there quite soundly when my sister came and woke me.|$|E
6000|$|Between {{three and}} four we were all awakened by a loud {{knocking}} at the door, and Mademoiselle's shrill voice calling out to her maids to open it. Through the anteroom, where the Comtess de Fiesque and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sleeping,</b> there came M. de Comminges. Mademoiselle, in her laced night-cap, rose on her pillows and asked-- ...|$|R

6000|$|After I {{had been}} there a week I began to grow alarmed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> and eating well and {{actually}} beginning to enjoy life. For a man in my desperate condition that would never do. So I sneaked down to the trolley-car station, took the car for Pineville, and went {{to see one of}} the best physicians in town. By this time I knew exactly what to do when I needed medical treatment. I hung my hat {{on the back of a}} chair, and said rapidly: ...|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning at}} dawn we started, with some difficulty. To begin with, {{in the middle}} of the night old Babemba came to the canvas shelter under which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping,</b> woke me up and in a long speech implored me not to go. He said he was {{convinced}} that the Pongo intended foul play of some sort and that all this talk of peace was a mere trick to entrap us white men into the country, probably in order to sacrifice us to its gods for a religious reason.|$|E
60|$|Once more I woke, troubled because I {{could sleep}} no better. I struck a match {{and looked at}} my watch. It marked midnight. And I had not left the deck until three! I should have been puzzled had I not guessed the solution. No wonder <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> brokenly. I had slept twenty-one hours. I listened {{for a while to}} the {{behaviour}} of the Ghost, to the pounding of the seas and the muffled roar of the wind on deck, and then turned over on my ride and slept peacefully until morning.|$|E
60|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the <b>sleeping</b> volcano, and one morning, monsieur, I have {{suffered}} the eruption. It <b>is</b> like this. <b>I</b> shall tell you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{your honor}} {{does not mean}} to say," [...] Denis said in great astonishment, [...] "that <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> for five hours? The watch must have gone wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am reading some Hebrew {{nearly every}} day, and Lightfoot on the Galatians, Tyler's [...] "Researches into the Early History of Mankind," [...] Dollinger's [...] "First Ages of the Church," [...] and [...] "Ecce Homo." [...] I tried Maine's [...] "Ancient Law," [...] {{but it is}} too tough for the tropics, unless I chance to feel very fresh. I {{generally}} get an hour in the evening, if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sleeping</b> at home.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} I was {{thoroughly}} awake and had arisen from my blankets. Throwing a kaross over my shoulders, I left the hut, made of boughs, in which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> and walked {{a few paces}} to {{the crest of a}} rocky ridge, whence I could see the dry vlei below. Here the mists of dawn still clung, but from it rose sounds of grunts, bellows and tramplings which I, an old hunter, could not mistake. Evidently a herd of buffalo, one or two hundred of them, had established themselves in those reeds.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{bungalow}} is {{very bad}} and low-caste! No wonder the Presence was disturbed and is speckled. Three sets of doolie-bearers came to the bungalow late last night when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> outside, and {{said that it was}} their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the English people! What honor has the khansamah? They tried to enter, but I told them to go. No wonder, if these Oorias have been here, that the Presence is sorely spotted. It is shame, and the work of a dirty man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was talking}} to Billy only yesterday," [...] added Bunfit. [...] "I've got it on my mind that they didn't treat Billy quite on the square. He didn't let on {{anything}} about Benjamin; but he told me out plain, as how {{he was very much}} disgusted. 'Mr. Bunfit,' said he, 'there's that roguery about, that a plain man like me can't touch it. There's them as'd pick my eyes out while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping,</b> and then swear it against my very self.' Them were his words, and I knew as how Benjamin hadn't been on the square with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Baas, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sleeping.</b> Kill {{me if you}} wish, for I deserve it. And yet, Baas, never <b>was</b> <b>I</b> more wide-awake in my {{life until}} I drank that water. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not wont to sleep on guard, Baas." ...|$|R
60|$|On this {{particular}} evening, {{for the first}} time since the beginning of the term, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seized with a prejudice against coffee. <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> badly for several nights, and I decided that abstention from coffee might remedy this.|$|R
60|$|This {{decision}} {{on the part of}} those stupid Zulus put us in an awkward fix, since it was impossible for us to carry over all our baggage and ammunition without help. Therefore glad <b>was</b> <b>I</b> when before dawn on the fifth morning the nocturnal Hans crept into the wagon, in the after part of which Ragnall and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sleeping,</b> and informed us that he heard men's voices on the farther side of the river, though how he could hear anything above that roar of water passed my comprehension.|$|R
60|$|The Shy Man {{came into}} our yard one {{afternoon}} in April, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> with mother in the sun on an old sweater which we had borrowed from Fred, one of the barmen. I heard mother growl, but I didn't take any notice. Mother {{is what they call}} a good watch-dog, and she growls at everybody except master. At first, when she used to do it, I would get up and bark my head off, but not now. Life's too short to bark at everybody who comes into our yard. It is behind the public-house, and they keep empty bottles and things there, so people are always coming and going.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was twenty}} years ago. Saxtorph was his name. He was {{certainly}} the most stupid man I ever saw, but he was as inevitable as death. There was only one thing that chap could do, and that was shoot. I {{remember the first time}} I ran into him--right here in Apia, twenty years ago. That was before your time, Roberts. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> at Dutch Henry's hotel, down where the market is now. Ever heard of him? He made a tidy stake smuggling arms in to the rebels, sold out his hotel, and was killed in Sydney just six weeks afterward in a saloon row.|$|E
60|$|The {{last time}} that I saw him before leaving for America--it was a sad blow to both of us. When he heard I was leaving, and {{that might be the}} last time we might meet--it almost was so--he was terribly upset, and came round at once. We sat late, in Baxter's empty house, where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping.</b> My dear friend Walter Ferrier: O if I had only written to him more! if only one of us in these last days had been well! But I ever {{cherished}} the honour of his friendship, and now when he is gone, I know what I have lost still better. We live on, meaning to meet; but when the hope is gone, the pang comes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Compliments again, Mr. Heigham. Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the <b>sleeping</b> beauty last time, so one {{may as well}} be a queen for a change. I {{wonder what}} you will call me next?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; you, my good friend! you. I should {{consider}} myself as safe if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sleeping</b> in a burning house as <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>were</b> <b>I</b> with Beckendorff alone. Although {{this is not}} the first time that we have communicated, I have never yet seen him; and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> fully aware that, if the approaching interview were known to my friends, they would consider it high time that my son reigned in my stead. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> resolved to be firm, to be inflexible. My course <b>is</b> plain. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not to be again duped by him, which," [...] continued the Prince, much confused, [...] "I will not conceal that <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> once." ...|$|R
