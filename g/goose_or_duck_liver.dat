Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the Bay of Biscay, trapping in the Garonne and stream fishing in the Pyrenees. The Pyrenees also support top quality lamb, such as the [...] "Agneau de Pauillac", as well as high quality sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the Blonde d'Aquitaine, Boeuf de Chalosse, Boeuf Gras de Bazas, and Garonnaise. High quality free-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, capon, goose and duck prevail in the region as well. [...] Gascony and Périgord cuisines includes high quality patés, terrines, confits and magrets. This is one of the regions notable for its production of foie gras or fattened <b>goose</b> <b>or</b> <b>duck</b> <b>liver.</b> The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based. [...] Armagnac is also from this region, as are high quality prunes from Agen.|$|E

Various polls repeatedly declare potato salad and Frankfurters/Wieners as Germany's favourite meal on Heiligabend. Further typical meals may include fish, fondue or raclette. On Christmas Day, the most common dishes are roast <b>goose</b> <b>or</b> <b>duck.</b>|$|R
50|$|The theorized {{causes of}} angel wing are genetics, the {{excessive}} intake of carbohydrates and proteins, together with insufficient intake of vitamin E, low dietary calcium and manganese deficiency. Angel wing is occasionally observed in waterfowl residing near humans, (including domestic fowl), and the disease {{can sometimes be}} observed in areas where <b>geese</b> <b>or</b> <b>ducks</b> are excessively fed bread. Other examples are not fed bread at all. Duck seed is an alternative for duck feeders.|$|R

Pieces of fat meat (mutton, beef, <b>goose,</b> <b>or</b> <b>goose</b> and <b>duck</b> innards) are combined with grains (millet, spelt, rice) and baked in a crock. Tutırma, an intestine filled with finely cut or chopped liver and millet or rice, is another combination of meat and grains.|$|R
50|$|Feathers for a featherbed {{could be}} saved from <b>geese</b> <b>or</b> <b>ducks</b> being {{prepared}} for cooking. In England servant-girls were often allowed to keep feathers from poultry they'd plucked, and could save {{them to make a}} featherbed or pillows for their future married life. Live birds might have their soft downy breast feathers harvested {{three or four times a}} year, as described in an account from 20th century Missouri. Some poultry feathers were undesirable for mattress-making, especially chicken feathers. The best featherbeds were filled with a high proportion of down; larger feathers needed to have their quills clipped.|$|R

He liked to pick out his birds and not throw a pound of shot into a flock. In the meantime, he pushed on the draining of the marsh, and although he spent anxious hours counting the cost, resolved to hold out until the job was done. As a rule, he was preoccupied and quiet, and Evelyn often found him dull. His talk about dykes and sluices did not amuse her.|$|R

Eggs from wild birds, such as <b>geese</b> <b>or</b> <b>ducks</b> were {{available}} in ancient Egypt, while domestic chickens were not common until the Classical period [17]. Yet so far there has been no certain identification of the use of egg as a binder for ancient Egyptian artefacts. The use of egg as a binder is tentatively reported in a study of a mummy portrait dated to the 4 th century CE [18]. However, as this investigation does not provide a sufficiently stable context for the sampling, we cannot exclude the presence of egg here being related to a restoration material. The use of egg white is also reported in an Egyptian cartonnage from the 1 st century CE that was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employing polyclonal antibodies against ovalbumin [19].|$|R
50|$|Lightweight white, solid-color or printed plain weave, satin weave, or flannel cotton or cotton/polyester blends are {{the most}} common types of sheeting, {{although}} linen and silk may also be used, including in combination. <b>Goose</b> <b>or</b> <b>duck</b> down and other feathers are frequently used as a warm and lightweight filling in duvets, comforters and quilts. But such fill can protrude in part even from tightly-woven fabric, and be an irritant for many people, particularly those with allergies. Natural and synthetic down alternatives are marketed. Cotton, wool or polyester batting is commonly used as fill in quilts and down alternative comforters. These are less expensive and more easily laundered than natural down or feathers. Synthetic fibers are best in the form of thermofused (where fibers cross) batting. Thick-woven or knitted wool, cotton, acrylic or other microfiber synthetics, or blends of these, are typically used for blankets.|$|R
5000|$|Recently, decoys {{have been}} {{introduced}} that provide lifelike movement that adds to the attraction for waterfowl. Shakers are decoys with a small electric motor and an offset weighted wheel. As the wheel turns it causes the decoy to [...] "shake" [...] {{in the water and}} create realistic wave rings throughout the decoy spread. Spinning wing decoys are also fitted with an electric motor and have wings made of various materials. As the wings spin an optical illusion is created simulating the wing beats for landing birds. These decoys can be quite effective when hunting waterfowl and have been banned in some states. Other types of movement decoys include swimming decoys and even kites formed like <b>geese</b> <b>or</b> <b>ducks.</b> The use of UV paint has also been suggested for decoys. Unlike humans, it is possible for wildlife to see UV colors and decoys so patterned may appear more authentic.|$|R

50|$|Different {{types of}} attire {{are needed for}} extreme weather {{conditions}} like snow. Thicker coats or jackets, gloves and boots are necessities in the cold. Winter sports such as snowboarding and skiing require the riders and skiers to be properly geared in the snow. Snow jackets differ from casual coats such {{that they may be}} packed with extra insulation and thicker coating materials. The insulation is usually made with down, which is the layer of fine feathers from <b>geese</b> <b>or</b> <b>ducks.</b> These feathers are naturally insulated to keep the birds warm in the harsh winter weathers. The feathers trap air inside and keep the body heat from flowing out. Down is also considered to be the highest quality of insulation for jackets. It is light and compressible. Alternative types of insulation are being invented including: synthetic microfibers and polyester-based insulation. These materials perform as well as down if not better and are becoming popular in the markets with the help of major brands using such materials for their equipment.|$|R

They {{were not allowed to}} marry non-Cagots, enter taverns, hold cabarets, use public fountains, sell food or wine, touch food in the market, work with livestock, or enter the mill. [...] They were allowed to enter a church only by a special door, and during the service, a rail separated them from the other worshippers. [...] Either they were altogether forbidden to partake of the sacrament, or the Eucharist was given to them {{on the end of a}} wooden spoon, while a holy water stoup was reserved for their exclusive use. [...] They were compelled to wear a distinctive dress, to which, in some places, was attached the foot of a <b>goose</b> <b>or</b> <b>duck</b> (whence they were sometimes called [...] "Canards").

50|$|Non-traditional foods {{other than}} turkey are {{sometimes}} {{served as the}} main dish for a Thanksgiving dinner. Ham is often served alongside turkey in many non-traditional households. Goose and duck, foods which were traditional European centerpieces of Christmas dinners before being displaced, are now sometimes served {{in place of the}} Thanksgiving turkey. Sometimes, fowl native to the region where the meal is taking place is used; for example, an article in Texas Monthly magazine suggested quail as the main dish for a Texan Thanksgiving feast. John Madden, who appeared on television for the NFL Thanksgiving Day game from 1981 to 2001, frequently advocated his fondness for the turducken, deboned turkey, duck and chicken nested inside each other then cooked. In a few areas of the West Coast of the United States, Dungeness crab is common as an alternate main dish, as crab season starts in early November. Similarly, Thanksgiving falls within deer hunting season in the Northeastern United States, which encourages the use of venison as a centerpiece. Sometimes a fowl alternative to turkey is used; for example, <b>goose</b> <b>or</b> <b>duck.</b> Vegetarians <b>or</b> vegans may have a tofu, wheat gluten or lentil-based substitute; or stuffed squash.

50|$|Force-feeding {{of birds}} is practiced mostly on <b>geese</b> <b>or</b> male Moulard <b>ducks,</b> a Muscovy/Pekin hybrid. Preparation for gavage usually begins 4-5 months before slaughter. For geese, {{after an initial}} free-range period and {{treatment}} to assist in esophagus dilation (eating grass, for example), the force-feeding commences. Gavage is performed 2-4 times a day for 2-5 weeks, {{depending on the size}} of the fowl, using a funnel attached to a slim metal or plastic feeding tube inserted into the bird's throat to deposit the food into the bird's crop (the storage area in the esophagus). A grain mash, usually maize mixed with fats and vitamin supplements, is the feed of choice. Waterfowl are suited to the tube method due to a non-existent gag reflex and an extremely flexible esophagus, unlike other fowl such as chickens. These migratory waterfowl are also said to be ideal for gavage because of their natural ability to gain large amounts of weight in short periods of time before cold seasons.|$|R

40|$|Down {{feathers}} are remarkable {{insulating materials}} that reputedly {{have the greatest}} warmth-to-weight ratio of all natural fibres, and they possess excellent compressibility and compression recovery. Despite their outstanding performance as thermal insulators, down feathers have been relatively overlooked by the academic community and their structure and properties remain quite poorly understood. To {{provide insight into the}} fundamental properties of these feathers and to inspire the design and development of future synthetic insulation materials, a study into the structural, mechanical, and thermal properties of down feathers and their assemblies has been conducted. The appearance, mass, size, and geometric shape of goose, duck, and eider down plumes and their barbs were assessed. While goose and duck down plumes were very similar in both appearance and size, the eider down feathers were found to be larger and their barbules had a greater number of prongs and nodes. In each type of down, barbules were adapted to occupy maximum space and utilised a planar cross-section as they divided from the barb to optimise compression recovery. The microstructure and morphology of goose and duck down barbs and barbules were analysed using SEM, TEM, and AFM and were found to be analogous to wool fibres. Melanin granules were found in goose down but not in duck down, and the examined goose down barbs had irregular, hollow cross sections, whereas duck down’s were solid and more elliptical. With the help of novel down-based nonwovens developed to capture X-ray diffraction data from goose and duck down with excellent clarity, goose and duck down were found to share great similarities in their crystal structures. The mechanical properties of goose, duck, and eider down feathers were studied, including a comparison of their barbs’ tensile properties and the compression resistance and recovery of individual down plumes. Eider down barbs were found to have greater Young’s moduli, ultimate strength, and strain at break than <b>goose</b> <b>or</b> <b>duck</b> down barbs, and individual eider down plumes were also more compression resistant than those from geese and ducks. The compression resistance and recovery of goose and duck down assemblies were studied using a novel apparatus. Goose down proved to be more compression resistant than duck down, attributed to its cross sectional shape and hollow geometry. The thermal resistances of goose and duck down-filled test squares were extremely similar, but the densities of the down inside the face fabrics strongly influenced their thermal resistances. Air-laid and thermal-bonded down-feather-based nonwovens were developed to alleviate the problem of constraining individual down feathers in insulated products. Their structural and thermal properties were evaluated and they possessed industry-leading warmth-to-weight ratios, which could be further improved by better engineering of these composite materials. Great efforts have been made to provide a comprehensive investigation into the structure and properties of both individual and bulk down feathers in relation to their thermal insulation properties. It is hoped that this research will prove useful to the development of superior biomimetic synthetic insulations as well as the high performance products made from down, a world-leading natural material. ...|$|R
