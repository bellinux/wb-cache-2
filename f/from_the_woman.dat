5|$|Several sources {{describe}} an incident which purportedly had {{an influence on}} Cadron-Jetté's future career. Between 1830 and 1832, while living in Montreal, Cadron-Jetté was visited at her house {{in the middle of}} the night by a prostitute who was seeking asylum from two sailors with intentions of violence. Cadron-Jetté hid the woman for the night in her cellar, fed her, and counselled her to change her way of life. Subsequently Cadron-Jetté received a letter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> informing her the woman had emigrated to the United States and made positive changes to her life, including marriage.|$|E
5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man looking away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{once again}} {{attempts}} to administer a potential cure to the infected {{woman in his}} laboratory, but the next night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute {{in the back of}} the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont. They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E

5|$|Three {{music videos}} were shot for the single; one by Yusuke Azumaya, the second being a lyric video, {{and the third}} {{directed}} and animated by Riff Studios. Azumaya's version opens with a large-figured woman cutting images of herself and sticking them on portraits of a blonde male. As she sticks it on her wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for {{the man in the}} photo, and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near the end of the video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A man holding a balloon bumps into the woman, and as the camera pans away to the balloons floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki. The man who walked away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> then see's Hamasaki, walks to her, and both hug each other.|$|E

25|$|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis: Genetic testing {{procedures}} that are performed on human embryos {{prior to the}} implantation {{as part of an}} in vitro fertilization procedure. Pre-implantation testing is used when individuals try to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. Eggs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> and sperm from the man are removed and fertilized outside the body to create multiple embryos. The embryos are individually screened for abnormalities, and the ones without abnormalities are implanted in the uterus.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallels}} between the stories of Enkidu/Shamhat and Adam/Eve have been long recognized by scholars.

In both stories the man accepts food <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> covers his nakedness, and must leave his former realm, unable to return. The presence of a snake that steals a plant of immortality from the hero later in the epic is another point of similarity.|$|E

25|$|The Viennese oyster {{position}} requires great flexibility <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> to perform. The female lies on {{her back}} and moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of their marriage, Marie and Parker worked {{together}} in the carnivals. As Parker's management career began to take off, Marie became more of a housewife and mother, although she would occasionally travel with him to various parts of the country. During the 1960s, after many years of ill health, Marie began to display signs of dementia. Parker began to distance himself from her, heartbroken by her rapid deterioration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> he once knew. Marie died in November 1986 of chronic brain syndrome. In October 1990, Parker married Loanne Miller, his secretary since 1972. From then on, he continued living in Las Vegas, mostly avoiding contact with the press.|$|E

500|$|The opening track, [...] "Sure Hope You Mean It", {{features}} slightly off-beat percussion, tambourine shakes, {{and lyrics}} {{about a man}} who awaits a sign of approval <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> he admires. [...] "Keep Marchin", which evoked socially conscious and positive sentiments, was composed in the vein of the Civil Rights Movement era soul music by artists such as Sam Cooke and the Staple Singers. Gail Mitchell from Billboard compared the song to Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions' 1968 song [...] "We're a Winner". Saadiq said [...] "Keep Marchin" [...] was also inspired by his journey in the music industry. [...] "Big Easy", featuring New Orleans-style brass playing, was sung {{from the point of view}} of a man in New Orleans who reacts to Hurricane Katrina and looks for his lost lover. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer remarked that the song [...] "manages to cast Hurricane Katrina as the villain in a romance, tearing lovers apart." [...] Its composition—mixing a blissful sound with disheartening lyrics—is similar to the songwriting technique used by Holland–Dozier–Holland. Saadiq was inspired to write [...] "Big Easy" [...] after watching the 2006 documentary film When the Levees Broke.

500|$|Ninja Gaiden {{features}} a ninja named Ryu Hayabusa who seeks revenge {{for the death}} of his father and gradually finds himself involved in a sinister plot that threatens the entire world. The story opens with Ryu's father Ken being killed in a duel by an unknown assailant. After the duel, Ryu finds a letter written by Ken which tells Ryu to find an archeologist named Walter Smith in America. Before Ryu can find Walter, Ryu is shot and kidnapped by a mysterious young woman; she hands him a demonic-looking statue before releasing him. Ryu then finds Walter, and Walter tells him of the demon statues he and Ken had found in the Amazon ruins. Walter tells Ryu of an evil demon named Jashin, that [...] "SHINOBI" [...] defeated and whose power was confined into two [...] "Light" [...] and [...] "Shadow" [...] demon statues. Ryu shows Walter the [...] "Shadow" [...] demon statue given to him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> but during their conversation, a masked figure, named Basaquer, suddenly breaks into the cabin and steals the Shadow statue. Ryu gives chase, defeats the masked figure, and retrieves the statue; but when he returns he finds that Walter is dying and the Light statue is missing. Right after Walter dies, three armed men confront Ryu and tell him to come with them.|$|E

Mulkern felt that Wilton was [...] "a major saving grace" [...] in the [...] "disappointing" [...] "Aliens of London" [...] / [...] "World War Three". The Daily Telegraphs Hugh Davies commented {{on a number of}} political allusions made through Jones's characterisation as Prime Minister in [...] "The Christmas Invasion". He felt that her rebuttal of aid from the US president after aliens invade is a [...] "swipe at Blair and Bush over the invasion of Iraq". He also compared Jones's destruction of the fleeing Sycorax—a decision heavily criticised by the Doctor—to Margaret Thatcher's decision to sink the Argentine warship General Belgrano during the Falklands War. Russell T Davies responded to observations of political commentary by stating that there is [...] "absolutely an anti-war message" [...] present in the episode due to Christmas being [...] "a day of peace". In their unauthorised guide to Doctor Who, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith felt that Wilton delivered the [...] "standout performance" [...] of the Christmas special" [...] stating that, whilst the character remained recognisable, it was [...] "fascinating watching her harder edge emerge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> we know and love". Of Harriet Jones's development, Stuart Galbrainth of DVD Talk felt that she begins as a [...] "charming neophyte minister" [...] but becomes [...] "suddenly much less charming at the end of [...] "Christmas Invasion," [...] when she becomes just another politician". However, Cliff Chapman of Den of Geek felt that the episode's denouement was flawed by trying to [...] "make out that Harriet Jones is awful for doing something perfectly reasonable."

500|$|Tamil works {{transform}} the terrible Kapali form of Shiva {{to a more}} lovable form. South Indian devotional literature portrays Bhikshatana in the Deodar Forest of the sages, but the Tevaram by the Nayanar poet-saints also describes rural women following him and calling out to him. Several poet-saints describe the sensuous nature of Bhikshatana and the love-sick emotions {{of the women who}} came to give him alms. However, the references to Shiva seeking alms had reduced to only three or four by the time of Manikkavacakar (9th century AD). The poems of Campantar, Appar, and Cuntarar focus on two forms of Shiva: Nataraja and Bhikshatana. The 7th-century Nayanar saint Campantar mentions that Bhikshatana wanders from door to door asking for alms with the beggar's call [...] "Ladies, give me alms" [...] and places his verses on the lips of women, who become enamoured of Bhikshatana. In a verse, Campantar rhetorically asks why the giver of all things and one who ends all troubles of devotees—Shiva—is wandering begging for food with a disgusting white skull. In another verse a woman comments on his strange appearance and describes how she is frightened by the serpent that wraps around his body when she approaches to give him alms. Another 7th-century Nayanar saint, Appar, talks about the handsome beggar Shiva, seducer of married women. He speaks of women allured by Bhikshatana's speech and his glance. The women tell that the handsome beggar wearing tiger-skin and smeared with ash had come riding a white bull and holding an axe, and used a skull as his begging bowl. Although he begged for alms, he would not accept any <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> deeming them [...] "petty". He did however warn the women of deceptions and cunning. Appar adds a strong erotic element in most of his verses, where the women directly desire physical contact with Bhikshatana. A woman in Appar's poetry sings: ...|$|E
500|$|The concert's setlist {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} songs from Up!, with several hits <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> in Me (1995) and Come on Over (1997). The songs from Up! were not {{performed in a}} specific format from the three studio versions of the album. Shania desired to approach the live productions as their [...] "own beast". The show commenced with Shania, who was costumed by a [...] "Body Glove" [...] top and black cargo pants, arriving {{from the back of}} the stage to perform [...] "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" [...] alongside her band. The singer then followed with [...] "Up!" [...] and after talking with the audience the singer says it has been 3 and 1/2 years being up on the concert stage and then performed Honey I'm Home. Shania continued to perform a total of ten songs during the segment. At one point, she invited an audience member onstage to propose to his girlfriend. She accepted and the two slow danced onstage as Shania sang [...] "When You Kiss Me", sitting on a stool placed towards the end of the runway. The segment ended with a performance of [...] "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!", where Shania invited Shyanne, Meanny and Ashley to join her onstage. In the succeeding segment, Shania donned a tan, multi-patterned halter top with the words [...] "True Love" [...] spelled on the front and black, sequined wide leg trousers. She began with [...] "From This Moment On". Then, she performed [...] "No One Needs to Know" [...] with an acoustic guitar and [...] "Thank You Baby!
