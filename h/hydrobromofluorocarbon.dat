2500|$|The {{accident}} {{occurred at}} 8:30 PM local time on 8 November 2008, during the submarine's first underwater test run. The submarine's {{fire extinguishing system}} was triggered, sealing two forward compartments and filling them with freon R-114B2 gas (Dibromotetrafluoroethane, known as khladon in Russian). The gas, a <b>hydrobromofluorocarbon</b> refrigerant, {{is used in the}} Russian Navy's LOKh (lodochnaya obyemnaya khimischeskaya â€“ [...] "submarine volumetric chemical") fire suppressant system. Each compartment of a Russian submarine contains a LOKh station from which freon can be delivered into that or adjacent compartments. Freon displaces oxygen, enabling it to extinguish fires rapidly in enclosed spaces. In high concentrations, it can cause , which progresses by stages into excitation, mental confusion, lethargy, and ultimately asphyxiation.|$|E

In {{the beginning}} HCFC {{was used as}} a substitute for some CFCs, but later was also substituted with other compounds such as hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) that have zero ozone depletion threat.|$|R
50|$|The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an {{international}} agreement that seeks to phase out chemicals that damage the ozone layer. The Montreal protocol was signed in 1987, went into practice in 1989, and was further amended in London in 1990 and in Copenhagen in 1992. The protocol set a quicker timetable for industrialized nations to phase out chemicals than it did for developing nations. For example, developed countries were to phase-out chlorofluorocarbons by 1995, but developing countries have until 2010 to phase out this chemical. Other chemicals that it wanted to phase out were halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, hydrochloroforlourocarbons, <b>hydrobromofluorocarbons,</b> and methyl bromide.|$|R
40|$|The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was a {{landmark}} in inter-national environmental regulation. This chapter describes {{the development of}} understanding of atmospheric science {{that led to the}} initial Protocol, agreed in 1987, and the subsequent developments that shaped its revisions. Eleven years later, both industrial statistics and, perhaps more significantly, atmospheric measurements clearly show compliance with the Protocol, and indicate that it is beginning to achieve its enviromental aim. The framework for regulations that now cover: chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform (1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane), methyl bromide, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and <b>hydrobromofluorocarbons</b> (HBFCs) is described. The regulations themselves, which treat developing and developed countries differently, are examined together with limits to the scope for further changes that may be required to mitigate future environmental impact. Finally, the differences between the Montreal Protocol and the recently developed Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gases are examined. The latter seeks to control emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Environmental regulations that are not specifically directed at halocarbons are not addres...|$|R
