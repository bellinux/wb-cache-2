25|$|In August 2016 the U.S. Navy {{announced}} that it is eliminating the NWU Type I {{in favor of the}} Type III which will completely replace it by 1 October 2019 for wear as the standard working uniform ashore for all Navy personnel. Type III will begin being issued to new navy recruits in October 2017. The Type II will remain restricted to wear by Naval Special Warfare sailors when in desert environments. The Navy's goal of developing a single working uniform for wear aboard ship and ashore and by all ranks and rates which the NWU Type I was supposed to fulfill was never realized by the Type I. Soon after its introduction it was found to be unsuitable for shipboard wear because of its lack of <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> and so was banned from wear aboard ship (except for when in port) thus making it essentially a uniform to be worn while ashore only. As a uniform for wear ashore only, a pattern designed to conceal stains aboard ships is not nearly as effective at concealment as a pattern designed to conceal people on land, thus the IIIs are used ashore. The Navy continues to work to develop a new shipboard working uniform.|$|E

50|$|For fire fighting, {{the design}} {{emphasis}} is on heat and <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> above cost. SCBA designed for fire fighting tend to be expensive because of the exotic materials used to provide the <b>flame</b> <b>resistance</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent, to reduce the weight penalty on the fire fighter. In addition, modern firefighting SCBAs incorporate a PASS device (personal alert safety system) or an ADSU (automatic distress signal unit) into their design. These units emit distinctive high pitched alarm tones to help locate firefighters in distress by automatically activating if movement is not sensed for a certain length of time (typically between 15 and 30 seconds), also allowing for manual activation should the need arise. In firefighting use, the layout of this breathing set should not interfere with ability to carry a rescued person over the firefighter's shoulders.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} syngas fuel composition on combustor blowout, flash-back, dynamic stability, and autoignition in premixed, steady flowing combustion systems. These are critical issues to be considered and balanced against emissions considerations {{in the development and}} operation of premixed combustors. Starting with blowout, the percent-age of hydrogen in the fuel is suggested to be the most significant fuel parameter, which is more fundamentally related to the hydrogen <b>flame’s</b> <b>resistance</b> to stretch induced extinction. Turning to flashback next, it is shown that multiple flashback mechanisms are present in swirling flows, and the key thermophysical properties of a syngas mixture that influence its flashback proclivity depend upon which flashback mechanism is considered. Flashback due to turbulent flame propagation in the core flow and the interaction of heat release with pulsations are less critical, whereas flame propagation in boundary layers and flashback due to the interaction of the heat release with vortex breakdown dynamics are most significant. Then, combustion instability is considered. The key flame parameter impacting the con-ditions under which instabilities occur is the spatial distribution of the flame. As such, fuel composition influences dynamics through impacts upon flame speed and the flame stabiliza...|$|R
