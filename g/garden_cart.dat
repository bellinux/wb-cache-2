40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningAnne E. BeamishThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a mobile sensory garden to help children with Sensory Integration Disorders. Sensory Integration (SI) is how an individual processes sensory information. Issues with sensory integration can lead to behavioral disorders, which can cause difficulties with social-emotional skills, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, play skills, and self-help skills. The goal of the project was to develop a mobile sensory garden to help alleviate or reduce the negative aspects of Sensory Integration Disorders. The research involved qualitative research, projective design, and evaluative research on a mobile sensory cart that was used in an elementary school in Topeka, Kansas. Methods included: interviews, design/build, and observation. The current sensory room was inventoried in Williams Science & Fine Arts Elementary Magnet School in Topeka, Kansas, and the children who used were observed. The faculty at the school, including the principal, teachers whose students use the current sensory room, counselors, and other support faculty, were interviewed. Once the observations were analyzed, a mobile sensory <b>garden</b> <b>cart</b> was designed and built. The new cart was brought to the elementary school and placed in the sensory room. A second phase of observation assessed how the children interacted with the new mobile sensory <b>garden</b> <b>cart.</b> During the second phase of observation the children showed intense interest in the mobile sensory <b>garden</b> <b>cart.</b> Some of this can be attributed to it being a new item in the sensory room. Some of the most popular items included the zen garden, wood slices on the wooden dowel, and the plants. In the second week children transitioned to using both the sensory <b>garden</b> <b>cart</b> and the original items in the sensory room. When an item on the sensory <b>garden</b> <b>cart</b> best suited their needs, that item was chosen and when their needs were best suited by other items in the room then that item was chosen. Overall the mobile sensory <b>garden</b> <b>cart</b> was beneficial to the school and the children. It can be easily replicated and modified to fit the individual needs of the children and school...|$|E
2500|$|By December 25, 1901, {{nearly the}} entire populations of Batangas and Laguna provinces had {{gathered}} into the reconcentrados. Families had to bring everything they could carry because anything left behind—including houses, <b>gardens,</b> <b>carts,</b> poultry and animals—was subject to confiscation or destruction by the U.S. Army. The reconcentrados were overcrowded, which led to disease and death. [...] "One camp was two miles by one mile in area and 'home' to some 8,000 Filipinos. Between January and April 1902, 8,350 prisoners of approximately 298,000 died, and some camps experienced mortality rates as high as 20 percent.|$|R

6000|$|And yet {{the last}} look of them--he {{stepping}} from the kerb and she following him round {{the edge of}} the big building brims me with wonder--floods me anew. Mysterious figures! Mother and son. Who are you? Why do you walk down the street? Where to-night will you sleep, and then, to-morrow? Oh, how it whirls and surges--floats me afresh! I start after them. People drive this way and that. The white light splutters and pours. Plate-glass windows. Carnations; chrysanthemums. Ivy in dark <b>gardens.</b> Milk <b>carts</b> at the door. Wherever I go, mysterious figures, I see you, turning the corner, mothers and sons; you, you, you. I hasten, I follow. This, I fancy, must be the sea. Grey is the landscape; dim as ashes; the water murmurs and moves. If I fall on my knees, if I go through the ritual, the ancient antics, it's you, unknown figures, you I adore; if I open my arms, it's you I embrace, you I draw to me--adorable world! ...|$|R
50|$|Walters {{was located}} on a now-abandoned portion of the Virginian Railway (VGN), built by {{industrialist}} Henry Huttleston Rogers to ship coal from West Virginia to port at Sewell's Point, near Norfolk. Completed in 1909, the VGN was merged into the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1959. The former railroad right-of-way now carries an important pipeline which transports fresh water to communities in South Hampton Roads.Walters was named after a resident, Walter Joyner. A nearby community in Southampton County was already named Joyners, so that name was abandoned.The community at one time was a bustling area, with several stores, a bank and post office. However, it is still home to some local businesses, including one that sells lawn & <b>garden</b> equipment, golf <b>carts,</b> and lawn tractors.|$|R
5000|$|The brand {{dates to}} 1967. In its {{earliest}} years, the brand was guaranteed to last [...] "forever", that is, {{as long as}} the original owner still owned the car in which it was originally installed, far more generous than traditional pro rata battery warranties. When drivers began to keep automobiles for longer periods than had been traditional previously (due to both their rising cost and hence longer financing contracts, and their improved durability), the cost of this policy became prohibitive and it was discontinued. However, the brand line was kept and expanded; it now includes medium-priced, medium-duty batteries as well as the premium-priced, heavy-duty line with which it was begun, and {{in recent years has been}} expanded to include other non-automotive batteries as well. It is used on batteries for motorcycles, boats, golf <b>carts,</b> <b>garden</b> tractors, and snowmobiles.|$|R
6000|$|One such {{night they}} went to the gallery at the opera, to supper at an oyster-shop, under Alan's pilotage, and then set out to walk back to Hampstead, timing {{themselves}} to catch the dawn. They had not gone twenty steps up Southampton Row before Alan and Sheila were forty steps in front. A fellow-feeling had made Derek and Nedda stand to watch an old man who walked, tortuous, extremely happy, bidding them all come. And when they moved on, it was very slowly, just keeping sight of the others across the lumbered dimness of Covent <b>Garden,</b> where tarpaulin-covered <b>carts</b> and barrows seemed to slumber under the blink of lamps and watchmen's lanterns. Across Long Acre they came into a street where there was not a soul save the two others, a long way ahead. Walking with his arm tightly laced with hers, touching her all down one side, Derek felt that it would be glorious to be attacked by night-birds in this dark, lonely street, to have a splendid fight and drive them off, showing himself to Nedda for a man, and her protector. But nothing save one black cat came near, and that ran for its life. He bent round and looked under the blue veil-thing that wrapped Nedda's head. Her face seemed mysteriously lovely, and her eyes, lifted so quickly, mysteriously true. She said: ...|$|R
