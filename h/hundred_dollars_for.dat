5|$|By early 1957, Fisher {{had lost}} {{patience}} with Häyhänen {{and demanded that}} Moscow recall his deputy. In January 1957, Häyhänen received a message from Moscow promoting him to Lieutenant Colonel and granting him leave in the Soviet Union. Upon hearing he was due to return to Moscow, Häyhänen was fearful {{that he would be}} severely disciplined or even executed. Häyhänen fabricated stories to justify his delay, claiming to Fisher that the FBI had taken him off the RMS Queen Mary. Fisher, unsuspecting, advised Häyhänen to leave the U.S. immediately to avoid FBI surveillance and handed him two <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> travel expenses. Prior to his departure, Häyhänen returned to Bear Mountain Park and retrieved the buried five thousand dollars for his own use. Häyhänen arrived in Paris on May Day, having sailed from the U.S. aboard La Liberté. Making contact with the KGB residency he received another two <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> his journey to Moscow. Four days later, instead of continuing his journey to the Soviet Union he entered the American embassy in Paris, announcing that he was a KGB officer and asking for asylum.|$|E
25|$|The website {{alleged that}} Frey {{had never been}} incarcerated and that he greatly exaggerated the {{circumstances}} of a key arrest detailed in the memoir: hitting a police officer with his car, while high on crack, {{which led to a}} violent melee with multiple officers and an 87-day jail sentence. In the police report that TSG uncovered, Frey was held at a police station for no more than five hours before posting a bond of a few <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> some minor offenses. The arresting officer, according to TSG, recalled Frey as having been polite and cooperative.|$|E
25|$|Immediately, {{under the}} act, the United States Attorney {{tried to bring}} leading church {{officials}} to trial. These efforts culminated in the sentencing of George Reynolds to two years hard labor in prison and a fine of five <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> his practice of polygamy. In 1876, the Utah Territorial Supreme Court upheld the sentence. His 1878 Reynolds v. United States appeal reached the United States Supreme Court, and in January 1879 that body ruled the anti-polygamy legislation constitutional and upheld Reynolds's prison sentence (it struck down the fine and hard labor portions). Reynolds {{was released from prison}} in January 1881, having served eighteen months of his original sentence.|$|E

25|$|On the {{strength}} of this appeal, the Reverend W. P. C. Johnson, then serving as a tutor at Gunston Hall, became the first post-Colonial rector to serve the church. Within a few years, Johnson, whose wife was a daughter of Bushrod Washington, was able to raise fifteen <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> repairs, largely on {{the strength}} of the Bishop's account; Meade further noted, however, that the doors belonging to the Washington and Mason pews were gone, although most of the others remained. Among those who provided funds to fix the leaking roof were John Quincy Adams, Martin van Buren, Daniel Webster, Francis Scott Key, and Henry Clay. The church continued serving an active Episcopal parish, being staffed sporadically by students from the Virginia Theological Seminary after Johnson's 1840 departure; in addition, a Methodist congregation held services in the building for some years in the 1850s, and a debating society used it for meetings for a time.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than simply}} sneaking Jim {{out of the}} shed where he is being held, Tom {{develops}} an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep {{and returned to the}} Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.|$|E
500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them the impression that I knew pretty much what I was doing, and they sort of got the idea that I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E

500|$|Popular was {{uncertain}} {{of the sales}} potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. Astonishings first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with Super Science Stories. [...] Pohl's budget for an issue was $405: in Pohl's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger, {{one of the company}} owners, breaking down the budget for him: [...] "Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. [...] A <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>for</b> black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover." [...] Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. [...] At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper {{than any of the other}} sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. [...] It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. [...] Pohl later commented that he {{was uncertain}} whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. [...] Some of the additional money went to long-time writer Ray Cummings, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. [...] Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came on a day when Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford to pay that rate. [...] Pohl comments in his memoirs that [...] "for months he would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all." ...|$|E
