5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect.

This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E

5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length.

GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though The Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.|$|E

5|$|A new Baroque {{building}} was constructed on {{site of the}} first Castellania by the same Grand Master, creating significant employment as Pinto had hoped for, with works commencing in 1757. Throughout the course of construction, prisoners were held in a torre near Valletta's Porta Reale, probably the tower of Saint James Cavalier. The new Castellania was built to a design by the architect Francesco Zerafa, but he died before its completion, so he was substituted by the architect Giuseppe Bonici. Zerafa is accredited for the main design, and for the subjected building he has post mortem {{established himself as a}} respected architect. The edifice was completed in 1760, with its chapel being consecrated on 15 November of that year. As a general rule, buildings in Valletta were required to be ready within three-years period <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> completion. The prisoners were transferred to the new prison three days later, on 18 November 1760.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> finish, {{in which the}} product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{gameplay}} of Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed {{escape and}} evasion together with investigative exploration, although first-person shooter (FPS) style combat is introduced later on.

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 local time.

Documentary film maker Jules Naudet captured the only known footage of the initial impact <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began to report on the incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse 102minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the recovery effort at the World Trade Center site, workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Rockets 51–14 at home before {{a crowd of}} 60,457, the fourth time during the season that {{attendance}} at Cleveland Stadium surpassed 60,000 people. The Browns led <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> finish, and Lavelli and Speedie had two touchdown receptions each. Graham's four touchdown passes helped the Browns reach an AAFC scoring record. Bud Schwenk made his first appearance {{in the fourth quarter}} of the game, substituting for Graham as the game turned into a blowout. He threw for a fifth touchdown, a 20-yard pass to Bill Lund. Edgar Jones added to Cleveland's scoring with a touchdown run in the first quarter, and center Frank Gatski scored the team's final touchdown in the fourth quarter after intercepting a pass and running it back 36 yards. It was the only touchdown of Gatski's 12-year career. Groza made a 51-yard field goal, the longest of the year in either the National Football League or AAFC, and kicked through six of the team's seven extra points. The seventh extra point was blocked, only the second time he missed a conversion in 33 tries. The Rockets managed two touchdowns, the first by Elroy Hirsch on an 81-yard drive in the second quarter and the second on a 76-yard punt return in the third quarter.|$|E
