Thus, despite the political and economic instability in the region, Eastern European countries, in and outside of the European Union need to fight corruption collectively and individually. The task is difficult, but hope is justified because the causes of corruption {{in this part of the}} region are similar and anti-corruption expertise is available. We believe that a deeper analysis of corruption’s drivers can produce a better articulated and more efficient anti-corruption strategy. This strategy will create an anti-corruption infrastructure that will strengthen the <b>Eastern</b> European <b>Partnership.</b> As a prelude to the deeper analysis that we believe must be a part of this strategy, this paper identifies the main drivers of corruption in the <b>Eastern</b> European <b>Partnership</b> countries and explains why addressing these drivers will strengthen the <b>Eastern</b> European <b>Partnership...</b>|$|R

The {{research has been conducted}} using the methods of empirical (regression) analysis, theoretical explanations, descriptive analysis, and Granger causality test. The six states under consideration had very diverse economic and reform pasts despite all having emerged from the post-soviet period.

40|$|Cereal grains are {{important}} staple foods in Africa but yields {{are still too}} low at 1. 5 tons per ha for maize while compared with a global average of 4. 5 tons per ha. This can be partly attributed to limited development of commercial seed markets, low use of improved seeds, small and highly fragmented seed markets. Many released varieties are not widely disseminated due to closed national markets dominated by a few international companies and parastatals, and restrictive laws, regulations and policies. Transactions costs within and across national boundaries are high because of differing arrangements across countries. Establishment of common regulatory structures is expected to reduce transactions costs and promote increased trade and hence use of improved seeds. This paper describes the process, results, experiences and lessons learned in developing and operationalizing a seed trade harmonization system in eastern and central Africa. It {{is clear that the}} public-private partnerships can play a pivotal role in catalyzing, facilitating and supporting the establishment, development and strengthening of national and regional seed trade.
