500|$|Many {{cultures}} {{also use}} turtles' shells for decoration. These turtles have been harvested for their beautiful shell since Egyptian times, {{and the material}} known as tortoiseshell is normally from the hawksbill.

Along the south coast of Java, stuffed hawksbill turtles are sold in souvenir shops, though numbers have decreases in the last two decades. In Japan, the turtles are also harvested for their shell scutes, which are called bekko in Japanese. It is used in various personal implements, such as <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frames</b> and the shamisen (Japanese traditional three-stringed instrument) picks. In 1994, Japan stopped importing hawksbill shells from other nations. Prior to this, the Japanese hawksbill shell trade was around [...] of raw shells per year. In the West, hawksbill sea turtle shells were harvested by the ancient Greeks and ancient Romans for jewellery, such as combs, brushes, and rings. The bulk of the world's hawksbill shell trade originates in the Caribbean. In 2006, processed shells were regularly available, often in large amounts, in countries including the Dominican Republic and Colombia.|$|E

50|$|A small pinhole {{can act as}} a lens, {{focusing}} light. This {{effect is}} used in pinhole cameras.

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1861, Lomb enlisted and served in the American Civil War for two years. In Lomb's absence, Bausch accidentally made a fortuitous discovery: he found a piece of {{vulcanite}} rubber on a New York street. He took it home and experimented making <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frames</b> from the material. At that time wire frames were mainly made from gold, and horn-rimmed frames were made from either European deer horn or tortoise shell, so eyeglasses were considered an expensive luxury. Bausch realized he could make stronger and less expensive vulcanite <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frames,</b> but soon he struggled {{to keep up with}} demand. During the Civil War, the blockade caused the price of gold and European horn to rise dramatically. This resulted in a growing demand for the Bausch and Lomb spectacles made from vulcanite.|$|E

40|$|Smartglasses, in {{addition}} to their visual-output capabilities, often contain acoustic sensors for receiving the user's voice. However, operation in noisy environments may lead to significant degradation of the received signal. To address this issue, we propose employing an acoustic sensor array which is mounted on the <b>eyeglasses</b> <b>frames.</b> The signals from the array are processed by an algorithm with the purpose of acquiring the desired near-field speech signal produced by the wearer while suppressing noise signals originating from the environment. The array is comprised of two acoustic vector-sensors (AVSs) which are located at the fore of the glassesâ temples. Each AVS consists of four collocated subsensors: one pressure sensor (with an omnidirectional response) and three particle-velocity sensors (with dipole responses) oriented in mutually orthogonal directions...|$|R
