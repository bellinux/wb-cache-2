Dosanjh faced sociologist Wai Young running for the Conservatives, <b>health</b> <b>worker</b> Ann Chambers running for the NDP, and an IT consultant, Csaba Gulyas for the Green Party. Dosanjh won by 33 votes over Young, both receiving 38.4% of the vote. A recount confirmed Dosanjh's victory but only {{by a margin of}} 22 votes. The Conservative Party requested a second, judicial recount, which again confirmed Dosanjh as the victor. In the 40th Canadian Parliament, with his party once again forming the official opposition, Dosanjh was appointed the National Defence critic for the first parliamentary session which was short-lived. During the 2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute he defended the proposed coalition government as a reaction to inappropriate leadership on economic issues by the existing government. When Dion resigned as party leader, Dosanjh considered but did not run for leadership citing his inability to speak French and again supported Rae's bid. In October 2009, Michael Ignatieff appointed Dosanjh as the Liberals' critic for National Defence.|$|E

The {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of training on the knowledge, attitudes and provision of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) information and counselling among primary healthcare (PHC) workers. Methods : A two-stage cluster sample was used to select <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> for training on IYCF in Ibadan, Nigeria. Baseline, immediate and 4 -week post-training surveys were conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices of <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> regarding IYCF. Paired t -tests were used to measure differences (p < 0. 05) before and after the training. Results : A total of 124 <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> were trained on current global IYCF recommendations. Participants included community <b>health</b> extension <b>workers</b> (59. 7 %), nurses (27. 4 %), community health officers (11. 3 %), and pharmacy technicians (1. 6 %). Mean age was 41. 8 ± 8. 2 years and 95. 2 % were women. Knowledge of <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> regarding IYCF, particularly complementary feeding, was low at baseline but improved significantly following the training intervention.

2500|$|Four {{elements}} {{are essential to}} maternal death prevention, according to UNFPA. First, prenatal care.

Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are hemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery.

[...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a <b>health</b> <b>worker</b> to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip a gloved finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye.

[...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok pulled off his oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a fine spray of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the night-shift by rising to his feet and staggering into the hallway. [...] The night nurse on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help.

40|$|Abstract Background Uganda, {{like many}} {{developing}} countries, {{is committed to}} achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. However, serious challenges prove to hamper the attainment of these goals, particularly the health related MDGs. A major challenge relates to the human resources for health. The health system in Uganda was decentralised in the 1990 s. Despite the health sector reforms, the services have remained significantly deficient and performance of <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> {{is thought to be}} one of the contributing factors. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to investigate the performance of <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> after decentralisation of the health services in Uganda in order to identify and suggest possible areas for improvement. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive survey, using quantitative research methods was utilised. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from 276 <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> in the districts of Kumi, Mbale, Sironko and Tororo in Eastern Uganda. The <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> included doctors, clinical officers, professional nurses and midwives. The sample was selected using stratified random sampling. The data was analysed using SPSS version 18. 0 and included both univariate and bivariate analysis. The results were presented in tabular and text forms. Results The study revealed that even though the <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> are generally responsive to the needs of their clients, the services they provide are often not timely. The <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> take initiatives to ensure that they are available for work, although low staffing levels undermine these efforts. While the study shows that the <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> are productive, over half (50. 4 %) of them reported that their organisations do not have indicators to measure their individual performance. The findings indicate that the <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> are skilled and competent to perform their duties. In general, the results show that <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> are proficient, adaptive, proactive and client-oriented. Conclusion Although Uganda is faced with a number of challenges as regards human resources for health, the findings show that the <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> that are currently working in the health facilities are enthusiastic to perform. This may serve as a motivator for the <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> to improve their performance and that of the health sector. </p...|$|R

They described a self-stigmatization related to a professional need to maintain a HIV-free status, contrasting with the HIV-vulnerable general population. Breaching of this boundary included feelings of professional embarrassment and fear of colleagues' and patients' judgements. Conclusions While care is available and relatively accessible, Swaziland <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> still face unique usage barriers that relate to a self-stigmatizing process of boundary maintenance - described here as a form of "othering" from the HIV-vulnerable general population - and a lack of trust in privacy and confidentiality. Interventions that target <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> should address these issues. </p...|$|R
