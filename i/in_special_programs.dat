5000|$|This {{school was}} founded in 1947 and was located in the Radio Bitola building. There was lots of {{interest}} about this school during that time. There were three music degrees in the school: piano, theoretical and strings. The school was then called [...] "Nizo Muzicko Uciliste-Bitola" [...] or [...] "Primary School for Music Education." [...] In the school at that time, Kire Kostov and Slave Dimitrov were students. In 1980 the school name was changed to today's name and the location is near Marshal Tito Street in {{the centre of the}} city. The school carries approximately 1800 students, all from South Macedonia. A proportion of the school's enrolment comes from a further field; either to participate <b>in</b> <b>special</b> <b>programs</b> like theory degree, instrument degree or solo singer degree. Each of these degrees have many teachers and examiners {{at the end of every}} year. For example if you are in the piano degree then you will study Piano, Chamber Music, Sight reading, Solfege, Theory and English.

The time is fast approaching when American schools {{will no longer}} be curriculum driven in the conventional sense; rather, they will be program driven. Nudging aside the standard cur-riculum is a collection of diverse programs, such as special edu-cation, remedial and compensatory education, and gifted and talented education. These programs have been more nearly designed to meet the individual and collective needs of selected youngsters, to provide them with the knowledge, skills, atti-tudes, and values embedded within a standard curriculum. As youngsters progress from grade to grade, they are con-tinually being sorted and placed in these special programs.

The purpose of this dissertation was to assess disciplinary characteristics of American Indian students <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education. More specifically, {{the purpose was to}} determine (a) the rate at which American Indian students <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education <b>programs</b> received ODRs in comparison to students <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education <b>programs</b> of differing races/ethnicities significantly represented in the population, (b) the rate at which American Indian boys <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education <b>programs</b> received ODRs in comparison to American Indian girls <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education <b>programs,</b> (c) the rate at which American Indian students <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education <b>programs</b> received ODRs in comparison to American Indian students who were not <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education <b>programs,</b> (d) the specific types of ODRs American Indian students <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education received, and (e) the impact race/ethnicity had on administrative decisions stemming from behavior violations. Logistic regression was used to examine ODRs for 10, 469 students from kindergarten through 12 th grade in two Southwestern public school districts with a large combined American Indian population (23. 2 %). Results indicated that although American Indian students <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education are less likely to obtain an ODR than Caucasian students <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education, and those ODRs are most often given for defiance, disrespect, and noncompliance, American Indian students <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education are still more likely to be given out-of-school suspensions and expulsions as an administrative consequence, than Caucasian students also <b>in</b> <b>special</b> education.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{participation}} in a supplemental aquatic fitness program on the physical fitness (muscular strength, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility) of children with developmental disabilities who also participate <b>in</b> <b>Special</b> Olympics <b>programming,</b> as compared to children who participate <b>in</b> <b>Special</b> Olympics <b>programming</b> alone. Fourteen children with developmental disabilities who were active participants <b>in</b> <b>Special</b> Olympics <b>programming</b> participated <b>in</b> the study. Of the 14 children, six participated in a supplemental therapeutic aquatic exercise program in order to see if participation would increase physical fitness levels. Participant physical fitness levels were assessed using the Brockport Physical Fitness Test. No significant gains in physical fitness levels were observed in the children who participated <b>in</b> <b>Special</b> Olympics <b>programming</b> alone. <b>In</b> addition, no significant gains were found in the children who participated <b>in</b> both <b>Special</b> Olympics <b>programming</b> and the aquatic program. This study suggests that physical fitness levels are not increased by regular <b>Special</b> Olympics <b>programming.</b> Consequently, a supplemental program to provide more physical activity and, therefore, increase physical fitness levels in children with developmental disabilities is still needed. However, the aquatics program used in this study <b>in</b> conjunction with <b>Special</b> Olympics <b>programming</b> also found no significant gains in physical fitness. A supplemental aquatic exercise program with increased frequency, duration, and intensity may still be effective although further research is needed to test this claim.   M. S...|$|R
