However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>episode</b> <b>a</b> reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|R
