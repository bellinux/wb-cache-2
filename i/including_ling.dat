50|$|The {{village is}} {{traditionally}} split into 'High' and 'Low' Seaton. Generally speaking, Low Seaton {{is the oldest}} part of the village and runs South West from Causeway Road towards Camerton. High Seaton makes up the remainder. Many housing estates have been built since 1950, <b>including</b> <b>Ling</b> Beck Park, Hunter's Drive Estate and Whitestiles, and house {{the vast majority of}} the current population. As these developments are in the North and East of the village, they are considered a part of High Seaton.|$|E

50|$|William Randolph Hearst {{memorial}} State Beach is a {{quiet place}} {{with an abundance of}} wildlife and nature that can be easily viewed. Hearst Memorial State Beach gives visitors the opportunity to hike, swim, fish and beachcomb. A popular beach spot, this protected cove also offers visitors pier fishing as well as kayak fishing, but there is no large boat launch from the beach. Fishing licenses are not required when fishing from the pier but limits are enforced. The beach has a variety of outdoor activities including, kayaking, kayak surfing, paddle boarding, slack lining, hiking, fishing, and swimming. though kayak surfing is becoming more popular along the beach the water is mostly shore break and therefore it is difficult to surf on a normal surfboard. Located on the beach is a small kayak shop, Sea For Yourself Kayak Outfitter, shop which provides kayak, paddle board, bike, and other beach gear rentals. The most popular is the kayak tour, nearly every day around ten a group of people can be seen launching through the waves and embarking on a two and a half hour tour led by local business owner, Cubby, who has spent nearly ten years exploring and researching the cove and its history. The beach has more than initially meets the eye. Sights Include caves underground, beaches, arches, and an abundance of wildlife. different types of wildlife that {{can be seen in the}} cove over a year include but are not limited too, Gray whales, Humpback Whales, Bottle nose dolphins, sea lions, harbor seals, elephant seals, otters, and northern fur seals. fishing from both the pier and by boat is also popular and common fish that are targeted here include but are not limited too rock fish <b>including</b> <b>Ling</b> cod, cabezon, vermilion rock fish, and gopher cod. Other fishes include halibut, thresher sharks, smelt, surf perch, and the occasional sting ray. There is also a peninsula that jets out into the ocean which is still Hearst property today, they do allow visitors to hike the path all the way out to the ocean. Just above the beach in the upper parking lot, there is a discovery center which provides information about the history and the local wildlife. Picnic tables, barbecue grills and restrooms are available.This day use area offers 24 picnic sites, 150 parking spaces, restrooms, water faucets, barbecue grill stands and easy beach access. Recreational activities include picnicking, swimming, fishing, boating, kayaking and sunbathing. including the kayak and boogie board concession in operation with equipment for rent everyday from ten till four thirty. The beach is day use only there is no camping or bonfires are allowed, and the gates will be closed just after the sun down.|$|E

40|$|Three {{species of}} {{medicinal}} mushrooms are commercially available in Taiwan, <b>including</b> <b>Ling</b> Chih (Ganoderma lucidum), Sung Shan Ling Chih (Ganoderma tsugae) and Yun Chih (Coriolus versicolor). The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the non-volatile components in these medicinal mushrooms, including their proximate compositions, soluble sugars, free amino acids and 5 '-nucleotides. Ganoderma spp. contained 7. 18 - 7. 92 % of proteins and Yun Chih contained 4. 20 %. Carbohydrate contents showed two different levels, Yun Chih (65. 09 %) and Ganoderma spp. (21. 83 - 27. 78 %). The fiber contents were in the order of Sung Shan Ling Chih (65. 29 %), regular and antler Ling Chih (59. 16 and 59. 49 %, respectively), and Yun Chih (23. 24 %). Yun Chih contained 20. 21 mg g(- 1) dry weight of total soluble sugars whereas Ganoderma spp. contained low amounts. Total free amino acid contents ranged from 4. 25 to 14. 04 mg g(- 1). Contents of MSG-like components ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 50 mg g(- 1) and sweet components ranged from 0. 28 to 1. 38 mg g(- 1). The bitter components were predominantly present in these mushrooms. Contents of total and flavour 5 '-nucleotides were high in Yun Chih and Ling Chih. The umami intensities were expected to be in the descending order of Ling Chih, Yun Chih, Sung Shan Ling Chih and antler Ling Chih. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} an offshore oil platform on local fish populations were assessed {{as part of the}} Water Column Monitoring (WCM) programme for 2014. The Njord A platform was chosen as the study location, which was not in operation and had no current discharge of produced water. Demersal fish species were targeted since they were believed to be less likely to migrate away from the platform than pelagic fish. By targeting organisms deeper in the water column and selecting a platform currently not in operation, the impact of drill cuttings and other sediment sources including leakages from well deposits were the main sources of contamination. Wild fish <b>including</b> <b>ling</b> (Molva molva), tusk (Brosme brosme), redfish (Sebastes sp.) and saithe (Pollachius virens) were caught with baited rod and line from within the 500 m safety zone of the Njord A platform during the summer of 2014. Reference fish were caught on a separate research cruise by trawling from a region of the Norwegian Sea less impacted by oil and gas activities. Limited numbers of reference ling were obtained and the reference data for ling collected from the North Sea as part of the WCM 2013 programme were used for comparison of the biomarker responses. Contaminant body burden and a suite of biological effects endpoints were measured in all fish groups and included DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks by comet assay, acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition, ethoxyresorufin 0 -deethylase (EROD), vitellogenin (VTG), lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), liver and gill histopathology, PAH metabolites, and PAH body burden. The biomarker data were integrated using the integrated biological response index (IBR/n). Despite low and/or undetected concentrations of PAH and PAH metabolites in fish fillet and bile respectively significant responses in AChE, comet and DNA adducts were found. The biomarker responses indicated exposure to both neurotoxic and genotoxic chemicals in fish inhabiting the lower water column with influence from sediment sources around the Njord A platform. Integration of the biomarker responses (IBR/n) found that all four fish species that were caught from around the platform had markedly higher IBR/n values than their respective reference population. The study shows the advantage of using a suite of biomarkers for assessing the biological effects of low concentrations of complex mixtures with biological effects observed despite low concentrations of PAH measured.
