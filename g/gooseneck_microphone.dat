50|$|In 2009, Alesis's partner Akai {{released}} its Akai Miniak, {{which has the}} same sound engine as the Micron, but in a differently styled plastic housing, with three modulation wheels instead of the Micron's two sliders plus one wheel, and with {{a different set of}} presets. Unlike the Micron, the Miniak standard comes with a <b>gooseneck</b> <b>microphone.</b> Pricing of the Miniak was substantially - typically 50% - higher upon release than the Micron's. In mid-2010 the price was dropped drastically.|$|E
5000|$|The {{unit was}} {{originally}} supplied with a <b>gooseneck</b> <b>microphone</b> (the Korg MC-01) which plugged into a bespoke BTS connector. This type of connector is now obsolete. It {{appears to have}} originated around 1965 and was phased out when XLR became the standard in later years. It is difficult to source a microphone that will connect to it but TOA Japan [...] still (as of Jan 2015, {{at a cost of}} approx. Â£100) makes a compatible model, the DM-524B. The VC-10 also has a front panel standard microphone phono input jack.|$|E
