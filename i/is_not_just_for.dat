The Minis division was first popularized in the 1970s with wrestlers like Pequeño Luke and Arturito (a wrestler with an R2-D2 gimmick) becoming noticed for their high flying abilities.

2500|$|Ilana Teitelbaum of The Huffington Post {{responded in}} an article called [...] "Dear New York Times: A Game of Thrones <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> Boys", {{claiming}} that Bellafante's piece was not only rife with inaccuracies, but also patronizing to female readers. Teitelbaum defended the many sex scenes in the TV series because the books as a source sprawl with them. She encouraged discussion of the Ice and Fire books and the fantasy genre from a feminist perspective, but rejected Bellafante's point that only men are interested in fantasy, considering Bellafante's characterization of fantasy as [...] "boy fiction" [...] as a promotion of gender stereotyping offensive to the genre {{as well as to}} women. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic noted the need to differentiate between depicting misogyny and endorsing misogyny, as the series is set {{in a world in which}} sex is the primary means by which women can assert their power. Meslow states that although the TV series may sometimes toe the line between Skinimax-style exploitation and genuine plot advancement, the sexual scenes also invite the viewers to sympathize with the series' women.|$|E
