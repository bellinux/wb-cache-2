5|$|Characteristic of the Roman times iron {{industry}} were huge centers of metallurgy. One such concentration of ironworks, in Świętokrzyskie Mountains, which already produced iron on an industrial {{scale in the}} 1st century AD, in the 2nd and 3rd centuries became Barbaricum's largest. It may {{have been responsible for}} the majority of the iron supplied for barbarian weapon production during the Marcomannic Wars. The iron product was obtained in rather small, single-use smelting furnaces. One furnace's iron output was from a few to 20kg, which required 10 to 200kg of ore and the same amount of charcoal. The satisfaction of so much need for charcoal caused significant deforestation of the areas surrounding the iron centers. Not only turf, but also hematite ores were utilized, which involved building mines and shafts to provide access. The furnaces in Świętokrzyskie Mountains were grouped into large complexes, located in forested areas, away from human settlements. There could have had been as many as 700,000 smelting furnaces built in that area; one big concentration of the Przeworsk culture's spent furnaces (2nd-3rd centuries) was located in Nowa Słupia, Kielce County. The second largest iron production center functioned at that time in Masovia, west of Warsaw, with the total number of furnaces there, in which only turf ores were used, estimated at up to 200,000. They were operated as very large complexes, with several thousand furnaces at a time located near populated areas, where <b>intermediate</b> <b>products</b> were processed further. Those two great concentrations of metallurgical industry produced iron largely for long distance trade; to fulfill local requirements and on smaller scale iron was obtained at a number of other locations.|$|E

25|$|The {{substance}} (or substances) initially {{involved in}} a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and {{the information on the}} precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes <b>intermediate</b> <b>products</b> and reaction conditions.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{technical}} barrier {{in the production}} and use of FDCA {{is the development of}} an effective and selective dehydration process from sugars. The control of sugar dehydration could be a very powerful technology, leading {{to a wide range of}} additional, inexpensive building blocks, but it is not yet well understood. Currently, dehydration processes using hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as intermediate are generally non-selective, unless, immediately upon their formation, the unstable <b>intermediate</b> <b>products</b> can be transformed into more stable materials such as methoxymethylfurfural (MMF).

40|$|The oil {{refining}} {{industry in the}} EEA faces future challenges. Some of these challenges are competition from non-EEA refiners, increased import of petroleum products to the EEA and unsophisticated technology of existing refineries. If the {{oil refining}} industry in the EEA will change in the future, what impact will these changes have on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> tanker segment trading in the EEA? These possible future changes in the refining industry are essential for ship-owners’ decision making in regards to efficient operation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> tankers in the EEA. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate how and why the oil refining industry in the EEA will develop until year 2025 and how these changes will affect the <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> tanker segment. To fulfil the purpose, a case study has been performed. The primary information for this study has been retrieved by conducting ten interviews with semi-structured questions. The result from this study shows that the refining industry in the EEA faces several future challenges. Increased competition from non-EEA refiners and increased import of petroleum products have been highlighted as the main challenges for the refining industry in EEA. This study also shows that the <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> tankers still are expected to be needed for regional transportation within the EEA. However, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> segment faces competition from larger segments and therefore it is important that the segment keeps its flexibility compared to larger segments to not lose its market shares.

25|$|Nitrogen {{is present}} in the {{environment}} {{in a wide variety of}} chemical forms including organic nitrogen, Ammonium (NH), nitrite (NO), nitrate (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), Nitric oxide (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>products</b> of organic matter decomposition. The processes of the nitrogen cycle transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the nitrogenous wastes in animal urine are broken down by nitrifying bacteria in the soil to be used as new. The diagram besides shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.|$|E
25|$|Ingested {{proteins}} {{are usually}} broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides {{in the small}} intestine, and then absorbed. They can then be joined to make new proteins. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>products</b> of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway {{can be used to}} make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. These are the essential amino acids, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize arginine and histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} {{production}} system, machines and apparatuses {{play an important}} role. What {{is referred to as}} capital is nothing other than these machines and apparatuses, together with materials and <b>intermediate</b> <b>products</b> consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one should say as important as labor. By the help of machines and apparatuses, the human being got a tremendous production capability. These machines, apparatuses and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile and the result of past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated by the past investment.|$|E

500|$|... 232Th absorbs {{neutrons}} {{more readily}} than 238U, and 233U has a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture (92.0%) than 235U (85.5%) or 239Pu (73.5%). It also releases more neutrons upon fission on average. A single neutron capture by 238U produces transuranic waste along with the fissile 239Pu, but 232Th only produces this waste after five captures, forming 237Np. This number of captures does not happen for 98–99% of the 232Th nuclei because the <b>intermediate</b> <b>products</b> 233U or 235U undergo fission, and fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide fuels to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium.|$|E

In this paper, we first introduce an agency contract where the salary of the manager of an activity centre that produces an <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> is dependent of its performance. Secondly, we add competition within the organization. This latter point is new in the literature. We then develop a "static analysis" comparing a firm that has only one activity centre producing an <b>intermediate</b> <b>product</b> with another firm that has two activity centres producing the same <b>intermediate</b> <b>product,</b> in a context where the technology manifests increasing returns to scale. We conclude that the introduction of internal competition makes the firm globally more efficient, even though it cannot fully explore the existence of increasing returns to scale. ...|$|R

2500|$|During World War II, {{as part of}} the Grün 3 program, a {{plant for}} the {{manufacture}} of tabun was established at Dyhernfurth (now Brzeg Dolny, Poland), in 1939.

The reason for the delay was the extreme precautions used by the plant. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>products</b> of tabun were corrosive, and had to be contained in quartz or silver-lined vessels. Tabun itself was also highly toxic, and final reactions were conducted behind double glass walls. Large scale manufacturing of the agent resulted in problems with tabun's degradation over time, and only around 12,500 tons of material were manufactured before the plant was seized by the Soviet Army. The plant initially produced shells and aerial bombs using a 95:5 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene, designated [...] "Variant A", and {{in the latter half of}} the war switched to [...] "Variant B", an 80:20 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene designed for easier dispersion.
