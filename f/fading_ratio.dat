The {{emphasis is on}} the capacity pre-log, i. e., on the limiting ratio of channel capacity to the logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as the SNR tends to infinity. It is shown that, among all stationary and ergodic fading processes of a given spectral distribution function and whose law has no mass point at zero, the Gaussian process gives rise to the smallest pre-log. The as-sumption that the law of the fading process has no mass point at zero is essential in the sense that there exist stationary and ergodic fading processes whose law has a mass point at zero and that give rise to a smaller pre-log than the Gaussian process of equal spectral distribution function.

Applying this technique to the noncoherent peak-power or averagepower limited discrete time memoryless Ricean fading channel, we obtain the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expansion of this channel’s cutoff rate. At high SNR, the gap between channel capacity and the cutoff rate approaches a finite limit. This limit is approximately 0. 26 nats per channel-use for zero specular component (Rayleigh) fading and approaches 0. 39 nats per channel-use for very large values of the specular component. We also compute the asymptotic cutoff rate of a Rayleigh-fading channel when the receiver has access to some partial side information concerning the fading. It is demonstrated that the cutoff rate does not utilize the side information as efficiently as capacity, and that the high SNR {{gap between the two}} increases to infinity as the imperfect side information becomes more and more precise.
