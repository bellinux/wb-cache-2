40|$|Book synopsis: Haptic {{interfaces}} {{are divided}} into two main categories: <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> and tactile. <b>Force</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>interfaces</b> are used to explore and modify remote/virtual objects in three physical dimensions in applications including computer-aided design, computer-assisted surgery, and computer-aided assembly. Tactile interfaces deal with surface properties such as roughness, smoothness, and temperature. Haptic research is intrinsically multi-disciplinary, incorporating computer science/engineering, control, robotics, psychophysics, and human motor control. By extending the scope of research in haptics, advances can be achieved in existing applications such as computer-aided design (CAD), tele-surgery, rehabilitation, scientific visualization, robot-assisted surgery, authentication, and graphical user interfaces (GUI), to name a few.

40|$|International audienceAs a {{solution}} to the lack of compactness and simplicity often encountered in haptic interfaces, we propose a device based on friction coefficient control principle. This device includes polarised piezoceramics well adjusted and glued to a 64 x 38 x 3 mm copper-beryllium plate supported by four legs. Then, properly energised around a resonant frequency, with legs at antinodes, a stationary wave is created in the plate. Variable friction forces between the legs and the plane substrate are created by the control of the wave amplitude, according to electro-active lubrication. So the user obtains force feedback by holding the plate, and moving it on a plane substrate, as he could do with a mouse interface.

40|$|The {{texture of}} a virtual surface can both {{increase}} {{the sense of}} realism of an object as well as convey information about object identity, type, location, function, and so on. It is crucial therefore that interface designers know the range of textural information available through the haptic modality in virtual environments. The current study involves participants making roughness judgments on pairs of haptic textures experienced through a force-feedback device. The effect of texture frequency on roughness perception is analysed. The potential range and resolution of textural information available through force-feedback interaction are discussed.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) offer {{great potential}} for advanced sensor development due to the unique electronic transport properties of the material.

40|$|We {{developed}} a snake rescue robot basing {{on the proposed}} mechanical intelligence. The mechanical intelligence is designed to avoid obstacles and to realize desired motions when the robot is navigated by a remote <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> steering wheel <b>interface.</b> We use free joints to connect modules of the snake robot. Modules can freely turn according to their neighbors. An obstacle-avoiding wheel is mounted {{on the head of}} the snake robot. When the head encounters an obstacle, the wheel touches it first to transfer the sliding friction between the wheel and the obstacle into rolling friction, so that the head avoid the obstacle easily. A metal wire is used to link gears mounted on both sides of each module. When any part of the snake robot's body encounters an obstacle, the wire length of each side varies automatically to change the robot's body shape, so that the snake robot avoids the obstacle. The wire length of each side can also be adjusted by a motor. By adjusting the wire length of each side, the snake robot can move in the desired direction. The mechanical intelligence based snake rescue robot has light body, low cost and low computation cost. Experiment results show that the designed mechanical intelligence is effective in realizing desired robot motions together with the <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> steering wheel <b>interface.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{scientific}} visualization has begun to articulate systematic methods for mapping data to a perceivable form. Most work in this area has focused on the visual sense. For blind people in particular, systematic visualization methods which utilize other sense need further development. In this work we develop methods for adding aural feedback to an existing haptic <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>interface</b> to create a multimodal visualization system. We examine some fundamental components of a visualization system which include the following: characterization of the data, definition of user directives and interpretation aims, cataloging of sensual representations of information, and finally, matching the data and user interpretation aims with the appropriate sensual representations. We focus on the last two components as they relate to the aural and haptic sensor. Cataloging of sensual representations is drawn form current research in sonification and haptics. The matching procedure {{can be thought of as}} a type of encoding which should be the inverse of the decoding mechanism of our aural and haptic systems. Topics in human perception are discussed, and issues related to the interaction between the two sensor are addressed. We have implemented a visualization system in the from of a Windows NT application using a sound card and a 3 DOF point interaction haptic interface. The system present a 2 D data set primarily as a polygonal haptic surface although other capabilities of the haptic sensor are utilized such as texture discernment. In addition, real time aural feedback is presented as the user explores the surface. Parameters of sound such as pitch and spectral content are used to convey information. Evaluation of the system's effectiveness as an assistive technology for the blind reveals that combining aural and haptic feedback improves visualization over using either of the two senses alone...|$|E
40|$|Virtual Reality has {{traditionally}} taken {{the form of}} audio-visual simulations. The desire for more realistic interactions gradually led to pursue the inclusion of touch as an additional feedback modality. Simulation of touch through haptics should ideally integrate both kinaesthetic and tactile feedback. Currently kinaesthetic feedback is applied mainly through force feedback joysticks {{and to a lesser}} extent through hand exoskeletons. Hand exoskeletons are desirable for whole- hand interaction but require further development before they can become more widely applicable. Tactile feedback on the other hand is still in its infancy. None of the past efforts has managed to satisfy the stringent performance and design requirements and to present an interoperable and generic tactile display suitable for integration in VR haptic systems. This thesis presents the development of two haptic interfaces designed for tactile- kinaesthetic feedback integration; an interoperable tactile display for the fingertip and an ergonomic exoskeleton for the hand. The tactile display is a compact and lightweight interface for high fidelity tactile feedback. Its operation is based on a 4 x 4 array of vertically moving tactors for the display of surface shape to an area of the fingertip. The tactors are spring loaded and are actuated remotely by dc motors through a very flexible tendon transmission. This design allows 6 DOF tactile exploration in an excellent work envelope. The compact design, high performance, reliability, and straightforward connectivity make this tactile display truly interoperable and suitable for direct integration in any VR haptic system. The exoskeleton is a 7 DOF <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>interface.</b> It is mounted on the dorsal side of the right hand and provides feedback to the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers. It is actuated remotely by DC motors through a tendon transmission. It is adjustable for different hand sizes and has been designed for comfort, easy fitting and removal. The exoskeleton has also been integrated with novel low cost vibrotactile displays for simulation of contact at the fingertips. The developed interfaces have been designed with a scope for performance practicality reliability and interoperability which are reflected in the outcomes of this thesis.

40|$|Low trauma, reduced {{costs and}} fast {{recovery}} {{are only a}} few factors why minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is taking over classical surgical methods. Interventional Radiology (IR) is a minimally invasive procedure where thin tubular instruments are steered through the patient's vascular system under X-ray imaging. In order to perform these procedures, a radiologist has to be trained to master hand-eye coordination, instrument manipulation and procedure protocols. The importance of training IR procedures rises with the increasing variety and sophistication of the procedures performed using this approach. Apart from the traditional "see one, do one, teach one" model, radiologists have only had few mock devices with limitations in practical use. Training on animals is an alternative, but its use is hindered by high costs and ethical issues. The existing simulation systems all have major drawbacks: the requirement to use modified instruments, high inertia of the haptic feedback that creates a noticeably degraded dynamic behavior, or excessive friction that is not properly compensated. In this thesis we propose a quality training environment dedicated to IR. The system is composed of a virtual reality (VR) simulation of the patients anatomy linked to a robotic interface providing haptic force feedback. This thesis focuses on the requirements, design and prototyping of a specific haptic interface for the manipulation of catheters and guide wires. Translational tracking and force feedback on the catheter are provided by two cylinders forming a friction drive arrangement. The complete friction drive can be set in rotation with an additional motor providing torque feedback. A force and a torque sensor are integrated in the cylinders for direct measurement on the catheter enabling disturbance cancellation with a closed-loop force control strategy. One of the specific requirements during a simulated intervention is to measure the position of the tip of a guide wire inside a catheter. This is a so called "tube in tube" problem. The guide wire is detected at the entrance of the simulator and then grasped by a micro-gripper. Forces and movements of the guidewire moving inside the catheter are then transmitted through a gripper and along a rod to an external unit. This thesis also reports a study of several micro-gripper designs developed and tested on a haptic <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>interface</b> developed at the LSRO-EPFL. A virtual reality environment has been developed to provide real-time visualisation and force feedback. Several different software routines are integrated in the system. During an IR procedure the tip of an employed instrument interacts with a wall of blood vessels and a repulsive force is transmitted to the user. Force feedback helps radiologist to orient and navigate the inserted instrument in the vessel. This thesis presents a novel method for measurement of internal constraints during an IR procedure. The measurements help to determine the maximum interaction forces between the catheter and the wall of the blood vessel and to observe the shape of dynamic interaction during manipulation. In order to recreate a realistic simulation environment it is necessary to derive the elastic properties and behavior of arteries when contact with an instrument occurs. A novel method for measurement of mechanical properties of blood vessels is proposed in this work. Information derived with this method is also very useful to determine coherent boundary conditions for hemodynamic simulations. Measurements of the modulus of elasticity of an artery are carried out by measuring the deformations due to the inflation of an angioplasty balloon catheter used for IR procedures. A test bench, consisting of an angioplasty balloon, a PVA model and an actuator used to inflate the balloon, is developed for realization of experiments. The pressure-volume curve during the inflation of the balloon is observed. The Young's modulus is derived with an analytical model of the measurement system. The results are then analyzed and compared to existing data from literature...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{design and}} {{instrumentation}} of <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> (FF) is presented for a networked telerobotic system {{that consists of}} a Master Arm Client Station (MACS) and a Slave Arm Server Station (SASS). A motion coordination system maps the operator hand at MACS, to a user defined floating tool frame at SASS. Variational analysis for a wrist force sensor allows evaluating the force at a floating point of the tool frame. Force is streamed from SASS to MACS where it is displayed on the operator hand. Performance evaluation of contact with the environment is presented. First, a user-controlled teleoperation with FF is described. Contact instabilities are observed in pre-contact and post-contact phases. Second, a programmed compliance loop is implemented at SASS by selectively converting sensed forces into corrective motion which allows minimizing contact forces. Third, a supervisory mechanism based on a user-controlled Active Compliance is presented. High FF gain improves operator sensitivity but may cause instability {{in the case of}} contact with stiff environment. Motion mapping minimizes the number of trials to set up the tool configuration. Light and stiff arms are highly recommended to reduce the degradation in telerobotic synchronization caused by elasticity in linkage transmission and by the network delays. Active compliance at the slave arm improved contact stability and provided an effective supervisory control.

40|$|Current <b>force</b> <b>feedback,</b> haptic <b>interface</b> {{devices are}} {{generally}} {{limited to the}} display of low frequency, high amplitude spatial data. A typical device consists of a low impedance framework {{of one or more}} degrees-of-freedom (dof), allowing a user to explore a pre-defined workspace via an end effector such as a handle, thimble, probe or stylus. The movement of the device is then constrained using high gain positional feedback, thus reducing the apparent dof of the device and conveying the illusion of hard contact to the user. Such devices are, however, limited to a narrow bandwidth of frequencies, typically below 30 Hz, and are not well suited to the display of surface properties, such as object texture.

Single cell manipulation is an important process in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), pro-nuclei DNA injection, gene therapy, and other biomedical areas. However, conventional cell manipulation requires long training and the success rate depends on the experience of the operator. The goal of this research is to address the drawbacks of conventional cell manipulation by using <b>force</b> and vision <b>feedback</b> for cell manipulation tasks. We hypothesize that <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> plays an important role in cell {{manipulation and}} possibly helps in cell characterization. This dissertation will summarize our research on: 1) the development of <b>force</b> and vision <b>feedback</b> <b>interface</b> for cell manipulation, 2) human subject studies to evaluate the addition of <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> for cell injection tasks, 3) the development of haptics-enabled atomic force microscope system for cell indentation tasks, 4) appropriate analytical model for characterizing the mechanical property of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and 5) several indentation studies on mESC to determine the mechanical property of undifferentiated and early differentiating (6 days under differentiation conditions) mESC. Our experimental results on zebrafish egg cells show that a system with <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> capability when combined with vision feedback can lead to potentially higher success rates in cell injection tasks. Using this information, we performed experiments on mESC using the AFM to understand their characteristics in the undifferentiated pluripotent state as well as early differentiating state. These experiments were done on both live as well as fixed cells to understand the correlation between the two during cell indentation studies. Our results show that the mechanical property of undifferentiated mESC differs from early differentiating (6 th day) mESC in both live and fixed cells. Thus, we hypothesize that mechanical characterization studies will potentially pave the way for developing a high throughput system with <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> capability, to understand and predict the differentiation path a particular pluripotent cell will follow. This finding could also be used to develop improved methods of targeted cellular differentiation of stem cells for therapeutic and regenerative medicine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There are two popular control methods {{widely used}} in haptic {{controller}} design. First, is impedance control- the operator motion input is measured, and then, the reaction force is fed back to the operator. The alternative method is admittance control-forces exerted by operator are measured and positions are fed back to the operator. Both, impedance and admittance control are also two basic methods for interacting with a virtual environment. In this paper, several experiments were performed to evaluate the suitability of impedance control with <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> for haptic <b>interface</b> development. The difference between conventional application of impedance control in robot motion control and its application in haptic interface development is investigated.

Compared to the <b>Force</b> <b>Feedback</b> Pro and the Precision 2, nothing new {{was added to the}} <b>Force</b> <b>Feedback</b> 2 that wasn't added to the Precision 2, in fact the shift button was taken away. The overall size and weight difference was not so great with the use of smaller motors. This joystick came in two varieties: one version with a silver trigger, and an updated version with a translucent red trigger. One of the main ideas in the <b>Force</b> <b>Feedback</b> 2 was the removal of the power brick. Since the release of the <b>Force</b> <b>Feedback</b> 2, the stick has garnered a reputation of reliability and resiliency, many <b>Force</b> <b>Feedback</b> 2 sticks are still in use currently. On eBay Sidewinder <b>Force</b> <b>Feedback</b> 2 joysticks regularly sell for more than the original MSRP of $109.|$|R

It is shown that active <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> yields a better and more reliable technical solution than passive <b>force</b> <b>feedback.</b> In addition, active <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> is also economically justified, since the passive solution requires additional peripheral equipment {{in order to deal with}} the large uncertainties.

40|$|For {{practical}} application of <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> in robotassisted surgical systems, {{it may not}} be possible to match the number of degrees of freedom of position sensing and control with the degrees of freedom of <b>force</b> sensing and <b>feedback.</b> The goal of this experimental study is to determine the effect of such sensor/actuator asymmetry during bilateral telemanipulation. We examined the performance of two tool-based teleoperated tasks: (1) a task to push a cup through a series of poses and (2) a blunt dissection task using phantom tissues. Three different <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> conditions were applied to a 3 -D teleoperation system: (1) 3 -D <b>force</b> <b>feedback,</b> (2) <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> without the axial forces measured on the slave tool, and (3) no <b>force</b> <b>feedback.</b> The tasks were also performed manually using a hand-held stylus. Results show that the absence of measured axial forces does not create a statistically significant difference in the level of applied forces, in comparison with complete 3 -D <b>force</b> <b>feedback.</b> In addition, this partial <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> is a significant improvement over teleoperation with no <b>force</b> <b>feedback...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the effects of {{indirect}} <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> methods in the telemanipulated robotic system. The goal of the work reported here is to evaluate the role of <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> information during telemanipulation, with a focus on robot-assisted surgery. Current robot-assisted surgery systems do not provide haptic feedback to the operator; it is not known whether this limitation significantly affects performance. We examined the level of <b>force</b> <b>feedback,</b> type of <b>force</b> <b>feedback,</b> and substitution of <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> for their effects on operator performance. First, we looked at the effect of an absence of <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> during surgical knot-tying. For the non-force feedback condition, the telesurgical robot, da Vinci, Intuitive Surgical, Inc., was utilized. The data from the non-force feedback methods was compared to data from the partial <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> method and the full <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> method conducted with forceps and hands, respectively. The results showed that operator precision was lower without <b>force</b> <b>feedback.</b> We, however, could not conclude that there was an effect on operator accuracy. Second, we examined the utility of sensory-substitution feedback during surgical knottying procedure. We provided both auditory and visual feedback to an operator during a surgical knot-tying task. The visual feedback assisted the operator more than the auditory feedback. However, the design of both feedbacks shall be improved to provide more utility. Third, the missing degrees of freedom in <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> were studied to provide evidence of the effectiveness of a tool that only has the capability of sensing force information in two dimensions. Operators under the partial <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> performed as well as they did under complete <b>force</b> <b>feedback.</b> These findings have the potent [...] ...|$|R
