40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES Previous {{laboratory}} studies in narcolepsy patients showed altered core body and skin temperatures, which are hypothesised {{to be related}} to a disturbed sleep wake regulation. In this ambulatory study we assessed temperature profiles in normal daily life, and whether sleep attacks are heralded by changes in skin temperature. Furthermore, the effects of three months of treatment with sodium oxybate (SXB) were investigated. METHODS Twenty-five narcolepsy patients and 15 healthy controls were included. Core body, proximal and <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> temperatures, and sleep-wake state were measured simultaneously for 24 hours in ambulatory patients. This procedure was repeated in 16 narcolepsy patients after at least 3 months of stable treatment with SXB. RESULTS Increases in <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> temperature and distal-to-proximal temperature gradient (DPG) strongly predicted daytime sleep attacks (P < 0. 001). As compared to controls, patients had a higher proximal and <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> temperature in the morning, and a lower <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> temperature during the night (all P < 0. 05). Furthermore, they had a higher core body temperature during {{the first part of the}} night (P < 0. 05), which SXB decreased (F = 4. 99, df = 1, P = 0. 03) to a level similar to controls. SXB did not affect skin temperature. CONCLUSIONS This ambulatory study demonstrates that daytime sleep attacks were preceded by clear changes in <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> temperature and DPG. Furthermore, changes in core body and skin temperature in narcolepsy, previously only studied in laboratory settings, were partially confirmed. Treatment with SXB resulted in a normalisation of the core body temperature profile. Future studies should explore whether predictive temperature changes can be used to signal or even prevent sleep attacks...|$|R

The abbreviated Italian version of the Demand/Control model (Karasek) {{was used to assess}} perceived work strain, while the Goldberg scales were used to assess anxiety and depression. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, occupation, latex glove use and history of atopy. Results Of the participants, 25 % reported hand dermatitis in the previous 12 months and 35 % had been affected by <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> {{in other parts of the}} body. High job demands (OR = 1. 09 CI 95 % 1. 05 - 1. 14), low social support (OR = 0. 90, CI 95 % 0. 87 - 0. 93), high strain (OR = 1. 54 CI 95 % 1. 20 - 1. 98) and high iso-strain (1. 66 CI 95 % 1. 27 - 2. 19) were all associated with a higher prevalence of reported hand <b>skin</b> <b>disorders.</b> Both depression (OR = 2. 50 CI 95 % 1. 99 - 3. 14) and anxiety (OR = 2. 29 CI 95 % 1. 81 - 2. 89) were associated with higher risk of hand <b>skin</b> <b>disorders.</b> The same pattern was observed for dermatological complaints in other parts of the body. Only a slight reduction in the association between occupational stress variables and <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> was observed after including depression and anxiety in the model. Conclusions Job stress plays a significant role in triggering <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> among hospital workers and psychological problems do not appear to be the mechanism behind this association. Occupational health education and training should focus on reducing job demands and occupational stress in order to prevent skin problems among hospital workers. </p...|$|R

Skin, hair, and nails are visible to self and others, and touchable by self and others. The skin {{is a major}} sensory organ. Skin also expresses {{emotions}} detectable by others through pallor, coldness, "goose bumps", redness, warmth, or sweating. Spiritual and religious significances of skin are revealed through {{how much of the}} skin has been and continues to be covered with what types of coverings, scalp and beard hair cutting, shaving and styling, skin, nail, and hair coloring and decorating, tattooing, and intentional scarring of skin. Persons with visible <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> have often been stigmatized or even treated as outcasts. Shamans and other spiritual and religious healers have brought about healing of <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> through spiritual means. Spiritual and religious interactions with various <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> such as psoriasis, leprosy, and vitiligo are discussed.

40|$|Objective: Besides {{excessive}} daytime sleepiness, disturbed nocturnal {{sleep is}} a major complaint of patients with narcolepsy. Previously, alterations in skin temperature regulation in narcoleptic patients {{have been shown to}} be related to increased sleepiness. This study tests the hypothesis that direct control of nocturnal skin temperature might be applied to improve the disturbed sleep of narcoleptic patients. Methods: Participants were eight patients (five males) diagnosed as having narcolepsy with cataplexy according to the ICSD- 2 criteria, mean (SD) age 28. 6 (6. 4) years, range 18 - 35 years. During two nights, sleep was recorded polysomnographically while proximal and <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> temperature were manipulated using a comfortable thermosuit that induced skin temperature to cycle slowly with an amplitude of only 0. 4 °C within the comfortable range normally observed during sleep. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of skin temperature manipulation on the probability of occurrence of different sleep stages and nocturnal wakefulness. Results: Proximal skin warming significantly suppressed wakefulness and enhanced slow wave sleep (SWS). In contrast, <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> warming enhanced wakefulness and stage 1 sleep at the cost of SWS and REM sleep. The optimal combination of proximal <b>skin</b> warming and <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> cooling led to a 160 % increase in SWS, a 50 % increase in REM sleep and a 68 % decrease in wakefulness, compared with the least beneficial combination of proximal <b>skin</b> cooling and <b>distal</b> <b>skin</b> warming. Interpretation: Subtle skin temperature manipulations under controlled conditions significantly improved the typical nocturnal sleep problems in narcolepsy...|$|R
