25|$|In {{the first}} year of Rowland's third term (2003), rumors began {{circulating}} that contractors <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> state paid for and made improvements to his weekend home, that he benefited improperly from the sale of a condominium in Washington, D.C. at an inflated price, that he took bribes from subordinates in state government, and that he took partial ownership in businesses immediately before they were granted state contracts. These eventually led to federal investigations and then indictments of some of Rowland's close aides, who then cooperated with federal investigators.|$|E
25|$|Young and Kelley {{arrived at}} the Hudson's Bay Company post Fort Vancouver on October 17, 1834, center of the Columbia District. The HBC was the preeminent {{economic}} force in the region's fur trade. At the time the Oregon Country was jointly occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States of America. Young decided to settle permanently {{on the west bank}} of the Willamette River, near the mouth of Chehalem Creek, opposite Champoeg. His home is believed to be the first house built by European Americans on that side of the river. Dr. John McLoughlin of the HBC tried to discourage American settlers in the region. The Mexican government of Alta California accused Young and his group of having stolen 200 horses when they left. The group denied this, saying some uninvited traveling companions had stolen the horses. McLoughlin blacklisted Young from <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> HBC.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a report}} written in 2011 by Vanity Fair {{contributing}} editor David Rose, Afghan Wireless's founder Ehsan Bayat had acted as a confidential informant for the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's Joint Terrorism Task Force since 1998. In a joint endeavor with the National Security Agency known as Operation Foxden, the FBI intended to install equipment into Afghan Wireless's infrastructure that would allow American intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on cell phone calls in Afghanistan. While the operation was in its planning stages, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13129, which prohibited US citizens from <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Taliban. In the interests of completing Operation Foxden, the FBI and NSA aided Bayat and his British partners in circumventing the executive order's ban by transferring ownership of Afghan Wireless to a shell company based in Liechtenstein. Before the plan could be put in place, the American Central Intelligence Agency raised objections to Operation Foxden, citing their traditional preeminence over the FBI in conducting foreign intelligence gathering. The operation was finally authorized {{to move forward on}} September 8, 2001—but the September 11 attacks just three days later and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan rendered the project moot.|$|E

25|$|On April 13, 1992, President George H. W. Bush {{issued an}} {{executive}} order, E.O. 12800, that required contractors <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{federal government to}} provide their non-union employees with notice of their Beck rights. Executive branch officials estimated that about 2 million to 3 million (10.5 percent to 15.8 percent) of the 19 million workers represented by labor unions are nonmembers, and that NLRB officials had issued more than 300 citations accusing unions of not notifying their members of their Beck rights. Labor leaders dismissed the Executive Order, claiming they already met the requirements set down by the Supreme Court. The Bush administration estimated the Executive Order would keep $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion a year from being collected by labor unions. The administration also said it would order the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to issue new regulations that would require unions to report in far greater detail {{the amount of money}} they spend on political activities, lobbying, and collective bargaining. Bush also asked Congress to enact legislation formally encoding the Beck ruling into federal labor law. Unions and Democrats derided the action as election year politicking, while right-to-work advocates hailed it as long overdue. At least one legal scholar criticized the order for not doing enough to implement the Beck decision, and for putting the onus of notification on the employer rather than the union.|$|E

Harpole defended the city's decision at the time, saying, [...] "They looked at {{everything they could to}} say are these people reasonable, can they perform and [...] have they been honest in their past dealings.

500|$|Harpole also toured Sugar Land, {{a city in}} the Houston metro area, {{along with}} other Amarillo city {{officials}}. Sugar Land city officials cited low crime, a major hotel, and low property tax rates as key to their city's redevelopment. In Sugar Land, Harpole met with former Sugar Land mayor David Wallace, and his business partner, Costa Bajjali, both principals of Wallace Bajjali Development Partners. [...] In November 2011, the city approved a $947,000 payment to Wallace Bajjali and began talks on how to revitalize downtown Amarillo. 51 investors sued the group for losses of $3.1 million in an alleged ponzi scheme. In February 2012, the group agreed to settle the suit for about $1.2 million. The city continued <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> group.|$|E

500|$|The main {{charge against}} Robeson was taking {{financial}} favors from Alexander Cattell & Co., a grain contractor, {{in exchange for}} giving the company profitable contracts from the Navy. [...] An 1876 Naval Affairs committee investigation found Robeson to have received such gifts as a team of horses, Washington real estate, and a $320,000 vacation cottage in Long Branch, New Jersey, from Alexander Cattell & Company. [...] The same company also paid off a $10,000 note that Robeson owed to Jay Cooke and offered itself as an influence broker for other companies <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Navy, thus turning away any competitive bidding for naval contracts. Robeson was also found to have $300,000 in excess to his yearly salary of $8000. The House Investigation committee had searched the disorganized books of Cattell, but {{found no evidence of}} payments to Robeson. Without enough evidence for impeachment, the House ended the investigation by admonishing Robeson for gross misconduct and claimed that he had set up a system of corruption known as Cattellism.|$|E
500|$|Klein's {{government}} had received criticism {{for reducing the}} importance of the legislature by sitting it fewer days than any other province's legislature and for directing business through standing policy committees of the Progressive Conservative caucus. These committees met in private, unlike the legislature's all-party committees, which fell almost entirely out of use during the Klein years. In April 2007, Stelmach initiated the creation of four new legislative [...] "policy field committees" [...] which would include opposition representation. The same month, his government introduced new legislation on conflicts of interest, such that former cabinet ministers would have to wait one year before <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government or lobbying it on behalf of third parties (up from six months). It also created a similar cooling-off period for senior bureaucrats, which lasted six months. [...] However, an Order in Council passed by Stelmach's cabinet shortly before the 2008 election delayed the implementation of these rules until one month after the election, meaning that cabinet ministers who retired or lost their bids for re-election would be exempt from the new rules.|$|E

Both cases also [...] used the [...] "legal incidence test." [...] The Supreme Court also later expanded the rationale for upholding state taxes on companies <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> federal government in two cases. [...] In United States v. Detroit, 355 U.S. 473 (1958), the Court held that private, for-profit companies should not gain tax-exempt status merely because they {{do business with the}} federal government. And in United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720 (1982), the Court enunciated a general policy of upholding taxes against private parties <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> federal government absent a specific constitutional or legislative mandate.|$|E
