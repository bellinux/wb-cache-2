5|$|One {{possible}} source {{has been}} identified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of New Guinea: beetles of the genus Choresine (family Melyridae), which contain the toxin and {{have been found in}} the stomachs of hooded pitohui. An alternative explanation, that the birds and beetles both get the toxin from a third source, is considered unlikely as the blue-capped ifrit is almost exclusively insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} pheasant {{is a rare}} bird found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of Vietnam and Laos.

5|$|For those reasons, Drusus {{was sent}} to Illyricum with proconsular imperium maius, and would be {{governor}} there from AD 17 to 20. Since Germanicus had left the Rhine in AD 16, the German tribes that formerly fought alongside each other against the Romans had turned on each other. The two major forces in the region, the Marcomanni under king Maroboduus and the Cherusci under Arminius clashed and, after an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew {{to the heart of}} his kingdom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of Bohemia.

One of New Zealand's only two native species of non-marine mammal, the long-tailed bat, lives in small numbers within the forests, and several species of lizard are also found locally, including the southern forest gecko.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Olga {{frequently}} went on hikes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> around Gatchina {{with their}} father, {{who took the}} opportunity to teach them woodsmanship. Physical activities such as equestrianism were also taught at an early age, as was religious observance. Though Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, Lent was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided. Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof Palace and with Michael's grandparents in Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Pennsylvania IBA #33is on the Allegheny Front, {{which is}} along a prime migratory path {{for a variety}} of birds of prey. The golden eagle, bald eagle, osprey, and {{northern}} harrier pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that the bald eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do nest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of the IBA include the northern goshawk, red-shouldered, broad-winged, red-tailed, sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Pisciculture {{has made}} {{significant}} advances in the state. At the end of 2009–10, the state produced a surplus of 104.3 million fish seeds. Rubber and tea are the important cash crops of the state. Tripura ranks second to Kerala {{in the production of}} natural rubber in the country. The state is known for its handicraft, particularly hand-woven cotton fabric, wood carvings, and bamboo products. High quality timber including sal, garjan, teak and gamar are found abundantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> of Tripura. Tata Trusts signed a pact with Government of Tripura in July 2015 to improve fisheries and dairy in the state.|$|E
40|$|Ground beetles {{were studied}} among {{grassland}} — forest edge — beech forest habitats in Hungary, using pitfall traps. We hypothesised that the activity density and species richness of carabids were <b>the</b> highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> edge, <b>the</b> activity density and <b>the</b> number of <b>forest</b> species were decreasing, while the activity density {{and the number}} of generalist species increasing from <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> towards <b>the</b> grassland. Carabid assemblage of the grassland was the most diverse and <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> was <b>the</b> least diverse if measured by Rényi diversity. The average species richness per trap was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grassland and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> edge than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> <b>The</b> number of <b>forest</b> species was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> edge than elsewhere. The number of generalist species was highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grassland and decreased towards <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> <b>The</b> activity density of carabids was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> edge than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grassland. The activity density of forest species was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> edge than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grassland. The activity density of the generalist species was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grassland than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> edge and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> There were seven species characteristic to the grassland as identified by IndVal; two species were characteristic to the edge, and two species were characteristic both to <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and <b>the</b> edge. We found that humidity was <b>the</b> highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest; Pterostichus oblongopunctatus and Molops piceus were associated with <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> habitat, while Abax ater and Pterostichus melanarius were associated with <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> edge according to the RDA.

5|$|The 1895 {{capture of}} the Merina royal capitol, the Rova of Antananarivo, by the French sparked the Menalamba {{rebellion}} against foreigners, Christianity and Merina domination. In the chaotic 1895–97 period, bands of Sakalava, Marofotsy and other bandits engaged in raids to loot cattle and other goods. The Sihanaka were especially hard hit owing to their reputation as a relatively wealthy trading people. Many Sihanaka villagers resorted to sleeping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> and fields to avoid falling victim to nighttime pillage and arson; entire Sihanaka villages were burned.|$|E
