5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the <b>fetus.</b> Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the <b>fetus</b> than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the <b>fetus,</b> leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E

All low-risk <b>fetuses</b> showed a similar pattern to that of normal <b>fetuses</b> of a comparable age: using Western blot analysis, a protein was detected of similar size and abundance to that of normal <b>fetuses</b> (i. e. smaller molecular weight than that of adult muscle); immunocytochemistry showed uniform sarcolemmal staining in <b>fetuses</b> older than 18 weeks gestation and differential staining of myotubes at different stages of development (distinguished by size) in younger <b>fetuses</b> (less than 15 weeks gestation). In contrast, Western blot analysis of high-risk <b>fetuses</b> detected low levels of dystrophin in 4 cases; 7 <b>fetuses</b> had no detectable protein.

Placental insufficiency-induced IUGR was created by exposing pregnant ewes to elevated ambient temperatures during mid-gestation. Treatment groups consisted of control and IUGR <b>fetuses</b> with either surgical sham or AD at 98 days gestational age (dGA; term = 147 dGA), a time-point that precedes IUGR.

Results: The ductus venosus blood flow that was corrected for fetal weight was increased significantly in intrauterine growth-restricted <b>fetuses</b> compared with control <b>fetuses</b> (P= 0); the median values (interquartile range) for comparable ages of gestation was 41. 3 mL/min/kg (range, 26. 2 - 64. 0 mL/min/kg) and 30. 8 mL/min/kg (range, 19. 9 - 42. 8 mL/min/kg), respectively.
