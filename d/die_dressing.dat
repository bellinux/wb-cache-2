50|$|As {{originally}} performed {{solely by}} an individual, {{it was an}} extremely painful method by which to <b>die.</b> <b>Dressed</b> ceremonially, with his sword {{placed in front of}} him and sometimes seated on special cloth, the warrior would prepare for death by writing a death poem. The samurai would open his kimono, take up his wakizashi (short sword), fan, or a tantō and plunge it into his abdomen, making first a left-to-right cut and then a second slightly upward stroke. As the custom evolved, a selected attendant (kaishakunin, his second) stood by, and on the second stroke would perform daki-kubi, where the warrior is all but decapitated leaving only a slight band of flesh attaching the head to the body, so as to not let the head fall off and roll on the ground, which was considered dishonorable in feudal Japan. The act eventually became so highly ritualistic that the samurai would only have to reach for his sword, and his kaishakunin would execute the killing stroke. Later still, there would be no sword, but something like a fan for which the samurai would reach.|$|R

50|$|In another instance, {{relating}} to the monks who refused to wear their habits any longer, Odo said that two monks from Tours were once sent on business outside of the monastery. One of the monks wore his habit and the other dressed like a layperson.

The dying monk was lying prostrate in front of the throne and was asking for help. Benedict then looked at the monk in the lay clothes and said that he did not seem to recognize this monk's habit and that he must have belonged to a different order. Benedict then said he could do nothing, because it was not within his powers to help those of another order or judge their lives. The <b>dying</b> monk <b>dressed</b> in lay clothes then was filled with despair at his doom. The other monk who kept his habit, then took it off and wrapped it around the dying monk, and Benedict then healed the dying monk of his disease.|$|R

It is unclear what happened next, as stories differ. In one scenario, {{he was taken to}} the hospital in Gina Lollabrigida's car and died. Another scenario is that Power <b>died</b> in his <b>dressing</b> room. In order to keep his jaw from dropping, a scarf was put around his neck to [...] "walk" [...] him out of the studio to the car. This was done in part because Mrs. Power was at the hotel and knew nothing about what happened. Ted Richmond gave orders that no press was to be called, and Mrs. Power was not to be called. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Mrs. Power was escorted to the hospital. A memorial service was held on 16 November at US Torrejon Air Force Base.|$|R
40|$|Background: Drug {{reaction}} with eosinophilia {{and systemic}} symptoms (DRESS) is a severe drug reaction which can mimic a viral infection, an autoimmune disease or a neoplastic disease. Aims: To study the clinical and epidemiological aspects of DRESS {{and to identify}} the precipitating drugs. Methods: All patients admitted to the dermatology ward of our tertiary care hospital from 1 st October 2010 to 30 th September 2013 with probable or definite DRESS as per the RegiSCAR scoring system were included in this prospective study. The clinical manifestations observed in the study population were studied and the common offending drugs were identified. Results: During the 3 year study period, 26 patients fulfilled criteria for probable or definite DRESS. In more than 50 % of cases, the culprit drug was phenytoin. Most common symptoms observed were fever, rash and facial edema. Liver {{was the most common}} internal organ affected. Most of the patients responded to withdrawal of the drug and administration of steroids for 3 - 6 weeks. One patient with dapsone-induced <b>DRESS</b> <b>died.</b> Conclusions: Intense facial erythema and edema and an elevated eosinophil count were not found to be bad prognostic factors. In most instances the flare ups {{during the course of the}} disease could be managed with a slower tapering of steroids. More prospective studies on DRESS are required to assess the prognostic factors and to formulate better diagnostic criteria...|$|R

We have previously explored end-of-life choices in Saudi males and found important culture-related differences and that Q-methodology is useful in identifying intraculture, opinion-based groups. Here, we explore Saudi females’ end-of-life choices. Methods: A volunteer sample of 68 females rank-ordered 47 opinion statements on end-of-life issues into a nine-category symmetrical distribution. The ranking scores of the statements were analyzed by averaging analysis and Q-methodology. Results: The {{mean age of the}} females in the sample was 30. 3  years (range, 19 – 55  years). Among them, 51 % reported average religiosity, 78 % reported very good health, 79 % reported very good life quality, and 100 % reported high-school education or more. The extreme five overall priorities were {{to be able to say}} the statement of faith, be at peace with God, die without having the body exposed, maintain dignity, and resolve all conflicts. The extreme five overall dis-priorities were to die in the hospital, <b>die</b> well <b>dressed,</b> be informed about impending death by family/friends rather than doctor, die at peak of life, and not know if one has a fatal illness. Q-methodology identified five opinion-based groups with qualitatively different characteristics: “physical and emotional privacy concerned, family caring” (younger, lower religiosity), “whole person” (higher religiosity), “pain and informational privacy concerned” (lower life quality), “decisional privacy concerned” (older, higher life quality), and “life quantity concerned, family dependent” (high life quality, low life satisfaction). Out of the extreme 14 priorities/dis-priorities for each group, 21 %– 50 % were not represented among the extreme 20 priorities/dis-priorities for the entire sample. Conclusion: Consistent with the previously reported findings in Saudi males, transcendence and dying in the hospital were the extreme end-of-life priority and dis-priority, respectively, in Saudi females. Body modesty was a major overall concern; however, concerns about pain, various types of privacy, and life quantity were variably emphasized by the five opinion-based groups but masked by averaging analysis.

5000|$|The term is {{also used}} to {{describe}} badges, buttons and grander pieces of jewellery containing the heraldic signs of an individual, which were given by that person to friends, followers and distinguished visitors, as well as (in more modest forms) servants. The grandest of these is the livery collar. William, Lord Hastings the favourite of King Edward IV of England had a [...] "Coller of gold of K. Edward's lyverys" [...] valued at the enormous sum of £40 in an inventory of 1489. This would have been similar to the collars worn by Hastings' sister and her husband Sir John Donne in the Donne Triptych by Hans Memling (described in Sir John Donne). Lords gave their servants lead or pewter badges to sew onto their clothes. In the 15th century European royalty sometimes distributed uniform suits of clothes to courtiers, as the House of Fugger, the leading bankers, did to all employees.This practice later contracted to the provision of standardized clothing to male servants, often in a colour-scheme distinctive to a particular family. The term most notably referred to the embroidered coats, waistcoats, knee breeches and stockings in 18th-century style, worn by footmen on formal occasions in grand houses. Plainer clothing in dark colours and without braiding was worn by footmen, chauffeurs and other employees for ordinary duties. For reasons of economy the employment of such servants, and their expensive <b>dress,</b> <b>died</b> out after World War I except in royal households.|$|R
5000|$|John Buddle was {{a member}} of the Sunderland Society, set up to {{investigate}} colliery safety, and in this connection made scientific investigations into mine ventilation and advocated the keeping of proper records. The most important appointment, however, came when Buddle was appointed as General Manager to Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry. Londonderry had married an incredibly wealthy heiress, said to be the wealthiest woman in Britain, Lady Frances Anee Vane Tempest, and thus came to run her Durham collieries [...] Together, Londonderry and Buddle embarked on a project to develop a Port at Seaham, intending to bypass the Tyne and Wear monopolies. The building of the port began in 1828, and would not be finished until fifteen years later, in which the first shipment of coal was sent out on Buddle's personal ship, Lord Seaham. He even saw through much of the development of the town, his influence being so great that, when his sister Ann <b>died,</b> the ships <b>dressed</b> in black and the shops closed as a matter of respect. He also represented the Marquess on the committee of coalowners who regulated the North East coal trade with London. Although he was mostly active in the Great North Coalfield, the records show Buddle took on work all over Britain, including matters in Portugal, South America, Russia and Nova Scotia. Two of his latest colliery appointments were in 1837 when he became the owner of West Towneley Colliery and also the viewer to the Bishop of Durham- a post previously held by his Father.|$|R

5000|$|At {{a prayer}} service for priests in St Peter's Basilica in May 2010, Scicluna {{addressed}} the clerical vocation and said: The child becomes {{the model for}} the disciple who wants to be [...] "great" [...] in the kingdom of heaven.... How many are the sins in the church for arrogance, for insatiable ambition, the tyranny and injustice of those who take advantage of ministry to advance their careers, to show off, for reasons of futile and miserable reasons of vanity! ... Accepting the kingdom of God like a child is to accept with a pure heart, with docility, abandonment, confidence, enthusiasm, and hope. All this reminds us of the child. All this makes the child precious in God's eyes, and in the eyes of a true disciple of Jesus. He went on to quote the gospels on the corruption of the young-"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, {{it would be better for}} him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea" [...] (Mark 9:42)-and then quoted Gregory the Great's exegesis of that verse's meaning for priests: Mystically expressed in the millstone is the hard and tedious rhythm of secular life, while the deep sea signifies the most terrible curse. Thus, after having taken a profession of holiness, anyone who destroys others through words or deed would have been better off if their misdeeds had caused them to <b>die</b> in secular <b>dress,</b> rather than, through their holy office, being imposed as an example for others in their sins. Without a doubt, if they had fallen all by themselves, their suffering in Hell would be easier to bear.|$|R
