60|$|MY DEAR KINNICUM, - I am a {{very bad}} dog, {{but not for the}} first time. Your book, which is very interesting, came duly; and I {{immediately}} got {{a very bad}} cold indeed, and have been fit for nothing whatever. I am a bit better now, and aye on the mend; so I write to tell you, I thought of you on New Year's Day; though, I own, it would have been more decent if I had thought <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to get my letter then. Well, what can't be cured must be endured, Mr. Lawrie; and you must be content with what I give. If I wrote all the letters I ought to write, and at the proper time, I should be very good and very happy; but I doubt if I should do anything else.|$|E

You've already lived a {{thousand}} lifetimes. How could you watch me grow old and die? How can I watch you live and never age a day?" [...] From Ianto's monologue in [...] "The Dead Line" [...] by Phil Ford [...] Three further BBC radio dramas were produced in 2009 for the Afternoon Play slot on Radio 4, each of which feature Ianto Jones. Chronologically, these occur between the second and third televised series but after [...] "Lost Souls". Transmitted in July 2009, the first drama is [...] "Asylum", the second is [...] "Golden Age", and the third is [...] "The Dead Line". [...] "The Dead Line" [...] in particular focuses on Ianto's characterisation, particularly with respect to his relationship with Jack. AfterElton reviewers stated that the radio drama [...] "delivers for Janto portmanteau fans"; David-Lloyd delivers a monologue as Ianto, verbalising his insecurities to a comatose Jack. When Jack awakens from his coma, he promises [...] "You will never be just a blip in time, Ianto Jones." ...|$|E
5000|$|Whether Germain, Howe, and Burgoyne had {{the same}} {{expectations}} about {{the degree to which}} Howe was supposed to support the invasion from Quebec is also unclear. What is clear is that Germain either left his generals with too much latitude, or without a clearly defined overall strategy. In March 1777 Germain had approved of Howe's Philadelphia expedition and did not include any express orders for Howe to go to Albany. Yet Germain also sent Howe a copy of his instructions to Carleton which plainly stated that the northern army was to make a junction with Howe's army at Albany. In a letter from Germain to Howe dated May 18, 1777 he made clear that the Philadelphia expedition should [...] "be executed <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to co-operate with the army ordered to proceed from Canada and put itself under your command." [...] This last letter, however, was not received by Howe until after he had departed New York for the Chesapeake. To attack Philadelphia Howe could either have moved overland through New Jersey or by sea via the Delaware Bay, both options would have kept him a position to aid Burgoyne if necessary. The final route he took, through the Chesapeake Bay, was immensely time-consuming and left him wholly unable to assist Burgoyne as Germain had envisioned. The decision was so difficult to understand that Howe's more hostile critics accused him of deliberate treachery.|$|E

40|$|There's {{two seconds}} left in the {{championship}} game, your team is behind by one point and you are at the free throw line shooting two shots. You're keenly aware of the situation and you, like everyone else in the sold out arena, know how important these two shots are. You can feel your heart pounding and your legs are a little weak as you bounce the ball and prepare for your first shot. You take a last deep breath and push the ball towards the basket. You watch with considerable anxiety as the ball hits the front of the rim and bounces straight up. It comes back down and starts rolling around the rim, finally dropping through. As the ball drops through the hoop you feel a tremendous sense of relief. It's as if all {{the weight of the world}} has been lifted from your shoulders. The ball is passed to you by the referee for your second shot and you step up to the line and dribble the ball. This time, there is no thought of failure, there is no doubt in your mind. You know that you're going to make the shot. You take the last bounce, look to the basket, inhale, feel your knees bend slightly and begin pushing the ball towards the basket. It's effortless and you're in total control, you know before the ball leaves your hand that it's going through without even touching the rim. You feel the excitement as watch the ball spin through the air in slow motion towards it target. The moment almost seems frozen <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Just before your second shot, you entered what athletes refer to as "the zone. " One of the primary roles sport psychologists have, consists of trying to help athletes get into the zone and stay there. To do that, we have to help athletes quiet thought processes. We have to teach them to shut out distractions, to trust their bodies, to simply let themselves perform...|$|E

'And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself--unto death, even {{the death of the}} cross, [where he died for our sins]. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him; and given him a name--above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father' (Phil 2:8-11).

Weber, i. 11-50.) have pictured her, there within the royal tapestries, in bright boudoirs, baths, peignoirs, and the Grand and Little Toilette; {{with a whole}} {{brilliant}} world waiting obsequious on her glance: fair young daughter of Time, what things has <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> store <b>for</b> <b>thee!</b> Like Earth's brightest Appearance, she moves gracefully, environed with the grandeur of Earth: a reality, and yet a magic vision; for, behold, shall not utter Darkness swallow it! The soft young heart adopts orphans, portions meritorious maids, delights to succour the poor,--such poor as come picturesquely in her way; and sets the fashion of doing it; for as was said, Benevolence has now begun reigning. In her Duchess de Polignac, in Princess de Lamballe, she enjoys something almost like friendship; now too, after seven long years, she has a child, and soon even a Dauphin, of her own; can reckon herself, as Queens go, happy in a husband.|$|R
