30|$|The {{industry}} {{definition of}} biostimulants was originally proposed in 2012 and stated: “Plant biostimulants contain substance(s) and/or microorganisms whose function {{when applied to}} plants or the rhizosphere is to stimulate natural processes to enhance/benefit nutrient uptake, nutrient <b>efficiency,</b> <b>tolerance</b> to abiotic stress, and crop quality. Biostimulants have no direct action against pests, and therefore do not fall within the regulatory framework of pesticides”. Biostimulants were loosely defined {{for a long time}} and often regarded dubiously because of their aggregate nature and the inherent difficulty to determine which specific components were making beneficial contributions. The definition proposed by du Jardin [1] “A plant biostimulant is any substance or microorganism applied to plants with the aim to enhance nutrition efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance and/or crop quality traits, regardless of its nutrients content” represents the clearest and most concise way to define biostimulants.|$|E

Constructed wetlands and rainwater harvesting systems are commonly used as on-site water supply systems for distributed adaptation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to build a community water supply model and to evaluate the performance of low impact development (LID) modules as water supply facilities. The community water supply model simulates four water balances, namely, household storage, the constructed wetland, the rainwater harvesting system, and paddy fields. Three performance indicators are utilized, namely, the water saving <b>efficiency,</b> <b>tolerance</b> duration, and water use efficiency. The results show that the rainwater harvesting system saves up to 25. 8 % of the total domestic water demand, and the constructed wetland saves up to 40 % of the irrigation water demand in Xingshi Village, located in northern Taiwan. In conclusion, the constructed wetland and rainwater harvesting system are good candidates for on-site water supply systems at the community scale.

40|$|Exercise is an {{effective}} intervention for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle combines multiple signals contributing to the beneficial effects of exercise on cardiometabolic health. Inorganic nitrate increases exercise <b>efficiency,</b> <b>tolerance</b> and performance. The transcriptional regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor? coactivator 1 ? (PGC 1 ?) coordinates the exercise-stimulated skeletal muscle fiber-type switch from glycolytic fast-twitch (type IIb) to oxidative slow-twitch (type I) and intermediate (type IIa) fibers; an effect reversed in insulin resistance and diabetes. We find that nitrate induces PGC 1 ? expression and a switch towards type I and IIa fibers in rat muscle and myotubes in vitro. Nitrate induces the release of exercise/PGC 1 ?-dependent myokine FNDC 5 /irisin, and ?-aminoisobutyric acid from myotubes, and muscle in rats and humans. Both exercise and nitrate stimulated, PGC 1 ?-mediated, ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) secretion from muscle. Circulating GABA concentrations were increased in exercising mice and nitrate-treated rats and humans, thus, GABA may function as an exercise/PGC 1 ?-mediated myokine-like small molecule. Moreover, nitrate increased circulating growth hormone levels in humans and rodents. Nitrate induces physiological responses that mimic exercise training and may underlie the beneficial effects of this metabolite on exercise and cardiometabolic health...|$|E

However, if memory chip contents survives power-off, e. g., via freezing DRAM chips, sensitive data such as passwords and keys can be extracted. Main memory persistence {{will soon be}} the norm as recent advancements in MRAM and FeRAM position non-volatile memory technologies for widespread deployment in laptop, desktop, and embedded system main memory. Unfortunately, the same properties that provide energy <b>efficiency,</b> <b>tolerance</b> against power failure, and “instant-on ” powerup also subject systems to offline memory scanning. In this paper, we propose a Memory Encryption Control Unit (MECU) that provides memory confidentiality during system suspend and across reboots. The MECU encrypts all memory transfers between the processor-local level 2 cache and main memory to ensure plaintext data is never written to the persistent medium. The MECU design is outlined and performance and security trade-offs considered. We evaluate a MECU-enhanced architecture using the SimpleScalar hardware simulation framework on several hardware benchmarks. This analysis shows the majority of memory accesses are delayed by less than 1 ns, with higher access latencies (caused by resume state reconstruction) subsiding within 0. 25 seconds of a system resume. In effect, the MECU provides zero-cost steady state memory confidentiality for non-volatile main memory. ...|$|E
40|$|Non-volatile {{memories}} provide energy <b>efficiency,</b> <b>tolerance</b> against power failure, and “instant-on” power-up. These {{memories are}} likely to replace traditional volatile memory in next-generation laptops and desktops. However, the move to non-volatile memory introduces new vulnerabilities; sensitive data such as passwords and keys residing in main memory persists across reboots and can be probed during hardware suspension. In this paper, we propose a Memory Encryption Control Unit (MECU) to address the vulnerabilities introduced by non-volatile memories. The MECU encrypts all memory transfers between the level 2 cache and main memory. The keys used to encrypt memory blocks are derived from secret information present on removable authentication tokens, e. g., smart card, or other similar secure storage devices. This provides protection against physical attacks in absence of the token. A MECU design is outlined and performance, memory, and security trade-offs considered. We evaluate a MECU-enhanced architecture using the SimpleScalar hardware simulation framework on several hardware benchmarks. The performance analysis shows that we can secure non-volatile memories with minimal overhead—the majority of memory accesses are delayed by less than 1 ns, with limited degradation subsiding within 67 µs of a system resume. In effect, we provide zero-cost steady state confidentiality for main memory. ...|$|E
40|$|Further {{improvements}} on {{the novel}} method for state of charge (SOC) determination of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells based on the impedance spectra classification are presented. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to impedance spectra of a LFP cell, with each impedance spectrum representing a distinct SOC for a predefined temperature. As a SVM is a binary classifier, only the distinction between two SOC can be computed in one iteration of the algorithm. Therefore a search pattern is necessary. A balanced tree search was implemented with good results. In order to further improvements of the SVM method, this paper discusses two new search pattern, namely a linear search and an imbalanced tree search, the later one based on an initial educated guess. All three search pattern were compared under various aspects like accuracy, <b>efficiency,</b> <b>tolerance</b> of disturbances and temperature dependancy. The imbalanced search tree shows {{to be the most}} efficient search pattern if the initial guess is within less than ± 5  % SOC of the original SOC in both directions and exhibits the best tolerance for high disturbances. Linear search improves the rate of exact classifications for almost every temperature. It also improves the robustness against high disturbances and can even detect a certain number of false classifications which makes this search pattern unique. The downside is a much lower efficiency as all impedance spectra have to be evaluated while the tree search pattern only evaluate those on the tree path...|$|E

The use of biostimulants is proposed as an advanced solution to face the demand for sustainable agriculture by ensuring optimal crop performances and better resilience to environment changes. The proposed approach is to predict and characterize the function of natural compounds as biostimulants. In this research, plant growth assessments and transcriptomic approaches are combined to investigate and understand the specific mode(s) of action of APR, a new product provided by the ILSA group (Arzignano, Vicenza). Maize seedlings (B 73) were kept in a climatic chamber and grown in a solid medium to test the effects of two different combinations of the protein hydrolysate APR (A 1 and A 1 / 2). Data on root growth evidenced a significant enhancement of the dry weight of both roots and root/shoot ratio in response to APR. Transcriptomic profiles of lateral roots of maize seedlings treated with two increasing concentrations of APR were studied by mRNA-sequencing analysis (RNA-seq). Pairwise comparisons of the RNA-seq data identified a total of 1006 differentially expressed genes between treated and control plants. The two APR concentrations were demonstrated to affect the expression of genes involved in both common and specific pathways. On the basis of the putative function of the isolated differentially expressed genes, APR has been proposed to enhance plant response to adverse environmental conditions...|$|E
30|$|Introduction Fluid {{overload}} in septic {{intensive care}} unit patients is common, and recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} it is strongly associated with a poor outcome. In fact, we think that fluid overload is mainly the reflection of the intensity of capillary leak. Capillary leak is a determining factor of shock in sepsis, leading to hypovolemia and microcirculation alteration. Thus, hypovolemia and edema are the two faces of one pathophysiologic change in wall of microvessels, i.e., capillary permeability. Unfortunately, no treatment is capable of decreasing vascular permeability in sepsis at present. Fluid replacement appears to be a poor symptomatic treatment, compensating only the leak flow and fueling formation of edema in the more elastic body tissues. Here, we propose an original therapeutic approach aiming to limit capillary leak in septic shock by means of total body contention. The principle of this method is to antagonize the distension of soft tissues of the trunk and limbs, which allows capillary fluid leak to continue. Subcutaneous tissue being by definition extensible (such as the cutaneous envelope), the volume they can “accept” can grow without a dramatic increase in pressure in the interstitial space. In this way, the pressure gradient stays favorable for the leak from vascular to interstitial compartments, despite the presence of edema. We hypothesize that capillary leak in septic shock can be quantitatively contained by limiting soft tissue extension at the onset of disease, using contention bandages on {{a large proportion of the}} body surface. The objective of this study is to evaluate the <b>efficiency,</b> <b>tolerance</b> and feasibility of a new mechanistic treatment based on this hypothesis.|$|E
40|$|Salinity {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} problem limiting crop yield, {{particularly in}} arid and semi-arid regions where cereal production is common. Water and mineral nutrient uptakes in plants are affected by salt stress, and consequently, plant growth rate is reduced. In arid and semi-arid regions, zinc (Zn) deficiency is also a common constraint to crop production. Among number of solutions to these problems, selection of new genotypes with high tolerance to salt toxicity and Zn deficiency is the most sustainable and widely accepted approach. It {{is well known that}} the cultivated (modern) wheat has less genetic variation for a given trait than the wild or primitive wheats. Aegilops tauschii is a wild relative of wheat and the D-genome donor of wheat. In the present MSc study, salt tolerance and Zn <b>efficiency</b> (<b>tolerance</b> to Zn deficiency) of different Aegilops tauschii genotypes and modern wheat cultivars were investigated to identify and characterize the salt tolerant and Zn-efficient genotypes. Experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions by growing 116 Aegilops tauschii genotypes and 28 cultivated (modern) wheat cultivars at different levels of salt and Zn treatments. Genotypes were tested for severity of leaf symptoms, shoot dry weight, shoot Na, K, Ca and Zn concentrations, and ratios of K/Na and Ca/Na in shoot to determine physiological parameters associated with salt tolerance of genotypes. There was a large genetic variation in tolerance to NaCl toxicity among Aegilops tauschii genotypes based on the severity of leaf symptoms (leaf chlorosis and necrosis) and decreases in shoot dry matter production. This genetic variation has been evaluated and discussed in relation to the shoot concentrations of Na, K, and Ca and K/Na and Ca/Na ratios of the genotypes. The results indicated that K/Na and Ca/Na ratios are very important parameters involved in differential expression of high salt tolerance among Aegilops tauschii genotypes. The Aegilops tauschii genotypes tested for salt tolerance was also examined for their Zn deficiency tolerance. The results obtained showed existence of a marked genetic variation in tolerance to Zn deficiency among the Aegilops tauschii genotypes. The selected genotypes for differential tolerance to Zn deficiency have been characterized for shoot concentrations of Zn, Na, K, Ca and P and also for dry matter production and seed concentrations of Zn. Adequate Zn supply was affective in reducing Na concentrations and increasing K/Na ratio of plants. The results of this thesis revealed new Aegilops tauschii genotypes with very high tolerance to both Zn deficiency and NaCl toxicity. These genotypes have been recommended for exploitation in future breeding programmes...|$|E
