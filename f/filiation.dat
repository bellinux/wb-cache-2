5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where the legitimacy of the new king rests mainly on his <b>filiation.</b> These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than both Neferefre and Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose <b>filiation</b> {{is suggested by the}} fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E
25|$|Adoption is {{a process}} whereby a person assumes the {{parenting}} of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with <b>filiation,</b> from the biological parent or parents.

40|$|When {{proposing to}} surpass the {{political}} alternative family-individual, the author underlines that {{the variety of}} contemporary families becomes comprehensible only if analyzed {{in the context of}} big structural, political and cultural evolutions that affects the entire society. With contemporary conjugality turning more and more contractual, privatized but also more unstable, the link of <b>filiations</b> goes the other way around, turning more unconditional. Hence, the author introduces three important aspects concerning the family institution nowadays. The first is connected to the increasing number of mixed couples. The second aspect is linked to an ever increasing life expectancy. Lastly, the third concerns the diversification of <b>filiations</b> by means of adoption, family reorganizations, and medically assisted conception...|$|R
25|$|Two further sons of Neferefre and Khentkaus III {{have been}} {{proposed}} by Verner: the king's son Nakhtsare, whose <b>filiation</b> {{is supported by the}} general date and location of his tomb, and Kakaibaef, a member of the elite buried in Abusir. Krejčí notes the lack of king's son title in relation to Kakaibaef however, thereby emphasizing the conjectural nature of Verner's assertion.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{guardianship}} {{or other}} systems {{designed for the}} care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption; where others have tried to achieve adoption through less formal means, notably via contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of <b>filiation.</b> Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations.|$|E
25|$|Even though Isesi-ankh {{bore the}} title of King's son, the Egyptologists Michel Baud and Bettina Schmitz have shown that this <b>filiation</b> was {{probably}} fictitious, being used only as an honorary title. In particular, inscriptions found on the construction blocks of his mastaba give one of his titles as Seal bearer of the king Isesi ankh, while Baud argues that had he really been {{the son of a}} king, this title would have been Seal bearer of the king, king's son, Isesi ankh. Consequently, Isesi-ankh's father was likely not Djedkare Isesi.|$|E

25|$|Ishme-Dagan II (c. 1526 BC – c. 1510 BC), son and {{successor}} of Shamshi-Adad II, was {{a rather}} obscure ruler of Assyria {{in the midst of}} a dark age. He is only known from the Assyrian King List. The relationship with his successor is uncertain as the copies describe Shamshi-Adad III’s father as Ishme-Dagan II, the brother of Sharma-Adad II, who was in turn the son of Shu-Ninua. This Ishme-Dagan, however, has his <b>filiation</b> clearly given as son of Shamshi-Adad II. This led Yamada to suggest that Shamshi-Adad III’s father was a different homonymous individual from a collateral line of descent from Shu-Ninua.|$|E
25|$|Furius was {{a member}} of the patrician gens Furia, an ancient and noble house at Rome. Many members of his gens had {{previously}} held the highest offices of the state, most famously Marcus Furius Camillus. However, the branch or stirps of the family known as the Furii Phili had not previously held any curule magistracies. From his <b>filiation,</b> we know that Publius' father was named Spurius and his grandfather Marcus, but nothing is known of them. Publius had a son, likewise named Publius, who was a young man at the time of his father's death. It is not known how they were related to the later Furii Phili.|$|E

25|$|This {{branch of}} the family was {{maintained}} in their nobility by judgments dated 3 September 1666, by Mr. Dupuy (or du Puy), subdelegate of Claude Pellot, Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, 20 June 1696 by Claude Bazin de Bezons, also the Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, and, lastly by a judgment of the Conseil d'État rendered 29 June 1787 {{in the presence of}} the King. These three judgments leave no doubt about the origins of the branch, in that the family's nobility and <b>filiation</b> was legally established going back to Jean de Forcade, who was qualified as noble, Squire and Governor of the Château d'Auvillar in his marriage contract dated 29 April 1554. The 3 September 1666 judgment further confirms that Philippe de La Forcade, sieur de La Prade, was a squire, a captain in the infantry, that his father had been one of the Henry IV of France's bodyguards, that his grandfather had been Governor of the Château d'Auvillar and that they descended from the noble house of Forcade in Orthez, in Béarn.|$|E
500|$|Several {{daughters of}} Djedkare Isesi have been {{identified}} by the title of [...] "king's daughter of his body" [...] and the general date of their tomb. These include Kekheretnebti, whose <b>filiation</b> is clearly indicated by her other title of [...] "Beloved of Isesi", Meret-Isesi, Hedjetnebu, and Nebtyemneferes. Less certain is the <b>filiation</b> of Kentkhaus III, wife of vizier Senedjemib Mehi, who bore the title of [...] "king's daughter of his body". It is debated whether this title indicates a true <b>filiation</b> {{or if it is}} only honorary.|$|E
500|$|Finally, the {{successor}} of Djedkare, Unas, {{is thought to}} have been his son in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question. The main argument in favor of this <b>filiation</b> is that the succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth, as suggested indirectly, for example, by the Abusir papyri. Indirect evidence also comes from the reliefs of Unas' causeway, which show many officials bearing names incorporating [...] "Isesi", suggesting at the very least that Unas did not perceive Djedkare as an antagonist.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} colonial legacies traversing understandings of indigenous languages and their “revitalisation” in Colombia, arguing that neither language theories nor policies escape power-knowledge relations. It shows how alphabets and grammars have operated as colonial normalising technologies and defined indigenous languages as “illiterate” or “incomplete” languages, {{forcing them to}} adjust to foreign models and justifying the intervention of colonisers, missionaries and academic experts (who sought to “transform” indigenous languages into “complete” grammatical and alphabetical languages). It examines the asymmetrical clashes regarding the validation of “expert knowledge” over indigenous knowledge practices. Additionally, it acknowledges the contributions of postcolonial, decolonial, ecological, critical and cultural theories for decentring alphabetical, grammatical and monolingual normalisations and relocating indigenous languages in complex (non-anthropocentric) relations and community <b>filiations.</b> This research proposes a comprehensive “(po) ethical” approach that dialogues with indigenous language practices in their poetical, ethical and political dimensions. This has three important effects. Firstly, it challenges reductive models of literacy and grammaticality, consolidated since the colonial encounter. Secondly, it highlights the deep articulation of indigenous language practices with the recreation of traditions and community <b>filiations.</b> Thirdly, it redefines “revitalisation” as a process that goes beyond linguistics insofar as, conceived otherwise, it challenges colonial epistemic violence, rebuilds community <b>filiations,</b> and enables healing. (Po) ethical practices are agonistic. They emerge from {{the pain of the}} conflicts, historical conditions and violent asymmetries that are inscribed in the bodies and the languages we inhabit. In contrast to colonial technologies and policies of multiculturalism, (po) ethical practices do not pursue the elimination or assimilation of difference. Through agonistic translations, they acknowledge and connect creative processes of resistance and healing, allowing dialogue between adversaries instead of “eradicating conflict” by eliminating difference. The research stresses the local and global potential of agonistic translations of (po) ethical language practices in challenging coloniality and rebuilding communities...|$|R

500|$|A high {{official}} named Isesi-ankh {{could have}} been yet another son of Djedkare Isesi, as suggested by his name meaning [...] "Isesi lives". Yet, similarities in the titles and locations of the tombs of Isesi-ankh and Kaemtjenent have led Egyptologists to propose that they could instead be brothers and sons of Meresankh IV, or that the former is a son of the latter. Even though Isesi-ankh bore the title of [...] "king's son", the Egyptologists Michel Baud and Bettina Schmitz argue that this <b>filiation</b> was fictitious, being only an honorary title.|$|E
500|$|Unas had {{at least}} two queens, Nebet and Khenut, who were buried in a large double mastaba {{adjacent}} to their husband's pyramid.
