5|$|She {{was fitted}} {{out over the}} {{remainder}} of late 1892 and early 1893. Electric lighting was used, and she was elegantly furnished. Her grand saloon and skylighted promenade deck contained several fountains and a large aquarium filled with trout and other fish of the lakes. The cabins and public spaces were fitted out with oak paneling, velvet carpets, <b>etched</b> <b>glass</b> windows, leather furniture and marble. Shops and restaurants were provided for the passengers.|$|E
50|$|Bifluoride is an {{inorganic}} anion {{with the}} chemical formula HF (also written HF2−). It contributes no color to bifluoride salts. Salts of bifluoride {{are used to}} <b>etch</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R

5|$|To {{the right}} of the centre room are two small {{exhibition}} rooms entered through a screen with two further <b>etched</b> <b>glass</b> windows by Lord, of summer and spring. The first chamber, to the left and the smallest (the counterpart of the chapel of St Padarn), is Sulien’s room, which has an incised slate floor slab and lettered text around wall from the Elegy of Rhygyfarch, both by Ieuan Rees.|$|E
5|$|There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th {{floor with}} oak paneling, {{and an old}} English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main dining room, located on the 67th floor, was {{connected}} to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and <b>etched</b> <b>glass</b> appliques in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the roof, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side. It is believed that the dining room was a reference for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms. The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through <b>etched</b> <b>glass</b> panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{fluoride}} is {{the chemical}} compound with the formula KF. After hydrogen fluoride, KF {{is the primary}} source of the fluoride ion for applications in manufacturing and in chemistry. It is an alkali halide and occurs naturally as the rare mineral carobbiite. Solutions of KF will <b>etch</b> <b>glass</b> due to the formation of soluble fluorosilicates, although HF is more effective.|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} {{also has}} applications in cleaning, {{capitalizing on the}} affinity of fluoride for iron and silicon oxides. For example, formulations of sodium bifluoride are used for cleaning brick, stone, ceramics, and masonry. It {{is also used to}} <b>etch</b> <b>glass.</b> Another application of sodium bifluoride is in the chemical industry. Other applications of the compound involve the galvanization of baths and pest control. Sodium bifluoride's biological applications include the preservation of zoological and anatomical samples.|$|R
25|$|In metalworking, {{hydrofluoric}} acid {{is used as}} a pickling agent to remove oxides and other impurities from stainless and carbon steels because of its limited ability to dissolve steel. It is used in the semiconductor industry as a major component of Wright Etch and buffered oxide etch, which are used to clean silicon wafers. In a similar manner it is also used to <b>etch</b> <b>glass</b> by reacting with silicon dioxide to form gaseous or water-soluble silicon fluorides. It {{can also be used to}} polish and frost glass.|$|R

25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW {{in early}} October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million {{constructing}} and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration {{was designed to}} mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the game trophies (some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt). Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location, however. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 at tables and in booths. The booths had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by <b>etched</b> <b>glass</b> dividers. The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the curtains of lace. An oyster bar {{was added to the}} rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system. Gas lamps were used in the main bar and booth area. A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining ambience of any restaurant in the city.|$|E

The screen {{contains}} lines from the poetry of Dafydd ap Gwilym, who is {{regarded as one of}} the leading Welsh poets and amongst the great poets of Europe in the Middle Ages. Dafydd ap Gwilym wrote his famous poem [...] "The Girls of Llanbadarn" [...] ("Merched Llanbadarn") about the church in the mid-fourteenth century. There is a ceramic coat of arms set into the screen on the right-hand side, with the motto [...] "Gorau Gorchwyl Gwarchod" [...] ("Best reference for protection").|$|E
500|$|The National Trust for Historic Preservation {{designated}} the building an endangered historic site in 2003, the only synagogue on the list. It still retained {{a number of}} significant architectural features, including [...] "the ornate ark and pulpit, central bimah (reader's platform) with <b>etched</b> <b>glass</b> lamps, cantilevered balconies, Gothic vaulted ceiling, and colorful wall paintings"; the lighting included [...] "converted gas fixtures". Features retained from the original construction included Gothic Revival style woodwork and cast-iron railing that follows the lot line, and the original wooden pews. That same year Oshry died. His successor [...] designated by Oshry himself [...] was his son-in-law, Rabbi Mendl Greenbaum.|$|E
50|$|On September 27, 2012 {{workers at}} the Hube Global plant in Gumi were {{unloading}} hydrofluoric acid (HF) from a tanker when an explosion occurred causing about 8 tonnes of the acid to leak into the surrounding area. The leak caused 5 deaths initially and prompted 4,260 people to seek medical attention at local hospitals. Local rice and grape crops were ruined because the acid caused them to wither. Approximately 3,200 livestock were exposed. The acid, which can <b>etch</b> <b>glass</b> and {{is used in the}} electronics industry, caused damage to at least 1,000 vehicles. Total damage costs as of October 10, 2012 were about 16 million USD.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this initial}} phase of work, two methods of {{backside}} wafer thinning using ICP plasma etching of two-inch SiC substrates have been considered. Plasma processes were optimized for non-bonded and bonded wafers. The non-bonded process {{was used to}} etch 250 µm thick substrates to a final thickness of 100 µm. The bonded process was used to <b>etch</b> <b>glass</b> bonded SiC substrates mechanically ground to 130 µm thick and plasma etched to a final thickness of 100 µm. Etch rate measurements and surface analysis were performed using a profilometer and white light interferometry. Etch rates of 3. 4 µm/min were achieved for the bonded process and 2. 0 µm/min for the non-bonded process. The surface morphology for the non-bonded process was {{three to four times}} lower than the bonded process. The part mechanically ground samples showed evidence of surface damage from the grinding process after plasma etching...|$|R

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} stricter interpretations {{and provide a}} way for women to see, many synagogues will make an opaque wall that is 3–4 feet high and add a lattice, screen, one-way glass, or other semi-transparent material above that opaque wall. [...] The design shown above {{is an example of}} that design: [...] the <b>etched</b> <b>glass</b> is semi-transparent, while the opaque wall adheres to what the synagogue requires as the minimum height requirement. [...] A similar design is in the Or Torah synagogue in Skokie, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|Old Ebbitt Grill {{has four}} bars: [...] the Old Bar (which {{is part of}} the Main Dining Room, and {{features}} the mounted game trophies), the Oyster Bar (to the right of the entry foyer), Grant's Bar (toward the rear of the restaurant, adjacent to the Atrium Dining Room), and the Corner Bar (up the short steps and {{to the left of the}} entry foyer, along G Street NW). The <b>etched</b> <b>glass</b> panels separating the Old Bar from the Main Dining Room were created by Charles Shefts. Grant's Bar, named for American Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant, features a ceiling mural by Carol Loeb. An oil painting by Peter Egeli replicates one of Mathew Brady's famous Civil War photographs of Grant.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, a {{combination}} of cultural, linguistic, and artistic revivals, along with scholarly interest [...] and the continuing fascination and support of an educated and empathetic public, led to a renewal and extension of this artistic tradition. In 1938 the United States Forest Service began a program to reconstruct and preserve the old poles, salvaging about 200, roughly one-third of those known to be standing {{at the end of}} the 19th century. With renewed interest in Native arts and traditions in the 1960s and 1970s, freshly carved totem poles were erected up and down the coast, while related artistic production was introduced in many new and traditional media, ranging from tourist trinkets to masterful works in wood, stone, blown and <b>etched</b> <b>glass,</b> and other traditional and non-traditional media.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To improve ion {{mobility}} {{in solid}} inorganic electrolyte for lithium ion battery, the hybrid electrolytes {{were developed in}} the form of the organic-inorganic meso-scale hybridization by the infiltration of liquid electrolyte into meso-porous inorganic glass membrane. Glass electrolyte membranes with nanopores were prepared by spinodal decomposition and subsequent acid leaching. The most suitable glass electrolyte membranes could be fabricated from the 7. 5 Na 2 O- 46. 25 B 2 O 3 - 46. 25 SiO 2 (mol%). The effect of leaching temperature, leaching time and leaching acids on the preparation of the membranes were investigated. The microstructure of the cross-section of 7. 5 Na 2 O- 46. 25 B 2 O 3 - 46. 25 SiO 2 glass electrolytes were examined with a scanning electron microscope. Then, liquid electrolyte was infiltrated by dipping method into <b>etched</b> <b>glasses</b> electrolyte. Full cells were fabricated by LiCoO 2 for cathode materials and MCMB for anode materials. Conductivity and charge-discharge test of the porous glass electrolyte membrane was measured...|$|R
