Characteristics of floats and interviews with fishermen suggest two main causes of float loss.

Second, the difficulty with which floats are inserted on the <b>float</b> <b>rope</b> of the nets when they are used near the surface. Floats are inserted to replace damaged or lost floats, {{or they may be}} removed if it is desired that the nets be used in deeper waters. Floats may thus be poorly fixed to the cables and lost.

50|$|A small anchor {{can be used}} {{to allow}} the crew of the dinghy to fish or rest. Dinghy anchors are usually either a {{mushroom}} shape, a small folding grapple hook or the more modern and efficient Danforth type, with <b>floating</b> <b>rope</b> that will avoid being cut by snags on the bottom. The mushroom is used in locations where the bottom is very muddy, while the grapple works better in rocks. Some persons prefer a small Danforth or plow,because of their superior holding power in all but rocks, but these have sharp edges, and need to be set with a little care. Even a dinghy should have a length of chain attached to the anchor - the same length as the dinghy. The warp then attaches to the short chain with a wired shackle. This gives added weight and help in setting an anchor. It also stops the warp fraying on sharp rocks when the dinghy swings to and fro with the tide. Generally an anchor warp should be 4 times the depth of the water. In strong winds this can be extended to 8 times the depth but most dinghies are not seaworthy enough to be anchored securely in such storm conditions.|$|R

In this paper we compare the catches made at eight experimental <b>floating</b> FADs (polypropylene <b>ropes</b> frayed at the ends) with those obtained at eight traditional FADs in the Gulf of Castellammare. A total of 672 samples were collected during summer and autumn in 1995 and 1996 at the 16 FADs using a surrounding net. Visual observations of fishes associated with the FADs were also conducted to obtain qualitative information about the spatial distribution of species. A total of 1632 specimens weighing 144 kg and belonging to eight species were caught during the survey. Seriola dumerili, Caranx crysos, C. rhonchus and Coryphaena hippurus were the most frequent and abundant species accounting for 96 % of the total catch. Average fish abundance and weight, characterised by high variance, were significantly higher at the sites with experimental FADs than at the sites with traditional FADs.

40|$|Many marine {{renewable}} energy (MRE) conversion systems including wave, floating wind, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) and some tidal energy devices, are moored in place. The choice of mooring system is critical as it directly affects installation, energy take-off, {{and long term}} reliability, and hence has a significant influence on costs. Installation has been estimated to account for 27 % of lifetime cost for a tidal turbine [1]. This {{is an area where}} the other marine industries, notably offshore oil and gas, have extensive experience, but the high energy regions in which MRE devices are deployed pose particular installation difficulties and operating conditions. There has been a strong movement towards replacing steel with synthetic fiber ropes offshore in recent years, particularly in deep water off Brazil and in the Gulf of Mexico [2, 3]. Lightweight materials can simplify handling and reduce vessel and crane size {{but this is not the}} prime mover towards synthetic fiber moorings for marine energy. The main arguments are the possibility to adapt the mooring to the large movements of <b>floating</b> devices, using <b>rope</b> compliance to reduce peak loads while minimizing energy loss, and reduced cost. This requires both a detailed knowledge of the material options and design tools which can optimize stiffness, strength, damping and long term behavior.

40|$|Sixty {{kilometers}} of outer coast beaches at 25 locations in Alaska were surveyed from 1982 to 1988 to determine distribution, composition, quantity, deposition, and source of plastic debris washed ashore. Approximately 67 % of all plastic debris found was fishing gear (e. g., net fragments, <b>rope,</b> <b>floats)</b> and 33 % was packaging material (e. g., plastic bags, bottles). Debris found which could entangle marine mammals, seabirds, and fish included trawl web, rope, packing straps, and monofilament gillnet. Monofilament gillnet was not abundant (usually < 5 pieces/km) on beaches, but trawl web {{was found on}} beaches throughout Alaska and exceeded 10 fragments/km at more than 50 % of the locations sampled. Foreign fisheries were the source of most (98 %) of the monofilament gillnet washed ashore; the source of trawl web is shifting from foreign to domestic fisheries. Trends in composition and abundance of plastic debris were monitored at three sites: Amchitka Island, Middleton Island, and Yakutat. Amchitka Island had similar quantities (- 300 items/km) of total plastics in 1982 and 1987, although the amount of trawl web at this site continued to increase. Quantities of plastic debris on Middleton Island remained similar from 1984 to 1987 (average 860 items/km), {{with the exception of}} an approximate 33 % decline in 1985 from the 4 -year average. Near Yakutat, the quantity of trawl web deposited ashore increased from 8. 8 to 10. 1 fragments/km/year from 1985 to 1988.

40|$|Recently, lake {{eutrophication}} {{has become}} a serious concern and its causes and controls have attracted growing attention worldwide. In the experiments described here, we have used Ipomoea aquatica as an experimental plant for use with ecological floating beds. Three kinds of combined ecological floating bed systems were constructed by hanging two kinds of rope (hemp and PST) below the beds, and their effectiveness for improving water quality was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} plant ecological <b>floating</b> bed, plant-PST- <b>rope</b> combined bed, and plant-hemp-rope combined bed provided significant removal effects on TN, NH 4 +-N, TP and DIP. Removal efficiencies were 39. 09 %, 49. 46 % and 60. 43 %, 44 % 55 %, 67. 79 %and 70. 05 %, 63. 68 %, 54. 72 % and 71. 70 %, and 53. 70 %, 50. 62 % and 64. 20 %, respectively. The plant-hemp-rope combined floating bed had especially high N and P removal rates. In the three kinds of ecological floating beds, the contributions of plant absorption to N and P removal were 36. 13 % and 71. 85 %, 32. 15 % and 87. 07 %, 27. 11 % and 74. 34 %, respectively. This suggested that for N removal in the system, plant uptake accounted for a relatively small portion of total absorption, and that denitrification by microorganisms might play a more important role. However, plant uptake took the leading role in P removal in all three kinds of floating beds. Therefore, the combined ecological floating bed having both ropes and plants was an effective way for improving the quality of eutrophic water...|$|R
60|$|The ground fell almost sheer {{six hundred}} {{feet to the}} flat bottom of the valley. Beneath, the Tugela curled along like a brown and very sinuous serpent. Never have I seen such violent twists and bends in a river. At times the waters seemed to loop back on themselves. One great loop bent towards us, and at the arch of this the little ferry of Potgieter's <b>floated,</b> moored to <b>ropes</b> which looked through the field glasses like a spider's web. The ford, {{approached}} by roads cut down through the steep bank, was beside it, but closed {{for the time being}} by the flood. The loop of river enclosed a great tongue of land which jutted from the hills on the enemy's side almost to our feet. A thousand yards from the tip of this tongue rose a line of low kopjes crowned with reddish stones. The whole tongue was virtually ours. Our guns on the heights or on the bank could sweep it from flank to flank, enfilade and cross fire. Therefore the passage of the river was assured. We had obtained what amounted to a practical bridgehead, and could cross whenever we thought fit. But the explanation of many things lay beyond. At the base of the tongue, where it sprang from the Boer side of the valley, the ground rose in a series of gentle grassy slopes to a long horseshoe of hills, and along this, both flanks resting securely on unfordable reaches of the river, out of range from our heights of any but the heaviest guns, approachable by a smooth grass glacis, which was exposed to two or three tiers of cross-fire and converging fire, ran the enemy's position.

40|$|Non-indigenous {{marine species}} {{are a major}} threat to marine environments and economies globally. This thesis {{examines}} whether management of pest organisms post-border (i. e, after they have established in New Zealand) is feasible in the marine environment, using the non-indigenous Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida as a model organism. Background information on Undaria in Chapter 2 recognises the paucity of information on Undaria's impacts. Hence, Chapter 3 investigates ecological effects from Undaria in a low shore rocky habitat. Although negligible effects were described, the uncertainty in extrapolating findings to other places and times means that the precautionary principle should be applied by managers, and 'worst-case' impacts assumed. Chapter 4 investigates mechanisms for Undaria's natural dispersal, and describes strategies based on spore release and sporophyte drift that may lead to spread over scales of metres to kilometres. This work highlights the importance of human transport vectors (especially vessels and aquaculture) in the post-border spread of Undaria at regional and national scales. Hence, a case study in Chapter 5 describes aquaculture activities that could be vectors for spread of Undaria in New Zealand, and presents criteria for identifying present and future high risk pathways. Chapters 6 and 7 describe methods to reduce the accidental transport of Undaria and other biofouling pests with aquaculture, with a focus on mussel farming. Treatments based on water blasting, air drying and freshwater immersion provide low cost options for equipment such as <b>floats</b> and <b>rope.</b> For treatment of mussel seed-stock, immersion in dilute (4 %) acetic acid (the active ingredient in vinegar) is identified as a method that could eliminate Undaria and other soft-bodied fouling organisms without resulting in an unacceptable level of mussel mortality. Chapter 8 proposes a risk-based framework for setting post-border management priorities based on the feasibility, benefits and costs of risk reduction. This chapter elucidates how knowledge generated from research in Chapters 2 - 7 {{can be used in a}} biosecurity risk management context. It shows that effective management post-border is possible even when pest organisms become relatively well established, and that the benefits gained from even limited successes have the potential to greatly outweigh the consequences of uncontrolled invasion. However, as unwanted species become increasingly widespread, management will become increasingly focussed on the protection of specific values. Chapter 9 extends some of the ideas proposed in Chapter 8, and considers a broad postborder management framework for marine pests. A comprehensive system should consist of vector management, surveillance, and incursion response that targets particular pests or suites of functionally similar species (e. g., biofouling organisms), coupled with generic vector management approaches that aim to reduce humanmediated transport of all organisms at a national scale. New Zealand's geographic isolation and low population, hence relatively low level of vector activity, makes the management of human-mediated pathways of spread entirely feasible in many circumstances. Hence, while there are clearly many challenges in the post-border management of marine pests, this is nonetheless a realistic goal, and probably moreso in New Zealand than in any other country in the world...|$|R
