25|$|American <b>immigration</b> <b>history</b> can {{be viewed}} in four epochs: the colonial period, the mid-19th century, {{the start of the}} 20th century, and post-1965. Each period brought {{distinct}} national groups, races and ethnicities to the United States. During the 17th century, approximately 400,000 English people migrated to Colonial America. Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as indentured servants. The mid-19th century saw mainly an influx from northern Europe; the early 20th-century mainly from Southern and Eastern Europe; post-1965 mostly from Latin America and Asia.|$|E

25|$|The {{value of}} Riis's {{autobiography}} {{lies in the}} description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers’ quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes about self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, The Making of an American remains useful as a source for students of <b>immigration</b> <b>history</b> and sociology who {{want to learn more about}} the author of How The Other Half Lives and the social reform movement that he helped to define.|$|E

30|$|As {{part of my}} Ph.D., the {{hypotheses}} developed in this paper {{are by no means}} final claims. Instead, they will hopefully serve as starting points for further discussions about and refinement of migration policy theory. Given that one out of two international migrants live in countries that have been omitted by immigration policy theories so far, I believe it is paramount to analyze and bring to the fore the <b>immigration</b> <b>histories</b> and policy processes in other countries in the world to achieve a more genuine and global understanding of the role of states and their policies in international migration.|$|R

30|$|In addition, our {{paper is}} the first one to focus on the United States and Australia. The choice of these two {{countries}} constitutes a critical element in the analysis of the different factors affecting trust. The United States and Australia have quite similar <b>immigration</b> <b>histories</b> and share a number of social and economic characteristics. However, the two countries exhibit very different average levels of individual trust. We investigate the reasons for this difference by expanding the set of country level characteristics proposed by Dinesen to include several indicators for the economic conditions in the two countries, and for social characteristics, such as crime levels, racial inequality and racial segregation.|$|R
