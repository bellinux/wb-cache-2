5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January19 off {{the east}} coast of Madagascar, which became Tropical Disturbance 6 two days later. It <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the east, strengthening to tropical depression status on January22, and passing 330km (205mi) west of Réunion. Increased wind shear caused the system to weaken as it turned back to the west, dissipating over Madagascar on January24. On Réunion, the system dropped about 100mm (4in) of rainfall, including a total of 50mm (2in) falling in a 90minute period in Cape Bernard.|$|E

The horse had been narrowly beaten by Party Politics in the previous year's National but had won just one of his six races since, a moderate event at Exeter in November. He shared pre-race favouritism with Party Politics until shortly before the start when he <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> 15/2 joint-second favourite. His Irish jockey, Adrian Maguire, was one of nine riders making their debut in the race.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on June 6 and developed into a depression the next day as it <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the north, moving over south of the Ganges Delta. The depression reversed its course overland, reemerging into the Bay of Bengal on June 8. Once over water, the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm {{on the morning of}} June 9. The cyclone's motion shifted to the northwest and it made a second landfall near Balasore in northern Orissa that night. The cyclone quickly weakened to a deep depression overland and tracked to the west over central India, where it degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} on June 11.|$|E
5|$|Alberto quickly {{strengthened}} while moving northeastward {{through the}} southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into a hurricane about nine hours after attaining tropical storm status. Late on June 3, Alberto attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) while located about 120miles (195km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Shortly after peaking in intensity, strong upper-level westerly winds impacted the deep convection of the storm. By early on June 4 Alberto weakened to {{a tropical storm}} after turning sharply westward due to weak steering currents. It drifted erratically as the circulation became exposed, and early on June 5 it degenerated into a convectiveless tropical depression. As a tropical depression, Alberto <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the east-northeast and later turned to the east, and late on June 6 it dissipated while located about 70miles (115km) {{off the coast of}} Florida.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> {{a location}} south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 9. It moved westward through {{a hostile environment}} of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked on July 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into a swirl of clouds on July 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Edouard was {{the first}} of eight named storms to form in September 2002, the most such storms in the North Atlantic for any month at the time. The fifth {{tropical}} storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Edouard developed into a tropical cyclone on September 1 from an area of convection associated with a cold front east of Florida. Under weak steering currents, Edouard <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the north and executed a clockwise loop to the west. Despite moderate to strong levels of wind shear, the storm reached a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h) on September 3, but quickly weakened as it tracked westward. Edouard made landfall on northeastern Florida on September 5, and after crossing the state it dissipated on September 6 while becoming absorbed into the larger circulation of Tropical Storm Fay.|$|E
5|$|A system {{developed}} {{within a}} convergence zone on January20 near {{the boundary between}} the South-West Indian Ocean and the Australia region. Its circulation became better defined, and MFR initiated advisories on January22. With a ridge to the south, it <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the southeast, approaching 90°E, but turning to the southwest before crossing over. On January23, the system intensified into a tropical depression. Slowly intensifying, the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January24. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S, and it turned toward the south. After having experienced moderate wind shear, Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions, and its convection gradually organized. Early on January26, MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone, later estimating peak winds of 130km/h (80mph). After that time, increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to a tropical storm, causing it to curve to the west. By January28, the circulation was exposed from the convection, and Eddy weakened to a tropical depression. It turned to the southwest the next day, and dissipated fully on January30.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 27. It tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge, becoming convectively active, and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the Cape Verde islands on September 28. The organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days, and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression. As it approached the Lesser Antilles it organized further, and despite unfavorable upper-level wind shear the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3 while located about 115miles (185km/h) east of Dominica. Located in an area of weak steering currents, the depression <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the National Hurricane Center designated it with the name Klaus.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the most intense North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005, tying for seventh overall. Additionally, it made the third most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall. A Cape Verde-type hurricane that formed on August 13, 2007, Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean. It strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August21 as a powerful Category5 storm. It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened, but still a hurricane. It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22. Dean <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States. Dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure, only behind Cyclone George in the Australian region, and tied with Felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds.|$|E
5|$|In late 1863, the New Zealand {{government}} requested {{troops to}} assist in the invasion of the Waikato province against the Māori. Promised settlement on confiscated land, more than 2,500 Australians (over half of whom were from Victoria) were recruited to form four Waikato Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko, Pukekohe East, Titi Hill, Ōrākau and Te Ranga. Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the towns and cities {{by the end of the}} decade, while many others had returned to Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} slowly {{organized for}} the next day, as it <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the northeast. On July 17, the rate of organization and development of deep convection increased considerably, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny later that day. From the night of July 17 through July 18, Danny quickly developed deep convection and banding features in the favorable environment of the Gulf of Mexico, and reached hurricane status later on July 18. Located between two high pressure systems, Danny continued its unusual July track to the northeast, and crossed over southeastern Louisiana near the Mississippi River Delta. A small storm, Danny continued to strengthen after reaching the coastal waters off Mississippi {{on the night of}} July 18, and attained a peak of 80mph (130km/h) early on July 19. The hurricane-force winds, however, were confined to the eyewall. After stalling near the mouth of Mobile Bay on July 19, Hurricane Danny turned to the east, and made its final landfall near Mullet Point, Alabama later that day.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Lupit {{were from a}} {{tropical}} disturbance that persisted in the monsoon trough on November14 to the northeast of Kwajalein Atoll. There was a weak circulation with pulsating convection (thunderstorms) and weak outflow. The system <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the southwest without much organization. On November17, the circulation intensified, although convection was initially unable to persist. The next day, outflow increased to the northeast, and the thunderstorms developed over the center. At around 1200UTC on November18, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression {{to the west of the}} Marshall Islands. Due to low wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, indicating that tropical cyclogenesis was likely. Late on November19, the JTWC issued its first advisory on Tropical Depression 26W when the system was about 465km (290mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Kiko was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} storm that capsized a boat off the western coast of Mexico, killing at least 15people. The 15th and final tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko developed out of a tropical wave that formed {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 26 and traversed the Atlantic. The wave crossed over Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on October8, where it spawned Tropical Depression 15-E on October15. The depression <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the south over the next day before briefly being declared Tropical Storm Kiko. It subsequently weakened into a tropical depression, but later reattained tropical storm intensity. By October18, Kiko was forecast to make landfall along the western Mexican coastline as a moderate tropical storm. However, the cyclone turned to the west and reached its peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October20. The tropical storm slowly weakened to a remnant low-pressure area by October24 and completely dissipated on October27 without making landfall.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Rosseau gave {{orders for}} the French frigates to sail once more, {{slipping}} away from the British ships which had <b>drifted</b> <b>to</b> the north and anchoring safely between the batteries at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and the island of Tatihou. Observing the strong position the French frigates had taken up, Grant sent messages to Malcolm's force at Cherbourg requesting reinforcements. Malcolm brought Donegal and Revenge to support the frigates on 14 November, maintaining position off the anchorage despite a strong gale which caused Elisa to drag her anchors. Captain Fraycinet-Saulce was forced to throw much of the ship's stores overboard to prevent his frigate from being wrecked on the shore. The following day, Diana {{took advantage of the}} rising tide to attack the anchored Amazone, Captain Rosseau withdrawing deeper into the sheltered anchorage under protection from the batteries. Twice more Grant launched probing attacks on the French frigate, each time beaten off by heavy fire from the batteries. Joined by Malcolm and the remainder of the British force, four successive attacks were launched against Amazone, each one driven back by cannon fire. At 13:00, with the tide falling, the British squadron was compelled to retreat to deeper water, out of range of the French. All four British ships had suffered under fire, with two killed and five wounded on Revenge, three wounded on Donegal and one wounded on Diana. French losses were a single man killed on Amazone.|$|E
