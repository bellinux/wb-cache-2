5000|$|In 1937, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and {{its sister}} newspaper, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, covered a [...] "contest" [...] between two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division. The {{two men were}} {{described}} as vying {{to be the first}} to kill 100 people with a sword before the capture of Nanking. From Jurong to Tangshan (two cities in Jiangshu Province, China), Mukai <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> 89 people while Noda <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> 78 people. The contest continued because neither <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> 100 people. By the time they had arrived at Zijin Mountain, Noda <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> 105 people while Mukai <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> 106 people. Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it impossible to determine which officer had actually [...] "won" [...] the contest. Therefore, (according to journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun of December 13), they decided to begin another contest to kill 150 people.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{dispute between}} the prosecuting and defence counsels was not whether Nilsen <b>had</b> <b>killed,</b> but {{his state of mind}} before, during and after he <b>had</b> <b>killed.</b> The prosecuting counsel, Allan Green, arguing that Nilsen was sane, in full control of his actions and <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> with premeditation; the defence counsel, Ivan Lawrence, arguing that Nilsen {{suffered}} from diminished responsibility, rendering him incapable of forming the actual intention to commit murder, and should therefore be convicted of manslaughter as opposed to murder.|$|R
5|$|The adult bobcat has few predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause for}} the {{extinction}} of the King Island emu is unknown. Soon after the bird was discovered, sealers settled on the island because of the abundance of elephant seals. Péron's interview with Daniel Cooper suggested that they likely contributed {{to the demise of}} the bird by hunting it, and perhaps by starting fires. Péron described how dogs were purpose-trained to hunt down the emus; Cooper even claimed to <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> no fewer than 300 emus himself. Cooper had been on the island for six months, which suggests he killed 50 birds a month. His group of sealers consisted of eleven men as well as his wife, and they alone may <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> 3,600 emus by the time Péron visited them.|$|E
5|$|Van der Sloot's mother, Anita, {{stated in}} a Dutch {{interview}} {{that her son}} could <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Flores and that she will not visit him at the prison. She said in another interview that she hopes {{to talk to the}} family of the victim and apologize to them.|$|E

Pattabi states that Hema could <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Rajan for the money as she loses her sanity when overpowered by anger.|$|E
5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests that it may <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E

Lord Edmund himself did not {{take part in the}} battle after arriving late, but later claims to <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> 450 peasants and several nobles, one of whom had actually been killed by his brother in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Marge {{take the}} lizards to the Springfield Birdwatching Society. Principal Skinner, {{a member of}} the society, {{explains}} that they are Bolivian tree lizards, a type of lizard that steals a bird’s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. Skinner says the lizards must be killed by law, because they <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, but before he can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the lizards glide to the ground, where they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|E

They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E
