In the late 1970s, Pass further developed his amplifier technology and Threshold began to market the STASIS line of amplifiers.

Pass was quoted as saying, “The Stasis 1 was the statement product for what became the popular Stasis product line, which served Threshold {{for the life of the}} company.” In another interview, he stated: “The Stasis amplifier certainly stands out as probably the premier example of a simple, creative topology that’s <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> and stood the test of time.” [...] Virtually all Threshold amplifiers and pre-amplifiers displayed a luxurious look of [...] "sculptured" [...] brushed aluminum faceplates that were Besne's hallmarks of the entire line in keeping with the components’ substantial price.

50|$|However, this parting of {{the ways}} suited {{many people in the}} BBC, as it came in the wake of very strong {{criticism}} that had been building over a long time about Clark's poor work habits, his general inefficiency, his unpunctuality and missing of important deadlines, his administrative bungling and his unwillingness to communicate with his colleagues about what he was doing, thinking or planning. His dismissal had been considered more than once. His conducting was also the subject of criticism, on the basis that he could not quickly establish rapport with or give strong and unambiguous directions to his players, and he was discouraged from this activity. His personal integrity had also come under question: He took sick leave in 1928 due to severe rheumatism that necessitated having his affected arm in a sling, but while on leave he conducted orchestras in both London and Prague. Then there was a trip to Europe to negotiate with Arturo Toscanini about his involvement in the forthcoming BBC Symphony Orchestra's appearances at the Florence May Festival; Clark changed his travel arrangements at the last minute, he stayed a week longer than he was scheduled to, he still did not complete the task he was sent to do, and the rocky relationship Toscanini already had with the BBC was further soured. Adrian Boult backed Clark to the hilt, saying he had <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> in very difficult circumstances; but it was too late.|$|E

However, the statement did not mention which foreign doctors had been invited or whether or not any of them had responded. A statement one day later from the hospital said that Liu was admitted on 7 June. On 8 July, the hospital said that Joseph M. Herman of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Markus Büchler of Heidelberg University had joined domestic experts for group consultation. The foreign doctors said that Liu had indicated {{that he wanted to be}} sent abroad for treatment. Acknowledging the risk that is involved when a patient is moved, they deemed that Liu was fit to travel abroad in order to receive the care which they were willing to provide him. However, the hospital said that the foreign doctors had confirmed that even they had no better treatment methods and also that the domestic doctors had <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> On 10 July, the hospital said that Liu was in critical condition, and that he was suffering from an increasingly bloated stomach, an inflamed abdominal wall, falling blood pressure, faltering kidneys, growing cancer lesions, and that they were actively rescuing him, and were starting to use continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). On 12 July, the hospital said that Liu was suffering from liver failure (Child-Pugh class C), kidney failure, respiratory failure, septic shock, blood clot, etc. and that they had communicated the necessity for tracheal intubation, but his family had rejected the procedure. The New York Times reported that Liu's family could not be independently reached for confirmation of his condition.|$|E
