40|$|Summary. This {{carried out}} work is aimed {{enhancing}} {{the efficiency of}} the spray scrubber by combining processes and improving hydraulic conditions in the device. The problem of treating waste gases is often characterized by unique features and the significant factor that makes it difficult to find {{a solution to the problem}} of treatment is the low and/or variable concentration of the pollutant. With a removal efficiency of up to 98 %, wet treatment technology in scrubber type devices is the only practical method advantageous to the treatment of waste gases. The set objective is solved by developing a two-stage treatment system for pyrolysis gas based on ejector scrubbers. Their advantage - a central nozzle supply that allows the scrubber to operate on the principle of an ejector pump. A drift eliminator of the developed device is located on the case unit and a chain is suspended from a clamp mounted on the lower part of the tube neck by pins and two <b>detachable</b> <b>joints.</b> The operation of the scrubber was checked in compliance with the absorption gas treatment of sulfur dioxide. A chemical sorbent, calcium carbonate which is produced as a by-product in the manufacture of nitroammophos at JSC “Minudobrenia” factory is used. Preliminary results indicate that the stiochiometric inlet ratio of Ca/S equals about 2. 0 and SO 2 emissions reduce by 80 - 90 %, significantly larger than the planned 70 % and subsequently corresponds to the residue concentration of less than 30 mg/m 3. This is explained by the greater degree of capture and deposition of the sorbent on the chain curtain (not more than 20 mg/m 3). The proposed device for treating gases enables: improvement in the efficiency of gas treatment; increased reliability; increase in the degree of treatment of the gas flow without the use of additional equipment; reduction in metal and design complexity; reduction on the cost of the treatment process and simplification in the device design...|$|E

40|$|Reducing {{the number}} of {{transitions}} of manufacturing products {{and the increase in}} the degree of deformation at a transition in shaping sheet metal forming processes can improve the performance of manufacturing and makes the resulting products competitive. For the drawing process developed ways of shaping with the use of differential radial flange backwater using liquid drawing in a die of special profile and the combined drawing in the double cone die special profile. Using computer simulation by the method of finite elements, was found that application of backwater significantly reduce the amount of tensile stresses in the dangerous section, which result is the destruction of the wall. Reduction of these strains has increased the degree of deformation in one transition and reduce {{the number of}} drawing transitions. The use of traditional drawing in a die of special profiles and combined drawing in double-cone die of special profile also reduced the number of presswork transitions. The experimental results confirmed the results of the calculations. Was found the analytical dependences for determining the parameters of the combined drawing in the double-cone die. For processes of reducing tubular and hollow bottom blanks were used the application of liquid back pressure to the inner surface of the blanks and reducing was applied in the die of special profile. Calculation found that counter-pressure application with reducing of tubular of steel billets leads to the exclusion of loss of stability of the preform wall and forming of the cross-ribbed on the wall and on the deformed part of the workpiece, which allowed to obtain products with the neck in one transition. During reducing was applied cone and spherical dies of special profile. In such dies deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are positioned at an angle with a certain step. Forming on these surfaces ensure the reduction of the friction forces in forming and increasing the degree of deformation in one transition. Using the pre-operation profiling wall of tubular or hollow blanks with the bottom results in reducing products of constant wall thickness. Prototypes of products was obtained by experimental way. Was founded the analytical dependences for determining the reducing force, the shape and size of the deformed part of the blanks. The developed method of outward flanging of the holes in the sheet metal blanks and profiles provides receiving of deformed part with a constant wall thickness without distortion. Constant wall thickness leads to an increase in the height of products after outward flanging with thinning and increased reliability and durability <b>detachable</b> and permanent <b>joints</b> which are formed by outward flanging products with other items. Using the pre-profiling of the blanks and profiles by cold extrusion forming holes followed by punching jumper leads to saving metal. Calculations and experiments have shown the possibility of obtaining constant wall thickness. For engineering calculation of parameters of preliminary profiling blanks and parameters of outward flanging was founded analytical according to the definition of power modes, the specific efforts on the instrument and final shape and size of deformed blanks. For various configurations of flanges on tubular workpieces and pipes was developed method of bulging by punch of special profile. At such punch deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are located at an angle to the corresponding step. By computer simulation was found and confirmed by experiment punch profile, which provides a reduction of the friction forces in the forming in the bulging processes and increase the bulging ratio. ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?? ??????????? ??????????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????, ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????. ????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ???????????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????. ??????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ???????; ??? ????????? ?????? ????????? ? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ??????? ???????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ???????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ????????? ?? ????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ?? ?????? ? ???????????????? ????? ?????????, ??? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ??? ?????? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ???????????? ?????. ?????????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ??? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ??????. ????????????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????, ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ????? ?????????. ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????????? ????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????? ????????. ????????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ???????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????. ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????. ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ???????, ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ??????????????? ?????. ???????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ????????, ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?? ???????????????? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ???????...|$|R
