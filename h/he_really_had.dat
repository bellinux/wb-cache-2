5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentation}} of the various phrases of the construction {{makes no mention of}} anyone other than Bernardino delle Croci, {{but it is not clear}} if <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> the skills the create a sculptural structure of this type. A reappraisal of Brescian art of the period, as well as the clear evidence of the style, have led critics to assign to Cairano the execution of the stone parts of the monument, limiting delle Croci's involvement only to the bronze inserts. The jeweller, consequently, assumed the entire Martinengo commission but entrusted the parts outside his competence, most of the monument in fact, to the Cairano studio.|$|E

5|$|On the April 5 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hardy was {{introduced}} {{as a member}} of Team Hogan for the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would face Team Flair. One week later, however, Hardy was injured when James Storm spewed a volatile liquid against a flame from his lighter, forming a fireball that singed most of Hardy's face. At Lockdown, Team Hogan (Hardy, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm). At Sacrifice, Hardy defeated Mr. Anderson. After the event, Anderson turned face and eventually managed to convince the skeptical Hardy that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> changed, after which the two went on to form a tag team. At Slammiversary VIII, Hardy and Anderson, now known as Enigmatic Assholes, defeated Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) in a tag team match.|$|E
25|$|Many testified falsely against Jesus, {{but their}} {{statements}} did not agree.

Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{undertook}} {{the recording}} of Abbey Road {{with a sense of}} discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and Let It Be. Having temporarily left the group in January 1969 {{partly as a result of}} McCartney's criticism of his musicianship, Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band, particularly while they worked on his compositions [...] "Something" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: [...] "I first recognised that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a great talent when we did 'Here Comes the Sun.' But when he brought in 'Something,' it was something else... It was a tremendous work – and so simple." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stieglitz {{later said}} he {{immediately}} recognized this image as [...] "another milestone in photography…a step {{in my own}} evolution, a spontaneous discovery", but this claim is challenged by several of his biographers who {{have pointed out that}} although he had many opportunities to do so [...] he didn't publish it until 1911 and didn't exhibit it until 1913. In addition, biographer Richard Whelan states, [...] "If <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> known that he had just produced a masterpiece, he probably would not have been so depressed during his European vacation that summer [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Koniecpolski's {{intelligence}} on {{the enemy was}} better, and Toğay bey mistakenly believed he had a much larger numerical advantage than <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had.</b> At first, he had only his own corps of about 10,000, that began the fighting defensively. The battle was slowed down by heavy mists, during which Wiśniowiecki arrived, giving the Poles a numerical parity, if not superiority. After the Polish attack, Toğay bey ordered a retreat, which turned into a rout. The pursuit continued for a day, and many Tatars drowned near Sina Woda when the ice gave way. The Tatars lost over 4,000 people, mostly during the retreat; the Polish casualties were [...] "minimal".|$|E
2500|$|A Democrat-turned-Republican, Caldwell first won {{the general}} {{election}} for state senator for Benton and Carroll counties in 1968, when he unseated the veteran Democratic incumbent, Russell Elrod (1904-1985) of Siloam Springs, who in the 1953-1954 session had been the Senate President Pro Tempore. Although he was considered a [...] "progressive" [...] or a Moderate Republican within the legislature, Caldwell recalled years later that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> [...] "no ideology, no issue when I first ran. I just thought a two-party system was a good idea. I don't recall any of us [...] having an agenda. ...

2500|$|Friedrich was the co-creator {{and initial}} writer of Marvel's motorcycle-demon Ghost Rider, and later teamed with that character's first artist, Mike Ploog, on Marvel's Monster of Frankenstein – {{the first five}} issues of which (Jan.-Oct. 1973) {{contained}} a relatively faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. As one critic wrote of issue #4: [...] "Unmatched by anything else he'd written at Marvel, Friedrich's script ... had reached a point that perfectly captured the 19th-century cadences of Shelley's prose and lifted the strip far above any past or, so far, future attempt to adapt the character to comics." [...] Friedrich co-created the supernatural hero the Son of Satan in Ghost Rider vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 1973). Friedrich recalled in 2009 that Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee [...] "had some idea that he wanted a character called Son of Satan. I {{have no idea why}} or where it came from. All <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> was the name and he wanted us to create a character based around that. I guess it just popped in his mind. He said [...] "I want a title called Son of Satan. Do it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe has {{an aversion}} to {{physical}} contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe's own bedroom: [...] "Wolfe told me once ... that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> no cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone …" [...] When Jerome Berin, creator of saucisse minuit, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at [...] "Wolfe, who didn't like being touched, concealing his squirm {{for the sake of}} sausages." [...] In Prisoner's Base, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff [...] "put a hand on me. ... I will not have a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man's hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff's, unmerited, I will not have." [...] Wolfe's prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death", Archie finds Wolfe in the kitchen with a woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef: [...] "Standing beside him, closer to him than I had ever seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making {{a big deal out of}} ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.". Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that [...] "Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a clear insight into television".|$|E
