5|$|From {{the early}} 1860s whaling {{declined}} rapidly {{with the increasing}} use of petroleum, the onset of the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War – with unfortunate consequences for the island. To explore alternative means of income Thompson, in 1867, purchased the Sylph which was the first local vessel to trade with Sydney (mainly pigs and onions). It anchored <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> at what is now Sylph's Hole off Old Settlement Beach, but was eventually tragically lost at sea in 1873 which added to the woes of the island at this time.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> occasionally {{results in}} significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, {{but also from}} oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E
5|$|Three of the {{surviving}} ships, Lübeck, München, and Danzig, were seized by Britain as war prizes {{after the end of}} the war and sold for scrapping. The other two ships, Hamburg and Berlin, were used as training cruisers through the 1920s. They were converted into barracks ships in the mid-1930s, a role they filled for a decade; in 1944, Hamburg was sunk by British bombers and later broken up for scrap, while Berlin was scuttled <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> after the end of World War II to dispose of a load of chemical weapons.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The major Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events 450 {{million years}} ago may {{have been caused by}} a GRB. The late Ordovician species of trilobites that spent portions of their lives in the plankton layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} laid {{a series of}} minefields during their career, though their most {{significant}} success came in October 1917, when they attacked a British convoy to Norway. They sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships from the convoy. They escaped back to Germany without damage. The two ships were interned at Scapa Flow {{after the end of}} the war, and were subsequently scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919. Brummer was sunk <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> and was never raised, but Bremse was brought up in 1929 and broken up for scrap in 1932–1933.|$|E

5|$|Though silvertip {{sharks are}} quite mobile, they exhibit {{fidelity}} to certain areas {{and there are}} reports of territorial behavior. They are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Small groups of adult females have been seen <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water.</b> Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) of equal size when competing for food. This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites. They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} saucer scallop (Amusium balloti) is {{the only}} commercially important species. This occurs in sheltered areas of medium-fine sand <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> to the north-east of the reefs; {{it is usually the}} dominant species there.|$|E
25|$|Underneath the surface, {{there is}} a fluid motion {{associated}} with the free surface motion. While the surface elevation shows a propagating wave, the fluid particles are in an orbital motion. Within the framework of Airy wave theory, the orbits are closed curves: circles <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water,</b> and ellipses in finite depth—with the ellipses becoming flatter {{near the bottom of}} the fluid layer. So while the wave propagates, the fluid particles just orbit (oscillate) around their average position. With the propagating wave motion, the fluid particles transfer energy in the wave propagation direction, without having a mean velocity. The diameter of the orbits reduces with depth below the free surface. <b>In</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water,</b> the orbit's diameter is reduced to 4% of its free-surface value at a depth of half a wavelength.|$|E

25|$|This linear {{theory is}} often used to get a quick and rough {{estimate}} of wave characteristics and their effects.

25|$|In 2005, Hammack, Henderson and Segur have {{provided}} the first experimental evidence {{for the existence of}} three-dimensional progressive waves of permanent form <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> – that is bi-periodic and two-dimensional progressive wave patterns of permanent form.

25|$|Water depth at {{the glacier}} {{terminus}} {{is the key}} variable in predicting calving of a tidewater glacier. Debris flux and sediment recycling at the glacier grounding-line, particularly rapid in the temperate glaciers of Alaska, can alter this depth, acting as a second-order control on terminus fluctuations. This effect contributes to the insensitivity of a glacier to climate when its terminus is either retreating or advancing <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
