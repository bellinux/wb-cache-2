5|$|Scottish {{society in}} the Middle Ages <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> {{organisation}} {{of what is now}} Scotland between the departure of the Romans from Britain in the fifth century and the establishment of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century.

Kinship groups probably provided the primary system of organisation and society was probably divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had the right to bear arms and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners.|$|E

25|$|Granting no {{concession}} to his precarious legal situation, Socrates speaks emotionally and provocatively to the court, {{and says that}} the greatest good to occur upon Athens is his moral concern for them as fellow citizens. That material wealth {{is a consequence of}} goodness; that the god does not permit a better man to be harmed by a lesser man; and that he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> gadfly required by Athens: “All day long, I will never cease to settle here, there, and everywhere — rousing, persuading, and reproving every one of you.” In support of the moral mission assigned him by the Oracle at Delphi, Socrates tells the court that his daimonion continually forbids him to act unethically. That statement implicitly validates Meletus' accusation that Socrates believes in novel deities not of the Athenian pantheon.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{there are}} few reports about how many people disaffiliating from Islam in Muslim {{majority}} countries. The main reason for this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and legal repercussions associated with leaving Islam in many Muslim majority countries, {{up to and including}} the death penalty for apostasy. However, the report also suggest that in future, {{it is also possible that}} these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate. On the other hand the increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in Foreign Affairs whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany are no longer embrace Islam in adulthood. Many of the Muslims who leaves Islam faces social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or penalty. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, there is increasing numbers of Americans who are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012. On the other hand, conversion into Islam have also been well documented.|$|E

500|$|Structure and agency, {{sometimes}} referred to as determinism versus voluntarism, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: [...] "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" [...] In this context 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas 'structure' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological epistemology ("What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> world made of?", [...] "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?"). A perennial question within this debate is that of [...] "social reproduction": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals? ...|$|E
