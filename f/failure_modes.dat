5|$|The main {{failure mode}} for die casting dies is wear or erosion. Other <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> are heat {{checking}} and thermal fatigue.

5|$|The {{most common}} <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> were loss of {{sensitivity}} caused by dust infiltrating the speaker panels, and internal arcing of the panels caused by excessive {{power to the}} step-up transformer; use at high altitudes may also cause the same effect. Also, because of its novel electrical characteristics, the speaker could cause some amplifiers to become unstable and could result in damage to either or both. Late in the speaker's life, many owners found that the highly-stable 15-watt Naim NAIT launched in 1983 worked well with the ESL.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the wear-out <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> common to all fluorescent lamps, the electronic ballast may fail, since it {{has a number of}} component parts. Ballast failures are usually due to overheating and may be accompanied by discoloration or distortion of the ballast enclosure, odors, or smoke. The lamps are internally protected and are meant to fail safely {{at the end of their}} lives. Industry associations are working toward advising consumers of the different <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> of CFLs compared to incandescent lamps, and to develop lamps with inoffensive <b>failure</b> <b>modes.</b> New North American technical standards aim to eliminate smoke or excess heat at the end of lamp life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> of the {{corroded}} RC beam may {{shift from}} designed <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> to others <b>failure</b> <b>mode,</b> as the load resisting mechanism changes {{due to the}} corrosion ratio of rebars. In this study, the load resisting mechanism and the <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> of the corroded RC beam were investigated based on the bond performance. If the corroded RC beam is non-uniformly corroded, the beam suffers beam action and fails in flexural failure. Otherwise, the load resisting mechanism and the <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> depend on the corrosion ratio of bottom portion stirrups. Moreover, the decision point is proposed to predict the load resisting mechanisms in the corroded RC beam...|$|R

25|$|Instant abort {{capability}} {{was important}} because certain <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> such as loss of thrust upon liftoff (for example the third Redstone test flight in May 1954) {{could result in}} an immediate catastrophic situation. Other <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> such as deviation from the proper flight path or a drop in engine chamber pressure during ascent did not necessarily present an immediate risk to the astronaut's safety and he could either initial a manual abort by pulling a lever in the capsule to activate the Launch Escape System or ground control could send a command to activate it.|$|E

25|$|The many {{different}} types of electrolytic capacitors show differences in electrical long-term behavior, their inherent <b>failure</b> <b>modes,</b> and their self-healing mechanism.

30|$|The {{proposed}} kinematic {{model was}} expected to be able to simulate the envelope curves of the CLT shear wall containing panel-to-panel connection. Firstly, based on the envelope curves of unit connections, global peak loads for the four different modes were calculated. Originally, the wall and connections were designed for the wall to fail by <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> A (uplift at bracket). As expected, the actual <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> was the <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> A.|$|R
40|$|The <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> {{analysis}} (FMA) {{is described}} as a design tool to predict and improve product reliability. The objectives of the <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> analysis are presented as they influence component design, configuration selection, the product test program, the quality assurance plan, and engineering analysis priorities. The detailed mechanics of performing a <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> analysis are discussed, including one suggested format. Some practical difficulties of implementation are indicated, drawn from experience with preparing FMAs on the nuclear rocket engine program...|$|R
30|$|The global {{shear wall}} {{resistance}} would {{be governed by}} the <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> A, but the global displacement of CLT wall is not caused by a <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> only. The other mode would also affect the total global displacement. Therefore, global displacements for the other mode have to be calculated and added to the global displacement of the <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> A (Eq.  10). At each displacement step, the global displacements of the other mode under the global force of each displacement steps were calculated.|$|R
25|$|As {{with any}} {{industrial}} product, specific causes of <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> {{are known for}} aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes.

25|$|Most {{regulator}} malfunctions involve improper {{supply of}} breathing gas or water leaking into the gas supply. There are two <b>failure</b> <b>modes,</b> where the regulator shuts off delivery, which is extremely rare, and free-flow, where the delivery {{will not stop}} and can quickly exhaust a scuba supply.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{corrosion}} of concrete-covered {{steel and}} iron {{can cause the}} concrete to spall, creating severe structural problems.

For example; [...] "fatigue or corrosion of a structural beam" [...] or [...] "fretting corrosion in an electrical contact" [...] is a failure mechanism and in itself (likely) not a <b>failure</b> <b>mode.</b> The related <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> (end state) is a [...] "full fracture of structural beam" [...] or [...] "an open electrical contact".

30|$|The maximum global {{displacements}} for the <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> A {{were calculated}} by the corresponding displacement formula (Eqs.  1, 3, 5 and 7).

25|$|Scuba {{diving in}} {{relatively}} hazardous environments such as caves and wrecks, areas of strong water movement, relatively great depths, with decompression obligations, with equipment {{that has more}} complex <b>failure</b> <b>modes,</b> and with gases that are not safe to breathe at all depths of the dive require specialised safety and emergency procedures tailored to the specific hazards.|$|E
25|$|Rebreathers release {{little or}} no gas bubbles into the water, and use much less stored gas volume, for an {{equivalent}} depth and time because exhaled oxygen is recovered; this has advantages for research, military, photography, and other applications. Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open-circuit scuba, and special training and correct maintenance are required {{for them to be}} safely used, due to the larger variety of potential <b>failure</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Byzantine {{failures}} {{are considered}} the most general and most difficult class of failures among the <b>failure</b> <b>modes.</b> The so-called fail-stop failure mode occupies the simplest end of the spectrum.

25|$|When photographing or {{shooting}} {{video of}} shy animals which are easily disturbed, {{it is more}} likely to be successful if there is only one diver potentially disturbing the subjects. The disturbance can also be reduced by buddy diving on rebreathers, which cuts down on bubble noise, but at the cost of increased risk due to the inherently higher number of <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> characteristic of rebreathers.

25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected.

It is closely associated with maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some), and logistics engineering.

25|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases.

Rebreathers also produce far less bubble volume and less noise than scuba, which makes them attractive to military, scientific and media divers.
