40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} an experimental study on large droplet ice accretions which was conducted in the NASA-Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) with a full-scale 77. 25 inch chord Twin-Otter wing section. This study was intended to: (1) document the existing capability of the IRT to produce a large droplet icing cloud, and (2) study the effect of various parameters on large droplet ice accretions. Results are presented from a study of the IRT's capability to produce large droplets with MVD of 99 and 160 microns. The effect of the initial water droplet temperature on the resultant ice accretion was studied for different initial spray bar air and water temperatures. The initial spray bar water temperature was found to have no discernible effect upon the large droplet ice accretions. Also, analytical and experimental results suggest that the water droplet temperature is very nearly the same as the tunnel ambient temperature, thus providing a realistic simulation of the large droplet natural icing condition. The effect of temperature, droplet size, airspeed, angle-of attack, flap setting and <b>de-icer</b> <b>boot</b> cycling time on ice accretion was studied, and will be discussed in this report. It was found that, in almost all of the cases studied, an ice ridge formed immediately aft of the active portion of the <b>de-icer</b> <b>boot.</b> This ridge was irregular in shape, varied in location, and was in some cases discontinuous due to aerodynamic shedding...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{experiments}} {{designed to determine}} the effects of large droplet ice accretion on a NACA 23012 wing section are presented. Using primarily an icing condition with a median volumetric diameter droplet size of 160 micron and a liquid water content of 0. 82 grams per cubic meter, the effects of various air temperatures, angles of attack, and <b>de-icer</b> <b>boot</b> cycle interval times on ice accretion were studied. Measurements of aerodynamic performance penalties due to the ice accretions were made. Results were also compared with similar tests conducted with a Twin Otter wing section in Part 1 of this study. The form of the ice from the large droplet cloud varied as a function of air total temperature; particularly at the near-freezing temperatures of 28 F to 34 F. Changing boot cycle interval time did not prevent formation of an ice ridge. The most detrimental aerodynamic effects occurred at an air total temperature of 28 F...|$|E

25|$|The Boeing Model 247 was {{an early}} United States airliner, {{considered}} the first such aircraft to fully incorporate advances such as all-metal (anodized aluminium) semimonocoque construction, a fully cantilevered wing and retractable landing gear. Other advanced features included control surface trim tabs, an autopilot and <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> for the wings and tailplane.|$|R

The winds ripped off the propeller <b>de-icing</b> <b>boot</b> {{and pushed the}} flight down to a perilous 1000 ft above sea level. The ruggedized Lockheed WP-3D Orion was only designed for a maximum of +3.5Gs and -1G.|$|R
5000|$|In April, 1996 the American FAA issued 18 Airworthiness Directives (ADs) {{affecting}} 29 turboprop aircraft {{which had}} the combination of unpowered flight controls, pneumatic deicing boots and NACA [...] "five-digit sharp-stall" [...] airfoils. They included significant revisions of pilot operating procedures in icing conditions (higher minimum speeds, non-use of the autopilot, different upset recovery procedures) {{as well as physical}} changes to the coverage area of the <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> on the airfoils.|$|R
50|$|The {{pneumatic}} boot is {{most appropriate}} for low and medium speed aircraft, especially those without leading edge lift devices such as slats. Therefore, this system is most commonly found on turbo propeller aircraft such as the Saab 340, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, and British Aerospace Jetstream 41. Pneumatic <b>De-Icing</b> <b>boots</b> are sometimes found on larger piston prop aircraft, smaller turbojets such as the Cessna Citation V, and some older turbojets. This device is rarely used on modern turbojet aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{failure of}} Continental Express {{maintenance}} and inspection personnel {{to adhere to}} proper maintenance and quality assurance procedures for the airplane's horizontal stabilizer <b>de-ice</b> <b>boots</b> {{that led to the}} sudden in-flight loss of the partially secured left horizontal stabilizer leading edge and the immediate severe nose-down pitchover and breakup of the airplane. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of the Continental Express management to ensure compliance with the approved maintenance procedures, and the failure of FAA surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures." ...|$|R
5000|$|While the ATR 42 and ATR 72 {{aircraft}} are now compliant with all icing condition requirements imposed by those 18 ADs, the <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> still only reach back to 12.5% of the chord. Prior to the accident, they had extended only to 5% and 7%, respectively. Robert Boser believes the ADs still fail {{to deal with}} the findings of tests conducted by British regulators at MoD Boscombe Down, which demonstrated that ice could form as far back on the wing as 23% of the chord, and on the tail at 30% of the chord. Both percentages are well {{beyond the reach of the}} extended deicing boots installed in compliance with the FAA ADs. Those tests limited the size of the droplets to 40 micrometres, near the maximum limit of the FAA design certification rules for Transport Category aircraft (Part 25, Appendix C), still in effect at that time of the Roselawn crash. [...] "Extensive airborne testing" [...] following the accident revealed that airliners can encounter water droplets exceeding 200 micrometers in average diameter. It is likely that the lack of further ATR icing accidents is attributable to the changes in pilot operating procedures, as well as the moving of those aircraft to operating areas where severe icing is not a problem, rather than to the modest extension of the <b>de-icer</b> <b>boots</b> to 12.5% of the chord.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft icing causes {{performance}} degrada-tion in aircraft. When {{a significant}} amount of degra-dation occurs aircraft accidents occur which result in the lost of life and property. Currently sensors measure the amount of ice buildup only at specific points on the aircraft. Icing flight tests conducted by NASA Lewis Research Center to investigate the efects of tailplane icing. Analysis of this data indi-cates {{that it is possible to}} detect the onset of aircraft icing by utilizing a gain scheduled Beard-Jones De-tection Filter(BJDF). Specifically the case of a failed <b>de-icing</b> <b>boot</b> is analyzed and a detection filter is for-mulated to detect this failure. ...|$|R
50|$|The CAC-100 was {{designed}} as a low wing monoplane with four turboprop engines mounted on the leading edges of the wings. The all-metal fail-safe semi-monocoque tubular fuselage was to have been pressurized and to accommodate a flight crew of two, 50-60 passengers, a single stewardess, a coat compartment, galley and toilet, as well as a pressurized baggage compartment aft of the main cabin. The mainplanes were constructed as two-spar fail-safe structures from 2024-T4 light alloy supporting the engines, ailerons and hydraulically actuated single slotted flaps. Pneumatic <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> on the fin and rudder leading edges ensured ice free operation.|$|R
5000|$|During {{its service}} the Sunderland Mark I {{received}} various improvements. The nose turret was upgraded {{with a second}} [...]303 (7.7 mm) gun. New propellers together with pneumatic rubber wing <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> were also fitted. Although the [...]303 guns lacked range and hitting power, the Sunderland had {{a considerable number of}} them and it was a well-built machine that was hard to destroy. On 3 April 1940, a Sunderland operating off Norway was attacked by six German Junkers Ju 88C fighters. It shot one down, damaged another enough to send it off to a forced landing and drove off the rest. The Germans are reputed to have nicknamed the Sunderland the Fliegendes Stachelschwein ("Flying Porcupine") due to its defensive firepower.|$|R
50|$|In-flight ice buildups {{are most}} {{frequent}} {{on the leading}} edges of the wings, tail and engines (including the propellers or fan blades). Lower speed aircraft frequently use pneumatic <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> on the leading edges of wings and tail for in-flight de-icing. The rubber coverings are periodically inflated, causing ice to crack and flake off. Once the system is activated by the pilot, the inflation/deflation cycle is automatically controlled. In the past, it was thought such systems can be defeated if they are inflated prematurely; if the pilot did not allow a fairly thick layer of ice to form before inflating the boots, the boots would merely create {{a gap between the}} leading edge and the formed ice. Recent research shows “bridging” does not occur with modern boots.|$|R
25|$|The cockpit {{design of}} the TBM strives to be {{user-friendly}} and as uncomplicated to operate as possible. For pilot convenience, an automatic fuel selector automatically switches between fuel tanks periodically to effortlessly maintain fuel balance throughout flight; manual selection of fuel tanks is also possible, which remains overseen by a low fuel warning system. The ice protection system is as automated as possible, the windshield being electrically heated, the air inlet being kept warm by engine exhaust and the <b>de-ice</b> <b>boots</b> automatically cycling once activated. The electrically actuated flaps are monitored by a sophisticated split-flap protection system to prevent asymmetric deployment. An onboard air data computer calculates various values to support the pilot, such as the aircraft's true air speed, wind, and power advisory notices based upon current external temperature and altitude.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 {{the model}} 210G {{introduced}} a cantilever wing replacing the strut-braced wing. Its planform {{changed to a}} constant taper from root chord to tip chord. In 1970 the 210K became the first full six-seat model. This was achieved by replacing the flat leaf-springs used for the retractable main landing gear struts (undercarriage) with tapered tubular steel struts of greater length. This allowed the tires to be nested farther {{to the rear of}} the fuselage, making room for the full-size rear seats. In 1979 the 210N model eliminated the folding doors which previously covered the two retracted main wheels. The tubular spring struts retract into shallow channels along the bottom of the fuselage and the wheels fit snugly in closed depressions on the underside of the fuselage. Some models featured <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> as an option.|$|R
50|$|The Galaxy {{was based}} on a new wider fuselage, {{attached}} to a strengthened Astra SPX wing with integrated winglets and modified high lift devices, powered by new 5,700 lb (25.3 kN) thrust Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306 turbofans, and with improved Pro Line 4 avionics and all-new interior. The decision to use the existing Astra SPX wing imposed a limit on maximum size, but allowed for a fuselage large enough to accommodate three-abreast seating. The main change from the Astra SPX wing was the introduction of Krueger flaps on the leading edges of the inboard section. These recovered some of the field performance lost {{as a result of the}} Galaxy's higher wing loading. It used rubber <b>de-ice</b> <b>boots</b> on wing and horizontal stabilizer leading edges. The aircraft has seating configurations for 8 to 10 passengers. The G200 has a forward tilting stance when on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. twice {{refused to}} supply the Soviet Union with B-29s under Lend Lease. However, on four {{occasions}} during 1944, individual B-29s made emergency landings in Soviet territory and one crashed after the crew bailed out. In accordance with the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Soviets were neutral in the Pacific War and the bombers were therefore interned and kept by the Soviets. Despite Soviet neutrality, America demanded {{the return of the}} bombers, but the Soviets refused. Three repairable B-29s were flown to Moscow and delivered to the Tupolev OKB. One B-29 was dismantled, the second was used for flight tests and training, and the third one was left as a standard for cross-reference. The aircraft included one Boeing-Wichita −5-BW, two Boeing-Wichita −15-BWs and the wreckage of one Boeing-Renton −1-BN - three different models from two different production lines (respectively Wichita and Renton factories). Only one of the four had <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> as used on the Tu-4. [...] The fourth B-29 was returned to the US along with its crew {{with the end of the}} Russo-Japanese entente following the Soviet declaration of war against Japan two days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, in accordance with the Yalta agreement.|$|R
50|$|Another {{upgrade to}} the Group II was the Hawkeye 2000 which {{featured}} the same APS-145 radar but incorporated an upgraded mission computer and CIC (Combat Information Center) workstations (Advanced Control Indicator Set or ACIS), and carries the U.S. Navy’s new CEC (cooperative engagement capability) data-link system. It is also {{fitted with a}} larger capacity vapor cycle avionics cooling system. Starting in 2007 a hardware and software upgrade package began {{to be added to}} existing Hawkeye 2000 aircraft. This upgrade allows faster processing, double current trackfile capacity and access to satellite information networks. Hawkeye 2000 cockpits being upgraded include solid-state glass displays, and a GPS-approach capability. The remaining Hawkeye Group II NAV Upgrade aircraft received GPS approach capability, but did not get the solid-state glass displays. In 2004, the E-2C's propeller system was changed; a new eight-bladed propeller system named NP2000 was developed by the Hamilton-Sundstrand company to replace the old four-bladed design. Improvements included reduced vibrations and better maintainability {{as a result of the}} ability to remove prop blades individually instead of having to remove the entire prop and hub assembly. The propeller blades are of carbon fiber construction with steel leading edge inserts and <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> at the root of the blade.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} uses of the {{in-flight}} icing research performed aboard NASA Glenn s DHC- 6 Twin Otter is for Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) and icing prediction code (Lewice) validation. Using the in-flight data to establish the IRT and Lewice as accurate simulators of actual icing conditions is crucial for supporting the research done in the Icing Branch. During test flights during the 2003 and 2004 flight season, a Natural Ice Shape Database was collected. For flights where conditions were appropriate, the aircraft is flown in an icing cloud with all ice protection systems deactivated. The duration of this period is usually determined by the pilot s ability to safely control the aircraft. When safe flight is no longer possible, the aircraft is maneuvered into clear air above the cloud layer. At this point several photographs are taken of the ice shape that was accreted on the wing test section during this icing encounter using a stereo photograph system (Figure 1). The stereo photograph system utilizes two cameras located at different locations on the fuselage that are both pointed at the same location on the wing. When both cameras take photographs of the same location at the same time, the negatives can be combined digitally to generate a two dimensional plot describing the cross-section of the ice shape. After these photographs are taken, the wing <b>de-icing</b> <b>boots</b> are activated and the ice shape is removed...|$|R
