Trata-se, portanto, de colher os rastros da situação hermenêutica. Partimos da pressupo-sição de que os momentos fundamentais que a constituem são, respectivamente, a circu-laridade, a verdade, a finitude e a historicidade. Primeiramente, mostraremos o movimento {{circular}} dessa situação, cuja motrici-dade se deve à concordância prévia e tácita dos existentes humanos quanto à apreensibi-lidade das coisas circunstantes como tais. Denominaremos comum-unidade esse ambi-ente de compreensibilidade, em cujo desenvolvimento histórico, segundo enfatizaremos, cada existente deve assumir um posicionamento. Uma vez que recorremos necessária e tacitamente a tal comum-unidade para interpretar o mundo em redor, a verdade não pode se tornar prerrogativa de ninguém em particular. Nesse segundo momento, tentaremos mostrar que a experiência da verdade sempre parte da e retorna para a comum-unidade, num movimento circular onde se con-figuram e se reestruturam pressuposições. Assim, devemos ressaltar, num terceiro momento, a determinação finita do mo-vimento circular da verdade, já que a existência de cada um delimita embora também ajude a fundamentar e a concretizar as possibilidades dos outros com quem coexiste. Porém, a inexorabilidade da finitude, porque também produtiva, não deve resultar num simples esvaziamento da experiência circular da verdade. Por fim, a historicidade surgirá na condição de momento-síntese, onde o tempo será o fenômeno motriz do movimento da comum-unidade. A circularidade, a verdade e a finitude devem se estruturar num jogo coeso de possibilidades, num diálogo continu-amente transformador entre os existentes humanos. Por ser transformadora, a situação hermenêutica se revelará ética e política. __________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis dissertation {{endeavors to}} trace the fundamental moments that constitute the situation of every human existent in the status of interpreter {{of the world in}} general. It is, therefore, an attempt at collecting the traces of the hermeneutic situation. The work is grounded on the premise that the fundamental moments that constitute such situation are, respectively, those of circularity, truth, finitude and historicity. Firstly is shown the circular movement of this situation, whose motility is due to a previous and tacit agreement among <b>human</b> <b>existents</b> as to the apprehensibility of cir-cumstantial things such as they are. For the purposes of this work this environment of mutual understanding will be called common-unity during whose development, it will be emphasized, each existent must assume some positioning. Once we recur necessarily and tacitly to such common-unity to interpret the world surrounding us, the truth cannot become a prerogative of any given person in particular. At this second moment, we will try to show that the experience of truth al-ways begins at and returns to the common-unity, in a circular movement where assump-tions are configured and re-structured. Thus, at a third moment the finite determination of the circular movement of the truth must be highlighted, as the existence of each one person delimits the possibilities of others with whom they co-exist however much his/her existence helps grounding and concretizing such possibilities. However, the inexorability of finitude, as it is also productive, should not result in the simple emptying of the circular experience of truth. At last, historicity will arise in the condition of synthesis-moment, where time will be the driving force of the common-unity‟s movement. Circularity, truth and fini-tude must be structured in a cohesive set of possibilities and in a continuously trans-forming dialogue among <b>human</b> <b>existents.</b> Because of its transforming nature, the her-meneutic situation will reveal itself to be ethical and political...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the proposition that}} there is a correspondence between the concept of human self-transcendence and the concept of the deification of man in that both are concerned with the bringing of human nature to its fulfilment by a process of 'redemption'. The first issue addressed is what it means to speak of man participating in divinity, and this notion is then traced through the religion and philosophy of the ancient classical world and the later Graeco-Roman world as the background against which early Christian doctrine emerged. Some modern interpretations of the notion of transcendence {{as it relates to the}} <b>human</b> <b>existent</b> are then reviewed, with particular attention being given to the suggestion that it is legitimate to speak of man rather than God as the 'locus' of transcendence by virtue of the inherent openness of human nature to the transcendence of being that meets it in its ex-sisting in being. The second, third and fourth chapters examine the development of the concept of deification as a way of speaking of humanity being brought to a resemblance to God, partaking of the divine nature, and thereby being enabled to realize the image of God in which man was originally created. The fifth chapter investigates the contributions of a selection of contemporary thinkers on the notion of man's quest for fulfilment by the process of self-transcendence, that process of overcoming the aspects of being human which compromise and threaten actual human existence. The final chapter shows how the insights of contemporary thought on the concept of self-transcendence can illuminate for us the patristic concept of deification as a way of speaking about the nature and destiny of human existence and the thesis concludes with a suggestion of three areas of contemporary investigation to which this study might be related. </p...|$|R
30|$|Our {{approach}} {{is based on}} human relations. The set-up configuration is based on presentation or greeting. In a group of friends, a new individual is introduced to the other members {{by one of the}} participants of the meeting. This member already knows the other's presentation data or may obtain them at the moment of presentation. He or she is then responsible for facilitating the new member's integration easily and simply into the group. Consequently, the network management is formed and run by cooperation between nodes, behaving similarly to that in <b>human</b> relations <b>existent</b> in our society. Thus, the formation of these networks is carried out in two principal phases: the first one is the presentation, greeting, or preidentification, and the second phase deals with the creation of the network and communication. As we can see in [16], the social relationship could be modeled as a spontaneous network. This has been the main reason to make a communication network based in this type of communications.|$|R

5000|$|However, Sartre takes {{a stance}} against characterizing bad faith {{in terms of}} [...] "mere social positions". Says Sartre, [...] "I am never any one of my attitudes, any one of my actions." [...] The good speaker {{is the one who}} plays at {{speaking}} because he cannot be speaking. This literally means that, like the café waiter, the speaker is not his condition or social categorization, but is a speaker consumed by bad faith. Thus, we must realize what we are (beings who exist) and what we are not (a social/historical preoccupation) in order to step out of bad faith. Yet, <b>existents</b> (<b>human</b> beings) must maintain a balance between existence, their roles, and nothingness to become authentic beings.|$|R
25|$|This {{picture of}} Spinoza's {{determinism}} is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics: ″the infant {{believes that it}} is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non <b>existent</b> <b>human</b> ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience {{that we have a}} false ideal of choice predicated upon this.|$|R
50|$|In this metaphor al-Arabi compares {{an object}} being {{reflected}} in countless mirrors {{to the relationship}} between God and his creatures.. God’s essence is seen in the <b>existent</b> <b>human</b> being, as God is the object and humans being the mirrors. Meaning two things, that since humans are mere reflections of God there can be no distinction or separation between the two and without God the creatures would be non- existent. When an individual understands that there is no separation between human and God they begin on the path of ultimate oneness. The one who decides to walk in this oneness pursues the true reality and responds to God’s longing to be known. The search within for this Reality of oneness causes one to be reunited with God, as well as, improve self-consciousness. The Perfect Human, through this developed self-consciousness and self-realization, prompts divine self-manifestation. This causes the Perfect Human to be of both divine and earthly origin, al-Arabi calls him the Isthmus. Being the Isthmus between heaven and Earth the perfect human fulfills God’s desire to be known and God’s presence can be realized through him by others. Additionally through self manifestation one acquires divine knowledge, which is the primordial spirit of Muhammad and all its perfection. Al- Arabi details that the perfect human is of the cosmos to the divine and conveys the divine spirit to the cosmos.|$|R

He {{passed into the}} Campaigner's keeping, from which alone he was rescued by the summons of pallid death. He met that summons like a philosopher; {{rejected}} rather testily all the mortuary consolations which his nephew-in-law, Josey's husband, thought proper to bring to his bedside; and uttered opinions which scandalised that divine.

Does a week pass without the announcement of the discovery of a new comet in the sky, a new star in the heaven, twinkling dimly out of a yet farther distance, and only now becoming visible to <b>human</b> ken though <b>existent</b> for ever and ever?

40|$|The canine genome {{offers a}} wide field for genetic studies on various areas like e. g. {{phenotypic}} diversity, heredity and diseases including cancer. The cancers seen in pet dogs are spontaneously developing {{as opposed to}} cancers of laboratory rodents. This suggests that the mechanisms of development in canine tumours could be comparable to humans. It is generally believed that dogs develop cancer twice as frequently as humans, and that the presentation, histology and biology of several canine cancers is similar to humans. Most canine cancers progress more rapidly than their human counterparts permitting a better monitoring of the tumour state. The canine cancers are more akin to human cancers than rodent tumours in terms of patient size and cell kinetics allowing better comparison of medical examinations like e. g. ultrasonography. Additionally, dogs show similar characteristics of physiology and metabolism for most organ systems and drugs, which allows better comparability of modalities e. g. surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In this thesis, the canine HMGA 1, HMGB 1, ZNF 331, and CCND 1 genes were characterised on various levels including their cDNA structure, partial genomic DNA structure, and their expression patterns. Their corresponding proteins were predicted by in silico analyses and gene identity analyses were carried out comparing these characterised genes with their corresponding counterparts of various other species. Additionally, the gene loci of these genes and of six other genes were defined by FISH analyses. Further on, to analyse if known molecular mechanisms involved in <b>human</b> cancers are <b>existent</b> in dogs as well, thirteen canine fibrosarcomas, two feline fibrosarcomas, and eleven canine melanomas were screened for hot-spot mutations of the NRAS and KRAS 2 genes. No such mutations could be detected, suggesting that these mutations do not {{play a major role}} in the analysed neoplasias...|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with riding and handling of horses, many accidents {{that can cause}} severe injuries to both horses and <b>humans</b> are <b>existent.</b> The cause is in most cases that the horse is frightened. The horse's fear also affects its usefulness {{and it has been}} shown to have adverse effects on the horse's welfare. To increase safety and improve the welfare of both humans and horses, it is important to find appropriate training methods to reduce the fear of horses in frightening situations. This experimental study compares handled habituation to free habituation. The aim was to study the impact of these training methods on the horse's behaviour and habituation, and to find out which method is most successful to reduce the fear of horses in frightening situations. Twenty horses were randomly divided into groups of ten horses per training method. The horses had three training sessions each and then they were tested for the task, to go over a bridge consisting of assembled plywood boards lying on the ground. About half of the horses passed the task, to go over the bridge, either correctly or with some small error. Only a very small difference between the two training methods were observed, handled habituation was found to be slightly better. Instead, a difference between horses with different use/breed and personality could be observed. The results indicate that the horses in the both training methods were calm during the test, all went with lowered heads and without any signs of escape behaviours or tenseness. During the training sessions the horses in handled habituation were closer to the bridge (P< 0, 05), and at the both training methods the horses were closer to the bridge for each training session. The study also found that horses with handled habituation showed more interest in the bridge compared to horses that were trained with free habituation, which had more interest to trot/canter and neigh to connect with other horses. Snorting and defecation were observed in more horses trained with free habituation while lowered head and escape behaviours were observed in more horses trained with handled habituation. Snorting, defecation and escape behaviours decreased from day one to day three. It was concluded that training with habituation, both handled and free, can reduce fear in horses. It's a calm training method where the horses showed few behavioral signs of fear and these were of low accident risk. More research on habituation could be undertaken to develop the method so that accidents in riding and handling of horses can be reduced and horse welfare improved. Handled habituation was shown both in terms to cross the bridge, close to the bridge and behaviorally to be slightly more effective than free habituation. But the difference was very small and to draw any conclusions, further studies are required. This study suggests that humans may have a calming effect on the horses, but the training method that is best also seems to depend on the horse's personality...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{engages with}} a dynamic {{discourse}} on the human rights approach to human trafficking. Building on the traditional doctrine of human rights, the thesis demonstrates that human trafficking is not a human rights violation, save for a state involvement in it, either directly or through a failure to observe its positive obligations imposed by the <b>existent</b> <b>human</b> rights. In situations that do engage human rights law, the thesis defends an argument that conceptually, human trafficking falls within a domain {{of the right to}} be free from slavery, servitude and forced labour. This argument is grounded in both a doctrinal and a conceptual analysis. In particular, the thesis conducts a unique conceptual and legal analysis of Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights offering an original interpretation of the concept of exploitation in the context of practices associated with trafficking and 'modern slavery'. This type of inquiry is missing in the existent scholarship. The thesis also conducts a detailed analysis of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on positive obligations to protect vulnerable individuals arising out of 'absolute' rights. In addition to providing a complete analysis and classification of these positive obligations, the thesis draws attention to the important difference between the scope of the right and the scope of state responsibility in situations of private infringements of 'absolute' rights. Accordingly, the thesis demonstrates that whereas the prohibition contained in these rights is absolute for the state, positive obligations in situations of their infringements by private individuals are of a limited scope. The analysis of the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court is supplemented by a comprehensive discussion of the obligations established in the trafficking-specific instruments. The thesis explains how victim protection provisions contained in these instruments may inform human rights obligations, yet, it demonstrates that these do not represent such obligations on their own. This analysis provides a roadmap for practitioners and activists when arguing cases before the Strasbourg Court and domestically. In addition to this practical dimension, the thesis intends to provide an important contribution to the scholarship on human rights law, and on human trafficking specifically. </p...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that human capital is {{a major determinant of}} economic growth. Reflections on how human capital is related to growth can be extended by viewing on the market value of the human capital. The concept of the market value of human capital reflects the efficiency of allocation and utilisation of the human capital in the economy. To measure this efficiency the concept of the market value of human capital is explained and developed in the present paper. The aim of the paper is to introduce the concept of market value of human capital and the specific objectives are targeted to define his content, to propose a method for estimating it and to provide calculations of it for OECD countries. The concept of human capital is complex and multifaceted one, consisting of: native human capital (biological), educational capital, health capital and social skills (Neagu, 2010). Clearly, human capital is intangible, a stock that is not directly observable as physical capital. Therefore, the estimation of human capital must be constructed indirectly. The stock of human capital in economy creates economic value, expressed through the economic output per capita. In order to estimate this economic value we have to find an appropriate proxy for the human capital stock producing that value. In the purpose of our paper, we consider that the economic value of human capital can be estimated by calculating the aggregate value created by the active human capital in the economy. In this view, GDP per person employed is a relevant estimation of value created by the employed labour force. The aggregate value is created by the employed persons with different educational level. The market value of human capital is calculated by dividing the GDP per person employed to the human capital stocks active in the economy. The human capital stock depends on educational costs (on primary, seconadry, tertiary education) as a the share of GDP per capita weighted by the employment rates. For OECD countries, the market value of their human capital was calculated for 1999 - 2008, showing their efficiency on utilisation of the human capital stock. The most efficient OECD countries are Australia Austria and USA and the less efficient are Mexico, Czech Republic and Hungary. The market value of human capital has a ascending trend in all OECD countries, reflecting the results of their efforts to valorise their human capital in employment. The originality of the paper consists on introduction the concept of the market value of the human capital, defining his content and providing estimates for OECD countries. As a concept, the market value of human capital of a country shows the ability of the economy to use the <b>existent</b> <b>human</b> capital to produce economic output. The market value of human capital reflects an aspect of the economic efficiency, by relating the economic output per person employed to the human capital per capita employed in the economy. It expresses the economic output per one unit of human capital, reflecting the aggregate perfomance of that economy...|$|R
40|$|Current {{readings}} of existentialism are overly negative. It {{is not without}} reason that existentialism has a reputation of pessimism preceding it, {{to the point that}} the uninitiated cannot help but picture beatnik poets chain-smoking by the first syllable of the name 2 ̆ 2 Sartre. 2 ̆ 2 Existentialism, while a movement over one hundred and fifty years old, is often characterized in the light of the media popularity it was given in the decade following the Second World War [...] although much of the spirit of what is supposedly existentialism came more as a response to the First. The Great War brought with it devastation across Europe that it instilled a sense of malaise in an entire generation of survivors. In the face of such violence, one of the common responses was to wonder if there could truly be any sense of meaning or purpose to life. This movement, philosophically, was existentialism. ^ Existentialism as a movement is not a denial of meaning. That is the role of nihilism. Existentialism simply says there is no sense of predetermined meaning, and that, in a particular formation, we are verbs before nouns: 2 ̆ 2 to be 2 ̆ 2 rather than a being thing in any real sense. Of course, there is an obvious pessimistic reading of any text that bases its thought on the foundation that <b>humans</b> are <b>existent</b> before their essence—if there is no predetermined meaning in the world, there certainly is a possibility that there does not have to be meaning in the world at all. ^ The future of the study of existential philosophy in part depends on its continuing attractiveness to a new generation of scholars. One of the things holding existentialism back is the alienating effect it can have on people—in large part because of its perceived concurrence with negativity. The aforementioned lack of a predetermined essence can cause anxiety, angst or anguish depending on whether you ask Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre. ^ Sartre explains anguish as the realization of the possibility of our own negation. If we imagine ourselves on the brink of a cliff or precipice, we can look down into the depth below and realize that, at that moment, there is nothing to prevent us from throwing ourselves over the precipice to our death. Freedom from meaning also implies there is a sense in which we do not have to live by any prescribed rules, or even at all. It can be intimidating. ^ A positive reading could bring stability to an otherwise dizzying discipline. Existential philosophy and literature both would benefit from a reimaging of certain thinkers 2 ̆ 7 approaches. What is needed is not a new reading to replace the old, but to supplement the accepted framework of understanding with serious alternative possibilities. In this prospectus, I intend to expand the traditional reading of existentialism. ^ I will offer differing interpretations of familiar texts in an effort to breathe new life into the texts themselves along with the discipline more generally. Existentialism can be freed from its trappings of negativity and pessimism. It is with this goal of liberation in mind that I seek to offer a new interpretation of the existential movement. If existentialism is liberated from negativity, that does not mean that more traditional interpretations are not possible, but rather that these common {{readings of}} a complex system of thought cannot define it. ^ My reading will be an attempt at an existential reading of existentialism. At its heart, this is an existential idea. Labeling, along with the idea that a past interpretation dictates a present or future condition, is inherently essentialist. Existentialism has been, in effect, 2 ̆ 2 playing at 2 ̆ 2 existentialism for too long, to use a Sartrean formulation. There is a sense in which the prevailing interpretations of the prominent texts are so ingrained in the public consciousness that any new scholarship takes them for granted. ^ My existential reading will try to be consistent and liberating. Because much of existentialism is a philosophy of freedom, it only makes sense that providing alternative readings and interpretations is good. In fact, this may be the only way to prevent essentialism from overtaking existentialism and unfairly making it something it was never intended to be. ^ After explaining the roots of joy in Camus and Nietzsche, I will seek to find this same idea in other existentialist writers and show how this concept can be used to varying degrees in Sartre and Kierkegaard. Both of these authors, through their texts and styles, allow for the possibility of joy as Camus or Nietzsche do. ^ Despite these differences, there is an essential similarity amongst these authors that both qualifies them to be considered 2 ̆ 2 existentialist 2 ̆ 2 and preserves the possibility of joy. This similarity is the emphasis all of them place on freedom. The same freedom that characterized the post-war malaise as a freedom-from—freedom from meaning—can also be a freedom-to—freedom to act. That action, moreover, is entirely determined by the self, independent of the constraint of essence. While freedom can be terrifying, it can also be uplifting. ...|$|R

Plenty of facts show that, in 2014, the U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, saw no improvements in its <b>existent</b> <b>human</b> rights issues, but reported numerous new problems. While its own human rights situation was increasingly grave, the U.S. violated human rights in other countries in a more brazen manner, and was given more [...] "red cards" [...] in the international human rights field.The U.S. was haunted by spreading guns, frequent occurrence of violent crimes, which threatened citizens' civil rights. Statistics showed {{that the use of}} firearms in the U.S. was behind 69 percent of murders, while for robberies, the figure was 40 percent, and for aggravated assaults, 21.6 percent (edition.cnn.com). The excessive use of force by police officers led to many deaths, sparking public outcry. An unarmed 18-year-old African-American Michael Brown was shot dead by a white police officer named Darren Wilson in Ferguson, a town in Missouri. After the grand jury of both Missouri and New York decided to bring no charges against the white police officer, massive protests broke out in more than 170 cities nationwide (cn.nytimes.com, November 25, 2014).The U.S. used cruel tortures indiscriminately, notably those carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). To acquire intelligence from suspects of terrorism and extremism, the CIA used brutal methods, such as sleep deprivation, waterboarding, long-term solitary confinement, slamming prisoners against the wall, lashing, death threat and even [...] "rectal rehydration" [...] or rectal feeding. United Nations human rights convention institutions such as the UN Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture had raised their concerns over issues in the U.S., including terrible detention conditions for convicts awaiting execution, abuse of brutal methods, secret detention, indefinite arbitrary detention, and illegal wire-tapping which infringed citizens' privacy. These institutions called on the U.S. to conduct swift, effective and fair investigations into all brutal behaviors and abuse of forces of the police force (www.un.org).The U.S. is a country with grim problems of racial discrimination, and institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities continued. Serious racial bias persisted in the police and justice systems. Minority groups and indigenous people are subject to unfairness in environment, election, health care, housing, education and other fields. In August 2014, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its concluding observation on the periodic report of the U.S. on the latter's implementation of relevant convention, slammed the U.S. for violating the rights of ethnic minorities, indigenous people, immigrants and other minority groups. It criticized the fact that members of racial and ethnic minorities continued to be disproportionately arrested, incarcerated and subjected to harsher sentences (tbinternet.ohchr.org).Money is a deciding factor in the U.S. politics, and the U.S. citizens' political rights were not properly protected. Despite the highest midterm election spending in history, general election voter turnout for the 2014 midterms was the lowest since World War II. [...] "Dark money" [...] flowed into elections, and the voting rights of racial minorities and other groups were intentionally suppressed. A few interest groups with power were able to influence the government's decision-making. As a renowned scholar pointed out sharply, the U.S. democratic system was experiencing a crisis of representation. [...] "Ordinary citizens feel that their supposedly democratic government no longer truly reflects their interests and is under the control of a variety of shadowy elites (Foreign Affairs, September/October 2014)."Although the U.S. is the most developed country in the world, it is hard for the economic and social rights of its citizens to be soundly ensured. In the process of economic recovery, the income inequality continued to be enlarged, the basic living conditions for the homeless people deteriorated, the health care system operated terribly and the education rights of average citizens were violated. In October 2014, the United Nations Special Rapporteurs criticized the unprecedented water shut-offs in Detroit disproportionately affected the most vulnerable and poorest people, violating their right of access to drinking water and other international human rights.American women and children's rights were not fully protected. Women were discriminated at workplaces, and domestic violence was prevalent. Each year, 2.1 million American women on average were assaulted by men. Three females were murdered by their partner each day, and four females died each day as a result of abuse. In the U.S. military, reports of female soldiers getting harassed were on the rise, and more faced repercussions for reporting assaults. Millions of American children were homeless. Three children died each day as a result of abuse. School violence and sex assaults were pervasive and gun shootings happened from time to time.National Security Agency and other intelligence-gathering apparatus of the U.S. for a long time have spied on world leaders and civilians. The U.S. has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. government often takes an evasive or uncooperative attitude toward the criticism of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of UN, the council's working groups and special rapporteurs.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] PU vir CHONo existentialism {{exists as}} a thought system as such. Not only are {{differences}} obvious between theistic and atheistic fields of thought as practised by the existentialist philosophers$ {{but there are}} also fundamental differences between advocates of the system such as Heidegger and Sartre. Certain common characteristics can be distinguished. It deals with the <b>existent</b> <b>human</b> being as plunged into a situation, a rebellion against rationalization, the absolutization of human freedom the incompleteness and transience of man, a denunciation of God and the Scriptures. The above-mentioned characteristics of this philosophy exercise a profound influence on the thoughts of modern man and are therefore of immediate importance to education. As Christians we need to understand these existentialists because unlike other more complacent modern thinkers, they are honest enough to voice that sense of despair which is so widespread in our world. They speak for millions of our contemporaries for whom God is dead. They tear away the masks of optimism, self-confidence and indifference. To our mind this philosophy has contributed to a large extent to the moral decline of this decadent twentieth century. It would therefore be gross neglect on the part of Christian education if it does not determine and define the implications of this philosophy. A religious minded people cannot accept the separation of its religion from its education and hence this study was undertaken in an effort to evaluate the existentialism {{in the light of the}} scriptures in which God discloses Himself and His relation to all things. It was deemed necessary to refer to religion and calling (vocation) as these are integral aspects of man's life. It was also necessary to refer to the implications of the belief in God as the foundation for a science of education with its corresponding aim and content. Therefore reference is made to an ontological, a cosmological, an anthropological, a cognizable and a methodological basis for this philosophy of education determined by Word revelation. The phenomenological approach (method) employed by the existentialists as well as the denunciation of the God of the Scriptures, causes the total absence of any relation to God, hence the neutrality. In its full reality, however, the God of the Scriptures and the Word of God cannot for one moment be excluded from its reality and no neutrality as such is ever possible. Any educator is a human being and thus a religious being who stands in relation to God, whether he is aware of it or not. Whether he accepts it or not, does not matter. All human activity is an activity issuing from the heart and qualified by the heart, be it in obedience to the law of God or not. Hence all activities of man are religiously centred and that includes education and educating. Man was created by God, as a child of God with the task of governing and ruling over His whole creation, as he would over himself; over his fellow human being, a task which includes the rearing and educating of the child and thereby complying with the responsibility entrusted to him by his Creator. Existentialistic anthropology which considers man as an incomplete and temporary being with no ultimate goal, severs the bond of the human being at its very source, viz., God. Anthropology has contributed largely to contemporary non-recognition of values and principles in education. The Christian educator sees man as the creation of God. Only anthropology based on the Bible can reflect a truly realistic image and total concept of the child. Existentialism absolutizes human liberty and self responsibility which does not subordinate itself to any authority or principle. This approach is a cosmologic absolutization of man’s existence. Man is created by God with a given task and responsibility to do his share in the fulfilment of God’s will. The Lord God has put a radical yet correlated variety in the cosmos. This irreducible variety and interdependent relation must be accepted and investigated without relativization and absolutization and yet with the acknowledgement of God as sovereign Ruler over and Creator of man and the cosmos subject to God’s cosmic law and order. The subjectivism into which the existentialists have deteriorated has caused the relegation to total insignificance of the subject-object relationship in the actual creation. To our mind the concept that knowledge can be obtained only through subjectivity, is impossible to accept. Subject and object are cognizable because God has created them as such. The educationist as a scientist, should continually realize that his knowledge can only be partial, but in the light of Scripture he should acknowledge the sovereignity of God over the whole cosmos and over each and every activity of man and this includes education. In order to combat the godlessness of existentialism the Christian educator should practise his education, that is every subject in the light of Scripture. The determining approach, the Word of God, has illumined that which has to be researched. An attempt has been made not only to give a mere description of the field or research, but also to delve into the results with full and due consideration of what God has revealed in connection with it in His Word. The Word has therefore a function to fulfil in connection with the field of research as well as the researcher. These principles have therefore of neccesity determined the method used. Use has also been made of the analytical and comparative methods. The conclusion arrived at in this study is that the answers to questions arising from educational problems such as those with regard to the eventual aims education should strive for, the very essence of education, the reason for educating, content and method, freedom and authority, discipline and punishment, the task of the teacher, and all questions relating to the full spectrum of education, cannot be supplied by existentialism. A philosophy of education should be based. on a Christian philosophy and should include the totality of education that in its entirety depends on the revelation of the Word. Master...|$|R
