In vitro efficacy of <b>florfenicol</b> showed that this drug is highly effective against most important respiratory pathogens. All these facts are shown in our survey. Three studies in pigs were relevant {{to include in the}} meta-analysis, which showed that results in the <b>florfenicol</b> group were better than in comparative control groups in all observed parameters: clinical signs, lung lesions and resolution of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (P< 0, 001).

[br/] ANIMALS: 9 healthy adult Lacaune ewes. [br/] PROCEDURES: Animals received an IM and SC administration of <b>florfenicol</b> (20 mg/kg) in a 2 -way crossover design. Samples {{of blood and}} tear fluid were collected before and for 24 hours after administration. Concentrations of <b>florfenicol</b> in plasma and tear fluid were measured via high-performance liquid chromatography. The MIC of <b>florfenicol</b> for various Mycoplasma strains cultured from sheep and goats was determined via an agar dilution method. [br/] RESULTS: Mean <b>florfenicol</b> concentration in tear fluid for the 24 -hour period was significantly higher after IM administration (0. 70 μg/mL) than after SC administration (0. 22 μg/mL) and was maintained for a longer duration. The lacrimal fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio was not different between the 2 routes of administration, with mean values of 40. 2 % and 32. 5 % after IM and SC administration, respectively. The MIC for Mycoplasma agalactiae, Mycoplasma conjunctivae, and Mycoplasma mycoides isolates ranged from 0. 5 to 8 μg of florfenicol/mL.

After six of the fish were reserved as the control group, the remaining 90 fish were divided equally into 3 groups as follows: LPS (2 [*]mg/kg, IP), LPS (2 [*]mg/kg, IP) + <b>florfenicol</b> (40 [*]mg/kg, IM), and <b>florfenicol</b> (40 [*]mg/kg, IM). Blood samples were obtained from the tail of the fish at 1. 5, 3, 6, 10, and 24 hours. The levels of sTNF-α were determined by ELISA and biochemical markers were evaluated with an autoanalyzer. A significant increase was observed in the values of sTNF-α in the LPS and LPS + <b>florfenicol</b> groups (P< 0. 05). Significant increases were found in the kidney and liver damage determinants in the LPS and LPS + <b>florfenicol</b> groups (P< 0. 05). Irregular changes in the lipid metabolism parameters were observed in all the subgroups. In conclusion, <b>florfenicol</b> does not affect the increases of sTNF-α caused by LPS and does not prevent liver or kidney damage; at least, it can be said that <b>florfenicol</b> does not have any evident positive effects on the acute endotoxemia of fish...|$|E

A 10. 8 kb florfenicol–chloramphenicol resistance plasmid, designated pCCK 381, was identified by transformation into Escherichia coli. The plasmid was mapped with restric-tion endonucleases, cloned and sequenced completely. Results: Of the antimicrobials tested, plasmid pCCK 381 conferred resistance only to chloramphenicol and <b>florfenicol.</b> It showed extended similarity to the 5. 1 kb plasmid pDN 1 from Dichelobacter nodosus in the part carrying the mobilization and replication genes.

40|$|<b>Florfenicol,</b> a {{veterinary}} fluorinated analog of thiamphenicol, {{is approved}} {{for treatment of}} bovine respiratory pathogens in the United States. However, <b>florfenicol</b> resistance has recently emerged among veterinary Escherichia coli isolates incriminated in bovine diarrhea. The flo gene, which confers resistance to <b>florfenicol</b> and chloramphenicol, has previously been identified in Photobacterium piscicida and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT 104. The flo gene product {{is closely related to}} the CmlA protein identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cmlA gene confers nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance via an efflux mechanism. Forty-eight E. coli isolates recovered from calves with diarrhea, including 41 that were both chloramphenicol and <b>florfenicol</b> resistant, were assayed for the presence of both flo and cmlA genes. Forty-two of the 44 isolates for which <b>florfenicol</b> MICs were ≥ 16 μg/ml were positive via PCR for the flo gene. All E. coli isolates for which <b>florfenicol</b> MICs were ≤ 8 μg/ml were negative for the flo gene (n = 4). Twelve E. coli isolates were positive for cmlA, and chloramphenicol MICs for all 12 were ≥ 32 μg/ml. Additionally, eight isolates were positive for both flo and cmlA, and both <b>florfenicol</b> and chloramphenicol MICs for these isolates were ≥ 64 μg/ml. DNA sequence analysis of the E. coli flo gene demonstrated 98 % identity to the published GenBank sequences of both serovar Typhimurium floSt and P. piscicida pp-flo. The flo gene was identified on high-molecular-weight plasmids of approximately 225 kb among the majority of florfenicol-resistant E. coli isolates.

In this study, the effect of drinking-water medication with <b>florfenicol</b> on Salmonella infection in pigeons was examined.
