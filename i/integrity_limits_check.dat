40|$|Fixed or static limit sensing is {{employed}} in control centers {{to ensure that}} spacecraft parameters remain within a nominal range. However, many critical parameters, such as power system telemetry, are time-varying and, as such, their 'nominal' range is necessarily time-varying as well. Predicted data, manual <b>limits</b> <b>checking,</b> and widened limit-checking ranges are often employed {{in an attempt to}} monitor these parameters without generating excessive limits violations. Generating predicted data and manual <b>limits</b> <b>checking</b> are both resource intensive, while broadening limit ranges for time-varying parameters is clearly inadequate to detect all but catastrophic problems. OSA provides a low-cost solution by using analytically selected data as a reference upon which to base its limits. These limits are always defined relative to the time-varying reference data, rather than as fixed upper and lower limits. In effect, OSA provides individual limits tailored to each value throughout all the data. A side benefit of using relative limits is that they automatically adjust to new reference data. In addition, OSA provides a wealth of analytical by-products in its execution...|$|R

For example, a data stream of 4 Mbits/s and a test time of thirty minutes would yield 900 Mbytes of raw data.
