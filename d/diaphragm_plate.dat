The results shows that the maximum load occurs in a HS- 75 profile mild steel material with a three diaphragms attached are about 26780 N, about 18495 N for one diaphragm attached and 17360 N for the profile without any diaphragm attached. This is an indication that the profile with a three diaphragm attached was able to withstand the maximum load greater than either the profile attached with one diaphragm or the profile without any diaphragm attached.

Finite element models confirm that diagonal tension field develops under shearing action but stress patterns are affected by perforations. Two plate slenderness and three perforation patterns combinations were tested experimentally. Under quasi-static condition, devices with certain plate slenderness produced stable and repeatable force-displacement hysteresis, and achieved large energy dissipation capability.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} a HS- 75 profile {{which has}} a thickness of 0. 8 mm. The aim to observe this profile {{is to get the}} information whether this profile could replace timber as a house roof frame or not. This profile was observed in three different conditions. The first condition is analyzing the profile without any stiffener plate attach. The second condition is by attaching one <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> on the middle of the HS- 75 beam, and the last observed object is a HS- 75 beam with three <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> attach on certain places along the beam. The modeling and simulation of HS- 75 is important to predict the actual strength or some other properties such as strain, deflection or deformation. In this study, strength analysis of HS- 75 is simulated using finite element method (FEM). The profile strength analysis is simulated on three different combinations of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> commonly designed for house roof frame. The HS- 75 being analyzed is the beam total deformation. The first step in preparing the simulation is producing the HS- 75 product using the Ansys workbench software. Some HS- 75 properties should also be attached, such as the Young modulus, the Poison Ratio and the Tensile Ultimate Strength value. The HS- 75 beam being simulated has a length of 1800 mm, and a plate thickness of 0. 08 mm. The second step is dividing the beam in small part as meshing of the beam. The next step is attaching the loads work out on the beam. The last process is simulating the product by analyzing the directional deformation and the total deformation. FEM static stress analysis is also simulated on three different beam conditions. The results showed that the greater the load given to a light steel beam, then the deflection that occurs will also be greater. Based on the type of treatment conditions on HS- 75 light steel {{it was found that the}} deflection occurs at a maximum load of 6500 N is 14. 346 mm (without <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate),</b> 6. 5094 mm (one <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> attached) and 6. 159 mm (three diaphragm plates attached).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn modern automated manufacturing systems, {{there is a need}} for work-holding devices that provide for precision, accuracy, reliability, flexibility and remoteness of control. One of such devices is the diaphragm chuck which utilizes the strain energy of its varying thickness <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> for gripping action. The jaw-carrying <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> is deflected by a thrust load, and the jaws are bored or ground to the nominal diameter of the workpiece. Gripping action occurs when the workpiece is inserted into the jaws and the thrust is relieved. Designers and manufacturers of diaphragm chucks have in the past been limited to the use of empirical data for diaphragm chuck design. This design limitation has been caused by complex problems due to factors such as the varying thickness encastre <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate,</b> the gripping couples and the stiffening effects of the jaw slides. This work involved the establishment, by theory and experimental verification, of the design and performance parameters of a diaphragm chuck, and the provision of diaphragm chuck design methodology. The designer is therefore able to achieve the a priori design of the diaphragm chuck. In addition, the user is able to adapt existing diaphragm plates to achieve required gripping forces within existing constraints. The scope of this research is the static gripping action for any number of symmetric jaws. The design method is for diaphragm plates with small thickness taper, and carry detachable jaw slides. The concept of the equivalent constant thickness is applied to the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate.</b> Gripping action is divided into two major phases - the separate deflections of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> by a thrust load and symmetric couples. These deflections are equated to obtain the gripping force. This research concludes that the gripping force of a diaphragm chuck is closely predicted by the equivalent constant thickness method. Design data and methodology are provided for diaphragm chuck design. Thus, a designer can now design a diaphragm chuck based on a desired and pre-specified gripping force requirement...|$|E

It consists of a short length square hollow section (SHS) with a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> welded inside it. Under moderate earthquake loading, the device deforms plastically under applied shear forces, while the frame members remain essentially elastic. Subassemblies of the frame-to-device connection were designed and tested. The tests incorporate various SHS dimensions and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> aspect ratios. Both monotonic and cyclic loadings were employed in these tests. Based on the experimental results, the device with small d/t ratios showed stable hysteretic behavior with significant energy dissipation capacity. Strain hardening was observed in the post-yield region, which further increased the device's energy absorption capacity. Thin diaphragm plates suffered from shear buckling, strength degradation and pinched hysteresis was observed. Accumulation of out-of-plane deformation after repeated inelastic load cycles led to strength degradation and subsequent failure of the device. Welds on the perimeter of the diaphragm plates did not show damage.

The performance is influenced by the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> slenderness and by the in-plane rigidity of the surrounding SHS. Slender plates undergo elastoplastic shear buckling and exhibit stable though slightly pinched hysteresis response.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a series of}} cyclic tests on a yielding shear panel device of the form proposed by U. Dorka (unpublished) at the University of Kassel, Germany. The device consists of a short length of square hollow section (SHS) with a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> welded inside it. It is positioned between the braces and the main members of a braced frame, with the diaphragm lying in {{the plane of the}} frame, so that it is loaded in pure shear as the frame undergoes lateral deformation. An extensive series of tests on 100 mm square dissipative devices mounted in a single-storey, planar, K-braced frame was successfully performed, under both monotonic and cyclic loads. The devices proved easy and cheap to manufacture, fit, remove and replace. All the devices tested yielded at quite low deformations and sustained very large ductilities without failure. The load carried by the device continued to increase after yield, with a ratio of maximum force carried to yield force of around 1. 7 in most tests. While a device with a 2 mm diaphragm appeared to offer the maximum energy dissipation capacity, thinner devices were prone to buckling and to fracture under repeated large- amplitude cycling. A thickness of 3 mm (i. e. thickness to breadth ratio of 0. 03) is recommended as offering the best combination of dissipative capacity and robustness. A 3 mm device dissipated approximately 1. 3 kJ of energy when the frame in which it was fitted underwent a single displacement cycle of amplitude 30 mm.

40|$|Tubular columns own many {{structural}} and architectural advantages that, in certain cases, {{make them more}} favourable than open-section columns in steel moment-resisting frames. These advantages are sometimes underexploited due to the relative lack of design guidance on their moment joints to open-section beams, in particular on semi-rigid joints with special detailing for seismic actions. Different configurations of I-beam to tubular column joints have been investigated in the past, including through, internal and external diaphragm joints. This project investigates experimentally the cyclic behaviour of an external diaphragm joint between a steel I-beam and a circular hollow section column. The proposed joint includes two <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plates</b> (DPs) welded to the outer circumference of the column and bolted to the I-beam flanges with two tapered cover plates (TCPs). A web stub is welded to the column face and bolted to the I-beam web. Full-scale laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the hysteretic response and energy dissipative performance of the proposed joint under cyclic loading. TCPs were integrated in the joint to act as replaceable sacrificial components that dissipate most of the energy whilst {{the rest of the}} joint components remain elastic to minimise the post-seismic repair. The test specimens were identical except their TCPs that had the same geometry but differed in steel grade, size of bolt-holes, use of stiffeners or bolt preloading force. The use of higher grades of steel for the TCPs and stiffening them imposed higher strain demands in the beam and DPs and dissipated less energy than the joints with lower grades and unstiffened TCPs, respectively. The results confirmed that the main energy dissipation fuse in these joints was yielding in the TCPs while the other components remained elastic. Connection slippage created a second fuse for energy dissipation when the bolt preloading force was properly controlled, and the rotation of the plastic hinge region exceeded the minimum threshold of 25 mrad for medium ductility class structures...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 There {{are about}} 80 million single-family {{dwellings}} (SFD) in the United States, predominantly of wood-frame construction. Of these, 68 % are owner occupied. A home is typically {{the largest single}} investment of a family, and is often not covered by earthquake insurance, even where it is available. Of all SFD in America, 50 % were built before 1974, and 76 % built before 1990. Most wood frame SFD (WFSFD) were built to prescriptive code provisions before seismic requirements were introduced. This dissertation examines a broad field of seismic research applicable to WFSFD seismic analysis and the design, and to the retrofit of existing WFSFD. It summarizes the "state-of-the-art" of seismic experimentation and seismic evaluation, and provides observations and recommendations for future research. The study showed that performance based design (PBD) needs to develop a consensus on performance objectives for WDSFD with respect to damage and repair costs, including new design techniques which balance life-safety {{with the effects of}} damage to building finish materials. There is also a strong need to develop {{a better understanding of the}} effects of WDSFD components, attachment, the lateral force resisting system and how loads are distributed to these elements within the structure. To address concerns with limited pitched light-frame roof diaphragm experiments, ten full size (3. 7 x 4. 9 m) plywood roof diaphragms with metal plate connected (MPC) common and hip wood trusses or joists, typical of WFSFD construction were tested according to ASTM E 455. Specimens included three gable roof slopes of 33, 67 and 100 %, a hip roof of 33 % slope, and a flat roof. Gable and hip roofs experiments examined the effect of eave sheathing and gypsum ceilings on the bottom chord. Results showed eave plywood had negligible effect on diaphragm apparent stiffness; gable roofs had apparent stiffnesses that were about 50 % that of the flat roofs; and gypsum provided more than 1 / 3 of the total roof apparent stiffness for gable roofs at slopes of less than 33 %. There was no effect of pitch on ultimate roof strength in any configuration and all exhibited approximately the same ultimate shear strength. Failure modes of roofs included nail withdrawal, nail tear-through, metal plate tear-out on trusses and chord tensile failure. This dissertation also examines code provisions applicable to WFSFD seismic design, compares rigid and flexible diaphragm analyses for different geometries of “L” shaped WFSFD applying stiffness reductions due to differing roof geometry and pitch. These analyses are applied to historic earthquake damage reports and compared with a practical rigid, semi-rigid or flexible <b>diaphragm</b> <b>plate</b> FEM analysis method. This study determined that most WFSFD should be designed using an envelope method due to a mix of diaphragm types and the effects of roof pitch and geometry on the stiffness. Cases may occur where determination of semi-rigid or flexible diaphragm behavior is difficult because the code prescribed analysis is contradictory or fallacious. This suggests that use of semi-rigid finite element model (FEM) or a manual envelope method is prudent. The use of RP, FP or SP FEM methods can be simple and practical methods for analyzing WFSFD with a reasonable level of detail and effort...|$|E

A 2. 5 inch gap exists between the termination of the <b>diaphragm</b> connection <b>plate</b> and the flanges of the girder. This is a known fatigue prone detail subject to out of plane deformations which lead {{to the formation of}} distortion induced fatigue cracks. Previous research done on the Newport Viaduct used global finite element models to estimate the fatigue life of the web gap details and analyze potential retrofit options. The purpose of this project is to measure site specific strains caused by variable traffic loads and use this data to carry out a fatigue life analysis of the web gap details. In order to assist in the fatigue life analysis, localized finite element models of the web gap details were created. Given geometric differences, separate models were created for the top and bottom web gap details. The finite element models were created using FEMAP and solved using ABAQUS. The analysis results showed a high stress gradient in the web gap region with a maximum near the weld toe. Moreover, the results showed that the bottom web gap detail experienced higher stresses than the top web gap detail given the same loading. In-service monitoring of the Newport Viaduct was carried out for 23 days. Resistive foil type strain gages were installed directly in the top and bottom web gap regions and data was collected and processed at 100 Hz using the Rainflow algorithm to count the number of load cycles and their magnitude. The recorded data was used in conjunction with the bottom web gap finite element model and Miner’s Rule to determine an effective stress at the weld toe. The results predict a mean fatigue life of 22 years for the bottom web gap detail. Furthermore, current uncracked web gap details are expected to crack in the future.

The microphone consists of two conducting plates which form a capacitor. The lower plate (backplate) is rigid and fabricated in silicon. The upper <b>plate</b> (<b>diaphragm)</b> consists of a 6 pm thick metallized Mylar foil. In the air cavity between both plates a 1 pm thick silicon dioxide electret is present. The fabrication process, such as {{the construction of the}} silicon backplate, the realization of the electret and the diaphragm attachment are described.

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{the theory and}} design of dynamic "pressure augmentors" (<b>diaphragms</b> equal orifice <b>plates</b> and nozzles) and various forms of "pressure multipliers" (simple venturi tubes, Rateau-type multiple venturis, and a combination of shaped nozzle and simple venturi developed by the author). No complete theory of pressure multiplication is yet available; conditions of governing are discussed in relation to pressure-augmenting devices fitted either on the suction or the pressure side of the blower; fluctuations of output and power consumption caused {{by the presence of}} an augmentor are analyzed with the result that fitting on the pressure side appears generally preferable. Some considerations on the suitable design and selection of pressure-augmenting devices are appended...|$|R

40|$|The low {{frequency}} response of orifices (slit, circular <b>diaphragm,</b> and perforated <b>plate)</b> {{in the presence}} of mean flow is well predicted by a quasisteady theory. A refinement is brought to the theory by considering a Mach number dependent vena contracta coefficient. The measurements of the vena contracta coefficient of a slit agree well with the simple analytical expression existing {{in the case of the}} Borda tube orifice. The measured scattering matrix coefficients do not depend strongly on the geometry of the element. If the frequency is increased the moduli remain relatively unaffected while the arguments exhibit a complex behavior which depends on the geometry. From these considerations an anechoic termination efficient at high mass flow is designed...|$|R
30|$|In this article, a 2 D plate {{theory for}} the {{deformation}} and stress analyses of moderately thick functionally graded elastic, rectangular/square plates is presented using higher order shear and normal deformation theory (HOSNT 11). The material properties of FG plates {{are assumed to}} vary in the thickness direction according to an exponential law distribution. The governing equations of equilibrium are obtained using the PMPE. Navier solution technique employing double Fourier series is used to get the results with desired level of accuracy for simply (<b>diaphragm)</b> supported FG <b>plates.</b> For all cases studied, the computed displacement and stress parameters {{are found to be}} close to the exact analytical solutions. These numerical solutions with high accuracy can be used as benchmark to assess any other analytical/computational models for FG plates. Although the presented formulation for FG thick plates using HOSNT 11 involves large computations compared to FOST and CPT, the accuracy of the obtained numerical results is as good as the exact 3 D elasticity solutions. This particular higher order model (HOSNT 11) yields the most accurate results for the transversely loaded simply (<b>diaphragm)</b> supported FG <b>plates.</b> The benefit of this approach is that a 2 D theory is able to predict solutions close to 3 D elasticity solutions. The location of neutral surface of the FG plates depends upon the gradation index of FGMs and also its thickness ratio. The shift of the neutral surface from the middle surface of the FG plates is towards the stiffer material zone. It does not depend upon the aspect ratio of the plate and the external loads applied.|$|R
40|$|Some of the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) continuous, steel, welded {{plate girder}} bridges have {{developed}} web cracking in the negative moment regions at the <b>diaphragm</b> connection <b>plates.</b> The cracks are due to out-of-plane bending of the web near the top flange of the girder. The out-of-plane bending occurs in the "web-gap", which is {{the portion of the}} girder web between (1) the top of the fillet welds attaching the <b>diaphragm</b> connection <b>plate</b> to the web and (2) the fillet welds attaching the flange to the web. A literature search indicated that four retrofit techniques have been suggested by other researchers to prevent or control this type of cracking. To eliminate the problem in new bridges, AASHTO specifications require a positive attachment between the connection plate and the top (tension) flange. Applying this requirement to existing bridges is expensive and difficult. The Iowa DOT has relied primarily on the hole-drilling technique to prevent crack extension once cracking has occurred; however, the literature indicates that hole-drilling alone may not be entirely effective in preventing crack extension. The objective of this research was to investigate experimentally a method proposed by the Iowa DOT to prevent cracking at the diaphragm/plate girder connection in steel bridges with X-type or K-type diaphragms. The method consists of loosening the bolts at some connections between the diaphragm diagonals and the connection plates. The investigation included selecting and testing five bridges: three with X-type diaphragms and two with K-type diaphragms. During 1996 and 1997, these bridges were instrumented using strain gages and displacement transducers to obtain the response at various locations before and after implementing the method. Bridges were subjected to loaded test trucks traveling in different lanes with speeds varying from crawl speed to 65 mph (104 km/h) to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the study show that the effect of out-of-plane loading was confined to widths of approximately 4 in. (100 mm) {{on either side of the}} connection plates. Further, they demonstrate that the stresses in gaps with drilled holes were higher than those in gaps without cracks, implying that the drilling hole technique is not sufficient to prevent crack extension. The behavior of the web gaps in X-type diaphragm bridges was greatly enhanced by the proposed method as the stress range and out-of-plane distortion were reduced by at least 42 % at the exterior girders. For bridges with K-type diaphragms, a similar trend was obtained. However, the stress range increased in one of the web gaps after implementing the proposed method. Other design aspects (wind, stability of compression flange, and lateral distribution of loads) must be considered when deciding whether to adopt the proposed method. Considering the results of this investigation, the proposed method can be implemented for X-type diaphragm bridges. Further research is recommended for K-type diaphragm bridges...|$|R
