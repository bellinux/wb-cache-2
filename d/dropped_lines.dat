5000|$|In poetry, a dropped {{line is a}} line {{which is}} broken into two lines, but where the second part is {{indented}} to the horizontal position {{it would have had}} an unbroken line. For example, in the poem [...] "The Other Side of the River" [...] by Charles Wright, the first and second lines form a dropped line, as do the fourth and fifth lines: It's linkage I'm talking about,::::::::and harmonies and structures,And all the various things that lock our wrists to the past.Something infinite behind everything appears,:::::::::::::and then disappears. Charles Wright <b>Dropped</b> <b>lines</b> have a variety of functions and uses. In Robert Denham's words, a dropped line is [...] "a spatial as well as temporal feature, affecting both the eye and ear." [...] It may be used to determine the visual appearance of the line as a whole. Wright, for example, uses <b>dropped</b> <b>lines</b> to reference landscape paintings, especially by Paul Cézanne and Giorgio Morandi, which influenced his writing. As Joe Moffett notes, the dropped line [...] "can be seen as imitating the sense of horizontal rhythm prevalent in paintings by Cézanne." [...] Modern poets who are known for using <b>dropped</b> <b>lines</b> include Wright, Carl Phillips, and Edward Hirsch.|$|E
5000|$|Lines {{which are}} broken between two voices, {{as in the}} first two lines in the {{following}} scene in Hamlet, may also be called <b>dropped</b> <b>lines.</b> In this case, the line is broken to reflect a change in character while preserving a steady iambic pentameter across the entire line. In classical tragedy this technique of dividing a single verse line between two or more characters is called antilabe and functions [...] "as a means of heightening dramatic tension." [...] It was [...] "frequently utilized by Renaissance dramatists" [...] such as Shakespeare: HAMLET:Did you not speak to it?MARCELLUS::::::::My lord, I did;:But answer made it none: yet once methought:It lifted up its head and did address:Itself to motion, like as it would speak; William Shakespeare ...|$|E
50|$|Captain Charles T. Wilson of the Badger State and a {{skeleton}} crew of five men {{who volunteered to}} remain onboard immediately <b>dropped</b> <b>lines</b> to the crew {{who were in the}} water in an attempt to save them, and vectored the Greek freighter the Khian Star which had responded to the distress call to the survivors now scattered in the water around them, which later earned the Khian Star the Merchant Marine Gallant Ship Citation awarded by the Secretary of Transportation. Rescue in the heavy seas proved almost impossible, as many {{of the men in the}} water were washed away as they were being pulled up to the decks from the surging waves. By daybreak on the 27th, only 14 of the crew who were in the lifeboat had been recovered; the other 21 were never seen alive again.|$|E

50|$|A {{handling}} or <b>drop</b> <b>line</b> {{is mandatory}} safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20-30 meters in length {{attached to the}} balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end.

We have all frequently had the experience: reading {{to the end of}} one line of text, only to find that the next line has no grammatical connection. The answer is usually a <b>dropped</b> <b>line</b> or transposed lines. If several lines are printed in scrambled order, the rest can be a challenge to re-order...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the line}} is set, the angler need only check the line {{periodically}} throughout the day {{to see if any}} fish have been caught. While checking the line, one can also replace bait, untangle <b>drop</b> <b>lines,</b> and retrieve any fish on the line. Care is needed when checking or setting the line to make sure that no one is accidentally hooked in any part of the process.|$|R

50|$|Fishing gear damages reefs via direct {{physical}} {{contact with the}} reef structure and substrate. Gill nets, fish traps, and anchors break branching coral and cause coral death through entanglement. When fishermen <b>drop</b> <b>lines</b> by coral reefs, the lines entangle the coral. The fisher cuts the line and abandons it, leaving it attached to the reef. The discarded lines abrade coral polyps and upper tissue layers. Corals are able to recover from small lesions, but larger and recurrent damage complicates recovery.|$|R
50|$|Yellow garden spiders breed twice a year. The males roam {{in search}} of a female, {{building}} a small web near or actually in the female's web, then court the females by plucking strands on her web. Often, when the male approaches the female, he has a safety <b>drop</b> <b>line</b> ready, in case she attacks him. The male uses the palpal bulbs on his pedipalps to transfer sperm to the female. After inserting the second palpal bulb, the male dies, and is sometimes then eaten by the female.|$|R
5000|$|The {{population}} size is unknown, but numbers have decreased {{as much as}} 99% in some areas since the 1970s. This species is harvested, by commercial trawling or <b>drop</b> <b>lining,</b> for meat and liver oil (squalene). Upper-slope dogfish species are more vulnerable to capture than midslope species, because they are targeted throughout their vertical distribution and most of their local geographic distribution. [...] The low reproductive rate, late age of maturity, and long lifespan typical of these sharks means they are likely unable to recover quickly after depletion.|$|R

[...] If listened closely enough on [...] "Aware" [...] and [...] "More of the Same," [...] something can even be noticed, something more or less alien to hardcore records of the era: guitar solos.|$|R
50|$|While it is {{certainly}} possible to enjoy the sport of hot air ballooning without a chase vehicle, returning from the landing site by foot, bicycle, or hitch hiking, many balloonists opt {{to be followed by}} their ground crew in some sort of chase vehicle. Crew at the landing site can aid with the landing itself, by catching a <b>drop</b> <b>line</b> and guiding the balloon into a tight space; with extracting the balloon system from a remote location, such as deep in a farmer's field; and with packing up all the equipment.|$|R

50|$|Typically, the <b>drop</b> <b>lines</b> are set so {{that the}} hook of one line can not touch the hook of another line, to prevent the fish from getting tangled up in {{multiple}} lines, or getting tangled in lines with other fish already on the line. This might mean using lines just over 1 foot long and having the lines spaced in 3 foot intervals. It is also typical to avoid setting lines directly over stumps, branches or other obstacles that might cause the fish to get tangled. This is done so that any released fish {{has a better chance}} of being in good health.|$|R

5000|$|Constructing a trotline {{is quite}} simple. Basic {{supplies}} needed are fishing hooks, clamps, swivels, fishing line, and a durable cord or lightweight rope {{used for the}} main line. Before constructing the trotline, {{it is a good}} idea to measure the span of the body of water being fished in order to give the main line an appropriate length. Once this is done, <b>drop</b> <b>lines</b> are set along the main line by threading clamps on the line with swivels between them. Fishing line is attached to the swivels and hooks are tied to the end of the fishing line.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{capacitors}} developed quickly as better materials, such as mylar, {{were used in}} their production.

These largely physical sequences could be improvised or preplanned within the performance and were often used to enliven the audience when a scene was dragging, to cover a <b>dropped</b> <b>line</b> or cue, or to delight an expectant audience with the troupe's specialized lazzi.|$|R
