5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} mountains to the front lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> unskilled work, at an average of about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|E
5|$|Officials of the Port of Port Hedland, an {{important}} iron ore exporting terminal, closed and evacuated the port by {{the morning of}} 16 March, operating under standard emergency preparedness procedure. Overall, nearly 40 ships in the port were relocated from the port {{out of the path}} of the storm. The Port of Dampier was also closed. The Port of Port Hedland reopened to shipping on 18 March, about 52 hours after its closure, with little or no damage reported, though the downtime drove iron ore prices up for a time, and reduced exports of the raw material by 4.7% compared to the previous month. In total, Lua cost natural resources companies over $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in stunted industry, accounting <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of the monetary losses resulting from the storm.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August, one {{day after}} sinking Rosalie, Steinbrinck and the crew of UB-10 bettered their 30 June {{activities}} by sinking ten fishing smacks off Cromer. All ten ships, which ranged in size from 41 to 62 tons, were boarded and sunk by explosives. With these ten ships, the August tally for Steinbrinck and UB-10 was 7,309 tons, which accounted <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of the 7,709 tons sunk by Flanders Flotilla boats that month. In addition, counting the ships sunk {{at the end of}} July, UB-10 sank 23 ships in a 13-day span, nearly half the 55 ships sunk by the flotilla in both July and August.|$|E

5|$|Sea turtles nest {{on island}} beaches in the park. Park staff {{actively}} assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose {{an obstacle to}} adults and hatchlings. Loggerhead turtles {{are the most common}} sea turtle species and account <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of the turtle nests in the park. Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with mesh screen against the predation by abundant raccoon population. Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100% of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007, with a more usual average of more than 50% nest disturbance in most years. In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected, five partially disturbed nests were protected, and one nest was destroyed by predators. The threatened eastern indigo snake is also present on the island.|$|E
5|$|The daily {{rail and}} water Red Ball Express from Yokohama to Sasebo to Pusan began on July 23. By August it was {{operating}} with increased efficiency, demonstrating {{that it could}} promptly deliver any supplies available in Japan to Korea. On August 5, for example, it delivered 308tonnes; on August 9, 403tonnes; on August 22, 574tonnes; and on August 25, 949tonnes. The success of the Red Ball Express cut down the amount of airlift tonnage. This fell from 85tonnes on July 31 to 49tonnes on August 6. The express eliminated the need <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> airlift of supplies to Korea from Japan. It delivered supplies to Korea in an average time of 60–70 hours, while the airlift delivery varied from 12 hours to 5 days. The Red Ball delivery was not only more cost effective, it was more consistent and reliable.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Motoi Sakuraba, who had composed <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> the previous Tales games, and his regular partner Shinji Tamura, the latter {{working under the}} alias Hibiki Aoyama. While creating the soundtrack, Sakuraba {{was caught in the}} transition between sequenced to prerecorded streamed music, the latter of which gave room for rearrangements and improvisation mid-production. Sequenced music had been used up to Abyss, so {{it was the first time}} in the series that Sakuraba used this method, although he had done so for all his other projects at the time. For some tracks, a heavy piano element was used, with Sakuraba playing the instrument. Tamura worked with Sakuraba to create different feelings for the various tracks: character themes were melodic, dungeon themes were given a simple and minimalist mood, while town themes struck a balance between these two approaches. In addition to original tracks, three remixed tracks from other Namco Bandai games were included.|$|E

5|$|The {{restrictions}} against royalist {{candidates and}} voters were widely ignored, and the elections {{resulted in a}} House of Commons that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians. The new so-called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles promised lenience and tolerance. There would be liberty of conscience and Anglican church policy would not be harsh. He would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth. There would be pardons <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> his opponents except the regicides. Above all, Charles promised to rule in cooperation with Parliament. The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return, a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660. In Ireland, a convention had been called earlier in the year, and had already declared for Charles. On 14 May, he was proclaimed king in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
5|$|Maury Gertsman, {{who handled}} the {{cinematography}} <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> Universal Pictures films from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s, worked as director of photography on The Brute Man. Since the film focused on a disfigured serial killer, Gertsman sought to give the movie a dark, diseased look appropriate for the film's subject matter and urban setting. Although primarily a horror thriller film, Gertsman uses several film noir elements in his photography, including shadowed lighting, unbalanced compositions, and chiaroscuro contrasts between light and dark. As a result, The Brute Man features a bleak, at times dismal visual atmosphere. Hans J. Salter, who composed the scores {{for many of the}} Universal Pictures films of the 1940s and 1950s, worked as composer for The Brute Man as well. Salter's score for the film strongly resembled the music he composed for the Universal horror films Black Friday (1940) and The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944). Philip Cahn edited The Brute Man. Raymond Kessler and Ralph Slosser worked as dialogue director and assistant director, respectively, while John B. Goodman and Abraham Grossman worked as art directors. Other crew included Russell A. Gausman and Edward R. Robinson as set decorators, Joe Lapis as sound technician, Jack Pierce as make-up director, Carmen Dirigo as hair stylist, and Vera West as gowns supervisor.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} designer <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> {{entries in}} the series is Kimihiko Fujisaka. Initially a minor staff member at Cavia, the team were impressed by his skill as an amateur artist and he was recommended for the post of character designer for the game. The designs for both the characters and the world were influenced by armor and clothing of Medieval Europe. He returned in the same capacity for Drakengard 2, and later for Nier. Disliking some of his initial designs for Drakengard, he {{took the opportunity to}} remodel them more to his liking for the arcade game Lord of Vermilion. For Niers international release, the protagonist was redesigned from a teenager to an adult character. This was because the publishers felt an older character would appeal more to western players. In Drakengard 3, Fujisaka designed the protagonist Zero around the dark themes of the game, although some unusual elements were nearly cut. The other female characters were inspired by Puella Magi Madoka Magica, while the male characters, considered a low priority, were designed around male archetypes and approved quickly. For Nier: Automata, the designs were handled by Akihiko Yoshida, an artist noted for his work on the Final Fantasy series. While he was initially expected to refuse, he agreed as several staff at his company CyDesignation were fans of Nier. For his designs, Yoko requested he focus on smooth outlines and black coloring.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E
