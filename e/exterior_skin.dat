5|$|Raymond {{sought to}} {{mitigate}} {{the effects of the}} Pondicherry climate and oriented the Golconde dormitory (as it became known), so that its main facades faced north and south {{to make use of the}} prevailing breeze. A combination of moveable louvres on the <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> and woven teak sliding doors permitted ventilation without compromising on privacy. The building is still in use as an ashram today. It was the first modernist building in India.|$|E
500|$|Made {{to follow}} Aston's DB7 model, the DB9 is, {{according}} to Aston's initial press release, [...] "a contemporary version of classic DB design elements and characteristics". It retains the traditional Aston Martin grille and side strakes, {{and the design}} attempts to keep the lines simple and refined. The boot of the car is pronounced, {{like that of the}} DB4 and DB5. At the front, DB9 is without a separate nose cone, and has no visible bumpers. The <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> is largely aluminium, though the front bumpers and bonnet are composite.|$|E
2500|$|This method held a {{pre-eminent}} {{position in}} glassforming ever since its introduction {{in the middle}} of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used nowadays as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a '"gather" [...] which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.|$|E
50|$|Bennett {{suggests}} that hypothetical lunar buildings made of lunarcrete {{would most likely}} use a low-grade concrete block for interior compartments and rooms, and a high-grade dense silica particle cement-based concrete for <b>exterior</b> <b>skins.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, the {{high-performance}} aircraft designed since 1945 {{have made}} {{extensive use of}} skin structures machined from thick plate and extrusions, precluding the use of alclad <b>exterior</b> <b>skins.</b> Maintenance requirements increased as a result, and these stimulated research and development programs seeking higher-strength alloys with improved resistance to corrosion without cladding.|$|R
50|$|Architectural {{acoustics}} {{noise control}} practices include: interior sound reverberation reduction, inter-room noise transfer mitigation and <b>exterior</b> building <b>skin</b> augmentation.|$|R
2500|$|A South African {{government}} chemist {{examined a}} microscopic particle on the nylon netting {{next to the}} front-right pallet on Flight 295. The chemist found that the airflow patterns on the iron suggested that it travelled at a high velocity while in a molten state; therefore the fire on Flight 295 may have not been a flash fire triggered by packaging. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, said that this {{would suggest that the}} source of the fire would have had properties like a sparkler, with the source including its own oxidising agent. [...] A British fire and explosion analyst examined the <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> of the aircraft which had been located above the pallet; the analyst found that the skin became as hot as 300 degrees Celsius. [...] Bereswill said that {{it would be difficult for}} a fire to burn through the skin of an aircraft in-flight because of the cool airflow outside the aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|The upper stadium bowl <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> is a {{combination}} of red powder-coated corrugated metal and aluminum panels providing long-term durability with minimal maintenance. [...] Goals behind the design of the <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> included allowing natural light into the concourse while still protecting fans from the elements, and assuring ample air flow throughout the concourse and stadium for fan comfort without hindering the performance of student athletes.|$|E
50|$|Havel and Ruck altered two {{buildings}} {{owned by the}} Art League of Houston {{on the corner of}} Montrose Boulevard and Willard Street. The <b>exterior</b> <b>skins</b> of the houses were peeled off and used to create a large vortex that funneled into the small central hallway connecting the {{two buildings}} and eventually exited through a small hole into an adjacent courtyard. Inversion has become one of Houston’s most well-known, albeit vanished, sculptures. The structure was later demolished {{to make way for a}} new Art League building.|$|R
50|$|The Fleet-X was {{designed}} to be as light as possible, substituting polycarbonate for the rear quarter and tailgate windows. The concept used different colors to identify where lightweight alternate materials were used, including the <b>exterior</b> door <b>skin,</b> hood, and roof panels.|$|R
50|$|The outward {{appearance}} of the building is {{to be made in}} a style reminiscent of the windows of traditional Korean houses. Its design specifies the installation of an <b>exterior</b> super <b>skin</b> containing 40,000 LED panels that emit light of various colors.|$|R

30|$|The mimetic {{fabrication}} of a superhydrophobic surface was primarily {{inspired by the}} self-cleanable leaves of the lotus, which have an array of protrusions on the surface [15, 16]. The {{fabrication of}} self-cleanable surfaces has received {{a great deal of}} attention in various novel applications, such as for easy removal of undesirable contaminants from the surface of semiconductors and solar cells, prevention of water corrosion on the <b>exterior</b> <b>skins</b> of automobiles and building units, biomaterials used in clinical therapies that require minimal contamination, no-mass-loss transport of water droplet systems, and microarrays that require specific wetting properties of the substrates for precise spotting [17]. Especially in dry condition, which is common in optical or opto-electric applications, the superhydrophobic surface is expected to decrease the adhesion of dusts because the surface energy in surface-air interface decreases as the surface becomes superhydrophobic.|$|R

5000|$|The Ruan Center is locally {{famous as}} the [...] "rusty skyscraper", for its Cor-Ten steel {{cladding}} that sheds rust. The <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> {{is composed of}} 1,600 US tons of Cor-Ten steel, and 4,700 US tons of structural steel {{were used in the}} building's frame.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{construction}} of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals and hotels, many U.S. states and cities have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical analysis, {{in order to protect}} building occupants from exterior noise sources and sound generated within the building itself. With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment {{in order to determine the}} performance standard required for <b>exterior</b> building <b>skin</b> design.|$|R

50|$|The {{bases of}} the {{aesthetic}} designs to be used {{are rooted in the}} rich history of Afghan jewelry and rug designs. The buildings assembled in this project are most adaptable to various design themes, especially with the <b>exterior</b> glass <b>skin</b> being set within an outside screen of colored concrete in the shape of women's jewelry and rug patterns, extrapolated from culturally significant Afghan images. Green space in the plan is also incorporated in the shape of Necklace Park, a greenway running through the development.|$|R
5000|$|An 1860s {{refurbished}} {{barn and}} two corn cribs comprise the <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> of the building. [...] The rustic exterior, which evokes the “architectural vernacular of 19th-century East Tennessee, a plain language of silvery, time-worn siding, rough logs, and minimal geometries” is melded with modern Shaker-like simplicity on the interior.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the building is a standard column and beam steel superstructure, set upon a pre-stressed concrete pile foundation system. The structural steel is designed to resist a seismic event of up to 6.9 on the Richter scale, an extremely high standard for the Sacramento area. The <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> of the building consists of Minnesota Gray Buff limestone panels. Each panel weighs over four tons.|$|E
50|$|The Udderbelly can be {{used for}} a variety of {{different}} purposes as it can be adapted to contain a stage and all-seater 405 seat venue, or alternatively can be completely empty inside. The <b>exterior</b> <b>skin</b> can either be the upside-down purple cow, or alternatively a white, silver, or purple tent. The tent has an aluminum truss frame that is designed to be strong enough to carry several tonnes of weight in lighting and sound equipment.|$|E
5000|$|ANSI {{standards}} use {{a standard}} of measurement algorithm called [...] "effective dose" [...] that considers the different exposure of {{all parts of the}} body and then weights them differently. The interior of the human body is given more weight in this survey, and the <b>exterior,</b> including the <b>skin</b> organ, are given less weight.|$|R
50|$|Devgad is a taluka in Sindhudurg {{district}} of Maharashtra state in western India consisting of 98 villages. Devgad is known globally for its exports of locally grown Alphonso mangoes. Devgad is also widely {{known for its}} pure Alphonso mango cultivation/farming and the whole development has evolved due to undertaking of the cultivation of Alphonso mango farming. Mangos grown here are characterised by their distinct aroma, smooth <b>exterior,</b> thin <b>skin</b> and thick saffron pulp. The variety {{is different from the}} Alphonso mangoes grown in the Ratnagiri district. Such is the popularity of the Devgad Alphonso Mango that vendors often pass off other similar looking mangoes under the name of Devgad Alphonso.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of {{construction}} of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals, and hotels, many states and cities have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical analysis, {{in order to protect}} building occupants. With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment {{in order to determine the}} performance standard required for <b>exterior</b> building <b>skin</b> design. The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 dBA). The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: glazing (glass thickness, double pane design etc.), perforated metal (used internally or externally), [...] roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports, and mounting of through-the-wall air conditioners.|$|R

Together, the various elements of the design enable a 70% energy savings over a typical large office tower.|$|E
50|$|The fruit itself {{becomes a}} dark orange color upon ripening, and is {{typically}} round or oblong, maturing to a size of about 13 cm {{in length and}} 10 cm in diameter. Its exocarp, or <b>exterior</b> <b>skin,</b> is covered in small spines. Its mesocarp is dense, light-orange in color, and has a mild taste with flavor {{similar to that of}} cucumber. The edible seeds are brown or black in color, surrounded by dark red membraneous sacs, and have a mild, nutty flavor.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also common}} for {{competitive}} swimmers to shave hair off their legs, arms, and torsos, to reduce drag {{and provide a}} heightened [...] "feel" [...] for the water by removing the <b>exterior</b> layer of <b>skin</b> along with the body hair. [...] Some professional soccer players also shave their legs. One {{of the reasons is}} that they are required to wear shin guards and in case of a skin rash the affected area can be treated more efficiently.|$|R

50|$|The Mahaffey Theater {{first opened}} in the spring 1965 {{as part of the}} city of St. Petersburg's Bayfront Center {{entertainment}} complex. It was first renovated in 1987-1988. In 2004 the demolition of the Bayfront Arena cleared the way for extensive $20 million building improvement project which included renovation of 95,000 sq. ft. and replacement of the building's mechanical, plumbing, fire protection and electrical systems. A new three-story showcase glass atrium was designed to highlight the south and east elevations and a 4,000 sq. ft. addition provided a new lobby, new elevators, stairwells and public restrooms. The entire building also received new roofing and <b>exterior</b> stucco <b>skin.</b> Work also included the addition of an elevator in the adjacent parking garage and improvements to the parking lot, sidewalks and landscaping. The building was renamed The Mahaffey Theater for the Performing Arts for a local St. Petersburg family who had contributed significantly to the building's capital campaign.|$|R
