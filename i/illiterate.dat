5|$|Although {{electoral fraud}} was common, {{it was not}} ignored by the Emperor, {{politicians}} or observers of the time. The problem was considered a major issue and {{attempts were made to}} correct abuses, with legislation (including the electoral reforms of 1855, 1875 and 1881) repeatedly being enacted to combat fraud. The 1881 reforms brought significant changes: they eliminated the two-stage electoral system, introduced direct and facultative voting, and allowed the votes of former slaves and enfranchised non-Catholics. Conversely, <b>illiterate</b> citizens were no longer allowed to vote. Participation in elections dropped from 13% to only 0.8% in 1886. In 1889, about 15% of the Brazilian population could read and write, so disenfranchising the <b>illiterate</b> does not solely explain the sudden fall in voting percentages. The discontinuation of mandatory voting and voter apathy may have been significant factors contributing to the {{reduction in the number of}} voters.|$|E

40|$|About 7. 5 million {{adults in}} Germany cannot {{read and write}} {{properly}} despite attending school for several years. They {{are considered to be}} functional <b>illiterates.</b> Since the ability to read and write is crucial for being employed and socially accepted, we developed a literacy training to overcome these deficits. In this study, we investigate the structural changes induced by the training. A group of 20 functional <b>illiterates</b> and 20 adult normal readers participated in the study. Group differences as well as intervention-related changes in gray (voxel-based morphometry, VBM) and white matter (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, TBSS, applied to fractional anisotropy, FA, obtained with diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) were assessed in functional <b>illiterates</b> and normal reading controls. VBM analyses revealed decreased gray matter intensities in functional <b>illiterates</b> compared to normal readers before training in several reading-related brain regions such as the superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus. Using TBSS, functional <b>illiterates</b> showed reduced FA values in the genu of the corpus callosum. After training, both the gray matter intensities and FA values increased in functional <b>illiterates</b> and were no longer statistically different from controls' pre-test data. Moreover, the increase was positively correlated with reading and writing skills. The findings suggest that poor literacy skills are associated with several structural abnormalities in reading-related brain areas. In addition, we showed that while literacy skills of functional <b>illiterates</b> improved after training, the structural differences to controls disappeared...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a general}} feeling that the {{technique}} used so far in national censuses to identify <b>illiterates</b> among adult populations does not give valid results, as it consists in asking a person to evaluate his ability to read and write. Another criterion suggested by educationalists to identify <b>illiterates</b> is the non-completion of 4 grades of primary school. It is hypothesized that the criterion of self-evaluation grossly underestimates the number of <b>illiterates,</b> {{due to the fact}} that many of them claim to be literates. It is believed that the criterion of the non-completion of 4 grades would be much more reliable and the number of <b>illiterates</b> so identified should be much higher. To verify this hypothesis, comparable census data from 6 Latin American countries and one Arab country were analyzed. It was found that in all these countries the pattern of differences between the results obtained by using both criteria corroborates the hypothesis. In addition, it was discovered that the differences between the numbers of self-evaluated <b>illiterates</b> and the number of those finishing less than 4 grades are much greater among males than among females. This phenomenon is explained hypothetically by pointing to the stronger tendency among male <b>illiterates</b> to claim being literate, as well as to their having more opportunities to become literate, even without 4 grades of school. Some proposals for further research to validate the school criterion of illiteracy are suggested...|$|R

The program was originally designed for young German children (IntraActPlus, Jansen, Streit, & Fuchs, 2007) and was adapted in this study for use with functional adult <b>illiterates.</b> Seven adult <b>illiterates</b> were trained in reading single letter-sound correspondences and single syllables from the curriculum over a 12 week period. Individual learning development in reading syllables was measured weekly using curriculum-based measurement probes while transfer effects on word reading was evaluated using a standardized reading test.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this article is combating adult {{illiteracy}} in the People’s Republic of Poland. The existing knowledge concerning the topic has been supplemented with the analysis of the archival documents, currently being in possession of the Central Archives of Modern Records in Warsaw. It describes how <b>illiterates</b> were recognised in the society, in what way they were encour­aged to train new skills and how attending the courses was made possible for them. The analysed documents include censors’ reviews of manuals, press articles, letters wrote by former <b>illiterates</b> and other valuable records. The communists were combating illiteracy not only {{in the name of the}} social progress, but mostly motivated by their quest to broaden the possibilities of ideological indoctrination – during the courses organised for <b>illiterates</b> and later on. This is why the selection of manuals and other publications addressed to former <b>illiterates</b> was propagandist. The strategic importance of the matter was expressed by Vladimir Lenin himself: “Socialism cannot be built by illiterates” (W.
