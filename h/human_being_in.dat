5|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} {{books of}} the Bhagavata Purana are widely {{considered to be a}} poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the Harivamsa. Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (lila), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna's life is closer to that of a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> Harivamsa, but is a symbolic universe in the Bhagavata Purana, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The Bhagavata Purana manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.|$|E

25|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The Crash Test Dummy is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury of a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> an automobile crash. This data can include variables such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision for use in crash tests. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they may cost over US$400,000.|$|E

25|$|Near that temple is a {{very large}} tree with {{widespread}} branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled. A golden chain encircles that temple and hangs over the gables of the building. Those who approach see its gleam from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. Every day they sacrifice one <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of 'fair and reasonable' {{must therefore be}} something else, and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average employee, regarded as a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a civilised community. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement - an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other - {{it seems to me}} that the framers of the agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of living as a civilised being. If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E

However, a {{disaster}} from the new war forces them {{to move in with}} their former comrades Andrew Waltfeld and Murrue Ramius at their shared mansion in Orb. Lacus is almost killed in an assassination attempt by Coordinators but Kira defeats the assassins with the Freedom. She, along with Murrue, Kira, Andrew, and most of the Archangel's crew reunite hoping to stop the new war. Lacus, along with Andrew, go into space, to see what the situation is at the PLANTs. She delivers the newly built Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice mobile suits to Kira and Athrun during her returning. She also reveals her presence to the public and the fact that ZAFT has been using an impersonation of her for their own benefit. Later, Lacus and Kira reveal to the crew of the Archangel Durandal's plan to assign behavioral genes to every <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> order to render war and conflict obsolete. Lacus then leads Terminal and its allies in the final battle to stop Durandal.|$|E

25|$|Historically, LDLT {{began with}} {{terminal}} pediatric patients, {{whose parents were}} motivated to risk donating {{a portion of their}} compatible healthy livers to replace their children's failing ones. The first report of successful LDLT was by Dr. Christoph Broelsch at the University of Chicago Medical Center in November 1989, when two-year-old Alyssa Smith received a portion of her mother's liver. Surgeons eventually realized that adult-to-adult LDLT was also possible, and now the practice is common in a few reputable medical institutes. It is considered more technically demanding than even standard, cadaveric donor liver transplantation, and also poses the ethical problems underlying the indication of a major surgical operation (hemihepatectomy or related procedure) on a healthy <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> <b>In</b> various case series, the risk of complications in the donor is around 10%, and very occasionally a second operation is needed. Common problems are biliary fistula, gastric stasis and infections; they are more common after removal of the right lobe of the liver. Death after LDLT has been reported at 0% (Japan), 0.3% (USA) and <1% (Europe), with risks likely to decrease further as surgeons gain more experience in this procedure. Since the law was changed to permit altruistic non-directed living organ donations in the UK in 2006, the first altruistic living liver donation took place in Britain in December 2012.|$|E

Its term [...] "troubled child" [...] is a good summary of the position of the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> relation to God. The wording of its conclusion, [...] "In deine tiefen Wunden, da ich stets Heil gefunden" [...] ("into Your deep wounds, where I have always found salvation") leads to the following recitative. The voice is accompanied by an obbligato viola (violoncello piccolo in the Leipzig version) in a lively figuration.|$|E

Fishburne stated, [...] "The personal stuff that I have as Ellis Cheever was telling my fiancée, soon-to-be wife, Sanaa Lathan, {{to get out of}} town, to leave, to pack up, to not talk.

The song was also included on the compilation albums GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009). [...] "Frozen" [...] was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and it was produced in collaboration with William Orbit. A mid-tempo electronica ballad, [...] "Frozen" [...] talks about a cold and emotionless <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, a judge in Belgium ruled that [...] "Frozen" [...] was plagiarized from a song by Salvatore Acquaviva, and it was banned from the region.

[...] Scott Heisel of Punknews.org felt that the Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 version maintained the band's distinctive sound, and signing to a major record label had not changed the band's music. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic noted that the Siren Song of the Counter Culture version {{reminded him of a}} harder version of songs by the Offspring, and that it was controlled enough to appeal to casual rock fans.|$|E
500|$|Hoskins starts {{this chapter}} by observing that in 1500 in Tudor times there were roughly three sheep for every <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> England, perhaps 8 million sheep to {{two and a}} half million people. There were four million acres of {{hardwood}} forest, remembered now as Epping Forest, the Forest of Arden, Sherwood Forest, the Forest of Dean, Wychwood and many others. A village might be surrounded by a single enormous thousand acre field, shared amongst all the village's farmers. There were extensive heaths and wild places, largely uninhabited, with [...] "no industrial smoke, nothing faster on the roads than a horse, no incessant noises from the sky". The first enclosures and the flowering of rural England, country houses and parks such as the magnificent Burghley House and Knole date from this period up to Georgian times.|$|E

500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness. Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois. and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.|$|E
500|$|The main {{setting of}} the series is the eponymous mining {{spaceship}} Red Dwarf, which is [...] long, [...] tall, and [...] wide and is operated by the Jupiter Mining Corporation. In the first episode set sometime in the late 22nd century, an on-board radiation leak of cadmium II kills everyone except lowest-ranking technician Dave Lister, who is in suspended animation at the time, and his pregnant cat, Frankenstein, who is safe in the cargo hold. Following the accident, the ship's computer Holly keeps Lister in stasis until the radiation levels return to normal – a process that takes three million years. Lister therefore emerges as the last <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the universe – but not alone on-board the ship. His former bunkmate and immediate superior Arnold Judas Rimmer (a character plagued by failure) is resurrected by Holly as a hologram to keep Lister sane. At the same time, a creature known only as Cat is the last member on board of Felis sapiens, a race of humanoid felines that evolved in the ship's hold from Lister's cat, Frankenstein, and her kittens during the 3 million years that Lister was in stasis.|$|E

Bill Clinton's campaign promise of [...] "two for the price of one" [...] led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as [...] "co-presidents" [...] or sometimes use the Arkansas label [...] "Billary". The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt. From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures. Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's [...] "politics of meaning" [...] to overcome what she saw as America's [...] "sleeping sickness of the soul"; that would lead to a willingness [...] "to remold society by redefining what it means to be a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium." ...|$|E
