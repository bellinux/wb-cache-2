5000|$|Hair - Around {{the time}} of jazz dancing's {{greatest}} popularity, a television dance act called Hot Gossip (went on {{to be known as}} Ruby Flipper) had several black members who had dyed their close-cropped <b>hair</b> <b>bleach</b> blonde. This style somehow filtered its way in to the underground Jazz Dance scene and many dancers copied the look. This opened the door to other experimental colour treatments for hair with 'Zebra' print and 'Leopard' print treatments becoming popular and a general 'punk rock' style was seen around many northern venues. Other memorable traits included 'Tramlines' - where lines were cut into the close cropped hair to give the appearance of a parting. Sometimes the parting went {{all the way around the}} head quite similar to the lines on a standard green tennis ball. Another style that was popular was using the hair clippers to create a sharp pointed 'receding hairline' either side of the head.|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{symptoms}} among hairdressers {{are often}} {{ascribed to the}} use of bleaching powders that contain persulfate salts. Such salts can act as allergens and airway irritants but the mechanisms behind the negative health effects are not fully known. In order to understand why some hairdressers experience respiratory symptoms during, and after, sessions of <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching,</b> it is of importance to characterize how exposure occurs. In this work we used time and particle size resolved instrumentation with the aim to measure the concentration of particles that hairdressers are exposed to during sessions of <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching.</b> We also used filter samples to collect particles for quantitative determination of persulfate (S 2 O 8 (2 -)) content and for analysis by light microscopy. Two different types of bleaching powders were used, one marked as dust-free and one without this marking (denoted regular). The time resolved instrumentation revealed that particles 10 µm) were emitted during application of the bleaching, when both the regular and the dust-free powders were used. The measured level of persulfate, sampled in the breathing zone of the hairdressers, was on average 26 µg m(- 3) when the regular powder was used and 11 µg m(- 3) when the dust-free powder was used. This indicates that use of dust-free powder does not eliminate exposure to persulfates, it only lowers the concentration. We show that the site of sampling, or position of the hairdresser with regards to the <b>hair</b> being <b>bleached,</b> is of high importance in the determination of persulfate levels and exposure. This work focuses on the physical and chemical characterization of the particles released to the air and the results are important for accurate exposure assessments. Accurate assessments may in turn lead {{to a better understanding of}} why some hairdressers experience respiratory symptoms from <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching</b> sessions...|$|R

40|$|Occupational asthma among hairdressers {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{for some years}} and cases of work related asthma due to <b>hair</b> <b>bleaches</b> containing persulphates and hair dyes have been reported. The extent of the disease among hairdressers remains unknown. An investigation was carried out on an entire hairdressing salon, which specialised in <b>hair</b> <b>bleaching</b> and colouring and which employed 23 staff. On the basis of history and specific and non-specific bronchial provocation testing, four out of 23 staff {{were found to have}} occupational asthma due to the persulphate salts contained in <b>hair</b> <b>bleaches.</b> Only one of these had a positive skinprick test response to persulphate salts. Tests for non-specific bronchial reactivity to histamine in this work force were more sensitive for the diagnosis of asthma than simple lung function tests or recordings of peak flow rates performed four times daily for three weeks. The response to these agents was studied in greater detail by specific bronchial provocation tests in 14 members of the salon as well as one hairdresser from elsewhere with occupational asthma, three individuals with non-occupational asthma, and four normal subjects. Only those with a history of work related asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity responded positively, confirming that the response to bleach powders was specific. Studies of pulmonary mechanics after challenge showed that the response arose from changes in airway calibre not lung volumes. Measurement of neutrophil chemotactic activity after challenge showed significant rises in those affected, suggesting that mast cells may play a part in the pathogenesis of occupational asthma due to persulphates...|$|R
40|$|Persulfates (ammonium and {{potassium}} persulfate) are anorganic salts that {{are widely used}} in <b>hair</b> <b>bleach</b> formulas to accelerate the bleaching process. Persulfates {{have been reported to}} cause both delayed-type and immediate reactions.

The mechanism of immediate reactions caused by persulfates is unclear.

40|$|Ammonium persulfate {{is widely}} used to "boost" {{peroxide}} hair bleaches. These persulfates can produce a variety of cutaneous and respiratory responses, including allergic eczematous contact dermatitis, irritant dermatitis, localized edema, generalized urticaria, rhinitis, asthma, and syncope. Some of these reactions appear to be truly allergic while others appear {{to be due to}} the release of histamine on a nonallergic basis. Patch tests may be performed with 2 % to 5 % aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate. Scratch tests may result in asthma and syncope. In some patients, merely rubbing a saturated solution of ammonium persulfate into the skin will evoke a large urticarial wheal. Hairdressers should be made aware that these ammonium persulfate <b>hair</b> <b>bleach</b> preparations may provoke severe reactions and should seek medical attention if the client complains of severe itching, tingling, a burning sensation, hives, dizziness, or weakness. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Persulfate salts are potent {{oxidizing}} agents in <b>hair</b> <b>bleach</b> products that accelerate the bleaching process. Ammonium and potassium persulfates may cause delayedtype and immediate skin reactions. Also allergic asthma and rhinitis have been described. Objectives: Ammonium and potassium persulfates may cause delayed-type and immediate skin reactions. Also allergic asthma and rhinitis have been described. Methods: Case 1 A 36 -year-old female hairdresser suffered from contact urticaria after exposure to bleaching agents for ten years. She also experienced asthma and rhinitis when {{she worked in}} the hair salon for the same period. Several minutes after accidental contact with bleaching powder she developed an urticarial reaction on the neck, facial angioedema, and dyspnoea. We performed prick-to-prick tests with serial dilutions of freshly prepared persulfates starting with 0. 1 %. Prick-to-prick tests with ammonium persulfate 1. 0 % aqua and potassium persulfate 1. 0 % aqua showed wheals of 8 mm (positive control 6 mm). Ten minutes after the prick-to-prick tests, she suffered from asthmatic complaints which cleared after inhalation of b 2 -sympathicomimetics. Patch testing with ammonium persulfate 2. 5 % petrolatum and potassium persulfate 2. 5 % aqua resulted in wheals at the test site after 20 minutes. Prick tests with ammonium and potassium persulfate 1. 0 % aqua were negative in four controls. Case 2 A 48 -year-old woman showed pruritus of the scalp and facial angioedema which started several minutes after application of a hair bleaching product. Forty-five minutes after application she fainted with increased heart rate and low blood pressure. She was treated with clemastine, dexamathasone, and saline and transferred to a hospital. Prick tests with ammonium persulfate 2. 0 % aqua and potassium persulfate 2. 0 % aqua showed wheals of 4 mm (positive control 7 mm). Intradermal testing with ammonium persulfate 0. 1 % aqua and potassium persulfate 0. 1 % aqua showed wheals of almost 20 mm. Several hours after the intradermal tests, she became increasingly dizzy which cleared after treatment with fexofenadine. Patch tests with ammonium persulfate 2. 5 % petrolatum and potassium persulfate 2. 5 % aqua were negative after 20 minutes. Intradermal tests with ammonium and potassium persulfate 0. 1 % aqua were negative in three controls. Results: We presented two cases of immediate type hypersensitivity to persulfates with an anaphylactic reaction in one patient. These reactions have never been adequately documented. Conclusion: It seems that the reactions are immunologic and based on release of IgE. In patients suspected of allergic reactions to persulfates, prick and patch tests should be performed. Because severe respiratory symptoms and anaphylaxis may occur, we recommend to start with prick-toprick testing...|$|E
