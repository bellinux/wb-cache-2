50|$|The Moses <b>King</b> <b>Brick</b> and Tile Works is a {{historic}} brickworks located at 738 North Coal Street in Colchester, Illinois. The complex includes King's Folk Victorian home, four of the original seven beehive kilns, the factory building and its drying tunnels, two exhaust stacks, and various outbuildings. Moses King established the brickworks on his own land, which held one of the county's richest clay deposits, in 1881. The brickworks was {{a major part of}} Colchester's clay industry, which developed as a way of using excess coal from the city's more prominent coal mining industry; it eventually became one of the city's main economic drivers, along with coal and the railroad. While coal and clay both declined in Colchester in the twentieth century, the brickworks survived as a producer of buff brick, ultimately becoming the last surviving brickwors in the city. It closed in the 1960s when buff brick declined in favor of colored brick, which could be more easily obtained from other sources.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{a village}} of rural loveliness which attracts many summer boarders. The Street, 200 feet 12 rods wide and two miles long, is bordered by grand old elms forming a natural arbor. The Soldiers' Monument with a stone cannon, and a stone clock tower are the modern {{features}} of the village. The Governor John Cotton Smith House, a fine specimen of Georgian architecture, is still perfectly preserved. The fine old George <b>King</b> <b>brick</b> house (1800) is {{at the head of}} the street. The C. C. Tiffany house (1757) is perhaps the oldest in the town. The old Pardee brick house (James Pardee House) (1782) stands by the Stone Bridge. The Prindle house is a spacious gambrel roof dwelling on Gay St. near the charming lakelet which furnishes a natural reservoir for the village water supply. The picturesque old Gay House has the builder's initials [...] "M. G. 1765" [...] on a stone in the gable.|$|E

50|$|On {{this present}} day, Withymoor Village {{is a local}} housing estate that {{consists}} of approximately 2000 houses but Withymoor was not always a housing estate. In 1971 the site of Withymoor was an opencast colliery. The collieries were called the Plants Hollow and Gayfield Collieries which are now names of streets on the estate. Also while the collieries were on Withymoor there was also another business called William <b>King's</b> <b>Brick</b> Works which was a famous producer of yellow bricks from the local clay which was used in both Amblecote Church and Quarry Bank Church.|$|R
5|$|The two {{defensive}} towers appearing {{along the}} near shoreline of the islet are still present, their structures remain intact although their exteriors are considerably altered. The leftmost is Birger Jarls torn {{located in the}} north-western corner of the islet and erroneously named after Birger Jarl, by tradition attributed to be the founder of Stockholm. The other is the so-called Vasatornet ("Tower of Vasa"), today forming the southern tower of the Wrangel Palace. For {{the construction of the}} towers and other defensive structures, the <b>king</b> used <b>bricks</b> from the monastery Klara kloster located just north of the city but absent in the painting. Since the monastery is known to have been demolished immediately following the introduction of Protestantism in 1527, the painting is, again, a credible source rendering the city as it appeared in 1535.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the church dates back to a chapel {{belonging}} to the Solna parish (Solna Municipality now {{being one of the}} suburbs of Stockholm) and at the time built {{on the outskirts of the}} parish. It is first mentioned in 1311, and archaeological excavations in 1948 and one more recently documented its location just south of the present church and reconstructions showed its extent was limited to 8×13 meters. [...] The parish itself is believed to be a century or so younger than the chapel as the church is first mentioned as ecclesia parrochialis in the 1430s. For defensive purposes the demolition of the church, together with other churches on the ridges surrounding the medieval city, was ordered by King Gustav Vasa following the Reduction in 1527. It is therefore believed the church was built in brick rather than wood, since the <b>king</b> needed <b>bricks</b> for his defensive structures.|$|R
5000|$|Erishum I or Erišu(m) I (inscribed me-ri-šu, or mAPIN-ìš {{in later}} texts but always {{with an initial}} i in his own seal, inscriptions, and those of his {{immediate}} successors, “he has desired,”) c. 1905 BC — c. 1866 BC (short chronology) or c. 1974 BC — c. 1935 BC (middle chronology), son of Ilu-shuma, was the thirty-third ruler of Assyria {{to appear on the}} Assyrian King List. He reigned for forty years. One of two copies of the Assyrian King List which include him gives his reign length as only 30 years, but this contrasts with a complete list of his limmu, some 40, which are extant from tablets recovered at Karum Kanesh. He had titled himself both as, [...] "Ashur is king, Erishum I is vice-regent" [...] and the, “Išši’ak Aššur”ki (“steward of Assur”), at a time when Assur was controlled by an oligarchy of the patriarchs of the prominent families and subject to the “judgment of the city”, or dīn alim. According to Veenhof, Erishum I’s reign marks the period when the institution of the annually appointed limmu (eponym) was introduced. The Assyrian King List observes of his immediate predecessors, “in all six <b>kings</b> known from <b>bricks,</b> whose limmu have not been marked/found”.|$|R
5000|$|Sharru relates that he {{was once}} a slave and that as {{followed}} the slave masters down this very road, a fellow slave Megiddo pointed out how the farmers weren't plowing deeply enough and consequently wouldn't get a very good yield for their crops. Another slave named Zabado spoke up {{and said that the}} farmers were wise because who wanted to work hard for someone else? Megiddo replied that he liked to work and he liked to do good work, that work had brought him all the good things in his life that he'd ever had. Zabado scoffed at this, pointing out that Megiddo was now a slave {{just like the rest of}} them. That night, Sharru crept to the edge of the slave pens and asked Godoso, one of the guards for advice. Godoso told Sharru to make the people at the slave auction want to buy Sharru as a slave, to avoid being sold to the <b>king</b> as a <b>brick</b> carrier to build the walls of Babylon. Sharru relates this to Megiddo the next morning and they resolve to try to make people want to buy them as a slave at the auction that day. The famous works of ancient Babylon, its walls, temples hanging gardens and great canals, were built by slave labor, mainly prisoners of war, which explains the inhuman treatment they received. This force of workmen also included many citizens of Babylon and its provinces who had been sold into slavery because of crimes or financial troubles. It was a common custom for men to put themselves, their wives or their children up as a bond to guarantee payment of loans, legal judgments or other obligations. In case of default, those so bonded were sold into slavery. George S. Clason Just before the auction, Megiddo counseled Sharru to [...] "treat work like a friend, to make thyself like it. Don't mind because it is hard." [...] A farmer then came up to him and Megiddo inquired of the farmer's [...] "farm and crops, soon convincing him that he would be a valuable man." [...] Upon hearing that a man was looking for a baker, Sharru spoke up and asked, [...] "Why should a good baker like thyself seek another baker of inferior ways? Would it not be easier to teach a willing man like myself thy skilled ways? Look at me, I am young, strong and like to work. Give me a chance and I will do my best to earn gold and silver for thy purse." [...] The baker then purchased Sharru. After learning diligently all that he could about baking, Sharru began to take over more and more of the duties of running the bakery. He created a plan to market baked goods throughout the city and thus bring his master, named Nana-naid, even more money. Nana-naid was so impressed by Sharru's diligence and willingness to work that he let Sharru keep a portion of the extra money that was being made. Sharru soon acquired a set of loyal customers, including a man named Arad Gula, who praised Sharru's industrious spirit and ability to market baked goods. In his daily journeys around the city for his master, Sharru ran into Megiddo who was also earning more money for the farmer and had been promoted to foreman. Megiddo was about to buy his freedom and bring his family to live with him as he continued working for the farmer as a free man. Sharru confided that Arad Gula, at that time, was also a slave who was about to buy his freedom.|$|R
