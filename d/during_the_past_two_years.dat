25|$|Winthrop {{also studied}} {{astronomy}} with his 3½ foot refracting telescope. In 1664, {{he wrote a}} letter to Sir Robert Moray regarding a “fifth satellite of Jupiter” that he believed he observed. This was only fifty years after Galileo discovered the first four moons of Jupiter. His letter was cautious since he thought it may be a faint star in close proximity to the other satellites. Winthrop requested that his observations be validated by Lawrence Rooke, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, but nothing was verified. Dr. Edward Emerson Barnard, who was credited for discovering Amalthea, Jupiter’s fifth moon, wrote “It makes me feel specially humiliated just now, for I have only caught the feeblest glimpses of the 5th satellite with the 40-inch <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> Winthrop’s telescope must have been specially good for him to see this faint object with his imperfect instrument in 1664.” Although today it is assumed that Winthrop probably did see a faint star, he is still credited for being a dedicated and vigilant observer of natural phenomenon.|$|E

Tsai commented, [...] "The album refers to film script, acting or performance, which helped me gain wisdom and experiences <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> With the new witty music, I hope my fans {{will find it}} playful and joyful as well as bringing optimism to the future." [...] The album garnered critical acclaim and was declared it as [...] "easily the best album of the year". Commercially, the album sold more than 85,000 copies in Taiwan, and made her the best-selling female singer {{of the year in}} Taiwan. The title track, [...] "Play", reached number one on the Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year. The track, [...] "The Third Person and I", reached number eight on the Hit FM Top 100. The music video of [...] "Play" [...] became the most-viewed music video of Taiwan in 2014 and helped thrust her into the international spotlight. Nolan Feeney from Time magazine commented, [...] "It might be the year's best pop music video." [...] She was nominated for an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Taiwanese Act. The album also received ten Golden Melody Award nominations—nine in the 26th Golden Melody Awards and one in the 27th—and eventually won for Best Mandarin Album and Best Vocal Recording Album. In December 2015, she performed the song, [...] "Play", at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards, where she won for Best Asian Artist. In May 2015, she began her Play World Tour, and the show was her first collaboration with Live Nation Entertainment. In October 2015, a worker was killed when the sound, lighting, and video rigging collapsed at a concert that she was planning for at Guangxi Sports Center in Nanning. Tsai expressed sadness on her blog.|$|E

I suppose there have always been the careful, painstaking writers, the men who are always taken so seriously by their fellow craftsmen. It seems to be the unconventional man who is so rare--I mean the honestly unconventional man, who has to express himself in his own big way because the conventional way isn't big enough, because ne needs room and freedom.|$|E
