5|$|Dewey's was not {{the only}} library {{classification}} available, although it was the most complete. Charles Ammi Cutter published the Expansive Classification in 1882, with initial encouragement from Melvil Dewey.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the speeches, there are fifty-six prologues (openings of speeches). They were collected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> of Alexandria by Callimachus, who believed them genuine. Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are authentic. Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and their authorship too is hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|Parentage : The Apollodorus {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> lists Troilus last of Priam and Hecuba's sons – {{a detail}} {{adopted in the}} later tradition – but then adds that {{it is said that}} the boy was fathered by Apollo. On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus {{in the middle of a}} list of Priam's sons without further comment. In the early Christian writings the Clementine Homilies, it is suggested that Apollo was Troilus' lover rather than his father.|$|E

5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> he supported. He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement his small salary as a federal judge. This allowed {{him to keep his}} personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E
5|$|By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities, and the Romney Literary Society {{was given}} {{authorization}} to raise monies from a lottery {{to build a}} new school building. The society successfully raised the funds, and in 1845 bids were called {{for the construction of a}} new school building. On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly empowered the Romney Literary Society to establish a seminary for learning at the academy. That same year, a new brick building was constructed for the academy and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> of the society; the building now serves as the central unit of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{construction}} {{began on}} a new concrete and brick-faced building to house the library. Completed in 1938, the building housed a collection that grew to 35,000 volumes in 1940. Now known as Smullin Hall, the library building was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi in the Georgian style of architecture. In 1965, the school received a $450,000 loan {{from the federal government}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>library.</b> Congressman Al Ullman worked to secure status as a Federal Depository Library in the late 1960s, with status conferred in 1969. In 1980, Willamette began a multi-year fund raising campaign intended to raise funds to renovate academic halls and build a new library, with $18 million total raised during the funding drive. At the time the library held a collection of 143,000 volumes.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{a survey}} {{conducted}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible. Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute). In 1998, Modern Library readers voted Atlas Shrugged the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by The Fountainhead in second place, Anthem in seventh, and We the Living eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list. Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work. Rand's work continues {{to be among the}} top sellers among books in India.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt, Coptic predominated, but Greek {{had been}} in use since the conquest of Alexander, and Latin and Greek were the {{administrative}} languages during the Roman Imperial period.

5|$|In May 1909, the Woman’s Club {{purchased}} {{an option}} to buy the property on {{the southwest corner of}} Winter and State streets for $5500, which was located across State from Willson Park (a city park at that time). This group then raised the funds to purchase the land for $12,000, and Salem applied for a grant from the Carnegie foundation. The city was allotted $14,000 by the foundation to build a library, but the Women’s Club which owned the existing library and land had not been involved in the process. The organization was able to get the money rescinded, and in November 1910, worked with the city to increase their maintenance fund <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>library.</b> Carnegie then raised the grant to $27,500 at the lobbying of Lulu Bush (daughter-in-law to Asahel Bush) and the Woman’s Club deeded the lot and the other library assets to the city of Salem.|$|E
5|$|The Library of Gray's Inn {{has existed}} {{since at least}} 1555, when the first mention of it {{was made in the}} will of Robert Chaloner, who left some money to buy law books <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library.</b> The Library was neither a big {{collection}} nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of Nicholas Bacon, a room that was also used for mooting and to store the deed chest. The collection grew larger over the years as individual Benchers such as Sir John Finch and Sir John Bankes left books or money to buy books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members of the Inn had been found stealing books.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore National Library traces {{its roots}} to Sir Stamford Raffles, {{the founder of}} modern Singapore, who in 1823 started a small private {{collection}} of books housed in the Raffles Institution. This was known as Raffles Library, {{and access to the}} collection was limited to the British and privileged class. Dr. Robert Morrison, an eminent missionary and educator became the first librarian from 1823 to 1845. He was mainly responsible for establishing the plans with Raffles and soliciting book donations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library.</b> When it was first built, it has a red-brick façade.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} notion of {{organisational}} missions and goals held by the major stakeholders in university li-braries in Ghana and assesses these visions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>libraries</b> {{in relation to the}} development of a strategic planning pro-cess <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>libraries.</b> Multiple case studies were used to col-lect the data and the data were analysed using the multiple case study approach. The primary findings are that the ma-jor stakeholders in Ghanaian university libraries have differ-ent perceptions of the missions of their libraries. Two main perceptions emerged. The non-library stakeholders prefer-red a narrower mission <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>libraries</b> focused more on the needs of their institutions and emphasising collection devel-opment as the method of attaining excellence. <b>The</b> <b>library</b> stakeholders expressed a much broader mission defined in the context of national information provision, emphasising information access while at the same time balancing it with collection development. This multiplicity of strategic visions was found to be the subject of disagreement between decis-ion-makers and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>library</b> staff. <b>The</b> study con-cludes with some ideas on how to address this situation...|$|R

5|$|Meridian {{is served}} by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located {{at the corner of}} 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city {{originally}} had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>library,</b> the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 1959, {{the library}} moved to its fifth {{location}} and first permanent home, the former Briarcliff Manor station originally on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad). The station {{had been built}} in 1906 by village founder Walter W. Law in the Tudor Revival style, {{as a replacement for}} a smaller station, which was moved to nearby Millwood. In its later operation as a station, the building was rarely used, and only four trains stopped there each day. Due to the railroad's tracks ending in the Bronx and requiring a transfer to continue on to Manhattan, many Briarcliff Manor residents would drive to Pleasantville or Scarborough, which had stations along lines ending in Manhattan, and more trains ran along those lines. The passenger railroad, then known as the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad, discontinued service in 1958, freeing up use of the building <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>library.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} music in the United States includes work relating music to social class, racial, ethnic and religious identity, gender and sexuality, as well as studies of music history, musicology, and other topics. The academic study of American music {{can be traced back}} to the late 19th century, when researchers like Alice Fletcher and Francis La Flesche studied the music of the Omaha peoples, working for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In the 1890s and into the early 20th century, musicological recordings were made among indigenous, Hispanic, African-American and Anglo-American peoples of the United States. Many worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> of Congress, first under the leadership of Oscar Sonneck, chief of the Library's Music Divisions. These researchers included Robert W. Gordon, founder of the Archive of American Folk Song, and John and Alan Lomax; Alan Lomax was the most prominent of several folk song collectors who helped to inspire the 20th century roots revival of American folk culture.|$|E
