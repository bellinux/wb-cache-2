25|$|Oxenstierna is {{regarded}} as a brilliant pragmatist, willing to reconsider his positions. There are examples of discussions within the Privy Council when Oxenstierna rejected laws he himself had earlier introduced, admitting that he <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> now. His way of examining, reconsidering, testing, and sometimes rejecting his earlier opinions constitutes his legacy more than his ideas on particular points of policy.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, {{even though it had}} seemed to be settled in favor of the church in 1619. Though the regents <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), they thought they had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} {{lasted until}} the early 1970s, when increased passenger and luggage travel to the station was rendering the old system obsolete. British Rail therefore decided to adapt a number of Class 423 4VEPs with increased luggage capacity (at the expense of fewer second class seats) and were redesignated as Class 427 4VEGs. The service however remained much the same, with the units attaching and detaching from Bognor Regis bound services running via Redhill. This led to somewhat extended journey times which meant the service lacked any real purpose, as the faster services began calling at Gatwick Airport from the early 1970s, and made the option of travelling to Gatwick from London on the service lack appeal to those who <b>knew</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E

25|$|The post of CIGS {{was less}} {{rewarding}} than command {{in an important}} theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers {{who would have been}} good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had {{in the beginning of the}} war. When General Sir Claude Auchinleck was to be replaced as the commander of the British Eighth Army in 1942, Brooke preferred Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery instead of Lieutenant General William Gott, who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God. Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than any other general how to deal with Churchill.|$|E

500|$|That the Soviet {{search was}} {{simulated}} (while knowing the wreckage lay elsewhere) also {{is suggested by}} the article of Mikhail Prozumentshchikov, Deputy Director of the Russian State Archives of Recent History, commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the airplane's shootdown. Commenting on the Soviet and American searches: [...] "Since the U.S.S.R., for natural reasons, <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> where the Boeing had been downed...it was very problematical to retrieve anything, especially as the U.S.S.R. was not particularly interested".|$|E
500|$|Although {{aware of}} some of these movements, Soubise thought the Prussians were in full retreat. He ordered his {{advanced}} guard to hasten toward the Janus hill, but he issued no instructions on where, how and when to deploy. [...] The Allied infantry moved in three long columns: at the head were the French regiments of Piedmont and Mailly, and on the flanks and in front of the right column were two regiments of Austrian cuirassiers and the Imperial cavalry. Ten French squadrons remained in reserve and twelve others protected the left flank. Soubise, who undoubtedly <b>knew</b> <b>better,</b> ordered no ground reconnaissance and sent no advanced guard. His army marched blindly into Frederick's clutches.|$|E
500|$|In {{the race}} Oxbow broke third {{out of the}} gate and settled behind pacesetters Frac Daddy and Freedom Child, {{completing}} a quarter mile in 23 seconds. As usual, Oxbow wanted to run close to the front, Stevens <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than to fight with him, and so, as in the Derby, horse and rider once again chased the speed horses at fractions described as [...] "suicidal". At the half-mile pole Oxbow was a neck off the leader, who clocked at 0:46.66, and on the backstretch, Oxbow went to the front, reaching the three-quarter mile mark at 1:10.95, running the second fastest half- and three-quarter mile fractions at that point in the race since Secretariat's 1973 record-setting performance. Oxbow was still in front by a half length at the mile post. At the top of the homestretch, Palace Malice and Oxbow were nose and nose but Oxbow tired, and finished second by three lengths to Palace Malice with Kentucky Derby winner Orb third, [...] lengths behind Oxbow. [...] His speed figure for the Belmont was 98, the same as in the Risen Star Stakes.|$|E

2500|$|Alvar {{has been}} criticized by his contemporaries for an overly nationalistic and {{colonialist}} viewpoint on the Spanish language. In his final year {{as director of the}} Real Academia Española, Alvar responded harshly to the European Commission (an institution of the European Union) after it requested that Spain revoke its law that all typewriters, computers and printers sold domestically include the tilde, a Spanish diacritical mark. Alvar declared that [...] "he tilde is our tradition and our identity." [...] He also received criticism for a statement he made in 1991 about indigenous languages, stating, [...] "Mexico <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> than anybody else the value of having a language that unifies, that liberates the indigenous communities from their backwardness and misery...the path to freedom runs through hispanization." ...|$|E

Konstantin was particularly scornful of the numerous aristocratic protests against his plan, commenting once that they were not even worthy for him to spit upon. On several occasions, Konstantin only just managed to keep the Committee from disintegrating under the strain. The post was a difficult one and the pressures wore on the Grand Duke.
