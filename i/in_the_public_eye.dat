5|$|In 1970, Neil Goldschmidt entered {{politics}} in Oregon. This began {{three decades of}} being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> in the state, serving as mayor of Oregon's most populous city and as the state's governor. In between {{he served in the}} Cabinet of President Jimmy Carter.|$|E

The brothers were inconspicuous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> for the next decade. Chris Stamper purchased the Eydon Hall estate for £17m in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Now outside Parliament, Odlum {{maintained}} his presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> through meetings {{and the work}} of his newspaper, The Crusader. His revenge over the Labour Party finally occurred during the 1987 general election, when the PLP split the vote and denied his old allies victory. In 1995 he accepted the position of Ambassador to the United Nations from Compton, his old enemy, holding it for only a year. When Compton resigned in 1996, Odlum chose to stand for election against his successor and lost the contest.|$|E

5|$|Some of the company's performers, {{over the}} decades, became stars {{of their day}} and often moved on to careers in musical theatre or grand opera. The company {{licensed}} the operas for performance in Australasia and to numerous amateur troupes in Britain and elsewhere, providing orchestra parts and prompt books for hire. The company kept the Savoy operas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> {{for over a century}} and left an enduring legacy of production styles and stage business that continue to be emulated in new productions, as well as recordings.|$|E
5|$|The {{intricacies of}} Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each ignoring the other, at least <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye.</b> However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by protecting and expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention {{came in the form}} of building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the Communists and constantly bombing the trail. They also provided heavy support for the Laotian government.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{was quick}} to team its two rising gangster stars—Edward G. Robinson and Cagney—for the 1931 film Smart Money. So keen was the studio to follow up the success of Robinson's Little Caesar that Cagney {{actually}} shot Smart Money (for which he received second billing in a supporting role) {{at the same time}} as The Public Enemy. As in The Public Enemy, Cagney was required to be physically violent to a woman on screen, a signal that Warner Bros. was keen to keep Cagney <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye.</b> This time, he slapped co-star Evalyn Knapp.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the term}} {{generosity}} often goes hand-in-hand with charity, many people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>eye</b> want recognition for their good deeds. Donations {{are needed to}} support organizations and committees, however, generosity should {{not be limited to}} times of great need such as natural disasters and extreme situations.|$|R

5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able}} to care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four decades <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye,</b> {{first as a}} child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E

50|$|Richard Andrew Farley (9 December 1952 - 13 May 2006) was an Australian born journalist, politician, {{land rights}} {{and civil rights}} activist {{for the rights of}} Indigenous Australians.

5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Who's concerts that included Tommy was overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye,</b> and cleared the band's debts. Several live recordings of Tommy from the Who's 1969–70 tours have been released. A complete performance {{is available on the}} 2002 Deluxe Edition of the live album Live at Leeds, recorded on 14 February 1970. The second Isle of Wight performance is available on Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, released in 1996. The Coliseum Theatre gig is available on the 2007 video release At Kilburn 1977 + Live at the Coliseum. Portions of the Woodstock performance of Tommy were released on the Woodstock film and later on The Kids Are Alright. The complete show was recorded, but has never been officially released.|$|E
5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up {{on a date with}} the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will be in charge of the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald's {{goal was}} to produce a {{literary}} work which would truly prove himself as a writer, and Gatsby {{did not have the}} commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye.</b> For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.|$|E

He emphasizes that he was never charged with a crime, therefore {{he did not need}} or deserve a pardon.

5|$|With America's {{entry into}} World War II, many {{professional}} players {{had left to}} serve in the armed forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> – the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League existed from 1943 to 1954. The inaugural College World Series was held in 1947, and the Babe Ruth League youth program was founded. This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers—where Branch Rickey had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers; Larry Doby debuted with the American League's Cleveland Indians later the same year. Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars.|$|E

50|$|After Universal Studios {{chose not}} to renew her {{contract}} in 1959, Van Doren was now a free agent and had to struggle to find work. Some of her later movies were foreign and independent productions, which would do little to keep her image <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>eye.</b> Many of <b>the</b> productions were low-budget B movies with some having gained a cult following for their high camp value.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to revive the movement, the Jewish Anarchist Federation in New York asked Berkman in 1926 to write an {{introduction}} to anarchism intended for <b>the</b> general <b>public.</b> By presenting <b>the</b> principles of anarchism <b>in</b> plain language, <b>the</b> New York anarchists hoped that readers might be swayed to support the movement or, at a minimum, that the book might improve the image of anarchism and anarchists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
