In a statement about the series, Spears stated: [...] "From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together.

500|$|The biographer Richard D. E. Burton {{comments}} that, in {{the late}} 1920s, Poulenc might have {{seemed to be in}} an enviable position: professionally successful and independently well-off, having inherited a substantial fortune from his father. He bought a large country house, Le Grande Coteau, at Noizay, Indre-et-Loire, [...] south-west of Paris, where he retreated to compose in peaceful surroundings. Yet he was troubled, struggling {{to come to terms with}} his sexuality, which was predominantly homosexual. His first serious affair was with the painter Richard Chanlaire, to whom he sent a copy of the Concert champÃªtre score inscribed, [...] "You have changed my life, you are the sunshine of my thirty years, a reason for living and working". Nevertheless, while this affair was in progress Poulenc proposed marriage to his friend Raymonde Linossier. As she was not only well aware of his homosexuality but was also romantically attached elsewhere, she refused him, and their relationship became strained. He suffered the first of many periods of depression, which affected his ability to compose, and he was devastated in January 1930 when Linossier died suddenly at the age of 32. On her death he wrote, [...] "All my youth departs with her, all that part of my life that belonged only to her. I sob... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>now</b> twenty years older". His affair with Chanlaire petered out in 1931, though they remained lifelong friends.|$|E
500|$|Acquaintance Robert Cathcart {{says that}} by 1980, {{in his private}} conversations with Savage, he knew him to have {{conservative}} political views. Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends. When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, [...] "I was once a child; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>now</b> a man." [...] Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker. He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes. Another turning point occurred {{for him as a}} writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as [...] "political opposition" [...] after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic. In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory. In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative. Savage later dropped the lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>now.</b> The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
