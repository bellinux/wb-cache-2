40|$|BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, {{procarbazine}} and prednisone) <b>escalated</b> is {{the preferred}} upfront Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treatment {{in a number of}} countries. Upon failure, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (HDT/ASCT) is performed, but its effectiveness has not been verified in this setting. We analyzed all Swiss cases of chemosensitive HL autografted after failure of BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> (n = 22) and compared outcomes with 22 cases of HDT/ASCT following frontline ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) failure. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 76 % for ABVD and 42 % for BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> (p = 0. 029). Two- and 5 -year overall survival (OS) was 90 % and 71 % for ABVD and 72 % and 65 % for BEACOPP <b>escalated,</b> respectively (p = not significant). Three patients in the ABVD and four in the BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> groups underwent allotransplant for relapse after HDT/ASCT. Grade 3 - 4 toxicities were comparable in both groups. Three cases of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/t-AML) were recorded in the BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> group. The acceptable PFS and OS of chemosensitive patients with HL autografted after failure of upfront BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> seem to justify this approach...|$|R

40|$|Software {{projects}} {{can often}} spiral {{out of control}} to become runaway systems that far exceed original budget and schedule projections. The behavior that underlies many runaway systems can best be characterized as escalation of commitment to a failing course of action. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) understand the extent to which IS projects are prone to <b>escalate,</b> (2) compare the outcomes of projects that <b>escalate</b> with those that do not, and (3) test whether constructs associated with different theories of escalation can be used to discriminate between projects that <b>escalate</b> and those that do not. A survey was administered to IS audit and control professionals and, to establish a baseline for comparison, the survey was designed to gather data on projects that did not <b>escalate</b> as well as those that did <b>escalate.</b> The results of our research suggest that between 30 % and 40 % of all IS projects exhibit some degree of escalation. Projects that <b>escalated</b> had project outcomes that were significantly worse in terms of perceived implementation performance and perceived budget/schedule performance, as compared to projects that did not <b>escalate.</b> Using constructs from theories that have been used to explain the escalation phenomenon, we were able to test various logistic regression models for their ability to discriminate between projects that <b>escalate</b> and those that do not. To construct our models, we explored constructs derived from self justification theory, prospect theory, agency theory, and approach avoidance theory. While constructs derived from all four theories were significant in logistic regression models, the completion effect construct derived from approach avoidance theory provided the best classification of projects, correctly classifying over 70 % of both <b>escalated</b> and non-escalated projects...|$|R

40|$|Although the dorsal {{raphe nucleus}} (DRN) has long been linked to neural control of aggression, {{little is known about}} the {{regulatory}} influences of the DRN when an animal engages in either adaptive species-typical aggressive behavior or <b>escalated</b> aggression. Therefore it is important to explore which neurotransmitter inputs into the DRN determine the escalation of aggression in male mice. Previously, we observed that microinjection of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen into the DRN <b>escalates</b> aggressive behavior in male mice. Here, we used a serotonin (5 -HT) neuron-specific GABAB receptor knock-out mouse to demonstrate that baclofen acts on nonserotonergic neurons to <b>escalate</b> aggression. Intra-DRN baclofen administration increased glutamate release, but did not alter GABA release, within the DRN. Microinjection of l-glutamate into the DRN <b>escalated</b> dose-dependently attack bites toward an intruder. In vivo microdialysis showed that glutamate release increased in the DRN during an aggressive encounter, and the level of glutamate was further increased when the animal was engaged in <b>escalated</b> aggressive behavior after social instigation. Finally, 5 -HT release was increased within the DRN and also in the medial prefrontal cortex when animals were provoked by social instigation, and during <b>escalated</b> aggression after social instigation, but this increase in 5 -HT release was not observed when animals were engaged in species-typical aggression. In summary, glutamate input into the DRN is enhanced during <b>escalated</b> aggression, which causes a phasic increase of 5 -HT release from the DRN 5 -HT neurons...|$|R

40|$|Animals {{that live}} in {{cooperative}} societies form hierarchies in which dominant individuals reap disproportionate benefits from group cooperation. The stability of these societies requires subordinates to accept their inferior status rather than engage in <b>escalated</b> conflict with dominants over rank. Applying the logic of animal contests to these cases predicts that <b>escalated</b> conflict is more likely where subordinates are reproductively suppressed, where group productivity is high, relatedness is low, and where subordinates are relatively strong. We tested these four predictions in the field on co-foundress associations of the paper wasp Polistes dominulus by inducing contests over dominance rank experimentally. Subordinates {{with lower levels of}} ovarian development, and those in larger, more productive groups, were more likely to <b>escalate</b> in conflict with their dominant, as predicted. Neither genetic relatedness nor relative body size had significant effects on the probability of escalation. The original dominant emerged as the winner in all except one <b>escalated</b> contest. The results provide the first evidence that reproductive suppression of subordinates increases the threat of <b>escalated</b> conflict, and hence that reproductive sharing can promote stability of the dominantÂ¿subordinate relationship...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better {{understand}} whether emotional aspects affect entrepreneursâ€™ and owner-managersâ€™ decisions in investment situations when escalation of commitment can be observed and where the level of uncertainty was also added to the emotional aspect. The study was performed using conjoint analysis (a. k. a stated preference technique) and yielded following results: positive emotions (self-confidence, challenge, and hope) increase the decision-makerâ€™s propensity to <b>escalate</b> commitment. Negative emotions (embarrassment and strain) do not, on the other hand, make the entrepreneur prone to <b>escalate.</b> The result remains the same for all positive emotions where an increasing level of uncertainty tends to make the entrepreneur more prone to <b>escalate.</b> Strain and embarrassment, under high uncertainty, decrease the tendency to <b>escalate.</b> All results are significant except for frustration that does not show any significant relationship. The combination of cognitive decision theories and emotional theories enhances our knowledge about the emotive side of entrepreneursâ€™ motives to <b>escalate.</b> The results also enable us to supplement and refine existing theories on self-justification.
