At night, the signal commonly arrives from directions offset from the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>bearing</b> by up to 80 ° and these events have been categorised into five main types. Statistics indicating how often these categories of propagation were observed in the period August 2006 to September 2007 are presented.

5000|$|A {{rhumb line}} can be contrasted with a <b>great</b> <b>circle,</b> which is the path of {{shortest}} distance between two points {{on the surface of}} a sphere. On a <b>great</b> <b>circle,</b> the <b>bearing</b> to the destination point does not remain constant. If one were to drive a car along a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> one would hold the steering wheel fixed, but to follow a rhumb line one would have to turn the wheel, turning it more sharply as the poles are approached. In other words, a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> is locally [...] "straight" [...] with zero geodesic curvature, whereas a rhumb line has non-zero geodesic curvature.|$|R
50|$|Latitude circles {{near the}} North Pole {{are shown in}} red. For A and B to face each other, A has to look East but B not to the West. If B were to look West, she would see a bear eyeing her as his next meal. For A and C to face each other, both would have to face North.To keep to a bearing is not, in general, the same as going in a {{straight}} direction along a <b>great</b> <b>circle.</b> Conversely, one can keep to a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> and the <b>bearing</b> may change. Thus the bearing of a straight path crossing the North Pole changes abruptly at the Pole from North to South. When traveling East or West, it is only on the Equator that one can keep East or West and be going straight (without need to steer). Anywhere else, maintaining latitude requires a change in direction, requires steering. However, this change in direction becomes increasingly negligible as one moves to lower latitudes.|$|R

40|$|Measurements of the direction-of-arrival {{of signals}} {{propagating}} {{on a long}} (4490 km) path along the midlatitude trough show that the azimuth can be deviated by up to 100 ° from the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>bearing.</b> In this paper an attempt {{has been made to}} model the shift in azimuth through a ray tracing simulation. Two possible mechanisms which lead to changes in azimuth have been investigated: (1) propagation along the density gradients which form the equatorward wall of the trough and (2) side scatter from regions of the sea well to the south of the trough. Of these two mechanisms, sea scatter gives results which are much closer to those observed. Peer reviewedPublisher versio...|$|E
40|$|A new {{procedure}} is proposed {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of surveillance satellites in circular orbits. It is assumed that the times of target detections by the satellite are given by a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with detection rate at time t of p(t) = f(lambda(t), Beta sub 1 (t), Beta sub 2 (t)), where lambda(t) is the angular distance between the target and subsatellite point, Beta sub 1 (t) is <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>bearing</b> from the target to the subsatellite point, and Beta sub 2 (t) is great circle relative bearing from the subsatellite point to the target. In some circumstances, the dependence of p(t) on Beta sub 2 (t) and Beta sub 2 (t) can be ignored, making p(t) only a function of lambda(t). Then the probability of target detection on a single satellite pass becomes a function of only the minimum angular distance, or lateral range, between the target and subsatellite point. A numerical method using Newton's method is developed for computing the local minimum of lambda(t). Probabilities of detection using this procedure are compared to those computed with existing methods of Wertz and Washburn. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
40|$|The high {{latitude}} ionosphere {{contains a}} multitude of large-scale ionospheric density structures. These act as tilted reflecting surfaces, which cause HF (3 - 30 MHz) radio signals to deviate from {{the plane of the}} great circle between the transmitter and receiver. There are also a large number of smaller scale electron density irregularities that scatter the signal out of the plane of the great circle. Consequently, measurements of the bearing of incoming HF signals are often found to be displayed from the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>bearing</b> of the transmitter, sometimes by as much as 100 °. This thesis is a study of bearing measurements obtained during the period 1993 to 1996 over seven high latitude paths of various lengths and orientation. Characteristics of the bearing deviations are found to be strongly related to geophysical parameters such as geomagnetic activity (Ap) indices and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field since these also parameterise the morphology of large scale ionospheric density structures. In addition, the daily times of near-great circle propagation are found to relate strongly to Ap on paths lying in the region of the mid-latitude trough. Relationships are identified between bearing deviations and signal parameters such as the signal strength and the Doppler spread of the signal spectrum. Ionograms have been recorded on two paths, and exhibit characteristic features that identify modes of propagation associated with reflections from tilted ionospheric layers and scattering from ionospheric irregularities. The associated bearings have been examined to determine the orientation of these tilts and/or the approximate location of scattering centres. The results of this research may be used as a basis for devising diagnostic tests to determine the level of confidence in the accuracy of bearing measurements made of HF signals at high latitudes...|$|E
