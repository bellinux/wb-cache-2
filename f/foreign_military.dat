5|$|In July 2016, the UK {{placed an}} order for 50 AH-64Es through the US <b>Foreign</b> <b>Military</b> Sales (FMS) {{programme}} instead of upgrading their Westland-built WAH-64s.|$|E
5|$|The Nationality Act of 1940 {{provided}} for {{loss of citizenship}} based on <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> or government service, when coupled with citizenship in that foreign country. This statute also mandated loss of citizenship for desertion from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States in order to evade military service during wartime, or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for loss of citizenship for <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case (Nishikawa v. Dulles), and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case (Trop v. Dulles).|$|E
5|$|Approximately 1,500 {{personnel}} {{are assigned to}} both HQ, Tennessee Air National Guard and to the 118 AW at Berry ANGB. Approximately 400 are full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, augmented by approximately 1100 traditional part-time air guardsmen. Approximately 100 additional <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> {{personnel are}} also temporarily assigned to the 118 AW {{at any one time}} for training in the C-130E or C-130H aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Between November 2006 and April 2007, four Singaporean JI {{members were}} {{detained}} under the ISA while {{one had a}} restriction order issued against him. In addition, lawyer and lecturer Abdul Basheer s/o Abdul Kader, who radicalized himself by reading extremist propaganda on the Internet, was detained in February 2007 for preparing to engage in militant activities in Afghanistan. He was released on 21 February 2010, but rearrested in September 2012 and detained under the ISA the following month for planning to resume jihadist terrorism against <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> operations abroad, including leaving Singapore– illegally, if necessary– to do so.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Egyptian Air Force {{placed an}} order for 36 AH-64A helicopters. These Apaches were {{delivered}} {{with most of the}} advanced avionics used on the U.S. fleet at that time, with the exception of localized radio equipment. In 2000, Boeing announced an order to remanufacture Egypt's existing Apache fleet to the AH-64D configuration. Notably, the AH-64D upgrade did not include the procurement of the Longbow radar, the supply of which had been refused by the U.S. government. Egypt requested a further 12 AH-64D Block II Apaches through a <b>Foreign</b> <b>Military</b> Sale in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In October 2005, the Secretary of Defense {{directed}} {{the formation of}} United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, the Marine component of United States Special Operations Command. It was determined that the Marine Corps would initially form a unit of approximately 2500 to serve with USSOCOM. On February 24, 2006 MARSOC activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. MARSOC initially consisted of a small staff and the <b>Foreign</b> <b>Military</b> Training Unit (FMTU), which had been formed to conduct foreign internal defense. FMTU is now designated as the Marine Special Operations Advisor Group (MSOAG).|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{directly}} {{ordering the}} aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, the Australian Government purchased its F/A-18s through the US Government's <b>Foreign</b> <b>Military</b> Sales (FMS) program. Ordering the aircraft via the US Government allowed the RAAF {{to take advantage}} of the superior purchasing power of the US military, and reduced the service's project management requirements. This led to a complicated arrangement whereby the aircraft were ordered by the US Government, delivered to the US Navy, and then transferred to the RAAF once initial flight testing had taken place. The process functioned smoothly, however, and was cost effective.|$|E
5|$|International governments, {{leaders and}} public figures also convey their {{greetings}} on the occasion. Overseas dignitaries are invited as chief guests in ceremonies, while <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> contingents often participate in parades. National flags are displayed on major roads and avenues such as Shahrah-e-Faisal, Shahara-e-Quaideen, and Mazar-e-Quaid Road, {{leading up to}} Jinnah's mausoleum in Karachi. Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore, where the Pakistan Resolution was passed in 1940, is fully illuminated {{on the eve of}} the independence day to signify its importance in the creation of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Louis and {{the representatives}} of the Polish nobility started {{negotiations}} of Louis's succession in Poland in the autumn of 1373. After a year of negotiations, he issued the so-called Privilege of Koszyce on 17 September 1374, reducing the tax that Polish noblemen paid to the king by about 84% and promising a remuneration to noblemen who participated in <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> campaigns. In exchange, the Polish lords confirmed the right of Louis's daughters to inherit Poland.|$|E

5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. <b>Foreign</b> <b>military</b> personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to the}} border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{argued that}} among the Vietnamese forces {{involved}} {{in the civil war}} there were nationalists opposed to <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> intervention. He opposed many of the strategies associated with troop escalation, notably the air campaign over North Vietnam, which he saw as an aggressive measure causing civilian casualties that could draw the People's Republic of China or the Soviet Union into the conflict. He also feared that other American interests, including the economy, were suffering through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E
5|$|The poor {{state of}} {{discipline}} of the Congolese forces became apparent again in 1990. <b>Foreign</b> <b>military</b> assistance to Zaire ceased {{following the end of}} the Cold War and Mobutu deliberately allowed the military's condition to deteriorate so that it did not threaten his hold on power. Protesting low wages and lack of pay, paratroopers began looting Kinshasa in September 1991 and were only stopped after intervention by French ('Operation Baumier') and Belgian ('Operation Blue Beam') forces.|$|E
50|$|The US Navy {{awarded a}} $120 million {{contract}} to Boeing in July 2011 {{for the production}} of about 60 Block II Harpoon missiles, including missiles for 6 <b>foreign</b> <b>militaries.</b> Boeing lists 30 foreign navies as Block II customers.|$|R

5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's <b>Foreign</b> <b>Military</b> Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of {{political}} and military machinations conducted by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that are described in the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> {{observers}} had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia.|$|E
50|$|The Air Gallantry Cross was {{occasionally}} {{awarded to}} members of <b>foreign</b> <b>militaries,</b> but only if an air combat action was performed which directly benefitted Vietnamese war efforts. Pilots of the United States Air Force were often awarded the Air Gallantry Cross.|$|R
50|$|The United States donated a 68 {{foot patrol}} boat, the Isla de Bioko (no longer operational) to the navy in 1988 to patrol its Exclusive Economic Zone. The Equatoguineans rely mainly on foreigners {{to operate the}} navy {{equipment}} it buys from <b>foreign</b> <b>militaries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Vietnam Distinguished Service Order {{was also}} {{provided}} to <b>foreign</b> <b>militaries,</b> {{and in the}} United States military the decoration was considered {{the equivalent of the}} Legion of Merit. For foreign officers, the 2nd class of the order was also provided to officers.|$|R
5|$|Reaction in the U.S. Congress to the {{incursion}} {{was also}} swift. Senators Frank F. Church (Democratic Party, Idaho) and John S. Cooper (Republican Party, Kentucky), proposed {{an amendment to}} the <b>Foreign</b> <b>Military</b> Sales Act that would have cut off funding not only for U.S. ground operations and advisors in Cambodia, but would also have ended U.S. air support for Cambodian forces. On 30 June the United States Senate passed the act with the amendment included. The bill was defeated in the House of Representatives after U.S. forces were withdrawn from Cambodia as scheduled. The newly amended act did, however, rescind the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) under which Presidents Johnson and Nixon had conducted military operations for seven years without a declaration of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of new AN/APG-73 radars was announced on 17 August 1998. The Commonwealth accepted a United States <b>Foreign</b> <b>Military</b> Sales case in October 1999, {{and then the}} prototype modification commenced on 21 August 2001. The first production modified aircraft was completed in August 2002 and the last aircraft was completed on 27 August 2003. Phase 2.2, the Multi-purpose Display Group Upgrade (MDGU) and the remaining equipment will be installed in the 2006/2007 time frame. Phase 2.3, various systems, from BAE Systems, SAAB, and Elta has not been announced. Phase 2.4, commercial contract with Northrop Grumman for the Litening AT targeting pod, will receive the targeting pods during 2007/2008.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} {{large numbers of}} United Nations troops stationed in the DRC. The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), on had a strength of over 19,000 peacekeepers (including 16,998 military personnel) and has a mission of assisting Congolese authorities maintain security. The UN and <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> aid missions, the most prominent being EUSEC RD Congo, are attempting to assist the Congolese in rebuilding the armed forces, with major efforts being made in trying to assure regular payment of salaries to armed forces personnel and also in military justice. Retired Canadian Lieutenant General Marc Caron also served for a time as Security Sector Reform advisor {{to the head of}} MONUC.|$|E
50|$|Irish {{citizens}} {{were free to}} work abroad and join <b>foreign</b> <b>militaries.</b> By {{the end of the}} war, figures suggest that 50,000 men and women born in the State served in the British armed forces, although this estimate has risen considerably over the years.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike in most countries, the Central Military Commission is not {{considered}} as just another ministry. Although China does have a Ministry of National Defense, headed by a Minister of National Defense, it exists solely for liaison with <b>foreign</b> <b>militaries</b> and does not have command authority.|$|R
5|$|Allied <b>foreign</b> <b>militaries</b> {{also provide}} students. In 1999, the school {{graduated}} its first international officers—Norwegian and Canadian.
