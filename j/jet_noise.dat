500|$|The B-52B was {{followed}} by progressively improved bomber and reconnaissance variants, culminating in the B-52G and turbofan B-52H. To allow rapid delivery, production lines were set up both at its main Seattle factory and at Boeing's Wichita facility. More than 5,000 companies {{were involved in the}} massive production effort, with 41% of the airframe being built by subcontractors. The prototypes and all B-52A, B and C models (90 aircraft) were built at Seattle. Testing of aircraft built at Seattle caused problems due to <b>jet</b> <b>noise,</b> which led to the establishment of curfews for engine tests. Aircraft were ferried [...] east on their maiden flights to Larson Air Force Base near Moses Lake, where they were fully tested.|$|E
2500|$|On April 2, 1965, the 8,800ft (2,682m) {{parallel}} Runway 13R/31L opened (Runway 13/31 became Runway 13L/31R). [...] The {{project had}} been vexed by legal wrangling; safety concerns were raised regarding {{its proximity to}} schools [...] and its minimal safety areas, while nearby residents attempted to stop the anticipated increase in <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> {{and the removal of}} homes and businesses adjacent to the airport to accommodate the project.|$|E
40|$|A {{nearfield}} {{aircraft noise}} prediction computer program is presented for the F- 22 aircraft.

40|$|The {{effect of}} flight on <b>jet</b> engine exhaust <b>noise</b> {{has often been}} {{presented}} {{in terms of a}} relative velocity exponent, n, as a function of radiation angle. The value of n is given by the OASPL reduction due to relative velocity divided by 10 times the logarithm of the ratio of relative jet velocity to absolute jet velocity. It is shown in this paper that the exponent n is positive for pure subsonic <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise</b> and varies, in a systematic manner, as a function of flight conditions and jet velocity. On the basis of calculations from simple empirical models for <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise,</b> shock noise and internally-generated noise, it is shown that when other sources are present, the resulting range of n is increased over the range for <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise,</b> and in some cases negative values of n are obtained...|$|R

2500|$|After {{three years}} and nearly 600 hours between the two aircraft, the XV-1 {{contract}} was canceled in 1957. Ultimately, {{it was determined that}} the XV-1's convertiplane configuration was too complex for the small advantages gained over conventional helicopters. The piston engine could not produce enough power to optimize the design advantages. Technological advances in conventional helicopter rotor design and engines in the following years would eventually negate the XV-1's performance margin. [...] The noise level was 116dB in the cockpit, but even higher for ground personnel who described the tip <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> as [...] "extremely irritating" [...] and the noise level was still 90dB Â½ mile away. McDonnell would try to capitalize on the tip-jet rotor technology with a small crane helicopter design, designated Model 120 and first flown on 13 November 1957.|$|E

50|$|Most of the {{air flow}} through a {{high-bypass}} turbofan is low-velocity bypass flow: even when combined with the much higher velocity engine exhaust, the average exhaust velocity is considerably lower than in a pure turbojet. Turbojet engine noise is predominately <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> from the high exhaust velocity, therefore turbofan engines are significantly quieter than a pure-jet of the same thrust with <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> no longer the predominant source. Other noise sources are the fan, compressor and turbine. <b>Jet</b> <b>noise</b> is reduced with chevrons, sawtooth patterns on the exhaust nozzles, on the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 and General Electric GEnx engines used on the Boeing 787.|$|E

40|$|A 2. 54 cm (1. 00 in.) nozzle {{supplied}} with nitrogen was mounted above an automobile and driven over an asphalt roadway past stationary microphones {{in an attempt}} to quantify the effects of the vehicle motion on <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise.</b> The nozzle was then tested in the Langley anechoic noise facility with a large free jet simulating the relative motion. The results are compared for these two methods of investigating forward speed effects on <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise.</b> The vehicle results indicate a noise with forward speed throughout the Doppler-shifted static spectrum. This decrease across the entire frequency range was also apparent in the free-jet results. The similarity of the results indicates that the effects of flight on <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise</b> can be predicted by simulation of forward speed with a free jet. Overall sound pressure levels were found to decrease with forward speed at all observation angles for both methods of testing...|$|R

Based on optimization principle, the main channel {{of the valve body}} is numerically investigated and optimized twice. The results show that the resistance coefficient and the maximum noise of the valve are decreased by 0. 37 and 23. 8 [*]dB, respectively, and the head and the tail of the valve plug are optimized when streamline design is employed on the main channel structure of the valve body...|$|R
50|$|In aeroacoustics, <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> is {{the field}} {{that focuses on the}} noise {{generation}} caused by high-velocity jets and the turbulent eddies generated by shearing flow. Such noise is known as broadband noise and extends well beyond the range of human hearing (100 kHz and higher). <b>Jet</b> <b>noise</b> is also responsible for some of the loudest sounds ever produced by mankind.|$|E
50|$|Turbojets {{have a low}} propulsive {{efficiency}} below about Mach 2 {{and produce}} a lot of <b>jet</b> <b>noise,</b> both {{a result of the}} very high velocity of the exhaust. Modern jet propelled aircraft are powered by turbofans. These engines, with their lower exhaust velocities, produce less <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> and use less fuel. Turbojets are still used to power medium range cruise missiles, due to their high exhaust speed, low frontal area and relative simplicity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{relationships between}} the noise generation characteristics and the flow-field characteristics for inverted-velocity-profile coaxial <b>jets.</b> <b>Noise</b> measurements were made at four different sideline distances {{in order to determine}} the apparent noise source locations, and flow-field characteristics were determined from jet plume pressure/temperature surveys. These relationships are based on a published NASA Lewis prediction model, the basic assumptions of which are shown to be consistent with the experimental data reported herein. Improvements to the noise prediction procedure, on the basis of the present study, are included, which increase the accuracy of the high-frequency noise prediction...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the impact of {{aircraft}} noise on the environment in the vicinity of an airport, it is essential that a methodology be developed for predicting in-flight exhaust noise from static data. Such a methodology is presented in this paper and is compared with experimental data for several unsuppressed turbojet engines. For each engine, static data over a range of jet velocities are compared with the predicted <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise</b> and shock-cell noise. The static engine noise over and above the <b>jet</b> and shock <b>noises</b> is identified as 'excess' noise. The excess noise data are then empirically correlated to smooth the spectral and directivity relations and account for variations in test conditions. This excess noise is then projected to flight based on the assumption that the only effects of flight are a Doppler frequency shift and a level change. The effects of flight on <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise</b> and shock noise are computed by published NASA methods...|$|R

40|$|Mean plume {{static and}} pitot {{pressures}} and far-field acoustic pressure were measured for an underexpanded convergent nozzle in simulated flight. Results show that supersonic <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise</b> behaves in flight {{in the same}} way that subsonic <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise</b> does. Regarding shock-associated noise, the frequencies of both screech and peak broadband shock noise were found to decrease with flight speed. The external flow determines the dominant screech mode over a wide range of nozzle pressure rations. Change in the screech mode strongly affects both the development of the downstream shock structure and the characteristic frequency of the broadband shock-associated noise. When no mode change occurs, the main effect of the external flow is to stretch the axial development of the shock cells...|$|R
40|$|Reduction of <b>jet</b> engine <b>noise</b> has {{recently}} {{become a new}} arena of competition between aircraft manufacturers. As a relatively new field of research in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), computational aeroacoustics (CAA) prediction of <b>jet</b> engine <b>noise</b> based on large eddy simulation (LES) is a robust and accurate tool that complements the existing theoretical and experimental approaches. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of CAA on numerical accuracy, finite difference methods in LES-based <b>jet</b> engine <b>noise</b> prediction rely on the implicitly formulated compact spatial partial differentiation and spatial filtering schemes, a crucial component of which is an embedded solver for tridiagonal linear systems spatially oriented along the three coordinate directions of the computational space. Traditionally, researchers and engineers in CAA have employed manually crafted implementations of solvers including the transposition method, the multiblock method and the Schur complement method. Algorithmically, these solvers force a trade-off between numerical accuracy and parallel scalability. Programmingwise, implementing them {{for each of the}} three coordinate directions is tediously repetitive and error-prone. ^ In this study, we attempt to tackle both of these two challenges faced by researchers and engineers. We first describe an accurate and scalable tridiagonal linear system solver as a specialization of the truncated SPIKE algorithm and strategies for efficient implementation of the compact spatial partial differentiation and spatial filtering schemes. We then elaborate on two programming models tailored for composing regular grid-based numerical applications including finite difference-based LES of <b>jet</b> engine <b>noise,</b> one based on generalized elemental subroutines and the other based on functional array programming, and the accompanying code optimization and generation methodologies. Through empirical experiments, we demonstrate that truncated SPIKE-based spatial partial differentiation and spatial filtering deliver the theoretically promised optimal scalability in weak scaling conditions and can be implemented using the two programming models with performance on par with handwritten code while significantly reducing the required programming effort. ...|$|R
50|$|Significant {{contributions}} to noise pollution {{are made by}} internal combustion engines.

40|$|For many years, {{sweeping}} {{has been}} identified as an important temporal decorrelation mechanism in turbulence.

In this article we develop an efficient Random Particle-Mesh method which enables us to model successfully the sweeping mechanism. We use it to simulate the noise radiation of a realistic subsonic jet. The results show that sweeping dynamics of turbulence is an important noise production mechanism in <b>jets.</b> <b>Noise</b> from the fine-scale turbulence can be predicted.

50|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>noise</b> may {{be reduced}} by adding {{features}} to the exit of the nozzle which increase the surface area of the cylindrical jet. Commercial turbojets and early by-pass engines typically split the jet into multiple lobes. Modern high by-pass turbofans have triangular serrations, called chevrons, which protrude slightly into the propelling jet.|$|E
50|$|The {{propelling}} jet produces <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> {{which is}} caused by the violent mixing action of the high speed jet with the surrounding air. In the subsonic case the noise is produced by eddies and in the supersonic case by Mach waves. The sound power radiated from a jet varies with the jet velocity raised to the eighth power for velocities up to 2,000 ft/sec and varies with the velocity cubed above 2,000 ft/sec. Thus, the lower speed exhaust jets emitted from engines such as high bypass turbofans are the quietest, whereas the fastest jets, such as rockets, turbojets, and ramjets, are the loudest. For commercial jet aircraft the <b>jet</b> <b>noise</b> has reduced from the turbojet through bypass engines to turbofans {{as a result of a}} progressive reduction in propelling jet velocities. For example, the JT8D, a bypass engine, has a jet velocity of 1450 ft/sec whereas the JT9D, a turbofan, has jet velocities of 885 ft/sec (cold) and 1190 ft/sec (hot).|$|E
40|$|The {{noise of}} the TF 30 {{afterburning}} turbofan engine in an F- 111 airplane was determined from static (ground) and flyover tests.

It was found that the noise produced at static conditions was dominated by <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise,</b> and was adequately predicted by current methods. The noise produced during flyovers exhibited large contributions from internally generated noise in the forward arc. For flyovers with the engine at nonafterburning power, the internal noise, shock <b>noise,</b> and <b>jet</b> mixing <b>noise</b> were accurately predicted.
