5|$|New {{office manager}} Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) picks {{favorites}} among the staff, including Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), a sycophantic Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who is attending business school thanks to Deangelo. He is also favorable towards Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who {{he believes is}} the head of the customer service department, and Kelly Kapoor's (Mindy Kaling) direct supervisor. Kelly is initially irate at the situation, but Ryan agrees to be a more dutiful boyfriend in exchange for Kelly keeping up the charade. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) desperately aspires to join the inner circle, while Deangelo repeatedly attempts to win over Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who is still apathetic toward the new boss. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) sees his style as sexist, as every member of the inner circle is male, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) agrees to, as Deangelo has repeatedly been acting coldly towards her. To prove to the staff that he's not sexist, Deangelo hires a woman named Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn), who turns out to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> experience (having previously worked in Anthropologie) over other qualified candidates, including a friend of Pam's. Kelly later attempts to tell Deangelo the truth about Ryan's actual position as a temp worker, but Deangelo simply appoints Ryan as the department head rather than figuring out the truth.|$|E

25|$|Serbia: A small protest {{took place}} in the town of Zenta (Senta) on this day. The {{demonstration}} was organised by a local ethnic Hungarian political party. These people wanted to show their sympathy for the demonstrators in Hungary because, in their opinion, all people who peacefully demonstrate on the streets in Hungary had previously voted to give Hungarian citizenship to the ethnic Hungarians in the neighboring countries. Attila Juhász, the mayor of the town, said that he and his party (the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians), which is the most influential ethnic Hungarian party in Serbia, believe that Hungarians in Vojvodina <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> in the Hungarian events.|$|E

500|$|In 1923 the {{composer}} Frederic Austin wrote the opera Polly, closely {{based on the}} 1729 work {{of the same name}} by John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch; recordings of Austin's work were published by Columbia's main rival, the Gramophone Company. At Columbia's request Ketèlbey produced his own version of Gay's original. Austin considered that it copied elements of his, and sued for copyright infringement. Acting as a court expert witness, {{the composer}} Sir Frederick Bridge thought that the case [...] "...is an awful bore.... These two good men are good musicians, and they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> to be fighting over the game. It is not worth the trouble.... It is rubbish. I am sick of Polly." [...] After three weeks the case ended with the judge finding against Columbia.|$|E

[...] Tamar Anitai, a blogger for MTV, said the episode was [...] "hilarious". He said [...] "The South Park writers actually appeared to sympathize, if not side with, the Jonas Brothers ... In the end, Disney and Christianity ended up getting a far more severe skewering than the Jonas Brothers." [...] Alan Sepinwall, television writer for The Star-Ledger, {{said he thought the}} Mickey Mouse character was used as an effective satirical device for corporate greed, but said he was not particularly impressed with the overall episode because [...] "its targets — the Jonas Brothers, and the Disney company for using them to sell sex to little girls with impunity — were so easy to hit". In contrast, Parents Television Council (PTC), criticized the episode for such elements, and they named this episode the [...] "Worst Cable Content of the Week".|$|E

500|$|Nelson's {{passage from}} Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to {{his lack of}} frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance {{and as a result}} only spoke with three {{merchant}} ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet. The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast. Although Captain Thomas Thompson of HMS Leander requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible. Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away. The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory. As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard Orient, his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating. When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy {{out of sight of the}} British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed. On 28 June, Mutine [...] arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour. Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul George Baldwin, but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city. As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson. A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in Mutine. Kurayyim replied that he had not seen the French fleet, and that he would enforce the Ottoman Empire's neutrality and forbid both the British and the French from entering the harbour or landing on the coast. He was dismissive of the British warnings: [...] "It is impossible that the French should come to our country. They <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> here and we are not at war with them." [...] Without Baldwin no further entries could be made, and when there was still no sign of the French on the morning of 29 June, Nelson decided to turn back northeast and take another pass across the central Mediterranean towards Corfu, following a more northerly course than his first voyage.|$|E

They <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> saying, 'Let's do a strike' when it will create a humongous burden on immigrant groups. They need to stay in their box."
