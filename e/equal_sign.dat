40|$|Young {{children}} often develop a partial, operational {{understanding of the}} <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> that refers to completing an action, such as getting the answer to an addition or multiplication question, and fail to develop a relational understanding of the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> as a symbol that denotes equivalence. A partial view of the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> as an operator can {{be the result of}} primary-age pupils’ overexposure to canonical equations such as a+b=c. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the different syntaxes and formats used to present equality statements in the Grade 1 textbooks in Greece. The quantitative analysis reveals an overemphasis on presenting the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> within canonical equations. However, qualitative analysis reveals that the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> is first introduced in a context that conveys the idea of equivalence relation and is presented within an interesting mix of symbolic and non-symbolic contexts which may minimise the tendency to interpret the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> exclusively as an operator...|$|R

40|$|A {{cumulative}} body {{of research}} has shown that children typically shift from an operational to a relational conception of the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> as they move through schooling. Jones (2008) argued that a truly relational conception of the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> comprises a substitutive component and a sameness component. Here we present two studies that build on this argument. The first investigated how the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> is typically presented to primary children in England, and we report that in the main an operational conception seems to be promoted. The second study measured the impact of a specially designed intervention on early secondary children’s conceptions of the <b>equals</b> <b>sign.</b> Pre- and post-test data revealed that the intervention promoted substitutive and sameness components of symbolic equivalence.

40|$|This thesis explores children’s {{conceptions of}} the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> {{from the vantage point}} of notating task design. The {{existing}} literature reports that young children tend to view the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> as meaning “write the result here”. Previous studies have demonstrated that teaching an “is the same as” meaning leads to more flexible thinking about mathematical notation. However, these studies are limited because they do not acknowledge or teach children that the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> also means “can be exchanged for”. The thesis explores the “sameness” and “exchanging” meanings for the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> by addressing four research questions. The first two questions establish the distinction, in terms of task design, between the two meanings. Does the “can be exchanged for” meaning for the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> promote attention to statement form? Are the “can be exchanged for” and “is the same as” meanings for the <b>equals</b> <b>sign</b> pedagogically distinct? The final two research questions seek to establish how children might coordinate the two meanings, and connect them with their existing implicit knowledge of arithmetic principles. Can children coordinate “can be exchanged for” and “is the same as” meanings for the <b>equals</b> <b>sign?</b> Can children connect their implicit arithmetical knowledge with explicit transformations of notation? The instrument used is a specially designed notational computer-microworld called Sum Puzzles. Qualitative data are generated from trials with pairs of Year 5 (9 and 10 years), and in one case Year 8 (12 and 13 years), pupils working collaboratively with the microworld toward specified task goals. It is discovered that the “sameness” meaning is useful for distinguishing equality statements by truthfulness, whereas the “exchanging” meaning is useful for distinguishing statements by form. Moreover, a duality of both meanings can help children connect their own mental calculation strategies with transformations of properly formed notation.
