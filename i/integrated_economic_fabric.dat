The structure of the system made it possible for the Ottomans to economize on the transaction cost of measuring the tax base. Regional variations resulted from both efficient adaptations and institutional rigidities. ...|$|R

Given the importance of SSFs in the social and <b>economic</b> <b>fabric</b> of many least developed countries, it is essential that new management approaches are developed and adopted.
