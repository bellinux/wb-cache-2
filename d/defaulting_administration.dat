A default is a risk that is a neglect to pay money-related obligations, as an outline when a bank cannot return the standard sum (bank crumple). The term default basically implies an account holder who has not paid an obligation. In legitimate terms, it is indebtedness suggesting that an account holder cannot pay. The probability of default (PD) is a credit risk which gives a gauge of the probability of a borrower’s will and identity unfitness to meet its obligation commitments (Bandyopadhyay 2006).|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis explores the everyday experiences with unemployment and job searching practices in a so-called work club in Northern England. A work club is a place, often a community initiative, where jobseekers who are finding it difficult {{to look for work}} independently can go to for support and assistance. These initiatives are encouraged to be set up by volunteers by the UK Department for Work and Pensions and its Jobcentre Plus and are aimed at reducing unemployment levels by helping people apply for jobs. Specifically, the thesis focuses on contemporary job searching practices and asks what Banterby SC work club, the fictional name of the field work location, can tell us about how neoliberal ideologies influence both these job searching practices as well as {{the way we think about}} the relationship between employment and citizenship. Work clubs have only received scant academic attention, and this study shows how more in-depth explorations can provide us with some valuable insights. Specifically, because doing so helps us to look beyond policy formulations, framings and imperatives to the implications of neoliberal ideologies in peoples everyday lives. The study uses an iterative inductive ethnographic approach, focusing on one single site field work location, encompassing two hundred hours of field work, during which at least 96 jobseekers have visited the premises of the work club. The study s approach to doing ethnographic fieldwork was based on viewing participant observation as hanging out; that is, more than merely being somewhere, but rather as engaging and being active in an informal fashion, something that the flexible and unstructured nature of the field work location suited very well. Through this ethnographic, in-depth exploration, then, I do not only explore the observations and findings as offered by some of the previous scholars exploring work clubs, but also seek to connect the findings to Bourdieu s theories of symbolic power/violence as a theoretical framework, which allows us to explore the wider implications of neoliberal governmentalities imposed on jobseekers that influence their everyday practices. This study extends not only our knowledge of the lived experiences of unemployment, but also provides a contemporary insight into work clubs, and how Banterby SC work club has proven to be a valuable site of knowledge about everyday experiences with neoliberal governmentalities toward unemployment and job searching practices. It also extends the application of a symbolic power/violence lens by bringing it together with Foucault s neoliberal governmentalities. Specifically, the study argues that neoliberal governmentalities influencing job searching and unemployment practices are a form of symbolic violence. This approach helps us to problematise job searching practices at work clubs in order to argue for increased critical attention on these sites. Furthermore, the study uncovers the extent to which a welfare system gearing towards a digital by <b>default</b> <b>administration</b> disadvantages many jobseekers who are finding it difficult to work with computers and navigate the internet. The study also addresses and explores to what extent compliance with symbolic power/violence is also shared by staff and volunteers of third sector organisations whose main goal it is to alleviate the burden of unemployment by assisting jobseekers to fulfil their job searching obligations as asked of them by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Jobcentre Plus. Finally, the study calls for more beneficiary-centred voluntary sector research, and proposes a new methodological model for exploring voluntary action and organizations, arguing for a more integrated analysis of the experiences of various actors...|$|R
40|$|Accuracy {{evaluation}} of the <b>default</b> Federal Highway <b>Administration</b> (FHWA) simplified equation for prediction of maximum soil nail loads under working conditions is presented in this study using the maximum likelihood method and {{a large amount of}} measured lower and upper bound nail load data reported in the literature. Accuracy was quantitatively expressed as model bias where model bias is defined as the ratio of measured to predicted nail load. The maximum likelihood estimation was carried out assuming normal and lognormal distributions of bias. Analysis outcomes showed that, based on the collected data, the default FHWA simplified nail load equation is satisfactorily accurate on average and the spread in prediction accuracy expressed as the coefficient of variation of bias is about 30 %, regardless of the distribution type. Empirical calibrations were proposed to the default FHWA simplified nail load equation for accuracy improvement. The Bayesian Information Criterion was adopted to perform a comparison of suitability between the competing normal and lognormal statistical models that were intended for description of model bias. Example of reliability-based design of soil nail walls against internal pullout limit state of nails is provided in the end to demonstrate the benefit of performing model calibration and using calibrated model for design of soil nails...|$|R
40|$|For decades, hazard {{assessments}} {{for environmental}} chemicals have used intra-gastric gavage {{to assess the}} effects of 'oral' exposures. It is now widely used [...] {{and in some cases}} required [...] by US federal agencies to assess potential toxicity of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In this review we enumerate several reasons why gavage is not appropriate for the assessment of EDCs using bisphenol A (BPA) as a main example. First, whereas human dietary exposures interact with the oral mucosa, gavage exposures avoid these interactions, leading to dramatic differences in absorption, bioavailability and metabolism with implications for toxicokinetic assumptions and models. Additionally, there are well acknowledged complications associated with gavage, such as perforation of the esophagus that diminish its value in toxicological experiments. Finally, the gavage protocol itself can induce stress responses by the endocrine system and confound the assessment of EDCs. These serious flaws have not been taken into account in interpreting results of EDC research. We propose the exploration of alternatives to mimic human exposures when there are multiple exposure routes/sources and when exposures are chronic. We conclude that gavage may be preferred over other routes for some environmental chemicals in some circumstances, but it does not appropriately model human dietary exposures for many chemicals. Because it avoids exposure pathways, is stressful, and thus interferes with endocrine responses, gavage should be abandoned as the <b>default</b> route of <b>administration</b> for hazard assessments of EDCs...|$|R
40|$|Aims: In recent years, intracoronary bolus {{abciximab}} {{has emerged}} {{as an alternative to}} the standard intravenous route in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of the current study was to perform an individual patient-level pooled analysis of randomised trials, comparing intracoronary versus intravenous abciximab bolus use in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI. Methods and results: Individual data of 3, 158 patients enrolled in five trials were analysed. Reperfusion endpoints were: post-procedural Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow, myocardial blush grade (MBG) 2 / 3 and complete ST-segment resolution. The primary clinical endpoint of interest was the composite of death and reinfarction at 30 days. Compared with the intravenous route, intracoronary abciximab bolus administration did not improve TIMI 3 flow (odds ratio [OR] 1. 19; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 90 - 1. 59; p= 0. 23) and complete ST-segment resolution (OR 1. 22, 95 % CI: 0. 92 - 1. 63, p= 0. 17), but increased MBG 2 / 3 occurrence (OR 1. 83, 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 3. 18, p= 0. 03). At 30 -day follow-up, intracoronary bolus abciximab did not reduce the risk of death and reinfarction (OR 0. 78, 95 % CI: 0. 55 - 1. 10, p= 0. 16), death (OR 0. 77, 95 % CI: 0. 51 - 1. 17, p= 0. 22), reinfarction (OR 0. 79, 95 % CI: 0. 46 - 1. 33, p= 0. 38) and stent thrombosis (OR 0. 77, 95 % CI: 0. 43 - 1. 35, p= 0. 36) as compared with intravenous administration. Conclusions: In STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, intracoronary abciximab does not provide additional benefits as compared with standard intravenous treatment and, therefore, it should not be recommended as the <b>default</b> route of <b>administration</b> in this setting...|$|R
40|$|Background:We {{previously}} reported decreased mortality following {{implementation of a}} commu-nity-acquired pneumonia guideline derived from specialty society recommendations. However, patients with respiratory failure and sepsis from pneumonia were not included, adjustment for comorbidities was limited, and no guideline compliance data were available. We also questioned whether decreased mortality continued after 1997. Methods: We utilized Utah data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid from 1993 to 2003 to determine if pneumonia guideline implementation was associated with 30 -day all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate. We adjusted outcomes by age, gender, Deyo comorbidity score, prior hospitalizations, and race. Guideline compliance was measured by initial <b>default</b> guideline antibiotic <b>administration.</b> We included patients> 66 years old with primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 480. 0 – 483. 9, 485. 0 – 486. 9, 487. 0, 507. 0 or 518. 81, and 038. x with secondary code pneumonia. We excluded patients with prior hospitalization within 10 days, patients with HIV infection or transplant recipients, and patients not treated by physicians closely affiliated with study hospitals. Results:Mean (SD) age of 17, 728 pneumonia patients {{admitted to the hospital}} was 72. 3 12. 0 years, 55. 2 % were female, and 96. 0 % were white. Within Intermountain Healthcare hospitals, a 1 -SD increase (10 %) in guideline compliance (range, 61 to 100 %) was associated with mortality odds ratio (OR) of 0. 92 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 87 to 0. 98; p 0. 007). Mortality OR at 16 Intermountain Healthcare hospitals was 0. 89 (95 % CI, 0. 82 to 0. 97; p 0. 007) compared with 19 other Utah hospitals. This mortality difference corresponds to approximately 20 lives saved yearly. The readmission rate was also lower. Conclusion: Improved clinical outcomes were associated with pneumonia guideline utilization...|$|R
