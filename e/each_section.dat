5|$|A brief {{overview}} {{of the contents of}} the manuscript follows, with the main sectioning and a general idea of the contents of <b>each</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
5|$|Students {{may receive}} college credit or upper-level college course {{placement}} upon the {{successful completion of}} a three-hour exam ordinarily administered in May. The exam consists of a multiple choice section and a free response section that are both 90 minutes long. <b>Each</b> <b>section</b> is weighted equally in determining the students' composite scores.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage {{is divided}} into three sound groups, the Organ Section, the Piano Section, and the Synthesizer Section. <b>Each</b> <b>section</b> can be played {{independently}} or simultaneously, divided into specific key ranges (splitting), and blended with independent volume controls.|$|E
50|$|The IBM Information Center link {{referenced}} below has {{a mapping}} of <b>each</b> <b>sections</b> data fields with {{a description of}} what the data represents.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} explorers {{came across}} the Yir-Yoront in their traditional lands, <b>each</b> <b>sectioned</b> according to patrilineal clan divisions, at the mouths of the Mitchell River.|$|R
50|$|These documents, {{descriptions}} and commentary encompass Japanese bilateral and international relations; {{and the work}} has been parsed into sections by country across 350 volumes. The text is organized chronologically within <b>each</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
5|$|A Scout Group {{consists}} {{of one or}} more units for different age groups: a Cub Pack, a Scout Troop, and less commonly a Rover Crew. Large Groups may have more than one of <b>each</b> <b>section,</b> or may have separate units for boys and girls. Rover Crews can also be associated with a Region or District.|$|E
5|$|After Zobel {{arrived at}} the Engineering Department of AT he used his {{mathematical}} skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters {{now known as the}} image method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of <b>each</b> <b>section</b> are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.|$|E
5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>section</b> of {{the process}} was overseen {{by one of the}} prisoners, and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E
50|$|All the Universal Carriers {{were armed}} with a Bren light machine gun and one carrier in <b>each</b> carrier <b>section</b> also had a Boys {{anti-tank}} rifle. By 1941, the carrier platoon had increased in strength to contain four carrier sections; one carrier in <b>each</b> carrier <b>section</b> also carried a 2-inch mortar.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{object of}} the present paper is to study {{three-dimensional}} generalized (k, µ) −contact metric manifolds with η−recurrent Ricci tensor and harmonic curvature tensor. φ−Ricci symmetric generalized (k, µ) −contact metric manifolds of dimension three are also considered. <b>Each</b> <b>sections</b> are followed by examples to illustrate the obtained results...|$|R

5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>section,</b> such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Kleinman {{contacted}} {{a pair of}} Canadian graphic novel {{artists to}} begin the storyboarding process. Storyboarding the commercial meant that the agency could determine {{how much of the}} £1.3M budget to allocate to <b>each</b> <b>section,</b> and provided them with visuals to use as part of the presentation to Diageo when pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue. The effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production.|$|E
5|$|Scouts South Africa caters {{for youth}} {{and young adults}} from the ages of 7 through 30. It is split into three sections, Cubs, Scouts, and Rovers, with <b>each</b> <b>section</b> serving a {{different}} age group, and concentrating on different areas of personal development. It {{is also one of}} the largest youth organisations in the rural parts of South Africa and performs many community upliftment programmes in those areas.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to understanding where {{the slope of the}} influence line changes for this method because the influence-line equation will change for <b>each</b> linear <b>section</b> of the influence line. Therefore, the complete equation will be a piecewise linear function which has a separate influence-line equation for <b>each</b> linear <b>section</b> of the influence line.|$|R
5000|$|The firing section, which {{includes}} the individual gun <b>sections.</b> <b>Each</b> gun <b>section</b> is typically led by a staff sergeant (US Army Enlisted pay grade E-6); the firing section {{as a whole is}} usually led by a lieutenant and a senior NCO.|$|R
50|$|As of School Year 2012-2013, San Juan National High School has 6 {{sections}} for Grade 7, 6 sections for Grade 8, 4 sections for Grade 9 and 5 {{sections in}} Grade 10. <b>Each</b> <b>sections</b> is facilitated by a Class Adviser {{and each year}} level is supervised by a Chief Adviser usually assumed by the adviser of the first section.|$|R
5|$|Some enemies move in {{predictable}} {{patterns and}} others hunt the player. They range in resemblance from larva and vultures to spiders. While ascending the mountain, the player passes through themed biomes, such as forest, desert, and snow, and <b>each</b> <b>section</b> {{of the mountain}} introduces new enemies that force the player to modify their strategy. TumbleSeed is depicted in a simple, colorful art style. Its characters are one-eyed, seed-shaped creatures who occasionally have hats. Their dialogue is visualized with speech bubbles, in text and emoji. Additionally, TumbleSeed includes other features including quests, leaderboards, and daily challenges.|$|E
5|$|Stela 3 {{is badly}} damaged, being broken into three pieces. It was found {{somewhere on the}} San Isidro Piedra Parada {{plantation}} although its exact original location is not known. It was moved to a museum in Guatemala City. The lower portion of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, <b>each</b> <b>section</b> containing a symbol or glyph.|$|E
5|$|The Amateur Station Operator's Licence, General Grade, {{requires}} {{a minimum of}} 50% in <b>each</b> <b>section</b> of the written examination, and 60% overall, and a demonstration of proficiency in sending and receiving Morse code at 8 words per minute (without errors for each). The minimum age is 14 years. The licence allows a user to make radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony transmission in 13 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 400W. In addition, satellite communication, facsimile, and television modes are permitted.|$|E
5000|$|The big loser {{under the}} new system was the City of Paris, which had {{dominated}} events {{in the first part}} of the Revolution. On 24 August 1794, the committees of <b>each</b> <b>sections</b> of e arrondissements of Paris, within a new department, the department of the Seine replacing the former [...] "Department of Paris" [...] created in 1790.|$|R

50|$|The Ramon Torres National High School has 24 {{sections}} for the Grade Seven level, 23 sections for the Grade Eight, 20 sections for the Grade Nine and 18 {{sections in}} the Fourth Year. <b>Each</b> <b>sections</b> is facilitated by a <b>Section</b> Adviser and <b>each</b> year level is supervised by a Class Adviser usually assumed by the Section Adviser {{of the first}} section.|$|R
5|$|The Duke and Jones {{intended}} to run {{no more than}} one train on <b>each</b> <b>section</b> of the line so the line was not built with passing loops or signalling. When more than one horse-drawn train or locomotive was in operation, the Tramway operated a token system using colour-coded staffs to ensure only one train could be on a section. Drivers between Quainton Road and Wotton carried a blue staff, those on west of Wotton and the Kingswood siding a red staff.|$|E
5|$|The Natural History is {{generally}} divided into the organic {{plants and animals}} and the inorganic matter, although there are frequent digressions in <b>each</b> <b>section.</b> The encyclopedia also notes the uses made {{of all of these}} by the Romans. Its description of metals and minerals is valued for its detail in the history of science, being the most extensive compilation still available from the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} tables list {{molecules that}} have been detected in the interstellar medium, grouped {{by the number of}} component atoms. If there is no entry in the molecule column, only the ionized form has been detected. For molecules where no designation was given in the scientific literature, that field is left empty. Mass is given in atomic mass units. The total number of unique species, including distinct ionization states, is listed in parentheses in <b>each</b> <b>section</b> header.|$|E
50|$|Structurally, {{there are}} two parts, <b>each</b> {{comprising}} three <b>sections.</b> <b>Each</b> movement is named after the six sections of Auden's poem, trying to mirror the moods and events in the poem.|$|R

30|$|For MPC studies, {{we propose}} that an {{approach}} {{for improving the}} match between the PET and CT in terms of density is to use an average of all the CT information to produce a combined-CT image (Fig.  5) for <b>each</b> study <b>section.</b> Results from applying the combined-CTs to <b>each</b> study <b>section</b> of the MPC protocols rectified TTAC discontinuity and improved parameter estimation (Fig.  6).|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{commercial}} propagation method {{is referred to}} as 'twin scales'. This involves the division of the bulb into 12 sections and then separating <b>each</b> <b>section</b> into twin scales connected by the basal plate. The cuttings that are derived from these are grown in moist vermiculite in the dark till bulbils appear. More recently growing them in sunlight produce a better crop.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the Atlas {{contains}} the maps but <b>each</b> <b>section</b> has its own title page, dedication and preface, and every country is succinctly supplemented by text describing a mixture of history, royal genealogy, ecclesiastical hierarchies, list of universities and occasionally facets of contemporary economy. Every place mentioned in the text is given its geographic coordinates to the nearest minute.|$|E
5|$|The {{version for}} {{personal}} computers (PC) is an action role-playing game which plays from a top-down perspective. Controlling Nakajima, the player explores the labyrinthine levels of a dungeon populated by enemies. Combat {{plays out in}} real time, with Nakajima fighting demons using both short-range melee attacks and ranged magic attacks. <b>Each</b> <b>section</b> of the dungeon ends in a powerful boss character.|$|E
30|$|According to the table, fitting {{residuals}} by the Gaussian {{model are}} smaller than the second-order polynomial model, so {{it is reasonable to}} use the Gaussian model to represent the gray scale distribution of the light strip on the measured object. When the light strip is a straight line, the gray scale distribution on <b>each</b> cross <b>section</b> is relatively uniform, and the gray scale fitting residual variation on <b>each</b> cross <b>section</b> is small. When the shape of light strip is curve, the gray scale fitting residual variation on <b>each</b> cross <b>section</b> is large. So the shape and material of the measured object have a great influence on the gray scale distribution of the light strip.|$|R
