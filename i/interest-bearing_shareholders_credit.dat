40|$|AbstractThe Taiwanese {{government}} offers {{firms that}} invest in qualified projects in emerging high-tech industries two mutually exclusive tax incentives—a corporate 5 -year tax exemption or <b>shareholder</b> investment tax <b>credits.</b> This study examines whether corporate managers take shareholder tax benefits into account in their corporate tax planning. The results show that privately held firms {{are more likely than}} listed firms to choose <b>shareholder</b> investment tax <b>credits</b> and forego corporate tax benefits. Listed firms with relatively high earnings response coefficients tend to choose a corporate 5 -year tax exemption, as it can enhance reported after-tax earnings. Further, in the 5 -year period following their choice of a particular tax incentive, firms choosing a corporate 5 -year tax exemption exhibit significantly lower earnings persistence than those choosing <b>shareholder</b> investment tax <b>credits.</b> Taken together, these results suggest that stock market pressure has a significant effect on firms’ choices between corporate and shareholder tax benefits, and that the choice of tax incentives has an effect on future earnings quality...|$|R

40|$|This paper tests two {{competing}} hypotheses describing investors' behavior: the efficient market hypothesis and the functional fixation hypothesis. In particular, {{this study examines}} how Taiwan's stock market interprets the nature of corporate income tax after the 1998 Tax Reform, which switches from the "classical" tax system to the "integrated" tax system. This Tax Reform changes the nature of corporate income tax from a pure operating expense to an individual <b>shareholder's</b> tax <b>credit,</b> but current GAAP still treats it as an operating expense in the income statement. The empirical results show that Taiwan's stock market perceives the change in nature of corporate income tax and responds accordingly. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2002. ...|$|R

5000|$|To a large extent, {{dividend}} imputation makes company tax irrelevant. This {{is because}} every dollar {{that a company}} pays in company tax can be claimed by the <b>shareholder</b> as franking <b>credit,</b> with no net revenue flowing to the government.

50|$|One {{effect is}} that this has reduced the {{effectiveness}} of tax incentives for corporations. If a corporation was given a tax break then its incomes thus released from taxation would not generate franking credits precisely because no tax was paid.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the {{enactment}} of the anti-thin capitalization rules on capital structure after the enactment of the anti-thin capitalization rules in Taiwan. According to the theoretical derivation, companies with lower <b>shareholder</b> imputed tax <b>credits</b> ratio tend to have greater debt-to-equity ratio, while companies with higher surtax on undistributed earnings ratio tend to have higher debt-to-equity ratio. This finding is consistent with the hypotheses of this study. However, the relationships between interest-bearing liability rate, marginal income tax rate and debt-to-equity ratios are uncertain. Using 2006 – 2012 sample data for the empirical study, this paper finds that enterprise’s total debt-to-equity ratios significantly decreases after the enactment of the anti-thin capitalization rules, and provisions preventing capital weakening have policy effectiveness. The <b>shareholder</b> imputed tax <b>credits</b> ratio and total debt-to-equity ratio are negatively correlated, while interest-bearing liability rate, marginal income tax rate, and surtax on undistributed earnings ratio, are positively correlated with total debt-to-equity ratio. This finding supports the hypotheses of this study. However, marginal income tax rate is lack of significance.

50|$|Dividends {{received}} by resident individuals and corporations {{are included in}} taxable income by most countries. A foreign tax credit is then allowed for any foreign income taxes paid by the shareholder on the dividends, such as by withholding of tax. Where the country taxes dividends at a lower rate, the tax eligible for credit is generally reduced. For example, US tax law requires individuals to reduce the foreign income tax by {{the ratio of the}} rate differential on dividends (39.6% less 20%) to the maximum individual tax rate (39.6%). Some countries have at times allowed <b>shareholders</b> a <b>credit</b> against the <b>shareholder's</b> tax for taxes paid by the corporations. Several countries allow corporations who own significant shares of other corporations to claim a foreign tax credit for a portion of the foreign income taxes paid by the owned corporation when the shareholding corporation receives a dividend.|$|R

We show that we can obtain a semi-closed form formula for the price of debt and equity when cash accounts are buffers to bankruptcy risk. As in other structural models, the strategic bankruptcy decision of <b>shareholders</b> drives <b>credit</b> spreads, and differentiates debt from equity. Cash flow risk also causes credit risk interdependencies between firms. Our model applies to the case where not only financial flows but also operations are dependent across firms. We use queueing theory to obtain our semi-closed form formulae in steady state. We perform a simplified implementation of our model to the US automotive industry and show how we infer the impact on a supplier’s credit spreads of revenue changes in a manufacturer or even in a large car dealer.

De Sole reacted by issuing new shares of stock in an effort to dilute the value of Arnault’s holdings. He also approached French holding company Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) about the possibility of forming a strategic alliance. François Pinault, the company’s founder, agreed to the idea and purchased 37 million shares in the company, or a 40% stake. Arnault’s share was diluted to a paltry 20%, and a legal battle ensued to challenge the legitimacy of the new Gucci-PPR partnership, with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom representing Gucci.

40|$|Could it be a fairy tale? Pineapples {{that are}} good for everybody, farmers, traders and {{consumers}} alike? Perhaps not. In 1999, around 170 Ghanaian pineapple growers organised themselves with the prime objective of getting a better price for their pineapples. With support from the World Bank, the farmers established a consortium called Farmapine, which consists of five producers' associations, who own 80 % of Farmapine, and two exporting companies, who own the remaining 20 % of the shares. Farmapine provides its <b>shareholders</b> with <b>credit,</b> inputs and advice on cultivation, hygiene and market information. An extra advantage for the farmers is not only higher prices, but prompt payment, two weeks after delivery to Farmapine. This is much more reliable than when they delivered to individual traders and payments were made much later or even not at all. Farmapine also operates a warehouse, for packing and shipping. The two participating trading companies were chosen for their experience in exporting to the European Union (Ghana s major market) {{and their ability to}} comply with a jungle of regulations concerning uses of chemicals, labour standards, freshness, hygiene, storage and transport. From a modest 9, 000 t in 1992, exports to Europe in 2000 exceeded 35, 000 t of pineapples. Of this, more than 12 % (or 4, 000 t) was exported by Farmapine.

40|$|There {{have been}} various {{proposals}} {{made in the}} past two decades to integrate the corporate and shareholder tax, including dividend exemption, imputation, and the Comprehensive Business Income Tax (CBIT). In our view, the problem with all of these proposals is that they omit to ask the crucial question of why we should tax business entities in the first place. Taxes, the economists tell us, are always borne by human beings, not by legal entities. Why should legal entities, be they corporations or other forms of business entity, be subject to tax at all? Would it not be easier to just tax people? It turns out that there are two good reasons to tax some business entities under some circumstances. Specifically, we believe that publicly traded corporations should be subject to tax (a) because it is hard to tax them on a pass-though basis, and if they are not taxed they become vehicles for tax deferral, and (b) because they are economically important and taxing them is a means to regulate the behavior of the people who run them. However, if those are the reasons for taxing business entities, then we believe that the right form of achieving corporate integration is not CBIT or its progeny, or dividend exemption, or imputation (giving <b>shareholders</b> a <b>credit</b> for the corporate tax). The right form of integration, we would argue, is dividend deduction. Dividend deduction is frequently mentioned in the literature on integration, but rarely analyzed. In what follows, we will try to explain why it is a superior form of integration, and resolve some of the hard questions it raises...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{considerable}} interest in {{the integration of the}} corporate and personal income taxes. Full integration, under which corporate-source income would be taxed only to shareholders, has significant economic advantages, but it suffers from severe practical difficulties. Some but not all of its advantages could be realized through dividend relief. Alternative means of providing dividend relief include a deduction for dividends paid, application of a lower corporate rate to distributed income than to retained earnings, and allowing <b>shareholders</b> a dividend-received <b>credit</b> for corporate taxes imputed to have been paid on their behalf. The proper treatment of tax preferences and international flows of corporate-source income raise important issues of tax administration and public policy. It is necessary, for example, to decide whether tax preferences are to be passed through to shareholders or nullified when preference income is distributed. Beyond that, "stacking rules" are required for the presumptive allocation of dividends between preference and taxable income. Further research on both economic effects and administrative feasibility is necessary for an adequate appraisal of integration. ...|$|R

According to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) policy brief report on SME development in 2006, Financing is necessary to help Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) set up and expand their operations, develop new products, and invest in new staff or production facilities. The study reveals that the major sources of finance for SMEs in Ghana are trade credit, bank overdraft and bank loans. The internal sources of finance and leasing or hire purchase are the minor source to which only few entrepreneurs resort to. The availability of external financing depends on various factors for instance, general economic outlook, access to public financial support including guarantees, firm-specific outlook with respect to their sales and profitability or business plan, firm’s own capital, firm’s credit history and willingness of commercial banks to provide loan.
