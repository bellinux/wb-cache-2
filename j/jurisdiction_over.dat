5|$|From its foundation, the Court of Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> trusts. While {{the main}} burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the Court of Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute of Wills, many people used feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting of assets, the process used by the Court of Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the Court of Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> some estates matters, but their remedies for problems were far more limited.|$|E

By 1530, the Audiencia Real of Mexico had <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> {{the province}} of Soconsusco, which was now held in encomienda by the Spanish Crown. It was governed by colonial officers appointed in Mexico. In 1556, Soconusco passed into {{the jurisdiction of the}} Audiencia Real of Guatemala, with independent governors appointed by the Crown. From 1564–69, Soconusco was passed back into the jurisdiction of Mexico, before once again becoming an independent province administered by the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, where it remained until the late 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex was a {{legal fiction}} {{used by the}} Court of King's Bench to gain <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> cases {{traditionally}} in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas. Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming that the defendant had committed trespass in Middlesex. Once the defendant was in custody, the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or detinue) would be substituted.|$|E

5|$|He {{administered}} for {{the king}} {{a large proportion of}} the vacant ecclesiastical offices. He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics. Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099, being consecrated on 5 June 1099. He had been the custodian of the see since the death of the previous bishop in early 1096. At his consecration, he managed to avoid giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York, just as his predecessor had done. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, accused Ranulf of paying 1,000 pounds for the bishopric. He was given ecclesiastical <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> Carlisle and Cumbria, because his predecessors had done so as bishops of Lindisfarne, but he only exercised this for a short time, as after the accession of Henry I <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>over</b> these areas was transferred to the diocese of York.|$|E
