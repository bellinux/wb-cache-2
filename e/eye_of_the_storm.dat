25|$|The 1943 Surprise Hurricane, which struck Houston during World War II, {{marked the}} first {{intentional}} meteorological flight into a hurricane. That summer, British pilots being trained as instrument instructor pilots at Bryan Army Airfield heard that the school was evacuating its AT-6 Texan trainers {{in the face of}} the oncoming hurricane, and began teasing their instructors about the airworthiness of the aircraft. Instrument flying school commander USAAF Lt. Col. Joseph B. Duckworth, a former airline pilot with Eastern Airlines who had developed instrument procedures for the carrier, bet his RAF students that he could safely fly into the storm and return. On 27 July 1943 he took out one of the trainers with 2nd Lt Ralph M. O'Hair navigating and flew it straight into the <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> After he returned safely, the base's only weather officer, 1st Lt William H. Jones-Burdick, took over the navigator's seat and Duckworth flew into the storm (now over land) a second time, this time recording their observations and measuring temperatures within the storm. The flights demonstrated that hurricane reconnaissance flights were feasible.|$|E
25|$|Meridian also geared a {{large amount}} of its network output towards younger viewers, with {{independent}} commissions including Wizadora for pre-school children, plus ZZZap!, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, It's a Mystery, The Vanishing Man, Jane Austen's Emma, William and Mary and <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Storm</b> for older children. Drama became a successful genre for the station, with Peter Kosminsky's No Child of Mine, tackling the emotionally difficult subject of child abuse, winning Meridian a BAFTA award. Meridian presents Mary Wesley's two novels: Harnessing Peacocks and The Vacillations of Poppy Carew. Later, the same production team tackled vicious childhood bullying in Walking on the Moon. Meridian's two-part production In the Name of Love in 1999 starred Tara Fitzgerald, Tim Dutton and Mark Strong, and was written by Sarah-Louise Hawkins and directed by Ferdinand Fairfax. Hornblower was a Sunday night success for the ITV network while another Sunday night favourite, Where the Heart Is, transferred production from Anglia Television to Meridian in 2002 - the station's last major contribution at a network level.|$|E
25|$|Following peak intensity, further {{strengthening}} was inhibited due to {{the emergence}} of a high pressure area over the United States Gulf Coast. The presence of this system injected dry air into Hilda, gradually weakening the hurricane. The once prominent <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> clouded over {{as a result of this}} advection. During the evening hours of Octobernbsp&3, Hilda made landfall on the central Louisiana coast with a minimum pressure of 950nbsp&mbar (hPa; 28.06nbsp&inHg) and maximum sustained winds of , making it equivalent to a Categorynbsp&3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Rapid weakening followed landfall as a result of the surrounding cold air; by 0600UTC on October4, Hilda had been downgraded to tropical storm intensity. The same area of high pressure which had weakened the tropical cyclone later forced Hilda eastward, resulting in the storm's merging with a cold front and thus transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. These extratropical remnants continued to track eastward before they were last noted near Jacksonville, Florida on October5.|$|E
50|$|The {{tropical}} disturbance {{that would later}} mature into Typhoon Janis formed near Pohnpei in the eastern Caroline Islands towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> July 1992. At 06:00 UTC on July 30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system. Increased convective development led to <b>the</b> issuance <b>of</b> a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 13:00 UTC on August 2. Intensification continued through the morning hours, and at 00:00 UTC, the JTWC issued the first warning on Tropical Depression 10W, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) following suit at the same time. At 14:39 UTC, a Hurricane hunter aircraft was able to identify a well-defined center as well as winds of 35 mph. Passing near Guam and moving into the Philippine Sea, the depression organized further and was upgraded to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on August 3 by both the JTWC and JMA. At around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> and assigned it with the local name Gloring. Midday on August 4, the JMA classified Janis into a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, Janis was declared a typhoon by the JTWC, with the JMA doing the same at 00:00 UTC on August 5. According to the JTWC, Janis entered a period of rapid deepening, intensifying 40 mph during <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> August 5. At 00:00 UTC on August 6, the JTWC increased <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> to 215 km/h (130 mph), equivalent to a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Operationally, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was believed to have attained winds 230 km/h (145 mph), based on Dvorak estimates from polar orbiting satellite imagery. However, in post-storm analysis, the JTWC determined that due to <b>the</b> high resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was overestimated, prompting the agency to revise its Dvorak methods to better match intensity estimates derived from geostationary satellites.|$|R

Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have {{a discussion}} with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted.

500|$|While {{the most}} obvious motion of clouds is toward the center, {{tropical}} cyclones also develop an upper-level (high-altitude) outward flow of clouds. These originate from air that has released its moisture and is expelled at high altitude through the [...] "chimney" [...] of the storm engine. This outflow produces high, thin cirrus clouds that spiral away from the center. The clouds are thin enough for the sun to be visible through them. These high cirrus clouds {{may be the first}} signs of an approaching tropical cyclone. As air parcels are lifted within the <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> the vorticity is reduced, causing the outflow from a tropical cyclone to have anticyclonic motion. [...] If two tropical cyclones are in proximity to one another, the outflow from the system downstream (normally to the west) can hinder the development of the system upstream (normally to the east).|$|E
