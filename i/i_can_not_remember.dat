40|$|Thanks to Patrick for {{not only}} being my PhD supervisor, but for {{actually}} shaping me as a scientist. Your approach of giving people as much freedom as possible, {{and at the same}} time keeping track of what they are doing, has taught me to confidently asses my abilities, to not only follow advice, but also come up with my own ideas and solutions, and finally to become a scientist that can work independently, but is never shy to ask for help or take advice. Your skill of creating a multifaceted team of like-minded people, and not allowing lone warriors, brings together what is not seen too often- successful research and happy people. I'm extremely grateful for having worked with you, for your support and for experiencing that research is not mostly about working hard, but about working passionate. Thanks to all the members of the Cramer group for being an outstanding team that-in my eyes- is hard to find in research these days. The warm-hearted and cheerful working atmosphere experienced in this group is invaluable, and the great team spirit kept many people motivated during difficult times, including me. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> a single occasion where help was refused by anyone, and similarly there were countless occasions where people took their time to figure out a solution for yet another Bye 1 -related problem. Every person in the lab has contributed to this truly memorable time, and I especially want to thank Amelie...|$|E

60|$|When I visit again some haunt of my youth, I {{am glad to}} {{find that}} nature wears so well. The {{landscape}} is indeed something real, and solid, and sincere, and I have not put my foot through it yet. There is a pleasant tract {{on the bank of}} the Concord, called Conantum, which I have in my mind;--the old deserted farm-house, the desolate pasture with its bleak cliff, the open wood, the river-reach, the green meadow in the midst, and the moss-grown wild-apple orchard,--places where one may have many thoughts and not decide anything. It is a scene which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>remember,</b> as <b>I</b> might a vision, but when <b>I</b> will <b>can</b> bodily revisit, and find it even so, unaccountable, yet unpretending in its pleasant dreariness. When my thoughts are sensible of change, I love to see and sit on rocks which I have known, and pry into their moss, and see unchangeableness so established. I not yet gray on rocks forever gray, I no longer green under the evergreens. There is something even in the lapse of time by which time recovers itself.|$|R
2500|$|Following the breakup, Christensen {{became more}} {{introverted}} than usual, {{and his girlfriend}} could not handle him being in this crisis. He went through a difficult time of coping with both his breakup with the band and with Rosendahl, but {{he went on to}} find his musical style, which resulted in the release of his debut solo album Secrets on Parade in 2000, of which some songs were based on the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy demos from 1998. Several songs on the album were rather ambiguous as to whether they referred to Dizzy Mizz Lizzy or Rosendahl. The album was a success, and it allowed him to further pursue a career in music. Nielsen and Friis initially also intended to continue in music, but turned to a normal working-class life. To walk off the extra weight he had gained from being at home for a long time, Nielsen {{took a job as a}} postman, while Friis became a truck driver delivering gas containers. Despite their different paths, Christensen explained in a 2000 interview that the trio remained friends: [...] "We meet occasionally and have great fun together. Of course we talk about the old days and amuse ourselves with it, because we experienced a lot of great things together and <b>I</b> simply <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> anything bad from back then. (...) But we just developed ourselves in three different directions, and we kept growing further apart, so it was simply the time to stop." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{remember}} {{whether this}} tale is true or not. If I read it through very carefully I have a suspicion that I {{should come to}} the conclusion that it is not. But, unfortunately, I cannot read it through very carefully, because, you see, it is not written yet. The image and the idea of it clung to me through a great part of my boyhood; I may have dreamt it before I could talk; or told it to myself before I could read; or read it before I could remember. On the whole, however, I am certain that I did not read it, for children have very clear memories about things like that; and of the books which I was really fond <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>remember,</b> <b>not</b> only the shape and bulk and binding, but even the position of the printed words on many of the pages. On the whole, I incline to the opinion that it happened to me before I was born.|$|R
5000|$|However, The Telegraph's Clive James was {{far less}} enthusiastic. [...] "Some of the Comic Strip’s {{catalogue}} is very good. They did {{a version of the}} Arthur Scargill story as it would have looked if Hollywood had taken it over and cast Al Pacino in the lead. I remember laughing at that. They did a version of The Professionals in which the pair of style-free heroes ran around the entire time with their lips pursed. It was called The Bullshitters. I remember laughing very hard at that. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> already <b>remember</b> <b>not</b> laughing at The Hunt for Tony Blair even once. It made all the standard references to Blair the war criminal as if that was enough. Meanwhile it recreated The 39 Steps and a whole era of British film in which Britain’s short list of stars struggled to be glamorous. Tony Blair, in fact, looked a bit like John Gregson, remembered by dozens of people even today. But even as you admired the fidelity of the stylistics, the show refused to fizz." [...] But John Preston, another Telegraph reviewer appears to have had a more mixed opinion of the production, writing: [...] "I saw the Comic Strip Presents… The Hunt for Tony Blair (Friday, Channel 4), described in another paper as [...] "mercilessly satirical". If that was merciless, then give those thumbscrews an extra turn - <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take it! In fact, just like every other Comic Strip film there’s ever been, it was quite funny in parts, and entirely unfunny in others.|$|R
6000|$|I {{had already}} sent these sheets to the press, concluding, as I thought, with a moral of {{excellent}} tendency for {{the encouragement of}} all fair haired, blue eyed, long legged, stout hearted emigrants from my native country, who might be willing in stirring times {{to take up the}} gallant profession of Cavalieros of Fortune. But a friendly monitor, one of those who, like the lump of sugar which is found {{at the bottom of a}} tea cup, as well as the flavour of the souchong itself, has entered a bitter remonstrance, and insists that I should give a precise and particular account of the espousals of the young heir of Glen Houlakin and the lovely Flemish Countess, and tell what tournaments were held, and how many lances were broken, upon so interesting an occasion; nor withhold from the curious reader the number of sturdy boys who inherited the valour of Quentin Durward, and of bright damsels, in whom were renewed the charms of Isabelle de Croye. I replied, in course of post, that times were changed, and public weddings were entirely out of fashion. In days traces of which <b>I</b> myself <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>not</b> only were the [...] "fifteen friends" [...] of the happy pair invited to witness their Union, but the bridal minstrelsy still continued, as in the [...] "Ancient Mariner," [...] to [...] "nod their heads" [...] till morning shone on them. The sack posset was eaten in the nuptial chamber--the stocking was thrown--and the bride's garter was struggled for in presence of the happy couple whom Hymen had made one flesh. The authors of the period were laudably accurate in following its fashions. They spared you not a blush of the bride, not a rapturous glance of the bridegroom, not a diamond in her hair, not a button on his embroidered waistcoat; until at length, with Astraea, [...] "they fairly put their characters to bed." [...] [the reference is to the plays of Mrs. Aphra Behn. [...] "The stage how loosely doth Astraea tread, who fairly puts each character to bed."] But how little does this agree with the modest privacy which induces our modern brides--sweet bashful darlings!--to steal from pomp and plate, and admiration and flattery, and, like honest Shenstone [(1714-1763): an English poet best known by The Schoolmistress], ...|$|R
