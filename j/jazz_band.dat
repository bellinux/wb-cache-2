With the average band containing up to 15-players, Dutch <b>jazz</b> <b>bands</b> tend to be the largest ensembles to play traditional jazz music.|$|R

2500|$|The {{history of}} the marching band in New Orleans is a rich one, with the various bands {{performing}} at virtually every major social event the city has to offer. They perform at funerals, picnics, carnivals and parades. The relationship between <b>jazz</b> <b>bands</b> and brass bands is one of co-influence. <b>Jazz</b> <b>bands</b> of this era began {{to go beyond the}} confines of the 6/8 time signature the marching bands utilized. Instead, New Orleans <b>jazz</b> <b>bands</b> began incorporating a style known as [...] "ragging"; this technique implemented the influence of ragtime 2/4 meter and eventually led to improvisation. In turn, the early <b>jazz</b> <b>bands</b> of New Orleans influenced the playing of the marching bands, who in turn began to improvise themselves more often. Again, yet another indication that jazz music is symbolic of freedom.|$|R

5|$|In {{gathering}} inspirations for Wrapped in Red, Clarkson {{started by}} listening to Bing Crosby's and Rosemary Clooney's soundtracks from the 1954 feature film White Christmas, as well as Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas (1994) and Merry Christmas to You (1997) by Reba McEntire. While Greg Kurstin, who used {{to play in a}} <b>jazz</b> <b>band,</b> took influences from A Charlie Brown Christmas by the Vince Guaraldi Trio and A Christmas Gift for You by Phil Spector as his inspirations, which resulted to the album's Wall of Sound resonance. Clarkson also cited that her relationship with her then-fiancé Brandon Blackstock had inspired some of the album's lyrical content.|$|E

5|$|Terry-Thomas {{made his}} {{professional}} stage début on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric Railwayman's Dining Club in South Kensington. He {{was billed as}} Thos Stevens, but only appeared as a minor turn. His performance brought heckles from the drunken audience, but earned him a commission of 30shillings. After this, he played a few minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions by the Edgware Operatic Society at the Scala Theatre. In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became travelling salesman of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing {{in order to make}} his pitch. In his spare time, he began playing the ukulele with a local <b>jazz</b> <b>band</b> called the Rhythm Maniacs. He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of Jessie Matthews. The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues, and they earned well from it. News soon travelled of the couple's talent, and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in Cricklewood. He found the dance-style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment.|$|E
