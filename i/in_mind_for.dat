5|$|Spielberg had Miranda Otto <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> {{the part}} of Mary Ann, {{but at the time}} he called her she was {{pregnant}} and thought the opportunity would be missed. Spielberg then decided to incorporate Otto's pregnancy into the film, changing the part for her.|$|E

5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist who had lived, {{performed}} and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw Russia as a musical desert compared to Paris, Berlin and Leipzig, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their art. With a similar ideal <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> Russia, he had conceived {{an idea for a}} conservatory in Russia years before his 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.|$|E

5|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>for</b> reasons both {{financial}} and creative. The developers conducted field {{research on the}} setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest, and subverted known archetypes to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game rather than traditional graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles. The voice recording sessions took place in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of his film Jeans (1998), S. Shankar wrote a script for his next film titled Mudhalvan (1999) having Rajinikanth <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the lead role. However, Rajinikanth could not act in the film due to {{schedule}} conflicts with Padayappa (1999). Hence the role went to Arjun Sarja. Post Anniyan (2005), Shankar decided to take a break before preparing for his next project.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Venkata Reddy had Akkineni Nageswara Rao <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> {{the lead}} role. He later wanted to cast Raja Reddy {{in the lead}} role but {{replaced}} him with N. T. Rama Rao in the last minute, who made his debut by playing a minor character in Mana Desam (1949). Rama Rao was eventually signed {{as a part of}} his four-film contract with Vijaya Vauhini Studios after Venkata Reddy was impressed with Rama Rao when he met him on the sets of Samsaram (1950). With this film, Rama Rao became the first actor to have acted in two languages simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|The idea of To {{directing}} an English-language film {{originated with}} ARP co-founders Michèle and Laurent Pétin, who had Alain Delon <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the lead role. In 2006, after Delon {{turned down the}} role, the Pétins recommended Hallyday, who was cast in the lead role after meeting with To in early 2008. Principal photography began in November 2008, and concluded in February 2009; filming took place on locations in Hong Kong and Macau, with a crew mainly based in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{discussed}} {{plans with}} his subordinates to integrate {{at least the}} German-speaking parts of Switzerland completely {{with the rest of}} Germany, and had several persons <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the post of a Reichskommissar for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in analogy to the office that Josef Bürckel held after Austria's absorption into Germany during the Anschluss). Later this official was to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter Köhler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair {{had a plan}} of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off every so often to improve the club's bleak financial picture, whilst {{at the same time}} advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he said that what Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra is what he had <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|The station's {{assembly}} {{marked the}} beginning of the third generation of space station design, being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft (thus opening a new era in space architecture). First generation stations such as Salyut 1 and Skylab had monolithic designs, consisting of one module with no resupply capability; the second generation stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 comprised a monolithic station with two ports to allow consumables to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as Progress. The capability of Mir to be expanded with add-on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> (<b>for</b> instance, the core module functioned largely as living quarters), thus eliminating the need to install all the station's equipment in one module.|$|E
5|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHistory had different aims <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> {{the products of the}} operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the United States Information Agency was to use the documents to release information {{that could be used to}} change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSUCCESS.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{he finally}} sailed into Piraeus where {{the crowd had}} gathered, {{desiring}} to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others {{of his friends and}} acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen in {{the fact that he had}} returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> a future occasion.|$|E

5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>For</b> his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E

25|$|Working memory (WM) can be {{described}} as a limited capacity system that allows one to temporarily store and process information.
