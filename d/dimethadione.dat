25|$|In March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince {{showed that}} {{ethosuximide}} and <b>dimethadione,</b> both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June {{of that same}} year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that valproic acid, which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that. The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 µmol/L to 1mmol/L.|$|E
40|$|Summary: A simple infrared-spectrometric {{method for}} the Simultaneous {{determination}} of <b>dimethadione</b> and trimethadione in plasma is described. The method {{is based on}} the absorption band of the carbonyl group for trimethadione at the wavenumber of 1740 cm" 1 and for <b>dimethadione</b> at the wavenumber of 1770 cirT 1. The accuracy and precison of the method are excellent; at a <b>dimethadione</b> and trimethadione concentration of 0. 5 mmol · 1 the coefficient of Variation for the determination of both compounds is < 1 %, which is better than that for the ultraviolet spectrometric or gas-liquid Chromatographie methods. The method can be used for the determination of the ratio trimethadione/dimethadione in the clinical setting äs a sensitive check of the pa-tient's adherence to therapy. It can also be used for the determination of <b>dimethadione</b> äs an indicator for the mean body intracellular pH.

40|$|Mutations in a {{voltage-gated}} {{sodium channel}} (SCN 1 A) result in Dravet Syndrome (DS), a catastrophic childhood epilepsy. Zebrafish with a mutation in scn 1 Lab recapitulate salient phenotypes associated with DS, including seizures, early fatality, {{and resistance to}} antiepileptic drugs. To discover new drug candidates {{for the treatment of}} DS, we screened a chemical library of ∼ 1000 compounds and identified 4 compounds that rescued the behavioral seizure component, including 1 compound (<b>dimethadione)</b> that suppressed associated electrographic seizure activity. Fenfluramine, but not huperzine A, also showed antiepileptic activity in our zebrafish assays. The effectiveness of compounds that block neuronal calcium current (<b>dimethadione)</b> or enhance serotonin signaling (fenfluramine) in our zebrafish model suggests that these may be important therapeutic targets in patients with DS. Over 150 compounds resulting in fatality were also identified. We conclude that the combination of behavioral and electrophysiological assays provide a convenient, sensitive, and rapid basis for phenotype-based drug screening in zebrafish mimicking a genetic form of epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of trimethadione (TMO) following {{oral administration}} (4 mg kg- 1) {{has been studied}} in 11 young male and 11 elderly male patients. The elimination half-life (h) of TMO was 11. 8 +/- 1. 4 (mean +/- s. e. mean) in the young and 23. 5 +/- 2. 17 in the elderly (P less than 0. 01). Total body clearance (1 h- 1 kg- 1) was 41. 4 +/- 2. 8 in the young and 29. 0 +/- 2. 4 in the elderly (P less than 0. 01). The apparent volume of distribution (1 kg- 1) was 0. 67 +/- 0. 03 in the young and 0. 65 +/- 0. 04 in the elderly. Serum <b>dimethadione</b> (DMO) /TMO ratios at 4 h were 0. 65 +/- 0. 03 in the young and 0. 46 +/- 0. 03 in the elderly (P less than 0. 01). These results suggest that N-demethylation of TMO is inversely related to age...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{hemodialysis}} of uremic animals {{may induce}} a syndrome characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, grand mal seizures, and electroencephalographic abnormalities. There is a fall in pH and bicarbonate concentration in CSF, and brain osmolality exceeds that of plasma, {{resulting in a}} net movement of water into the brain. This syndrome has been called experimental dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. The fall in pH of CSF may be secondary to a fall of intracellular pH (pHi) in brain. Since changes in pHi can alter intracellular osmolality in other tissues, {{it was decided to}} investigate brain pHi in uremia, and the effects of hemodialysis. Brain pHi was measured by evaluating the distribution of 14 C-labeled <b>dimethadione</b> in brain relative to CSF, while extracellular space was calculated as the 35504 =/ 4 space relative to CSF. In animals with acute renal failure, brain (cerebral cortex) pHi was 7. 06 +/- 0. 02 (+/-SE) while that in CSF was 7. 31 +/- 0. 02, both values not different from normal. After rapid hemodialysis (100 min) of uremic animals, plasma creatinine fell from 11. 8 to 5. 9 mg/dl. Brain pHi was 6. 89 +/- 0. 02 and CSF pH and 7. 19 +/- 0. 02, both values significantly lower than in uremic animals (P less than 0. 01), and there was a 12 % increase in brain water content. After slow hemodialysis (210 min), brain pHi (7. 01 +/- 0. 02) and pH in CSF (7. 27 +/- 0. 02) were both significantly greater than values observed after rapid hemodialysis (P less than 0. 01), and brain water content was normal. None of the above maneuvers had any effect on pHi of skeletal muscle or subcortical white matter. The data show that rapid hemodialysis of uremic dogs is accompanied by a significant fall in pH of CSF and pHi in cerebral cortex. Accompanying the fall in brain pHi is cerebral edema...|$|E
40|$|The Antiepilptic drugs (AEDs) {{phenytoin}} (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), phenobarbital (PB), tri- and <b>dimethadione</b> (TMD and DMD) {{are known}} teratogens having a common malformation pattern in {{human and animal}} studies. This thesis was designed chiefly to test a hypothesis correlating the teratogenicity of these AEDs to episodes of pharmacologically induced embryonic arrhythmia and hypoxia-reoxygenation damage. Effects on the embryonic heart were studied both after maternal administration in mice and in mouse embryos cultured in vitro. Only AEDs, correlated with {{the same type of}} malformation as could be induced by episodes of interrupted oxygen supply to the embryo (e. g. cleft palate) caused concentration dependent bradycardia and arrhythmia. PHT and DMD had the highest potential and affected embryonic heart at clinically relevant concentration, followed by CBZ, TMD and PB. Valproate and vigabatrin not associated with hypoxia-related malformations caused neither arrhythmia nor severe bradycardia. The results showed that the embryonic heart is extremely susceptible to PHT and DMD only during a restricted period of development, between gestational days 9 - 13 (weeks 5 - 9 of human pregnancy). An observed genetic susceptibility to react with arrhythmia at low concentrations when exposed to PHT or to external stress, could explain why A/J strain of mice is more susceptible to develop cleft palate compared to other strains. High activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) capturing antioxidant enzymes observed in untreated A/J embryos supported this assumption. The potential to cause embryonic arrythmia by an AED was related to the potential to inhibit the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium channel (I kr). A marked I kr blocking activity (70 %) of DMD in voltage clamping studies was observed. The I kr inhibition occurred at similar concentrations, which causes severe arrhythmia. The idea of a relation between teratogenicity and arrhythmia, resulting in ischemia followed by reperfusion and generation of ROS was supported by mechanistic studies. Pre-treatment with the spin-trapping agent PBN, which has the capacity to capture ROS, markedly reduced the incidence of PHT and DMD-induced cleft palate. In utero exposure to teratogenic doses of DMD and PHT resulted in hemorrhages in the embryonic palatal region. The same type of haemorrhage in the palatal region precedes orofacial clefts induced by episodic hypoxia...|$|E
40|$|Background: Drugs that inhibit cardiac repolarization are {{associated}} with potentially life threatening side effects {{in the form of}} ventricular arrhythmias in humans. Animal studies show that this mechanism also is relevant for the embryo, and that the circulatory depression results in hypoxia with embryotoxicity in the form of malformations and death as a consequence. This thesis addresses the pharmacological arrhythmogenic effects on the rodent embryonic heart, and highlight the human relevance of this mechanism by characterization of the human embryonic heart. Methods and Results: Pregnant mice were administered the hypoxia probe pimonidazole followed by phenytoin or saline at gestation day (GD) 10 or 15. Phenytoin treatment resulted in dose-dependent embryonic staining for the hypoxia probe at GD 10. At GD 15 staining was not dose-dependent and less pronounced compared to controls. The effect on cardiac rate and rhythm of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was studied in cultured GD 10 mouse embryos. Phenytoin, <b>dimethadione,</b> carbamazepine and phenobarbital induced concentration-dependent prolongation of the inter-beat interval (IBI) and irregular arrhythmias. Exposure to combinations of AEDs in therapeutic concentrations resulted in significant increase in IBI compared to single exposure. ECG was obtained before and after drug exposure from GD 11 rat embryos and embryonic cardiomyocytes (ECMs) cultured in multi-electrode array (MEA) culture dishes. In the embryo model phenytoin and the selective IKr blocker E 4031 both induced concentration-dependent bradyarrhythmia and QTC prolongation in cultured GD 11 rat embryos. At the higher tested concentrations, phenytoin induced cardiac arrest and E 4031 induced AV-nodal block. In the ECM model sensitivity to phenytoin and E 4031 was similar but other arrhythmias were observed. The distribution of Isl 1 + progenitor cells and their proliferative and differentiating capacity in human first trimester embryonic hearts were determined by immunohistochemistry. Isl 1 + cells were present in the heart and a few were Ki 67 + and troponinT+. Beating clusters of human embryonic cardiomyocytes, called cardiospheres were derived from human embryonic hearts and characterized with immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and in the MEA system. The spheres were sensitive to adrenergic stimulation with isoprenaline and displayed rate dependency of the action potential in a pacing experiment. Expression and function of the two components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK), IKr and IKs, were characterized in cardiac tissue and ECMs from human, rat and rabbit embryonic hearts. Patch clamp and quantitative RT-PCR were used. IKr was expressed and functional in all species. IKs expression was found in human and rat but not in rabbit hearts. Conclusions: Phenytoin induces dose-dependent embryonic hypoxia. The studied AEDs induce concentration-dependent embryonic bradycardia and arrhythmia. For selective IKr blockers and phenytoin, the effects {{are associated}} with QT prolongation. This indicates that QT prolongation {{can be used as a}} biomarker for embryonic arrhythmogenicity. Rat ECMs display a similar sensitivity as the embryonic heart but respond differently to drug exposure. Isl 1 + cells are present in the human embryonic heart and cardiospheres derived from embryonic hearts display rate dependency of the action potential duration and sensitivity to β-adrenergic stimulation. The IKr current is expressed and functional in the human embryonic heart and in species used in teratology testing. The results support that drug-induced embryonic arrhythmia is a cause of embryotoxicity and indicate human relevance of this mechanism...|$|E
