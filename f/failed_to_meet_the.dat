5|$|Prometheus was {{considered}} a financial success overall. After a strong start in North America, the film <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> studio's expectations, but it continued to perform strongly in other territories {{until the end of}} its theatrical run. Prometheus earned $126,477,084 (31.4%) in North America and $276,877,385 (68.6%) elsewhere for a worldwide total of $403,354,469, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of 2012, and the 159th highest-grossing film worldwide unadjusted for inflation.|$|E

5|$|The Brunei {{delegation}} {{included three}} athletes: Ak Hafiy Tajuddin Rositi, Maziah Mahusin, and swimmer Anderson Lim. Mahusin {{was the first}} women to represent Brunei at the Olympic Games and Lim's appearance made him the country's first Olympic swimmer. All three athletes qualified for the Games through wildcard places because they <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> required qualifying times for their events. Mahusin was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony while Lim held it at the closing ceremony. All three athletes failed to advance beyond the heat stages of their respective events, but Mahusin and Lim achieved new national records in athletics and swimming.|$|E
5|$|The Quincy Convention of October 1845 passed resolutions {{demanding}} that the Latter-day Saints withdraw from Nauvoo by May 1846. A few days later, the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia that would force them out if they <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> May deadline. To try to meet this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin, the Latter-day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions Marseille. On 14 July, Marseille manager Didier Deschamps {{confirmed}} that the club was negotiating with both Diarra and Bordeaux for a transfer. A week later, Bordeaux president Triaud stated that Marseille had <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> player's €7.75million release clause and that Diarra was likely not going to be leaving the club. Despite Marseille remaining hopeful a deal could go through, on 30 July, a deal was declared dead. Diarra later stated that he was happy to remain at Bordeaux and see out the rest of his contract. The defensive midfielder opened the new campaign scoring two goals in the first six matches of the season in wins over Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon.|$|E

5|$|Studio {{executives}} did {{not like}} the film and restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> studio's expectations at the box office and initially received polarizing reactions from critics, becoming {{one of the most controversial}} and talked-about films of the year. Critics praised the acting, directing, themes and messages but debated the explicit violence and moral ambiguity. Over time, however, reception towards the film has become largely positive with critics and audiences, finding critical and commercial success with its DVD release, which established Fight Club as a cult film. It is now regarded by many as one of the greatest films of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The 2003–04 season {{comprised}} {{mixed results}} for Alonso and his San Sebastián club. Alonso revelled in {{the opportunity to}} perform in Europe, appearing in all the team's games, and Real Sociedad qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League. The team struggled {{under the pressure of}} the extra matches, however, and were promptly knocked out of the tournament by Lyon and finished 15th in La Liga. The combination of Alonso's outstanding performances and the team's poor league finish made a move away from Anoeta Stadium inevitable. Despite interest from La Liga champions Real Madrid, Alonso remained committed to Real Sociedad. Madrid <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> £13million price tag that José Luis Astiazarán, the Real Sociedad president, had placed on Alonso and the deal reached a stalemate. Alonso had other concerns and focused on international duty with Spain at UEFA Euro 2004. Despite the fact that Alonso's appearance at the tournament was brief, he caught the attention of retired footballer Jan Mølby, who was impressed with his precise passing abilities.|$|E
5|$|This peace {{lasted for}} around a decade, until Trajan became emperor in 98 AD. Immediately upon {{becoming}} emperor, Trajan travelled to the frontier stretching from Pannonia to Moesia. Here he strengthened the fortifications. In 101–102 AD Trajan assembled {{an army of}} up to 150,000 men to send against Decebalus' 50,000. The army was split into two and entered into Dacian territory at two points along the frontier. The columns met at Tibiscum and marched together towards Sarmizegetusa. At Tapae they encountered and defeated the Dacian force. This in turn forced Decebalus to sue for peace, which Trajan agreed to, but, he imposed harsh terms against the Dacians. Decebalus <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> terms of the peace and in 105 Trajan launched a second campaign against him. By 106, Trajan completed the conquest of Dacia and ended its existence as an independent kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Leeds {{finished}} {{just five}} points above the Second Division relegation {{zone in the}} 1960–61 season and Taylor resigned; his replacement, Don Revie, was promoted from the United first team, and initially he was not fond of Charlton. Revie played Charlton up front {{at the start of}} the 1961–62 season, but he soon moved him back to centre-half after he proved ineffective as a centre-forward. He soon became frustrated and difficult to manage, feeling in limbo playing for a club seemingly going nowhere whilst his younger brother was enjoying great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared to let him go in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> £30,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially willing to pay the fee he eventually decided to instead try an untested youngster at centre-half. During these discussions Charlton refused to sign a new contract at Leeds, but felt frustrated by Busby's hesitance and so signed a new contract with Leeds whilst making a promise to Revie to be more professional in his approach.|$|E
