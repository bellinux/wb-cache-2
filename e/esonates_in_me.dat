The sensing element is a micromachined silicon dioxide cantilever fabricated using a process compatible with commercial CMOS microelectronic processes. The 1 mu m thick silicon dioxide device {{consists of two}} 8 * 150 mu m cantilever arms supporting a 50 * 50 mu m payload platform. Actuation of this first generation device is performed using a small vibration table. Resonant amplitude are measured by detecting the angular shift of a laser beam incident on the device. Finite element analysis is used to model resonant frequencies, mode shapes, and frequency response. Cantilever <b>esonates</b> <b>in</b> fundamental mode at 15. 9 kHz and have an experimental mass sensitivity of 1. 9 kHz ng/sup - 1 /...|$|R
