40|$|Abstract. Recent {{research}} by the Copper Development Association (CDA) has demonstrated the feasibility of diecasting electric motor rotors using copper [1]. Electric motors using copper rotors are significantly more energy efficient relative to motors using aluminum rotors. However, {{one of the challenges}} in copper rotor die-casting is low tool life. Experiments have shown that the higher molten metal temperature of copper (1085 °C), as compared to aluminum (660 °C) accelerates the onset of thermal fatigue or <b>heat</b> <b>checking</b> in traditional H- 13 tool steel. This happens primarily because the mechanical properties of H- 13 tool steel decrease significantly above 650 °C. Potential approaches to mitigate the <b>heat</b> <b>checking</b> problem include: 1) identification of potential tool materials having better high temperature mechanical properties than H- 13, and 2) reduction of the magnitude of cyclic thermal excursions experienced by the tooling by increasing the bulk die temperature. A preliminary assessment of alternative tool materials has led to the selection of nickel-based alloys Haynes 230 and Inconel 617 as potential candidates. These alloys were selected based on their elevated temperature physical and mechanical properties. Therefore, the overall objective of this research work was to predict the number of copper rotor die-casting cycles to the onset of <b>heat</b> <b>checking</b> (tool life) as a function of bulk die temperature (up to 650 °C) for Haynes 230 and Inconel 617 alloys.
