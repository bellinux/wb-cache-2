In his setting, Bach introduces dramatic syncopation for each declamation in [...] "Come, o death, you brother of sleep"; {{and it is only}} {{at the end of the}} penultimate line that torment and dissonance are transformed into glory and harmony, illuminating the words [...] "" [...] (for through you <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> to my loveliest little Jesus). Gardiner notes that it is Bach's only setting of Crüger's tune which recalls the style of his father's cousin Johann Christoph Bach whom he regarded as a 'profound composer'.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. [...] Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. [...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> back." [...] From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had sevenplayers taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school.|$|E

2500|$|Michael {{has neither}} {{encouraged}} nor opposed monarchist agitation in Romania and royalist parties have made little impact in post-communist Romanian politics.

[...] "Romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them {{to have the right to}} be consulted on their future." [...] King Michael's belief is that there is still a role for, and value in, the monarchy today: [...] "We are trying to make people understand what the Romanian monarchy was, and what it can still do" [...] (for them).|$|E

2500|$|Commanding the army, Mehmed led {{his land}} troops towards Ankara, {{stopping}} {{on the way}} to visit the tombs of his father and ancestors. He had written the ruler of Sinope, Kemâleddin Ismâil Bey to send his son Hasan to Ankara, and the young man was already there when Mehmed reached the city, and received his overlord graciously. Mehmed made his interests quickly known: according to Doukas, he informed Hasan, [...] "Tell your father that I want Sinope, and if he surrenders the city freely, I will gladly reward him with the province of Philippopolis [...] But if he refuses, then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> quickly." [...] Despite the extensive fortifications of the city and its 400 cannon manned by 2,000 artillerymen, Ismail Bey caved in to Mehmed's demands; he settled on the lands Mehmed gave him in Thrace where he wrote a work on ritual prescriptions of Islam called Huulviyat-i Sultan, dying in 1479.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a clear}} {{association}} of Ziggurats with mountain houses. Mountain houses play a certain role in Mesopotamian mythology and Assyro-Babylonian religion, associated with deities such as Anu, Enlil, Enki and Ninhursag. In the Hymn to Enlil, the Ekur is closely linked to Enlil whilst in Enlil and Ninlil it is the abode of the Annanuki, from where Enlil is banished. The fall of Ekur is described in the Lament for Ur. In mythology, the Ekur was {{the centre of the}} earth and location where heaven and earth were united. It is also known as Duranki and one of its structures is known as the Kiur ("great place"). Enamtila has also been suggested by Piotr Michalowski {{to be a part of}} the Ekur. A hymn to Nanna illustrates the close relationship between temples, houses and mountains. [...] "In your house on high, in your beloved house, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> to live, O Nanna, up above in your cedar perfumed mountain".|$|E
