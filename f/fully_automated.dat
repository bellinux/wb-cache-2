5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|The Chickasaw Turnpike {{has been}} <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> since shortly after it opened. As Governor Bellmon predicted, {{it has been}} a {{consistent}} money loser since opening.

5|$|Europa Lighthouse {{was inaugurated}} on 1 August 1841 {{in a brief}} {{ceremony}} witnessed by about 10,000 people. The first upgrade of the lighthouse occurred in 1864, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick burner, with further changes in 1875 and in 1894 when the amount of light emitted was increased. A three incandescent mantle burner was added in 1905. Following further modernisation in the 20th century, the lighthouse was <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> in 1994.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we develop}} {{techniques}} to <b>fully</b> <b>automate</b> {{the process of}} constructing a digital, three-dimensional (3 D) model from a set of 3 D views of a static scene obtained from unknown viewpoints. Since 3 D sensors only capture the scene structure as seen from a single viewpoint, multiple views must be combined to create a complete model. Current modeling methods are limited in that they require measurement of the sensor viewpoints or manual registration of the views. We have developed an alternative approach that <b>fully</b> <b>automates</b> the modeling process without without any knowledge the sensor viewpoints and without manual intervention...|$|R

5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> {{computer}} system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, various optical {{systems were}} tested. Kohler {{generators}} were installed in 1949 {{along with the}} stationary electric light system. A new rotating light system (EMV-3) was installed in 1963, making the lighthouse <b>fully</b> <b>automated.</b> It was in use until 1982, when an experimental EMV-930M system (made in Ukraine) was installed. The rotation mechanism of the optical system is a novel solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead. The optics brought a six to eight hundredfold increase to {{the efficiency of the}} light radiated by a 1kW quartz lamp. The same light system is still in use.|$|E
5|$|Kirov was {{completely}} overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> 100mm B-34USM mountings and her fire-control system {{was replaced with}} a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine twin gun water-cooled 37mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo launchers, aircraft equipment and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about {{half the cost of}} a new Project 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
5|$|The Vancouver SkyTrain is a three-line urban {{mass transit}} {{system in the}} {{metropolitan}} area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada managed by TransLink. The Expo Line was built for the Expo 86 World's Fair; the Millennium Line opened in 2002, followed by the Canada Line in 2009, which was built for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Expo Line and Millennium lines are operated by the British Columbia Rapid Transit Company on behalf of TransLink. The Canada Line is owned by InTransitBC, and operated by ProTrans BC, an SNC-Lavalin company. The Expo and Millennium lines use Bombardier's Advanced Rapid Transit technology, while the Canada Line technology is provided by Hyundai Rotem. The SkyTrain is the oldest and longest <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> driverless rapid transit system in the world.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} desired oligonucleotide, the {{building}} blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> since the late 1970s. Upon {{the completion of the}} chain assembly, the product is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules around 15–25 bases in length.|$|E

5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase sequencer into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{registering}} a domain, {{the user}} signs a declaration {{that they are}} not infringing on the rights of other parties and that the user will assume full responsibility for any consequences of use of the domain name. The registration process at Norid is <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to take over a domain name include infringements of the Trademarks Act and the Marketing Control Act. Trademark holders will also be awarded the domain if the registration was solely made to sell the domain to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E
5|$|The MRT {{has been}} expanded. The first {{expansion}} was in 1996. This was a S$1.2 billion {{expansion of the}} North South Line into Woodlands, merging the Branch Line into the North South Line and joining Yishun and Choa Chu Kang Stations. The concept of having rail lines that bring people almost directly to their homes led {{to the introduction of}} the Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines connecting with the MRT network. On 6 November 1999, the first LRT trains on the Bukit Panjang LRT went into operation. In 2002, the Changi Airport and Expo stations were added to the MRT network. The North East Line, the first line operated by SBS Transit, opened on 20 June 2003, one of the first <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> heavy rail lines in the world. On 15 January 2006, after intense two-and-a-half years lobbying by the public, Buangkok station was opened. The Boon Lay Extension of the East West Line, consisting of Pioneer and Joo Koon stations, began revenue service on 28 February 2009. The Circle Line opened in four stages from 28 May 2009 to 14 January 2012. Stage 1 of Downtown Line opened on 22 December 2013 with its official opening made on 21 December 2013 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Stage 2 opened on 27 December 2015, and was officially opened on 26 December by Prime Minister Lee. Stage 3, the final stage of Downtown Line, opened on 21 October 2017 with its official opening made on 20 October 2017 by Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan.|$|E
