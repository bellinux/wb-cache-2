The screening effect of the charge carriers on the transverse component of the electric field is observed to be negligible for an intrinsic semiconductor substrate but gradually approaching that of a metallic conductor as the doping level reaches 1018 cm- 3. The magnetic bias field apply to the doped semiconductor substrate makes the situation of Hall-effect which provide resistance or normal situation to the working of antenna.

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) is a monoamine {{originally}} purified from {{blood as}} a vasoactive agent. In nonneuronal tissues, its presence is {{linked with the}} expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH 1) that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of its synthesis. Targeted disruption in mice of the TPH 1 gene results in very low levels of circulating 5 -HT. Previous analysis of the TPH 1 knockout (TPH 1 (-/-)) mouse revealed that they develop a phenotype of macrocytic anemia with a reduced half-life of their circulating red blood cells (RBC). In this study, to establish whether the observed reduced half-life of TPH 1 (-/-) RBC is an intrinsic or an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>characteristic,</b> we compared their survival to RBC isolated from wild-type mice. Both in vivo and in vitro data converge to demonstrate an extrinsic protective effect of 5 -HT since presence of 5 -HT in the RBC environment protects RBC from senescence. The protective effect played by 5 -HT is not mediated through activation of a classical pharmacological pathway as no 5 -HT receptors were detected on isolated RBC. Rather, 5 -HT acts as an effective antioxidant since reduction of 5 -HT circulating levels {{are associated with a}} decrease in the plasma antioxidant capacity. We further demonstrate a link between oxidation and the removal of damaged RBC following transfusion, as supplementation with 5 -HT improves RBC post-transfusion survival in a mouse model of blood banking...|$|E

Assessment of {{the risks associated with}} habitat fragmentation is a big challenge as the change in population genetic diversity is a dynamic process, often acting over long time periods and depending on various characteristics pertaining to both species (life history traits) and their populations (<b>extrinsic</b> <b>characteristics).</b> With this survey, we provide an introductory overview for persons who have to make or are interested in making predictions about the fate of forest-dwelling plant populations which have recently become fragmented and isolated from their main occurrences. We provide a concise introduction to the field of population genetics focusing on terms, processes and phenomena relevant to {{the maintenance of}} genetic diversity and vitality of plant populations. In particular the antagonistic effects of gene flow and random genetic drift are covered. A special chapter is devoted to Central European tree species (including the Carpathians) which we treat in detail with reference to an extensive literature survey on population genetic studies assembled from the whole of Europe. We further provide an overview of the population biology of associated understorey species. We conclude with recommended steps to be taken for the evaluation of potential perils of habitat fragmentation or population thinning for the genetics of tree populations. The complexity of effects exerted by life history traits and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of populations suggest population genetic development is strongly situation dependent. Therefore, we recommend following a case-by-case approach ideally supported by computer simulations to predict future population genetic development of both trees and associated understorey species...|$|R

40|$|Recruitment {{literature}} {{has taken a}} holistic approach {{to the effectiveness of}} job ad characteristics, in terms of attracting job seekers and persuading them to apply. We question this approach by hypothesizing differential effects of intrinsic job ad characteristics (such as learning opportunities and agreeable team work) and <b>extrinsic</b> job ad <b>characteristics</b> (such as money and prestige). Based on Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000), we propose that intrinsic job ad characteristics are universally more effective than <b>extrinsic</b> job ad <b>characteristics,</b> as they signal a work environment in which basic psychological needs can be satisfied. In line with Person-Job Fit Theory (Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman & Johnson, 2005), in contrast, we argue that intrinsic job ad characteristics mostly appeal to job seekers pursuing intrinsic personal work values, as they signal a work environment supporting this particular pursuit of values. Similarly, we expect <b>extrinsic</b> job ad <b>characteristics</b> to attract mostly job seekers pursuing extrinsic values. A study among 93 business administration students however leaves most of our hypotheses unsupported. Contrary to expectations, job seekers find <b>extrinsic</b> job ad <b>characteristics</b> to be more attractive than intrinsic job ad characteristics, and a job seeker’s intrinsic value orientation is unrelated to the attractiveness of intrinsic job ad characteristics. Partly supporting the fit hypothesis, however, a job seeker’s extrinsic value orientation does increase the attractiveness of <b>extrinsic</b> job ad <b>characteristics.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} aimed at determining whether young urban consumers' choice of interior soft furnishings is based on <b>extrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> with the intention of gaining social acceptance and conveying positive attributes to others. It is argued that, when consumers buy products, they in fact purchase the total product that includes everything that adds value to a seller's offering. As such, consumers may use extrinsic and intrinsic variables to conclude the most suitable purchase decision in terms of the outlet and brand of product. Intrinsics refer to the tangible, core characteristics of the product, such as the raw materials it consists of and are usually easy to imitate. Extrinsics on the other hand, are used and even manipulated to make products more appealing to a specific target group in a crowded market place and include differentiating features such as packaging. Since the research was focused on describing and understanding, qualitative methods were used for data collection. Focus group discussions, projective techniques and product comparison tests were included for the purpose of triangulation. Participants were allowed to respond spontaneously to various tasks and intrinsic features were accommodated to objectively reflect on the collective influence of both intrinsic as well as extrinsic variables and whether <b>extrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> dominate choice or not. Intrinsic characteristics were found to seldom form the basis of differentiation and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> seem to playa determining role in young urban consumers' choice and use of soft furnishings such as towels and sheets. The evidence suggests that several retailers have succeeded in not only value engineering their product offerings to satisfy buyers' and users' minimum requirements for expected extrinsic attributes, but that they have also succeeded in augmenting their offerings through the addition of further extrinsic benefits. The findings strongly suggest the use of potential extrinsic attributes such as brand names, especially retail brands, to differentiate products. The evidence however also suggests that the outcome of past purchase decisions can alter perspectives of these attributes and that the acquisition of consumption related knowledge is a lifelong learning process. A conclusion drawn from the data collected, is that retailers have succeeded in creating store images that reflect the relationship between consumers and reference groups to which they (want to) belong. These findings underpin the importance of social acceptance and the relevance of the social dimension of brands. The relevance of the mental dimension of brands is supported by evidence that suggests that a relationship between the young urban consumer's self-image and the image of a specific outlet of soft furnishings is likely to occur. The findings coincide with the symbolic interactionist perspective that human society demands and depends on symbolic life. It appears as if interior products are purchased from certain outlets to serve as symbols to define/ represent realities, initiate responses, provide cues and organize behaviour in terms of what is considered appropriate. The study shed some light on young urban consumer's approach to the choice of interior soft furnishings, which could be extended to other product categories and consumer groups for use by the marketing sector in terms of consumer facilitation as well as the evaluation and development of marketing strategies.

30|$|The humerus is {{the second}} most common site of metastatic disease {{involving}} long bones. Humeral lesions may cause pain, disability and pathological fractures [2]. Untreated pathological fractures involving the extremities are generally responsible for serious disability. Additionally, the risk of fracture is different in lower and upper extremities. In fact, the bones of the lower limbs are subject to weight bearing, which makes 50 % destruction a critical limit for impending fractures [3]. The risk of fractures is certainly lower in the upper limbs. Nevertheless, important intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> involving certain districts, such as the proximal humerus, should be considered as risk factors for spontaneous fractures. These are the largely cancellous structure of the metaphysis with low cortical rigidity and the significant rotational and bending forces to which this structure is subject [4]. In this regard, the definition of impending fracture is controversial: when destruction is greater than 75 % of the bone’s cross section, the risk of spontaneous fracture is great [5]. On the other hand, it should also be considered that, when only one cortex remains, the humerus often fractures with activities of daily living [5].|$|R

We compare 31 seafloor canyon-and-channel systems from predominantly siliciclastic continental margins and discuss their morphologic variability. The longest canyon-and-channel systems of this study generally correspond with relatively mature, passive continental margins associated with some of the largest deep-sea fans in the world with long-term, voluminous, mud-rich sediment supply. Shorter, lower-relief canyon-and-channel systems generally correspond with immature margins associated with relatively meager, sand-rich or mixed-caliber sediment supply. Seafloor continental-margin relief nonlinearly corresponds with canyon-and-channel-system length, with very high-relief margins exhibiting longer canyon-and-channel systems than predicted by a linear relationship. Nonlinearity in our observations can be accounted for by the increased occurrence and magnitude of submarine mass wasting in higher-relief and correspondingly longer canyon-and-channel systems, limitations of relief imposed by the maximum depths of ocean basins, and sediment-gravity-flow dynamics. These interpretations of controls on canyon-and-channel geomorphology represent <b>extrinsic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of land-to-deep-sea sediment supply and basin or continental-margin framework and intrinsic sediment-gravity-flow dynamics.

The goal of region discovery {{is to identify}} interesting regions in geo-referenced datasets based on a domain expert’s notion of interestingness. Almost all agglomerative clustering algorithms only focus on the first challenge. The goal of the proposed work is to develop agglomerative clustering frameworks that deal with all four challenges. In particular, we propose a generic agglomerative clustering framework for geo-referenced datasets (GAC-GEO) generalizing agglomerative clustering by allowing for three plug-in components. GAC-GEO agglomerates neighboring clusters maximizing a plug-in fitness function that capture the notion of interestingness of clusters. It enhances typical agglomerative clustering algorithms in two ways: fitness functions support task-specific clustering, whereas generic neighboring relationships {{increase the number of}} merging candidates. We also demonstrate that existing agglomerative clustering algorithms can be considered as specific cases of GAC-GEO. We evaluate the proposed framework on an artificial dataset and two real world applications involving region discovery.

Our theory tells us that as people reach the self-actualizing stage in Maslow's Hierarchy they have the income and education to make their purchase decisions based on how it will effect others and the environment. We found higher income levels and educational attainment to be characteristics of our ethical consumer. We also found that the reasons these ethical consumers are purchasing ethical products fall into five categories, environment, social justice, biodiversity, and religious. This paper develops a theory on Ethical consumers, determining the demographics of the consumer and their motivations for their ethical purchases. Future research may look at using this information to create a demand theory for ethical consumers...|$|R

The results shows to rank the Basin to have R k score value of 0. 41 against the fi, n = max (fi) value equal to 1 as highest value of the function characterize the best in terms of suitability for the criterion in which this ranking are based upon. The paper also reveals as findings of some intrinsic characteristics such as; poor intercalated geologic formation, shallow aquifer systems within sedimentary pile in the basin which make the basin not suitable CO 2 sequestration and when other parameters in future are favoured; it would possess the risk of CO 2 leakages and groundwater contaminations in the geological storage media. Regional screening and ranking of the adjoining basins are recommended, while detailed local site characterisation of the basin is needed to assess its overall suitability for CO 2 sequestration potentials in Nigeria...|$|R
