5|$|In 1950, Ba Cụt was {{involved}} in a battle with another Hòa Hảo leader, Nguyễn Giác Ngộ. He was defeated and driven from the district of Chợ Mới in February, provoking Soái to attack Ngo. Ba Cụt then moved to Thốt Nốt and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there. The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the Hòa Hảo and gain an anti-Việt Minh ally, and offered material aid, which Ba Cụt accepted. Ba Cụt repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Việt Minh in return for arms and money, but he broke his <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargain</b> and sometimes fought the Cao Đài instead of the communists. He made five such deals with the French, but he abandoned his military responsibilities each time. It was said that Ba Cụt sometimes broke away with the encouragement of Soái, who was still allied to the French, but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba Cụt weapons to fight the French. The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and unreliability because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment. Some historians have claimed Ba Cụt's anti-French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident. There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French. The other Hòa Hảo commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba Cụt; they were stridently opposed to the Việt Minh due to Sổ's assassination, and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French, but at times they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack.|$|E

However, the Didact soon finds his plans threatened by Spartan Blue Team, consisting of the Master Chief and his old squad-mates Fred, Linda, and Kelly. The Didact confronts and attempts to kill Blue Team, summoning an army of newly-created Prometheans to back him up. While Static Carillon fulfills it's <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargain,</b> bringing the Halo over to the Forge, it also turns on the Didact and decides to help the Spartans as the Didact violated his side of their compact by creating more Prometheans.

When the Master Chief arrives at the control room, the Didact prepares for another fight, but the Chief confuses him by deliberately activating the Halo.

40|$|Recent {{historical}} research on bankruptcy has been centred {{almost exclusively on}} Common law countries, especially the United States. The consequence is that the research agenda includes issues which may, or may not, have broader relevance. This paper is an attempt at including within a larger historical and comparative perspective the evolution observed in continental Europe, during the 19 th century. A data set has thus been assembled which includes <b>the</b> main features <b>of</b> a total of 51 codes or statutes, in 15 countries of all legal traditions. An early conclusion is that all these laws defended strongly creditors’ rights during bankruptcy, during the whole period under review. This goes against the thesis defended i. a. by La Porta et alii (1998) which state that “legal origins” have a strong, differentiated effect on property and creditors’ rights, which would be permanent over history. Two dimensions are then analysed. First, <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failed debtor, and whether he was subjected to repression; second, {{the degree to which}} the law supported or not <b>the</b> attempts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties to negotiate a composition, or continuation arrangement. An early period witnessed repressive, highly regulated frameworks: the paradigm is the Napoleonic, 1808 Code de commerce, though its main features were still highly visible half a century latter, in almost all countries. Then emerged a liberal model, between 1865 and 1885 with again a fair degree <b>of</b> convergence: <b>the</b> personal and civic fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debtor became much more immune to commercial failure; and the parties get more autonomy to bargain, though a bifurcation emerged between a “menu approach” to re-negotiation in England and in the French law countries, and a “single-option” procedure in German law countries. Beyond, it is proposed that these broad trends reflect <b>the</b> growing capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institutional environment to reduce risks of moral hazards, and more generally transaction costs. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, <b>bargaining</b> on bankruptcy had become easier and safer, so that judicial guarantees could be eased. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the impact}} on productivity, employment, overtime, earnings and costs of shorter working hours with particular reference to the 1989 / 91 campaign by <b>the</b> Confederation <b>of</b> Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU). The {{events leading up to}} the CSEU campaign and the reasons for its success are investigated. One result of this union success was <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> national <b>bargaining.</b> <b>The</b> changing role <b>of</b> national bargaining, including why it became a casualty of reduced hours, is also examined. Research on earlier reductions in hours has tended to suggest that productivity rises as a result of reduced hours. A review of this research concludes that <b>the</b> productivity effect <b>of</b> reduced hours has been overstated. It also raises some important methodological issues. The thesis presents research on 20 engineering plants where the 37 -hour week was introduced as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSEU campaign. A variety of managers and union representatives were interviewed. In addition there was a survey of engineering plants. This included plants with unchanged hours. Finally, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> unions on working hours in the whole economy is explored using a large data set. The research finds that when engineering hours were reduced hourly earnings typically rose so that weekly pay was unaffected, at least in the short-term. While measures to increase productivity were a feature of collective agreements on reduced hours, {{there is little evidence that}} productivity has been permanently increased by reduced hours. The productivity-increasing measures would in general have been agreed without reduced hours, albeit somewhat later in many cases. There is even less evidence that reduced hours have affected output and overtime than there is of a productivity effect. So, increased employment is left as <b>the</b> major consequence <b>of</b> reduced hours. <b>The</b> recession, which was at its most serious when reduced hours were implemented, had a much larger effect on employment. This makes <b>the</b> employment effect <b>of</b> reduced hours hard to observe as it mainly took <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> job retention. Increased costs may well mean that <b>the</b> employment effect <b>of</b> reduced hours is a little less than it would otherwise have been...|$|R
