50|$|Bethell, {{a senior}} editor at American Spectator, and a former <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Monthly</b> aims to deal with what conservatives have seen as the {{politicization}} of science. He addresses a number of issues, including global warming, nuclear power, DDT and control of malaria, HIV/AIDS denialism, cloning, genetic engineering, intelligent design, the trial of Galileo and the relationship between science and Christianity. On all these topics, Bethell argues that the Left have distorted scientific facts in order to advance their political agenda and to increase the size of government, often through scare campaigns like the risk of runaway climate change. He also states that the Left have tried to censor those scientists who disagree with their viewpoints, regardless of what the best scientific evidence might say.|$|E
