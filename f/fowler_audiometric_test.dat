40|$|Introduction Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{is a serious}} problem for workers and {{therefore}} for businesses. The hearing conservation program (HCP) is a set of coordinated measures to prevent the development or evolution of occupational hearing loss, which involves a continuous and dynamic process of implementation of hearing conservation routines through anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and subsequent control of the occurrence of existing environmental risks or of those thatmay exist in the workplace and lead to workers hearing damage. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the HCP in preventing further hearing loss in workers with audiograms suggestive of NIHL. The <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> and medical records of 28 furniture company workers exposed to noise were reviewed and monitored for 2 years. Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined five <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> in the medical records (on admission and every semester) of 28 workers in a furniture company (totaling 140 audiometric exams) following the introduction of the HCP. Results Data analysis showed no differences between the <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> conducted on admission and those performed every semester. Conclusions The HCP implemented was effective in preventing the worsening of hearing loss in workers already with NIHL when exposed to occupational noise.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo assess patient {{satisfaction}} with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA) {{and the role}} of preoperative <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing.</b> Patients and methodsA telephone satisfaction survey was conducted on all patients implanted between June 1, 2005 and February 1, 2008. Patients with unilateral total deafness underwent preoperative <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> in quiet and in noise and stereoaudiometry with and without BAHA. Patients with a conductive hearing loss underwent preoperative <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> in quiet and in noise and real-life testing at home using a headband. A standardized satisfaction questionnaire derived from the Entific BAHA questionnaire was used. ResultsTwenty-two out of 26 patients responded to the questionnaire. Ten patients were implanted for conductive hearing loss (CHL) and 12 for unilateral total deafness (UTD). Mean follow-up was 19 months in the UTD group and 21 months in the CHL group. Sixty-seven percent of UTD and 80 % of CHL patients reported improved quality of life. The BAHA was worn for more than 4 hours per day by 83 % of UTD and 100 % of CHL patients, and at least 5 days per week by 67 % of UTD and 80 % of CHL patients. ConclusionBAHAs provided real benefit in all situations for CHL patients. In UTD, its benefit basically related to noisy environments.

40|$|International audiencePure-tone {{audiometry}} (measurement {{of absolute}} thresholds using pure tones) {{is the main}} test for the diagnosis of hearing loss. It {{can be achieved by}} using either air conduction (with headphones or loudspeakers) or bone conduction (by placing a vibrator on the mastoid bone behind the ear). The HeadPhone Transfer Function (HPTF) describes both the headphone response and the coupling to a listener's ear. Recent papers indicated that modifications of headphone position can lead to changes in HPTF, and that these spectral modifications can be audible. The aim of the present study is to determine whether the headphone placement over a listener's ears has an influence on pure-tone <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests.</b> Audiograms were performed several times on normal-hearing subjects, for different headphone positions (obtained by placing/removing the headphone over the listener's ears), the absolute thresholds measurements being repeated for each headphone position. The dispersions of absolute thresholds with and without modification of the headphone position were compared in order to determine whether the headphone positioning is an issue for <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

To achieve tuning capabilities down to 1 Hz at 20 kHz and 15 Hz at 100 Hz, a fractional division of a 40 -MHz master clock based on noise-shaping techniques is performed. Moreover, for noise generation, a novel circuit based on pseudorandom sequences combined with analog switched-capacitor filters is used.

40|$|Dialectal {{variations}} {{and linguistic}} factors {{are considered to}} be the primary causes of misdiagnosis during audiological assessments of speech performances. For new speech audiometry materials, the evaluation {{of the effects of the}} listener’s dialect or linguistic factors on speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) or supra-threshold phoneme recognition scores (PRSs) would be expected to give a valid and reliable audiometric measurement for clients. This thesis assessed the SRTs of native and non-native listeners of Southern Vietnamese regarding the dialectal effects; the effect of tonal patterns of syllables on speech perception of older adults; and the correlations between SRTs and duo-tone thresholds, between SRTs and PRSs. To attain the aforementioned objectives, two different types of speech audiometry materials were designed: Adaptive Auditory Speech Test (AAST) and NAMES (nonsense syllable test). Data of AAST were collected from 435 normal hearing listeners aged between four and 85 years old, while data of NAMES were gathered from 186 normal hearing listeners ranged between 15 and 85 years. The findings showed that the AAST and NAMES are valid speech <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> to quantify speech recognition of listeners aged between four and 85 (AAST), between 15 and 85 (NAMES). The age-related normative values of AAST in Vietnamese are similar to those in German, Ghanaian, and Polish. The findings of the dialectal study indicate that dialectal variation has an impact on speech recognition. However, the extent of the effects depends on the speech materials being used for the measurement. More effects of dialectal differences in “open speech tests with meaningful words” were found as compared to “closed speech test”. The findings on tonal pattern effects seem to implicate that the tonal patterns of syllables have a minor influence on speech perception of older adults, especially those above 75. Finally, the SRTs could be predicted using duo-tone thresholds. In contrast, the PRSs could not be predicted using either speech thresholds or duo-tone thresholds based on the correlations. The two-new speech <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> provide reliable outcomes with the same properties in normal-hearing listeners as compared to the other AAST and nonsense syllable tests in the different languages. These two speech <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> complement each other in evaluating hearing loss or language impairment.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{iron and}} steel {{industry}} in South Africa has been identified as one of the highest risk industries in terms of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). The National Institute for Occupational Health was commissioned by the Department of Labour to audit the current noise exposure levels and hearing conservation practices in eight major producers of {{iron and steel}}, and to make recommendations regarding prevention strategies. METHODS: The audit was conducted in two parts: the noise exposure levels and hearing conservation practices were assessed by the occupational hygiene department. The occupational medicine department assessed the hearing conservation policies and procedures, reviewed employees’ medical records to ascertain the number of NIHL cases, and conducted verification of audiograms on a sample of employees working in noise zones. RESULTS: Area noise levels exceeding 105 dB(A) were measured in four of the eight workplaces. The estimated average annual incidence of NIHL varied from 0. 7 - 8. 3 / 1000 /year. All companies did baseline, periodic and exit <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing,</b> but there were notable discrepancies between companies and verification audiograms and differences of more than 20 dB(A) were found. Although information and training on noise was reportedly done in all worksites, a high proportion of workers could not demonstrate correct fitting of hearing protection devices or recall when last they were trained. CONCLUSION: A detailed standard operating procedure should be implemented for medical surveillance for NIHL with action timelines that initiate remedial processes prior to employee developing compensable disease. Aggregated <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing</b> results should be communicated to managers and health and safety teams to provide guidance to prioritise areas for control measures. A quality assurance programme for <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing</b> must be implemented.
