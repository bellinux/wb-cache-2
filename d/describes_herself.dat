5|$|Also {{like her}} mother, whose Letters from Sweden was {{foundational}} {{to the writing}} of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley emphasised her maternal role in the text. She <b>describes</b> <b>herself</b> as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.|$|E

5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, <b>describes</b> <b>herself</b> as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E

25|$|Tohru <b>describes</b> <b>herself</b> as an {{excellent}} artist who loves cooking and cleaning. In the original Japanese, Tohru habitually speaks formally (see Honorific speech in Japanese), {{but not always}} correctly. She picked up this habit from her dead father, Katsuya, after he {{died when she was}} three, as a way of replacing him in her mother's eyes and from her father's family's statements that she was probably the daughter of a man her mother had an affair with. Tohru tends to be especially concerned for people with minor illnesses. This comes from the circumstances of her father's death, when Katsuya was originally diagnosed with a fever but eventually died of pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, at age 12, {{her family}} became {{involved}} with the Millerite movement. As she attended William Miller's lectures, she felt guilty for her sins, and was filled with terror about being eternally lost. She <b>describes</b> <b>herself</b> as spending nights in tears and prayer, and being in this condition for several months. On June 26, 1842, she was baptized by John Hobart in Casco Bay in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited Jesus to come again. In her later years, she referred to this as the happiest time of her life. Her family's involvement with Millerism caused them to be disfellowshipped by the local Methodist church.|$|E

25|$|Renée Geyer {{was born}} in 1953 in Melbourne, Australia, to a Hungarian Jewish father, Edward Geyer, and a Slovak Holocaust {{survivor}} mother, as the youngest of three children. Geyer was named Renée for another Holocaust survivor who had helped her mother in Auschwitz after Josef Mengele had assigned {{the rest of her}} mother's family to death. At a young age, the Geyers moved to Sydney where her parents were managers of a migrant hostel. Geyer <b>describes</b> <b>herself</b> as a problem child, and her parents called her übermutig (German for reckless). She attended various schools and was expelled from a private school, Methodist Ladies College, for petty stealing. Her first job was as a receptionist for the Australian Law Society.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the queen who wrote the letter is uncertain. She is called Dakhamunzu in the Hittite annuals, a possible transliteration of the Egyptian title Tahemetnesu (The King's Wife). Possible candidates are Nefertiti, Meritaten, and Ankhesenamun. Ankhesenamun seemed once likely since there were no candidates for the throne {{on the death of}} her husband, Tutankhamun, whereas Akhenaten had at least two legitimate successors. but this was based on a 27-year reign for the last 18th pharaoh Horemheb who is now accepted to have had a shorter reign of only 14 years. This makes the deceased Egyptian king appear to be Akhenaten instead rather than Tutankhamun. The phrase regarding marriage to 'one of my subjects' (translated by some as 'servants') is possibly a reference to the Grand Vizier Ay or a secondary member of the Egyptian royal family line. Since Nefertiti was depicted as powerful as her husband in official monuments smiting Egypt's enemies, she might be the Dakhamunzu in the Amarna correspondence as Nicholas Reeves believes. Ankhesenamun may have been pressured by Ay to marry him and legitimise his claim to the throne of Egypt (which she eventually did) This also might explain why she <b>describes</b> <b>herself</b> as 'afraid', especially considering the popular (but not widely accepted) theory that Ay had a hand in her husband's death. A CT scan taken in 2005 shows that he had badly broken his leg shortly before his death, and that the leg had become infected. DNA analysis conducted in 2010 showed the presence of malaria in his system. It is believed that these two conditions, malaria and leiomyomata, combined, led to his death. However, Ankhesenamun was not as powerful as Nefertiti to be able to choose her spouse from a foreign state.|$|E
