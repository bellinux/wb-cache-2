In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment, most based in Manhattan, as well as in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in Manhattan and across New York City, bolstered by the city's emergence as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability, as well as New York's position as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center in North America, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, the city's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City. As of October 2014, New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector, with a significant proportion in Manhattan.|$|E

Since the Crisis the regulatory pendulum has swung to the other extreme. Post-Crisis regulation, plus rapid technological change, have spurred the development of financial technology companies (<b>FinTechs).</b> <b>FinTechs</b> and data-driven financial services providers profoundly challenge the current regulatory paradigm. Financial regulators are increasingly seeking to balance the traditional regulatory objectives of financial stability and consumer protection with promoting growth and innovation. The resulting regulatory innovations include technology (RegTech), regulatory sandboxes and special charters. This paper analyses possible new regulatory approaches, ranging from doing nothing (which spans being permissive to highly restrictive, depending on context), cautious permissiveness (on a case-by-case basis, or through special charters), structured experimentalism (such as sandboxes or piloting), and development of specific new regulatory frameworks. Building on this framework, we argue for a new regulatory approach, which incorporates these rebalanced objectives, and which we term ‘smart regulation’. Our new automated and proportionate regime builds on shared principles {{from a range of}} jurisdictions and supports innovation in financial markets. The fragmentation of market participants and the increased use of technology requires regulators to adopt a sequential reform process, starting with digitization, before building digitally-smart regulation.

40|$|Der Trend zur Auswertung aller nur möglichen Datenbestände für kommerzielle Zwecke ist eine nicht mehr aufzuhaltende Entwicklung. Auch für die Kreditwürdigkeitsprüfung wird überlegt, Daten aus Sozialen Netzwerken einzusetzen. Die Forschungsfrage entsteht, wie die Nutzer dieser Netzwerke reagieren, wenn Banken ihre privaten Profile durchsuchen. Mit Hilfe einer Befragung von 271 Probanden wurde dieses Problem erforscht. Die Ergebnisse sind wie folgt: Die betroffenen Bürger sehen die Entwicklung mit Sorge. Sie begreifen ganz {{rational}} die neuen Geschäftsmodelle und ihre Logik und erkennen die Vorteile. Sie stehen dem Big-Data-Ansatz nicht vollkommen ablehnend gegenüber. Abgelehnt wird es aber, wenn sich Daten aus sozialen Medien negativ für eine Person auswirken. Wenn man schon sein Facebook-Profil einer Bank öffnet, dann will man einen Vorteil davon haben, keinen Nachteil. Ein Teil der Gesellschaft lehnt das Schnüffeln in privaten Daten strikt ab. Insgesamt sind die Antworten deutlich linksschief verteilt mit einem sehr dicken Ende im ablehnenden Bereich. Das Schnüffeln in privaten Daten wird als unethisch und unfair empfunden. Die Menschen fühlen sich im Gegenzug berechtigt, ihre Facebook-Daten zu manipulieren. Eine wie-Du-mir-so-ich-Dir-Mentalität ist festzustellen. Wer kommerziell ausgeschnüffelt wird, der antwortet kommerziell mit Manipulationen seiner Daten. Insgesamt ist Banken zu raten, nicht Vorreiter der Entwicklung zu sein, sondern abzuwarten, welche Erfahrungen <b>Fintechs</b> machen. Banken haben zu hohe Opportunitätskosten in Form des Verlustes von Kundenvertrauen. The {{trend to}} analyze all conceivable data sets {{for commercial purposes}} is unstoppable. Banks and <b>fintechs</b> try to use social media data to assess the creditworthiness of potential customers. The research question is how social media users react when they realize that their bank evaluates personal social media profiles. An inquiry among 271 test persons has been performed to analyze this problem. The results are as follows: The persons are able to rationally reflect {{the reasons for the}} development and the logic behind big data analyses. They realize the advantages, but also see risks. Opening social media profiles to banks should not lead to individual disadvantages. Instead, people expect an advantage from opening their profiles voluntarily. This is a moral attitude. An important minority of 20 to 30 % argues strictly against the commercial use of social media data. When people realize that they cannot prevent the commercial use of private data, they start to manipulate them. Manipulation becomes more extensive when test persons learn about critical details of big data analyses. Those who realize that their private data are used commercially think it would be fair to answer in the same style. So the whole society moves into a commercial direction. To sum up, banks should be reluctant and careful in analyzing private client big data. Instead, banks should give the lead to <b>fintechs</b> as they have fewer opportunity costs, because they do not depend on good customer relations for related products...|$|R

Crowdlending and Digital Advice offer additional opportunities for customers {{to manage their}} assets. In the banking market, 'FinTechs' are the most notable example of what Schumpeter described as 'creative destruction'. They could threaten the existence of established banks. Therefore the banks should use the <b>FinTechs</b> as a testing laboratory for customer behavior and testing ground for a more modern marketing policy. This environment gives rise to concerns that there may develop an unregulated area of shadow banks. But it should be considered that {{a level playing field}} has to be ensured and that innovative processes and products are not stalled. A potential advantage of Digital Advice is that consumers can have the possibility to access the relevant information they need to make their financial decisions. Consumers, in turn, are only able to benefit from this advantage if competition between financial service providers leads to a supply of clear and comprehensible information about financial products and an appropriate degree of data security. The rise of Big Data analyses in retail banking allows a more precise estimation of creditworthiness risk as well as a consumer's willingness-to-pay, propensity to switch and responsiveness to marketing offers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the level of importance consideration given {{to the development of a}} unique customer value proposition and the manner in which this proposition is proposed to or imposed on the customer within the Irish retail banking context. The organisation which is the subject of inquiry is herein referred to as Horizon. The world of retail banking has changed dramatically over the past twenty years. Channel evolution has advanced from sole branch services, call centres, ATM machines, internet banking, e-banking self-service through to today’s, previously unimaginable and unfathomable, self-service mobile banking and contactless cash society. This exponential advancement has been made possible largely by technology, emerging and emergent disruptive innovations, globalisation, new entrants and social shifts. These have resulted in a customer role paradigm shift which have impacted and influenced their expectations, buying patterns and consumer behaviours. The above coupled with increased hyper competitiveness due to the emergence of new players (for example, <b>Fintechs,</b> Peer to Peer Lending, Apple Pay and Google Wallet), crowdfunding and open source coding have resulted in increased commoditisation of banking products and services and the encroachment on incumbents’ previous market positioning advantages and distinct competencies. This research is justified given that the value proposition and intrinsically linked customer centricity phenomenon are key differentiators for sustainable competitive advantage. This paper will specifically assess Horizon’s value proposition, ascertain the degree to which the company is customer centric and determine its level of preparedness for future changes in the industry, where the customer experience will be key. A single exploratory case study was employed to ensure rich insights, opinions and experiences from key influential strategic, technical and operational executives within Horizon were captured. The case study approach is consistent with the methodological vehicle used by previous researchers. Key research findings highlight varying complexities and inter-organisational obstacles which impede the attainment of true customer centricity Specifically,individual silo structures, politics and power plays are impeding the collective ownership, alignment and accountability for the value proposition. This is further exasperated by the absence of the single view of the customer and absence of analysis and use of customer rich analytics. Cumulatively, these factors are adversely impacting on Horizon’s value proposition and the customers’ experience. Formalisation and co-creation of the value proposition, jointly with the customer and which is communicated, integrated and seamlessly aligned across all communication channels and divisions is required to position Horizon on the customer centric path for competitive advantage within the turbulent financial landscape environment...|$|R
