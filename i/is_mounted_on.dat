5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates {{the amount of}} gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> two {{boards of}} equal width, {{which have been}} cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} emblem {{that was used}} {{at the time of}} the BNR and post-Soviet independence was called the Pahonia (the chase). On the base of a red shield, an armored white knight <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a silver horse, with a sword drawn and charging to the left. On the shield of the knight, a golden Patriarchal cross is displayed. A variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Blamey is honoured in Australia {{in various}} ways, {{including}} a square {{named after him}} which is situated outside the Russell Offices headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and Department of Defence in the national capital, Canberra. A statue of Blamey stands in Kings Domain, Melbourne, {{on the corner of}} Government House Drive and Birdwood Avenue, opposite that of John Monash. It was sculptured from granite and bronze by Raymond B. Ewers and presented to the city in February 1960. Controversially, Blamey <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a jeep instead of the traditional horse. Blamey Barracks at Kapooka, where the Army Recruit Training Centre is located, is also named in his honour, as is Blamey Street and Blamey Park in North Ryde, New South Wales. His papers are held in the Australian War Memorial, where his field marshal's baton is on display.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that {{rests on the}} masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|E
50|$|The motored 6000 cars <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> bolsterless S-DT62 bogies, and the non-powered 6100 and 6200 trailer cars <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> S-TR62 bogies.|$|R

5000|$|Also in 1853, the American Ebenezer Talbot also {{patented}} a TBM {{that employed}} Wilson's cutting discs, although they <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> rotating arms, {{which in turn}} <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a rotating plate. [...] In the 1870s, John D. Brunton of England built a machine employing cutting discs that <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically <b>on</b> rotating plates, which in turn <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically <b>on</b> a rotating plate, so that the cutting discs would travel over {{almost all of the}} rock face that was to be removed.|$|R

5000|$|Signals <b>are</b> most {{commonly}} <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> trackside masts about 12 ft to 15 ft high {{to put them}} in the eyeline of the engineer. Signals can also <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> signal bridges or cantilever masts spanning multiple tracks. Signal bridges and masts typically provide at least 20 ft of clearance {{over the top of the}} rail. Bracket masts are arranged with multiple signals <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the same masts governing two adjacent tracks. Bracket masts tend to be the tallest type of signal to allow the train crew to see the signal over a train on the intervening track. Signals in electrified territory may <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the catenary structure, and signals on bi-directional lines may <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> back-to-back <b>on</b> the same <b>mounting</b> device.|$|R

The winch is powered by bevel gears on a shaft driven directly from the engine, with some form of clutch providing raise/lower control. These road locomotives can be used to load a trailer as well as to haul it to a new location. They are often referred to as 'crane engines'.|$|E
25|$|A {{waterwheel}} is {{a source}} of power for a watermill. It <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the axle and drives the mill by a Pit Wheel or Rim Drive. In some watermills, the Waterwheel was replaced by a Turbine.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Canon {{introduced}} the EF-S lens mount, a derivative of the EF <b>mount</b> that <b>is</b> strictly for digital EOS cameras with APS-C sensors released after 2003. EF lenses can <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> EF-S bodies but EF-S lenses cannot <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> EF bodies. In October 2012, Canon {{introduced the}} EF-M lens mount, a derivative designed exclusively for mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs) with APS-C sensors. EF and EF-S lenses can <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> EF-M bodies via the optional Mount Adapter EF-EOS M.|$|R
