25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
500|$|During Casino Royale's {{final draft}} stages, Fleming allowed his friend William Plomer {{to see a}} copy, and remarked [...] "so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the element of {{suspense}} is completely absent". Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first, they were unenthusiastic about the novel, but Fleming's brother Peter, whose books they managed, persuaded the company to publish it. On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s 6d, with a cover designed by Fleming. It was a success and three print runs were needed {{to cope with the}} demand.|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he would safely and conscientiously trust him with a {{considerable}} trust in government, but I think he said it with a little hesitation. It is clear that he is not quite at ease about him, tho' as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> determined not to abandon him. ... The combat in his mind between the candid interpretation of his friend's actions, and his own conviction deprives him of half the benefit of his understanding.|$|E

Because, you know--I blacken my blood in your interest, Pyecraft--my ancestors on that side were, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> gather, a jolly queer lot. See?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{there is}} no {{difference}} between a firing squad, an electric chair, a gas chamber, or hanging. Death is death and I would interpret the shedding of man's blood in legal executions as a figurative expression which means the taking of life. There {{seems to me to be}} no present significance as to whether an execution is by a firing squad or in some other way. I, of course, deleted my article on [...] "hanging" [...] from the Second Edition of Mormon Doctrine because of the reasoning here mentioned.|$|E
2500|$|Hunter R. Rawlings III, President of the {{prominent}} Association of American Universities research group of universities to which UVA is an elected member, came to Charlottesville {{to make a}} speech to university faculty which included a statement about the proposal: [...] "there's no possibility, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> that any state will ever relinquish its ownership and governance of its public universities, much less of its flagship research university". He encouraged university leaders to stop talking about privatization and instead push their state lawmakers to increase funding for higher education and research as a public good.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{occasional}} {{claims that}} Sky News may be inherently biased {{due to the}} fact that it is majority-owned by 21st Century Fox; most of 21st Century Fox's (and News Corp, in which Rupert Murdoch also has an ownership interest) news outlets have an openly conservative or right-wing outlook. In a 2010 article in the New Statesman, prominent journalist and broadcaster Mehdi Hasan argued that [...] "in style and in substance, of course, it is nothing like the pro-war, pro-Republican, pro-Palin Fox News Channel... Sky News remains, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> free of party political bias." ...|$|E

2500|$|Neal Ascherson defended Kapuściński in March 2010 by saying: [...] "None of the doubts, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> {{are about}} the despatches and {{features}} he sent to newspapers, or to the Polish Press Agency. They are about his books. The adventures and encounters he describes in his books are on a different level of veracity. Like his friend Gabriel García Márquez, Kapuściński {{used to talk about}} [...] "literary reportage". You're meant to believe what you are being told, but not in every literal detail. [...] Scrupulous in his journalism, in his books he was capable of inventing {{in order to make a}} truth even truer. He was a great story-teller, but not a liar." ...|$|E
2500|$|The court debated what [...] "religious worship" [...] meant but {{identified}} the phrase [...] "place of meeting for religious worship" [...] in the 1855 Act {{as being the}} key issue. To Lord Denning's mind, this meant [...] "a place of which the principal use was {{as a place where}} people came together as a congregation to do reverence" [...] to a deity, whether it was the Christian God or some other. The judges agreed that Scientology's practices [...] "did not reveal any form whatever of worship. [...] did not humble themselves in reverence or recognition of the dominant power and control of any entity or being outside their own bodies and life." [...] As Lord Denning put it, [...] "There is considerable stress on the spirit of Man, and adherents of this religion or philosophy believe that a man's spirit is everlasting and moves from one human frame to another. But it is still, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> the spirit of Man and not God." [...] The court found that {{there was no evidence of}} religious worship taking place in the chapel and dismissed the appeal. Permission to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.|$|E
2500|$|James Leach of Your Sinclair {{gave the}} ZX Spectrum game a 92/100 rating, writing that [...] "I'm really into this game. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> it's got {{everything}} it should have. It's fast, it's easy in places and dead wicked in others and it's got a {{massive amount of}} variety. What more could you want? ... The graphics are very cartoony, as you'd expect, and there's pots of colour." [...] Leach {{also noted that the}} idea of including minigames in Bart vs. the Space Mutants [...] "is pretty inspired, and makes the game even more fun." [...] A reviewer for Crash also gave the ZX Spectrum version a positive review, with a 91/100 rating. He praised the variety and gameplay of the game, and noted that [...] "while it may sound pretty basic [...] it’s when you start discovering things, making use of objects, finding hidden treasures that it really comes alive. And achieving an objective is satisfying because the route to completion can be pretty tough (especially some of the platform elements)." [...] The reviewer also noted that [...] "if you’re a Simpsons fan the game’s incredibly appealing, the graphics all reflect Matt Groening’s cartoon very well. And how much of a fan you are dictates how much you’re really going to enjoy this [...] Non-fans can still get loads of entertainment, but some parts may be frustrating if you’re not into the characters." ...|$|E
