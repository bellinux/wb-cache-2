5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which <b>is</b> <b>many</b> times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the country}} with the highest {{estimated}} incidence rate of TB was Swaziland, with 1,200 cases per 100,000 people. India had the largest total incidence, with an estimated 2.0 million new cases. In developed countries, tuberculosis is less common and is found mainly in urban areas. Rates per 100,000 people in different areas of the world were: globally 178, Africa 332, the Americas 36, Eastern Mediterranean 173, Europe 63, Southeast Asia 278, and Western Pacific 139 in 2010. In Canada and Australia, tuberculosis <b>is</b> <b>many</b> times more common among the aboriginal peoples, especially in remote areas. In the United States Native Americans have a fivefold greater mortality from TB, and racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 84% of all reported TB cases.|$|E
25|$|HCO3− {{is known}} as the {{bicarbonate}} ion. Calcium bicarbonate <b>is</b> <b>many</b> times more soluble in water than calcium carbonate—indeed it exists only in solution.|$|E

25|$|Theophylline (4%): Relaxes smooth {{muscles of}} the bronchi, and is used to treat asthma. The {{therapeutic}} dose of theophylline, however, <b>is</b> <b>many</b> {{times greater than the}} levels attained from caffeine metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Fossil {{trading is}} the {{practice}} of buying and selling fossils. This <b>is</b> <b>many</b> times done illegally with artifacts stolen from research sites, costing many important scientific specimens each year. The problem is quite pronounced in China, where many specimens have been stolen.|$|E
25|$|Because this {{reference}} frame rotates {{several times a}} minute rather than only once a day like the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced <b>is</b> <b>many</b> times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by {{the rotation of the}} Earth.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have found}} that {{university}} graduation rates are 20% higher among members of Greek-letter organizations than among non-members and students {{who are members of}} fraternities and sororities typically have higher-than-average grade point averages. One reason for this <b>is</b> <b>many</b> chapters require their members to maintain a certain academic standard.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Rydberg atoms are common in interstellar space and could be observed from earth. Since the density within interstellar gas clouds <b>is</b> <b>many</b> orders of magnitude lower than the best laboratory vacuums attainable on Earth, Rydberg states could persist {{for long periods of time}} without being destroyed by collisions.|$|E
25|$|December 31, 1940: No. 1676, a 2-10-2 type {{locomotive}} with a 40-car {{freight train}} in tow, jumps the rails while cruising north via the Sorrento Grade and {{lands in the}} Pacific Ocean, {{with much of the}} rolling stock following suit. No one is killed in the accident, and it <b>is</b> <b>many</b> days before all of the wreckage can be pulled out of the sea.|$|E

25|$|Another {{material}} used {{in building}} aquaria is plywood. The {{reason for this}} <b>is</b> <b>many</b> reasons including saving money, less weight, and better insulation. A popular {{thing to do with}} plywood aquaria is keeping them in a wall where the use of plywood hides the inside of the walls along with this putting insulation behind the plywood helps with tanks that need heating.|$|E
25|$|Painless {{passage of}} blood or protein {{in the urine}} may often be the only {{presenting}} sign of kidney involvement. Acute or chronic renal impairment may develop with lupus nephritis, leading to acute or end-stage kidney failure. Because of early recognition and management of SLE, end-stage renal failure occurs in less than 5% of cases; except in the black population, where the risk <b>is</b> <b>many</b> times higher.|$|E
25|$|To {{accelerate}} the electrons from the cathode {{to the screen}} with sufficient velocity, a very high voltage (EHT or Extra High Tension) is required, from a few thousand volts for a small oscilloscope CRT to tens of kV for a larger screen color TV. This <b>is</b> <b>many</b> times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply is turned off, some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain a charge for some time.|$|E

25|$|Just {{as there}} <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{different}} types of representations for Kac–Moody algebras and their universal enveloping algebras, so there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{different types of}} representation for quantum groups.|$|R
25|$|Using {{deuterium-tritium}} fuel, {{the resulting}} energy barrier is about 0.1MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an electron from hydrogen is 13.6eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) {{result of the}} fusion is an unstable 5He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining 4He nucleus is 3.5MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6MeV. This <b>is</b> <b>many</b> times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.|$|E
25|$|When {{the scope}} of the physics is widened to include gravity, the {{interpretation}} of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently no compelling explanation as to why it should not result in a cosmological constant that <b>is</b> <b>many</b> orders of magnitude larger than observed. However, since we do not yet have any fully coherent quantum theory of gravity, there is likewise no compelling reason as to why it should.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several {{similarities}} between the apparition at La Salette, near Grenoble, and Lourdes. La Salette <b>is</b> <b>many</b> hundreds of kilometres from Lourdes, and the events at La Salette predate those in Lourdes by 12 years. However, Virgin Mary's appearance of La Salette was tall and maternal (not petite and gentle like her Lourdes apparition) and had a darker, more threatening series of messages. It is not certain if Soubirous {{was aware of the}} events at La Salette.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> undiscovered species of blindsnakes, so it is likely that there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> more species of gerrhopilids yet to be discovered.|$|R

25|$|Dallas {{is a major}} {{destination}} for Mexican immigrants. The southwestern portion of the city, particularly Oak Cliff is chiefly inhabited by Hispanic residents. The southeastern portion of the city Pleasant Grove is chiefly inhabited by black and Hispanic residents, while the southern portion {{of the city is}} predominantly black. The West and East sides of the city are predominantly Hispanic; Garland also has a large Spanish speaking population. North Dallas <b>is</b> <b>many</b> enclaves of predominantly white, black and especially Hispanic residents.|$|E
25|$|The second possibility, fusing 32He {{with itself}} (32He + 32He), {{requires}} even higher temperatures (since now both reactants have a +2 charge), {{and thus is}} even more difficult than the D-3He reaction. However, it does offer a possible reaction that produces no neutrons; the charged protons produced can be contained using electric and magnetic fields, which in turn results in direct electricity generation. 32He + 32He fusion is feasible as demonstrated in the laboratory and has immense advantages, but commercial viability <b>is</b> <b>many</b> years in the future.|$|E
25|$|As {{the water}} quality has improved, otters have {{returned}} to the river in numbers such that fishing lakes now require fencing to protect stocks. Paxton Pits nature reserve near St Neots has hides from which otters are regularly seen. Coarse fishing is still popular, {{with a wide range of}} fish in the river, but it <b>is</b> <b>many</b> years since large sturgeon were caught. Seals have been recorded as far upstream as Bedford. Huntingdonshire seems to be the most popular area for breeding animals in recent years.|$|E
