50|$|The dam {{is unique}} in Queensland and is a {{concrete}} multiple arch and buttress type structure, with the spillway discharging {{over the tops of}} the arches. The spillway crest is 18.3 m above bed level. The arch barrels, founded on a triangular arch base, are constructed in <b>independent</b> <b>arch</b> rings and are hinged at buttress springing lines. The spillway is a precast superstructure and the dissipation slab at ground level is post tensioned to the foundation rock.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHAND 2 is an {{essential}} transcription factor for cardiac, pharyngeal arch, and limb development. Apoptosis in the HAND 2 -null embryo causes hypoplasia of the right ventricle and pharyngeal arches leading to lethality by embryonic day (E) 10. 0 from heart failure. In order to investigate the role of apoptosis in inducing the HAND 2 -null phenotype, we generated mouse embryos lacking both HAND 2 and Apaf- 1, a central downstream mediator of mitochondrial damage-induced apoptosis. In contrast to HAND 2 −/− embryos, HAND 2 −/−Apaf- 1 −/− embryos at E 10. 5 – 11. 0 had well-developed pharyngeal arches, aortic arch arteries, and no signs of cardiac failure. TUNEL analysis through pharyngeal arches of HAND 2 −/−Apaf- 1 −/− embryos revealed decreased apoptosis and the embryos had clearly patent aortic arch arteries. However, ventricular hypoplasia and cell death were unchanged in these animals compared to HAND 2 −/− embryos, resulting in growth arrest at E 11. 0. Our study suggests that loss of HAND 2 in the pharyngeal arch mesenchyme leads to apoptosis in an Apaf- 1 -dependent fashion and that, while loss of aortic arch integrity contributes to the early lethality, the ventricular defects are <b>independent</b> of <b>arch</b> development...|$|R
50|$|We have no {{hesitation}} in affirming, {{that of all}} the timber bridges patented in this country, there are none, in point of strength, economy (in which we include ultimate durability), facility of repair, and uniformity of action, to be preferred before this plan of bridge lately patented by Mr. D. C. McCallum, of Oswego, engineer or ways and structures on the New York and Erie railroad.The bridge shown in elevation (see image) has been built lately for the New York and Erie railroad, at Lanesboro', over the Susquehanna river, in the place of one built by ourselves, several years since, under the orders, and according to the plan of the chief engineer of that road, but which proved unequal to the duty imposed upon it; and its removal became a matter of necessity.We objected to the plan of the original bridge, built in that locality, as we have ever done to any plan of bridge in which the attempt was made to unite the <b>independent</b> systems of <b>arch</b> and truss, and make toe stability of the bridge dependent upon their uniformity of action. In this plan of Mr. McCallum, the two principles are not independent as heretofore; but the action of the arch in the upper chord is made {{an integral part of the}} truss itself; and instead of two systems acting unequally, and to the ultimate injury of the structure, we have the best features of both united in a manner which admits of entire uniformity of action.In the construction of bridges for railroad purposes, two prominent difficulties have long been discovered, viz., a lack of sustaining principle towards the ends of the trusses and near the abutments, and an entire absence in many cases of a proper counteracting principle to prevent vertical vibration by a moving load. See Haupt on Bridges, to which admirable work the reader is particularly referred for a full description of the proper office of a counter-brace...|$|R
40|$|Background Coronary {{angiography}} (CA) is {{the gold}} standard in diagnosing and determining the treatment of patients with coronary heart disease. Procedure-related neurological complications are rare; 0. 1 - 0. 4 % for CA and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In contrast, the incidence of procedure-related silent cerebral lesions, shown with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance tomography, is considerably higher (2 - 35 %). Cerebral microemboli have been observed during different vascular procedures and are related to new silent cerebral lesions but their clinical impact is debated. CA and PCI can be performed with different techniques, i. e. with the radial or the femoral access. As procedure-related stroke is associated with high mortality, considerable morbidity and suffering {{it is important to}} study which technique entails the lowest risk for patient injury. Methods and results Study I: Fifty-one patients with stable angina pectoris were randomised to CA with the radial or the femoral access and the number of cerebral microemboli was assessed with bilateral transcranial Doppler technique of the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). The number of particulate cerebral microemboli was signifiantly higher with the radial compared to the femoral access. The number of cerebral microemboli was higher for both access sites during catheter exchanges compared with other specifi procedural steps during CA, with most cerebral microemboli detected in the right MCA in the radial group. This indicates a causal anatomical link, as the catheter is advanced from the right radial artery through the brachiocephalic trunk before it bends into the ascending aorta to reach the coronary ostia. Study II: Forty-one patients with stable angina pectoris or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction scheduled for CA were randomised to two different guidewire techniques with the femoral access involving catheter advancement with or without a leading guidewire over the aortic arch. After the CA was completed, including contrast injections, the opposite technique was used on the same patient without further contrast injections. At the same time, the number of cerebral microemboli was registered using bilateral transcranial Doppler technique. The number of cerebral microemboli was higher when the catheter was advanced with, rather than without a leading guidewire over the aortic <b>arch,</b> <b>independent</b> of whether a complete CA was performed or if a catheter was placed {{in the vicinity of the}} coronary ostia only. Study III: All CAs and PCIs reported between 2003 and 2011, n= 336, 836, to the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Register with information on access site were retrospectively analysed regarding the association between access site and procedure-related stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). After cross-checking the reported neurological complications with the corresponding medical records the incidence of procedure-related stroke or TIA was 0. 16 %. After multivariable adjustment, the radial access was associated with a higher risk for procedure-related stroke or TIA (risk ratio 1. 30, 95 % confience interval 1. 04 - 1. 62) compared with the femoral access. Parallel to the increased use of the radial access over time, the risk for procedure-related stroke or TIA also increased, although there was no signifiant interaction between the different time intervals observed. Study IV: Ninety-three patients with suspected or stable angina pectoris scheduled for CA or PCI were tested with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) before and twice after the coronary procedure to study postprocedural cognitive impairment. A subgroup was monitored with bilateral transcranial Doppler technique to explore the relationship between cerebral microemboli and cognitive function. The patients were also randomised to radial or femoral vascular access site to study if the access site used was related to postprocedural cognitive impairment. Cognitive function assessed with the MoCA test was not impaired after the coronary procedure. There was no signifiant correlation between the results of the MoCA test and cerebral microemboli or vascular access site. Conclusions The choice of access site and guidewire technique used for CA and PCI had an impact on the occurrence of cerebral microemboli. There may be an association between the radial access and increased risk for procedure-related stroke or TIA, which should be studied further. Earlier studies have shown that cerebral microemboli are related to new silent cerebral lesions, but we found no cognitive impairment after coronary procedures using the MoCA test. Further studies are needed to explore the clinical impact of cerebral microemboli and to minimise or prevent the occurrence of procedure-related ischemic cerebral lesions in patients undergoing CA and PCI...|$|R
