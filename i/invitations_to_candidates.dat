40|$|We {{investigate}} whether the {{publicly available information}} on Facebook about job applicants affects employers' hiring decisions. To this end, we conduct a field experiment in which fictitious job applications are sent to real job openings in Belgium. The only characteristic in which these candidates differ is the unique Facebook profile {{that can be found}} online with their name. Candidates with the most beneficial Facebook picture obtain approximately 39 % more job interview <b>invitations</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>candidates</b> with the least beneficial picture. In addition, we find suggestive evidence for a higher effect of Facebook profile picture appearance on hiring chances when candidates are highly educated and when recruiters are female...|$|R

50|$|The North Paddington Liberal Council did {{encounter}} {{difficulty in}} selecting a candidate.

The Council eventually selected none of these: William Digby, a writer, ended up fighting the seat. Digby was a strong advocate of greater power for Indian natives.|$|R

5000|$|In 2004, Rocco {{ran for the}} Board of Education of the Orange Unified School District, a California school {{district}} that has a budget of $230 million and serves over 32,000 students at 42 schools. After filing his candidacy, Rocco ignored mail from district officials and the teachers' union. The local Parent-Teacher Association sent him an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> a <b>candidate</b> forum, but the letter was mailed back, unopened. On the ballot, Rocco identified himself {{as a writer and}} educator. Rocco was up against local park ranger Phil Martinez, who had three children in the district, and was an active volunteer with the Boy Scouts of America. Surprisingly, on November 4, 2004, the mysterious Rocco won 54% of the vote, beating Martinez. News of Rocco's victory ran in the New York Post, Ottawa Citizen, and USA Today. Paul Pruss, a middle school teacher and president of the local teachers' union, {{said in an interview with}} USA Today that [...] "nobody has seen this guy", and called the election bizarre.|$|R

5000|$|After he lost in 1924 Thompson {{declined}} to stand again in Torquay. The local Liberal Association did however approach him again {{when they were}} looking for a new candidate after the 1929 general election but he was unwilling to take it on.

Karjakin said in the postmatch conference that he had played well below his capabilities in the tiebreaks and was unable to make use of his preparation. Nonetheless, he indicated that he will accept his <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> the next <b>Candidates</b> Tournament <b>to</b> fight for another match for the title.

50|$|In 1928, João Pessoa {{was elected}} {{governor}} of Paraíba, in which role {{he attempted to}} bring about reform of the state's political and administrative structure, and imposed taxes on trade conducted between Paraíba and the port of Recife. In the 1930 presidential elections, Pessoa refused to support the Republican candidate, Júlio Prestes, and accepted an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> become vice-presidential <b>candidate</b> on the ticket of Getúlio Vargas. Prestes won the election, {{and one of his}} supporters, Colonel José Pereira Lima, led a revolt against Pessoa's state government, with the cooperation of the federal government. Pessoa responded by ordering raids on the homes and offices of suspected rebel sympathizers; during one such raid on the house of João Duarte Dantas, an ally of Pereira, police discovered intimate letters from Dantas' mistress, which were subsequently published in the state press.|$|R
50|$|Also in Europe, {{pervasive}} {{levels of}} age discrimination {{are found in}} Belgium, England, France, Spain and Sweden. Job candidates revealing older age are found to get 39% (in Belgium) to 72% (in France) less job interview <b>invitations</b> compared <b>to</b> equal <b>candidates</b> revealing a younger name. In addition, In a survey for the University of Kent, England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination. This is a higher proportion than for gender or racial discrimination. Dominic Abrams, social psychology professor at the university, concluded that Ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population. Discrimination {{is found to be}} heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In Belgium, they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.|$|R
50|$|Pervasive {{levels of}} ethnic labour market {{discrimination}} {{are found in}} Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and the UK. Job candidates with foreign names are found to get 24% to 52% less job interview <b>invitations</b> compared <b>to</b> equal <b>candidates</b> with native names. Interestingly, ethnic discrimination is lower among the high-educated and in larger firms. In addition, unequal treatment {{is found to be}} heterogeneous by the labour market tightness in the occupation: compared <b>to</b> natives, <b>candidates</b> with a foreign-sounding name are equally often invited to a job interview if they apply for occupations for which vacancies are difficult to fill, but they have to send twice as many applications for occupations for which labor market tightness is low. Recent research shows that ethnic discrimination is nowadays driven by employers' concern that co-workers and customers prefer collaborating with natives. In addition, volunteering has found to be a way out of ethnic discrimination in the labour market.|$|R
