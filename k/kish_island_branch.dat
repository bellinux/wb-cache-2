40|$|Coral reefs are {{specialized}} {{communities that}} develop clear, well-lit tropical and subtropical water; they provide shelter and canopy for {{great variety of}} organisms, living in mean temperature of 20 °C. Coral Bleaching and mortality {{have been associated with}} elevated seawater temperature. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate coral bleaching and evaluate health condition of the corals. Distribution of coral reefs around <b>Kish</b> <b>Island</b> was determined by the Timed Swim (TS) technique. This survey carried out in 2 times (May and October, 2009) in 2 depths of 3 - 5 m and 6 - 10 m. Two Divers swam in constant speed for a set amount of time in three dive sites. The timed swim survey around the <b>Kish</b> <b>Island</b> showed that the most healthy live hard coral assemblages were found in the site called Persian Gulf seaport, whereas the greatest percentage of bleached corals were located in Jurassic Park station, located at the southeast of the <b>Island.</b> <b>Branching</b> corals (Acropora sp.) were bleached among all 3 stations and no sign of recovery could be detected. In Big coral site suitable substrate for accumulation of living organisms including Echinometra mathaie (sea urchin) existed due to presence of great amount of algae on dead corals and rocks. Based on the observation, it seems that the cause of reef destruction in <b>Kish</b> <b>Island</b> fall in to two categories, natural and human impacts...|$|R
