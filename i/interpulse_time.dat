40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of ongoing volcanic eruptions is essential for predicting the input and transport of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. To constrain near-vent dynamic processes of explosive Vulcanian events, we used Doppler radar measurements, providing tephra velocities and a proxy of the mass flux, in two field experiments at Volcán de Colima (Mexico) and Santiaguito (Guatemala). We find that explosive eruptions at both volcanoes consist of individual degassing pulses. The analysis of the timing of such pulses shows that both volcanoes have preferred interpulse times of 3 s (Santiaguito) and 2 – 5 s (Volcán de Colima). The <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> during one event may change, but it often returns to the preferred <b>interpulse</b> <b>time.</b> This behavior is similar at both volcanoes and the <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> roughly follows a log-logistic distribution indicating the interplay of two competing processes.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of an optically injected quantum-dot laser accounting for excited states. Mapping of the bifurcations in the plane frequency detuning vs. injection strength shows that the relaxation rate scales the regions of locking and single- and double-period solutions, while the capture rate has a minor effect. Within the regions of time-periodic solutions, close to the saddle-node bifurcation boundary, we identify subregions where the output signal resembles excitable pulses {{as a result of}} the bottleneck phenomenon. We show that such emission is determined mainly by fluctuations in the occupation of the excited states. The <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> follows an inverse square root scaling law as a function of the detuning. In a deterministic system the pulses are periodic regardless of the detuning, but in the presence of noise, close to the locking region, the <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> follows a positively skewed normal distribution. For a fixed frequency detuning, increasing the noise strength can shift the mean of the <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> distribution and make the pulsations more periodic...|$|E

Theory predicts that at 0 K the branching ratio can be varied by a factor of 3, while at high temperatures (1000 K), the factor drops to approximately 1. 2 due to the effect of the wide distribution of initial states. Experimental results at 1000 K are presented and are found to be consistent with theory.

40|$|Three {{components}} {{determine the}} power {{spectrum of the}} surface EMG signal: the auto- and cross-power spectra of the firing processes and the power spectra of the motor unit action potential (MUAP). To clarify the relative contribution of these components to the median frequency (MF) of the power spectrum, a stochastic simulation model was used in which most input parameters [e. g., MUAP peak-peak <b>time</b> (PPT), mean <b>interpulse</b> interval <b>time,</b> and synchronization parameters] were {{described in terms of}} distribution functions. Simulation clearly predicts that MF is especially sensitive to variations in MUAP shape, the MUAP PPT, and synchronization. The influence of the firing process parameters was predicted to be marginal. To obtain values for the MUAP parameters, a needle-triggered averaging technique was used to gather surface MUAPs from the m. biceps brachii. With use of these MUAPs as input for the model, it was found that intrasubject variability of MF is caused by variations in both MUAP PPT and MUAP shape, whereas intersubject variability in MF is caused primarily by variations in PPT...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Recently a new MR {{endogenous}} contrast mechanism was reported. It allows specifically imaging the magnetization transfer (MT) effect {{arising from}} inhomogeneously broadened {{components of the}} NMR spectrum, and was hence dubbed ihMT. Such unique NMR lineshape properties are presumably occurring in myelin because of its specifically ordered, multilayered sheath structure. Here, optimization of a pulsed ihMT preparation module is presented to provide guidance for future studies and improve the understanding of underlying contrast mechanisms. METHODS: This study was performed at 1. 5 Tesla on healthy volunteers. A pulsed ihMT preparation was implemented in combination with a HASTE readout module. The pulse width, <b>interpulse</b> repetition <b>time,</b> total saturation duration and RF saturation power were considered for optimization of the ihMT sensitivity and contrast. RESULTS: An optimal configuration of the preparation module was derived, leading to 10 % ihMT signal in internal capsule (relative to unsaturated data) and around 200 % signal increase relative to gray matter, i. e., approximately 10 -fold superior contrast compared with conventional MT ratios, measured under similar experimental conditions. CONCLUSION: Overall the ihMT sequence was robust, sensitive and very specific for white matter. These findings suggest great potential for assessing brain myelination and for better characterization of myelin related disorders.

40|$|In the {{behavioral}} theory of timing, pulses from a hypothetical Poisson pacemaker produce transitions between {{states that are}} correlated with adjunctive behavior. The adjunctive behavior serves as a discriminative stimulus for temporal discriminations. The present experiments tested {{the assumption that the}} average <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> of the pacemaker is proportional to interreinforcer interval. Responses on a left key were reinforced at variable intervals for the first 25 s since the beginning of a 50 -s trial, and right-key responses were reinforced at variable intervals during the second 25 s. Psychometric functions relating proportion of right-key responses to time since trial onset, in 5 -s intervals across the 50 -s trial, were sigmoidal in form. Average interpulse times derived by fitting quantitative predictions from {{the behavioral}} theory of timing to obtained psychometric functions decreased when the interreinforcer interval was decreased and increased when the interreinforcer interval was increased, as predicted by the theory. In a second experiment, average interpulse times estimated from trials without reinforcement followed global changes in interreinforcer interval, as predicted by the theory. Changes in temporal discrimination as a function of interreinforcer interval were therefore not influenced by the discrimination of reinforcer occurrence. The present data support the assumption of the behavioral theory of timing that <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> is determined by interreinforcer interval...|$|E

The differential peak flux distribution is corrected for threshold effects at low peak fluxes and at short burst durations, and the pulse duration time dilation factors are also corrected for energy stretching and similar effects. Within an Einstein-de Sitter cosmology, we place strong bounds {{on the evolution of}} the bursts, and these bounds are incompatible with a homogeneous population, assuming a power law spectrum and no luminosity evolution. Additionally, under the implied conditions of moderate evolution, the 90 % width of the observed luminosity distribution is shown to be < 10 ^ 2, which is less constrained than others have demonstrated it to be assuming no evolution. Finally, redshift considerations indicate that if the redshifts of BATSE's faintest bursts are to be compatible with that which is currently known for galaxies, a standard candle luminosity is unacceptable, {{and in the case of}} the power law luminosity distribution, a mean luminosity < 10 ^ 57 ph s^- 1 is favored.

40|$|Phospholipid head group {{dynamics}} {{have been studied}} by pulsed phosphorus- 31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P-NMR) of unoriented and macroscopically aligned dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine model membranes in the temperature range, 203 - 343 K. Lineshapes and echo intensities have been recorded {{as a function of}} <b>interpulse</b> delay <b>times,</b> temperature and macroscopic orientation of the bilayer normal with respect to the magnetic field. The dipolar proton-phosphorus (1 H- 31 P) contribution to the transverse relaxation time, T 2 E, and to lineshapes was eliminated by means of a proton spin-lock sequence. In case of longitudinal spin relaxation, T 1 Z, the amount of dipolar coupling was evaluated by measuring the maximum nuclear Overhauser enhancement. Hence, the results could be analyzed by considering chemical shift anisotropy as the only relaxation mechanism. The presence of various minima both in T 1 Z and T 2 E temperature plots as well as the angular dependence of these relaxation times allowed description of the dynamics of the phosphate head group in the 31 P-NMR time window, by three different motional classes, i. e., intramolecular, intermolecular and collective motions. The intramolecular motions consist of two hindered rotations and one free rotation around the bonds linking the phosphate head group to the glycerol backbone. These motions are the fastest in the hierarchy of time with correlation times varying from less than 10 (- 12) to 10 (- 6) s in the temperature range investigated. The intermolecular motions are assigned to phospholipid long axis rotation and fluctuation. They have correlation times ranging from 10 (- 11) s at high temperatures to 10 (- 3) s at low temperatures. The slowest motion affecting the 31 P-NMR observables is assigned to viscoelastic modes, i. e., so called order director fluctuations and is only detected at high temperatures, above the main transition in pulse frequency dependent T 2 ECP experiments.

40|$|Recently prepulse {{techniques}} such as dual-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (DP-LIBS) have emerged as commonly used analytical techniques for qualitative and quantitative elemental investigations in various research fields and disciplines such as industrial, defense and medical applications. The performance of the DP-LIBS technique {{is strongly dependent on}} the choice of the experimental conditions. The key parameters that affect its performance are the target properties, laser wavelength, pulse duration, energy and spot-size, <b>interpulse</b> delay <b>times,</b> delay time of observations, ambient background gas pressure and geometrical setup of the optics. The DP-LIBS approach provides significant enhancement in the intensities of emission lines and their lifetimes, up to two orders of magnitude greater than conventional single pulse laser induced breakdown spectroscopy. The aim of the work presented here is to further advance prepulse techniques, as well as other methods to control species density, with a view to optimise emission in the visible wavelength range. In particular, a new technique involving reheating the stagnation layer formed at the collision front between two (or more) colliding plasmas is explored. Spatially and temporally resolved imaging and spectroscopy of the interaction region between two colliding plasmas are employed to demonstrate {{for the first time that}} pumping of an optimised stagnation layer significantly increases the intensity emission and duration of selected spectral lines. This technique offers the promise of tunable density and tunable energy (temperature) plasmas. It will potentially increase both the lifetimes and intensities of spectral lines in laser produced plasmas by creating relatively low density - high energy plasmas which can overcome the problem of flux loss due to opacity, which leads to the attenuation of discrete emission lines with a concomitant reduction in line contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-background ratio (SBR). The latter is a key parameter in determining the limit-of-detection (LOD) of the LIBS technique. Other applications of stagnation layers include the development of 2 ̆ 7 target fuel 2 ̆ 7 for Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) and X-ray light sources with an especial emphasis on generating high repetition rate, preheated droplet-like targets that can compete with the current liquid drop targets. The latter suffer from clogging at the jet nozzle due to adiabatic expansion freezing.

40|$|Obtaining {{high signal}} levels in {{fluorescence}} microscopy is usually spoiled by the concomitant {{population of the}} dark (triplet) state of the marker, which is often followed by photobleaching. Recently, we introduced the triplet relaxation (T-Rex) modality in fluorescence microscopy {{which led to a}} major increase in total signal and dye photostability. The idea behind T-Rex is to avoid the illumination of fluorophores in the triplet state, e. g. by using pulsed excitation with <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> distances that are long enough for the triplet state to relax between two pulses. While our previous implementation came at the expense of extended recording, here we investigate pulsed excitation patterns for T-Rex illumination implying shorter total recording times. In particular, we balance signal enhancement and imaging speed by exciting with bunches of quickly succeeding pulses that are separated by dark periods for triplet relaxation. Taking the green fluorescent protein and the organic dye Atto 532 as examples, we observe the dependence of photobleaching and total fluorescence gain on the number of pulses within a bunch. Reaching almost T-Rex conditions this excitation scheme mimics fast scanning of the illumination beam and has the potential to improve a whole range of analytical tools that suffer from photobleaching and low signal levels...|$|E
40|$|We study {{dynamical}} error suppression {{from the}} perspective of reducing sequencing complexity, in order to facilitate efficient semi-autonomous quantum-coherent systems. With this aim, we focus on digital sequences where all <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> periods are integer multiples of a minimum clock period and compatibility with simple digital classical control circuitry is intrinsic, using so-called em Walsh functions as a general mathematical framework. The Walsh functions are an orthonormal set of basis functions which may be associated directly with the control propagator for a digital modulation scheme, and dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences can be derived from the locations of digital transitions therein. We characterize the suite of the resulting Walsh dynamical decoupling (WDD) sequences, and identify the number of periodic square-wave (Rademacher) functions required to generate a Walsh function as the key determinant of the error-suppressing features of the relevant WDD sequence. WDD forms a unifying theoretical framework as it includes a large variety of well-known and novel DD sequences, providing significant flexibility and performance benefits relative to basic quasi-periodic design. We also show how Walsh modulation may be employed for the protection of certain nontrivial logic gates, providing an implementation of a dynamically corrected gate. Based on these insights we identify Walsh modulation as a digital-efficient approach for physical-layer error suppression. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of penetration depth {{and distribution of}} water at surfaces is essential to knowledge {{of the state of}} conservation of Cultural Heritage items and materials, such as frescoes, stone, brick, wood, and paper. Water can penetrate the surface of an object, coming from either an external or an internal source, and in general the moisture content of the surface region is the cause of various decay phenomena such as microfractures and disintegration. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach can be very powerful for the evaluation of the state of fine arts materials. Not only the water saturation and?or the porosity of the material can be evaluated but also information on material pore-size distributions can be obtained by monitoring the distributions of relaxation times of the transverse (T 2) and longitudinal (T 1) components of the magnetization of the trapped water. The drawback is that generally the sample does not fit into standard NMR magnets, and for in situ application, single-sided NMR devices have to be used. Therefore, the standard methods to get NMR parameters are not always valid, and some alternative procedures have to be performed. For example, in strongly inhomogeneous magnetic fields due to the geometrical features of single-sided NMR devices, the transverse relaxation is greatly influenced by the molecular self-diffusion even at the shortest <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> available for a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) sequence. In this paper we show how the dephasing effect due to molecular self-diffusion can be corrected by using the “constant echo time method. ” We report an attempt to recover the corrected T 2 distribution in well-characterized porous materials saturated with water, with data acquired in the highly inhomogeneous magnetic field of a single-sided NMR device. The results are discussed and compared with those acquired on the same samples in the highly homogeneous magnetic field of a traditional NMR instrument...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} world {{energy needs}} lead to strong efforts in today's energy R&D {{trying to open}} up new energy resources. One possible option to access energy in large scale power plants {{is to use the}} process of nuclear fusion to generate heat and, from that, electricity with conventional steam turbine technology. However, the realisation is technologically and scientifically very challenging. The heat fluxes that load the inner walls of a fusion device, especially the most severely loaded part, the divertor, are one of the issues currently being under investigation. A distinction is made between steady state heat loads (SSHLs) that are continuously active during operation and transient heat loads (THLs) that are superimposed short-time events. The potentially most harmful THLs during normal operation are type I Edge Localised Modes (ELMs). They are estimated to have a power density of 1 - 10 GW/m² for 0. 2 - 0. 5 ms duration in the upcoming next step fusion experiment ITER. Because of high pulse repetition frequency more than 1, 000, 000 ELM events are expected during the foreseen lifetime of divertor components. However, only data regarding behaviour of materials for a low number of pulses (typically 100 - 1000) exists. This work describes the development of a procedure to simulate THLs at high repetition frequency using an electron beam facility and the tests done on tungsten and carbon-based (carbon fibre composite, CFC) plasma facing materials. The developed procedure uses a pulse frequency of 25 Hz, hence actively cooled components are necessary and were designed. A novel electron beam guidance procedure, called circular loading method, was a result of the developmental process. It was used for all later tests because it provides a stabilisation of the applied power density against test parameter fluctuations (e. g. vacuum quality). The electron beam guidance is flexible enough to provide a SSHL pattern during the <b>interpulse</b> <b>time</b> (between two successive THLs) additionally to the THL pulses. This allowed to influence the base temperature of the sample surface. The material tests were done with pulse numbers of 100 - 1, 000, 000 and absorbed power densities of up to 0. 55 GW/m² and 0. 68 GW/m² per pulse for tungsten and CFC materials respectively. The surface base temperature was predicted by finite element analyses and monitored by pyrometer measurements. Damage thresholds of the investigated tungsten and CFC were found to be < 0. 27 GW/m² and < 0. 68 GW/m² respectively. Below these power densities no damage/degradation was found for pulse numbers up to 1, 000, 000 (tungsten) or 100, 000 (CFC). Tungsten showed long term fatigue, which did not occur in CFC. Although it was expected that tungsten would be more resistant at higher base temperatures due to higher ductility, it was found to show earlier degradation at higher temperatures. It is proposed that an increased ductility leads to stronger fatigue damage...|$|E
