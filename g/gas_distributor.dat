25|$|Power to gas is a {{technology}} which converts electrical {{power to a}} gas fuel. There are 2 methods, {{the first is to}} use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. The second (less efficient) method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane, (see natural gas) using electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction. The excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen Fuel cell maker Hydrogenics and natural <b>gas</b> <b>distributor</b> Enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in Canada.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the Dallas City Council {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} mandating that no vehicle can be operated as a taxicab {{within the city}} limits once it reaches five years from the date of manufacture. More recently, an effort spearheaded by Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert has begun to convert all taxicabs in Dallas to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). It has been alleged that the drive toward CNG taxis is consequence of a corrupt bargain among Dallas politicians and the large energy interests that dominate the business and civic circles of the city.

25|$|In {{the late}} '90s the {{wholesale}} electricity market opened up across North America, and Hydro-Québec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition {{both inside and}} outside its tranditional service area. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Hydro-Québec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices, enabling Hydro-Québec to expand its market. Hydro-Québec acquired a substantial share of Noverco, controller of natural <b>gas</b> <b>distributor</b> Gaz Métro, to participate in that market in northeastern North America.In 2002 the Agreement Respecting a New Relationship Between the Cree Nation and the Government of Quebec between the Grand Council of the Crees and the Quebec government made possible the development of the Eastmain Reservoir. The 5,000 million CAD Eastmain-1-A and Sarcelle powerhouses and Rupert River diversion project. This will provide water power to new turbines at Eastmain-1 or Eastmain-1-A and Sarcelle powerhouses and will provide increased flow at the existing La Grande-1 generating station as well as Robert-Bourassa or La Grande-2-A. Output will be 918 MW.|$|E
50|$|Natural <b>gas</b> <b>distributors</b> were {{required}} to add thiols, originally ethanethiol, to natural gas (which is naturally odorless) after the deadly New London School explosion in New London, Texas, in 1937. Many <b>gas</b> <b>distributors</b> were odorizing <b>gas</b> prior to this event. Most gas odorants utilized currently contain mixtures of mercaptans and sulfides, with t-butyl mercaptan as the main odor constituent in natural gas and ethanethiol in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, propane). In situations where thiols are used in commercial industry, such as liquid petroleum gas tankers and bulk handling systems, an oxidizing catalyst is used to destroy the odor. A copper-based oxidation catalyst neutralizes the volatile thiols and transforms them into inert products.|$|R

500|$|After infiltrating the station's secure wing, Adam discovers {{a massive}} {{detention}} camp {{with hundreds of}} detainees. After talking {{to one of the}} prisoners, Nina Sullivan, and overhearing a conversation between Burke and two of the scientists, Gary Savage and Tiffany Kavanagh, he confirms that innocents are kidnapped across the globe to further the Illuminati research that Jensen is investigating, and that the experiments prove fatal to the majority of subjects. With Burke's spare retinal prosthesis, and Quinn's technical expertise, Adam is able to gain access to a concealed elevator that takes him to a massive undersea research facility. He confronts Kavanagh who, already having misgivings about the inhumane nature of the research, agrees to turn informant. Burke discovers Keitner's mutiny, and she is killed by his soldiers. Burke then initiates [...] "Code Yellow": pumping toxic gas into both the detention camp and the research facility to eliminate any witnesses. Adam can either redirect the gas to save either Kavanagh or the prisoners, find and sabotage the <b>gas</b> <b>distributor</b> to save everyone, or simply do nothing and allow both parties to be killed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of using different benchmarking models to measure and compare the efficiency of Swedish <b>gas</b> <b>distributors.</b> It also discusses to which extent the results of a benchmarking study should influence the revenue-cap which will be implemented in the gas distribution sector in Sweden from year 2011. The discussion is based on arguments from both theory and practical applications of benchmarking. The results suggest that benchmarking Swedish <b>gas</b> <b>distributors</b> against distributors in another country using a parametric model is most favorable, but the reliability will be increased if non-parametric models are used also. Partial and total productivity measures could be used to confirm results of other benchmarking analyses. The input variables could be limited to operating costs, and some environmental variables like customer density or area size should be taken into consideration. From 2011 it would be interesting to measure any change in efficiency stemming from the change to ex-ante regulation. Ideally, the results of the benchmarking analysis should be used as complementary information when setting the revenue-cap, and not as a mechanical instrument...|$|R

40|$|The Portuguese {{natural gas}} sector is still growing, {{with a history}} of less than two decades. Consequently, the impact of {{regulatory}} reform is evidently recent. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the performance of the Portuguese <b>gas</b> <b>distributors</b> in order to define the efficiency targets for the regulatory period, 2010 - 2013. It also conducted further analysis in order to determine the best level of attainable operating costs by deriving the major costs driver of the Portuguese <b>gas</b> <b>distributors.</b> Therefore, the focus was on the deterministic frontier method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) accounting for variable returns to scale (VRS). This technique allowed the computation of X-factors for each firm. The study suffered from data problems since the sector is very recent and the set of comparable companies is small. In order to avoid misspecifications or misinterpretations, firms were divided into three main groups with different scale factors and exogenous factors were also considered.

40|$|A {{theme that}} runs through the long, {{convoluted}} history of natural gas regulation is the seemingly inexorable expansion of government intervention. Regulation has spawned further regulation; soon after one regulatory gap was filled, another appeared. Municipal franchising and price regulation of <b>gas</b> <b>distributors</b> led to state oversight of intrastate gas transmission, which prompted federal regulation of interstate transmission, followed by control of interstate affiliated field prices and later interstate independent field prices. Finally, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) extended federal jurisdiction to all intrastate field sales. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model, including coupled partial differential equations of mass, momentum and charge conservation inside a membrane electrode assembly of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) are developed. The CFD model is solved for PEMFCs with conventional and interdigitated gas flow fields. For the PEMFC with interdigitated flow fields both coflow and counterflow designs are studied. Furthermore a dynamic lumped model based on the formulation of Pukrushpan et al. (2003) is developed {{with the addition of}} membrane’s transient water transport. Models are validated by comparing the polarization curves with the experimental data of Ticianelli et al. (1988) for MEAs with conventional <b>gas</b> <b>distributors</b> and He et al. (2000) for MEAs with counterflow interdigitated <b>gas</b> <b>distributors.</b> The results of the lumped model and the CFD model for conventional design are shown to be comparable and lumped model proves to be a good substitute of CFD model for control studies. For the interdigitated case, coflow is found to be superior to counterflow in the performance of the cell. Transient and steady-state responses of the fuel cell system to changes in cell voltage, air pressure and relative humidity of air are investigated for each design. The effect of transient water transport is emphasized and it is observed that it plays a critical role in the operation of a PEMFC for both designs...|$|R
