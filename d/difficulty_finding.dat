5|$|The First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918 {{was largely}} a failure, the blockships {{grounded}} {{too far from the}} channels to obstruct them.

When they did discover the entrance, German resistance proved too strong for the operation to be completed as originally planned: the obsolete cruiser HMS Vindictive was sunk, but only partially blocked the channel.|$|E

U-862 unsuccessfully attacked the Greek freighter Ilissos off the South Australian coast on 9 December, with bad weather spoiling both the attack and subsequent Australian efforts to locate the submarine.|$|E

5|$|Soon, Granville {{had a full}} {{orchestra}} at his disposal, so {{he convinced}} the management committee {{to allow him to}} give classical concerts on Fridays and Sundays.

5|$|The group {{increasingly}} {{focused on}} the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration.

He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E
