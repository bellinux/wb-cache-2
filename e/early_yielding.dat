Based on the large-scale molecular dynamics simulation and the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the influence from different pre-existing surface defects on the bending properties of Ag nanowires (NWs) is studied in this paper.

Tremors in Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia due to Sumatra and Philippine earthquakes have been reported several times. Engineers are concerned of the seismic vulnerability of public buildings {{due to lack of}} earthquake consideration in Malaysia‟s building design procedure. 8 (eight) reinforced concrete buildings which are mostly categorized as moment resisting frames has been selected for vulnerability study. A case study has been conducted on low rise, medium rise, and high rise buildings. The buildings are analyzed using Finite Element Modeling (FEM) under different types of analyses including Time History Analysis (THA) considering low to medium earthquake intensities. Different intensities of earthquake load, 0. 05 g, 0. 10 g, 0. 15 g and 0. 20 g are applied to the structures to know the maximum allowable earthquake load intensities for the buildings. In the non-linear analysis of modal frames, it indicates that most of the buildings are categorised in the moderate damage level where there is no structural damage but some non-structural damage are expected.

40|$|The microstructure-property {{relationship}} for interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) is currently poorly understood. In {{an attempt to}} improve this understanding this study focused on one particular part of this relationship: the effect of phase shape on the elastic and plastic behaviour. A review of previous research showed that investigations had linked phase shape to the elastic and plastic behaviour of various inclusion reinforced composites, but that no similar work had been completed for IPCs. To study the complex response of the IPC microstructure under load, a numerical modelling analysis using the finite element method (FEM) was undertaken. Two three-dimensional models of IPCs were created, the first consisting of an interconnected spherical phase with the interstitial space forming the other interconnected phase, and the second replacing the spherical phase with an interconnected cylindrical phase. With the simulation of a uniaxial tension test under elastic and plastic conditions, these two models exhibited different responses based on {{the shape of the}} phases. Results from an analysis of the macroscopic behaviour identified that the cylindrical model produced greater effective properties than the spherical model at the same volume fraction. The influence of phase shape was connected to the increased contiguity of the superior phase within the IPC for the cylindrical model, which allowed similar levels of long-range continuity with smaller amounts of the superior phase (compared to the spherical model). An examination of microstructural stress distributions showed that preferential stress transfer occurred along paths of low compliance. This provided an explanation of how the improved contiguity of the stiffer (or stronger) phase could enhance the macroscopic effective properties of an IPC. Contiguity of the stronger phase was particularly important for plastic behaviour, where <b>early</b> <b>yielding</b> of the weaker phase requires the stronger phase to carry nearly all the load within itself...|$|E

Calculation of temperature dependent failure of zirconium, diffusion of hydrogen in zirconium, properties of interfaces in zirconium and zirconium hydride and effect of hydrogen on crack nucleation and propagation were in good agreement with available experimental data. These are the first computer simulations where large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) code was used with the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) to study structure and mechanical properties of zirconium hydrogen system (Zr-H) and zirconium hydride (ZrH 2). Verification of methods was done {{in order to establish}} the best potential for zirconium and zirconium hydride. EAM and MEAM potentials successfully predicted lattice parameters, mechanical properties and variation of lattice parameters with temperature for α-Zr. MEAM potential was used to predict correctly the face centered structure for ZrH 2 and also its mechanical properties. Temperature dependent stress-strain curves were calculated in order to predict yielding point for α-Zr. Results indicate <b>early</b> <b>yielding</b> and failure with increase of temperature in zirconium on application of tensile and compressive strains. Anisotropic stress variation with temperature in α-Zr was calculated. Hydrogen ingress through diffusion of hydrogen in zirconium is a mechanism responsible for formation of hydrides. Temperature-dependent hydrogen diffusion and activation energy for diffusion was calculated and the agreement with experiments was satisfactory. Anisotropy of diffusion of hydrogen is observed for Zr crystal. Hydrogen diffusion was also modeled under tensile and compressive strain and a possible formation of hydrides in the direction perpendicular to applied strain was observed. The effect of strain on orientation of hydride was investigated. Hydride { 111 } oriented crystal was strained along [1 1 ̅ 0] and [111] direction. Energy as a function of strain is calculated along both directions [111] and [1 1 ̅ 0] and it was found that energy of the system increase with increase in strain along [1 1 ̅ 0] and decrease with increase of strain along [111] direction. Calculated stress and strain curves indicate lower stresses along [111] direction and this causing the hydride to reorient in a direction perpendicular to applied strain. Structure of the interface (0 0 0 1) α-Zr // { 1 1 1 } δ-ZrH 2 is modeled in order to investigate the crack initiation at this interface. Interfacial cracking of hydride under stress is observed. This observation is in good agreement with available experimental studies. Cracks are seen to nucleate earlier at higher temperature. Cracks and voids are common defects in zirconium fuel cladding.

40|$|Duplex austenitic/ferritic {{stainless}} steels are increasingly {{used as an}} alternative to conventional austenitic grades. Main advantages of the duplex grades are good resistance to corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue in environments that contain chloride. One drawback of the duplex material is the susceptibility of the ferritic phase to a spinodal decomposition in the temperature range 250 - 500 o C. The decomposition of the ferrite leads to a significant hardening and embrittlement of this phase. This thesis treats the deformation properties of duplex stainless steel and particular attention is paid to the influence of the spinodal decomposition of ferrite. Evaluation of cyclic and monotonic deformation behaviour, fatigue crack growth and low cycle fatigue properties and impact toughness is included. Duplex {{stainless steels}} with different amounts of austenite and ferrite were studied and compared to single-phase austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. By including single-phase materials, understanding of the properties of the duplex stainless steel was facilitated. The monotonic yield stress of the investigated steels clearly deviate from the classic linear law of mixture, a law predicting a linear change in yield stress with increasing ferrite content. The explanation for the deviation is partly {{to be found in the}} presence of internal stresses, allowing <b>early</b> <b>yielding</b> of the duplex grades. A marked anisotropy of the mechanical properties is evident from the tensile tests. Further, annealing at 475 o C that hardens the ferritic phase leaves the austenite unaffected. The results from the tensile tests are discussed in terms of phase and grain distribution, contiguity and load/strain transfer. The influence of grain size and nitrogen content has been studied on two austenitic stainless steels. The grain size dependence of the yield stress was found to obey the well-known Hall-Petch relation. The cyclic yield stress of the investigated steels follow the classic linear law of mixture, i. e. vary linearly with increasing ferrite content. The austenite cyclically softens at low plastic strain amplitudes and hardens at higher. The duplex and ferritic steels show no or only little cyclic hardening/softening. Low cycle fatigue properties of the austenitic single-phase steel and a duplex steel having 25. alfa. / 75. gamma. have been determined. The austenitic grade shows better fatigue properties at high plastic strain amplitudes as compared to the duplex grade. It was found, in conjunction with earlier observations in the literature, that cracks initiated in the ferritic phase of the duplex material at high strains. Near-threshold crack growth properties were investigated, including crack closure measurements and quantitative fractography of the fracture surfaces. The duplex steels exhibit higher effective crack growth threshold levels. DELTA. K th,eff, while the single-phase materials have higher crack closure levels K cl. These results are discussed in terms of phase boundary interaction and fracture surface roughness. The monotonic and cyclic plastic zones accompanying fatigue cracks in austenite and ferrite were measured by stylus profilometry (monotonic zone) and nanoindenter technique (cyclic zone). The measured plastic zone sizes were rationalised by using cyclic stress-strain data of the bulk material and models on strain distribution ahead of a fatigue crack. A duplex grade with 25. alfa. / 75. gamma. showed a technically useful toughness still after 100 hours of annealing at 475 o C. This indicates that a careful choice of the phase balance of duplex stainless steel may allow use at higher temperaturesthan 300 o C...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} compact, {{efficient}} and high performance electronic devices and sensor systems {{has become one}} of the primary driving force for rapid advancement in miniaturization of current technology. However, the attempt to push the limits of component length scales into the nano regime is being challenged by possibly unconventional laws of physics. One of the key design parameters for good performance of any system is its structural stability, defined by the strength of a material. The strength of a material is defined as its resistance to plastic (or permanent) deformation. In conventional metals plastic deformation is carried by the migration of lattice defects such as vacancies and dislocations. The barriers to the motion of these defects provide strength to metals, leading to an inverse power law scaling with inter barrier spacing, l  = Bl q where represents the nominal strength, B is a measure for strengthening capability of barriers and q represents the order of strengthening. The well known Hall Petch relation (q= 0. 5) expresses this effect for grain boundary strengthening, where grain boundaries (GBs) obstruct motion of dislocations during plastic deformation. Extensive research over past few decades has shown that grain size strengthening may be limited by GB mediated deformation processes in nanocrsytalline (nc) metals with grain sizes of ≤ 20 nm. The strength of nanocrsytalline metals saturates, or in some cases decreases, with a reduction in grain size. Molecular dynamic simulations have provided some indication of atomic scale activities that dominate deformation in nc metals. Although it is difficult to experimentally monitor the atomistic processes, in situ mechanical tests in synchrotron facilities have captured some mesoscopic features of deformation in nanocrsytalline metals. For instance, experiments have shown that the typically extended elastic plastic transition during deformation of nanocrsytalline metals could be classified into two regimes. For initial stages of deformation, in the microplastic regime, the width of various diffracting peaks decreases suggesting the dominance of processes leading to structural relaxation. However, at later stages of deformation, in a manner similar to conventional metals, the diffraction peak widths increased signifying the increasing importance of deformation processes that involve an accumulation of defects. It is well known that thermal annealing also causes relaxation of materials and during high temperature deformation continuous relaxation of stress concentrations could retard premature failure of metals. As the ductility in nanocrsytalline metals is limited to 3 - 5 %, with very limited strain hardening, the processes of structural relaxation are very important. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the nature of structural relaxation during microplastic deformation in nanocrystals. It is well known that character of grain boundaries plays an important role in material properties. As the grain boundary area per unit volume varies inversely with grain size, nanocrsytalline metals contain a significant amount of grain boundary area. Moreover, due to small grain sizes, conventional Frank Read sources cannot operate for nucleating dislocations. Dislocations in nc metals are nucleated from GBs, traverse grains and gets absorbed in other GBs. The small volume of grains further restricts dislocation interactions. Thus, dislocation nucleation, propagation and absorption become possible rate controlling mechanisms in nc metals. Molecular dynamic simulations of nanocrsytalline and bicrystalline samples have shown that grain boundary structure could significantly affect these mechanisms. Simulations have shown further that apart from dislocation plasticity other grain boundary mediated process like GB sliding and GB diffusion become important with decreasing grain size. These processes are also influenced by GB character. Thus, it is important to understand the role of GB character in deformation of nc metals. On one hand where the structural need for high strength has encouraged reduction of internal microstructural length scales, miniaturization has also encouraged reduction in external length scale of device components. In modern electronic and sensor devices a typical component size varies from a few hundred microns to few tens of nanometer. Several studies have shown that free surfaces could reduce the constraints on deforming grains. With decreasing sample dimensions, the free surface to volume ratio increases and the internal microstructural length scale may become comparable to the external sample size. An increasing contribution from these two geometrical parameters can introduce external size effects in mechanical properties of materials. In the past, most of the external size effects have been attributed to strain gradient plasticity and deformation source starvation. However, a different external size effect has been observed during uniaxial test of polycrystalline metals where the strength of materials was found to deviate from their bulk values at smaller sample sizes. While most studies have shown a weakening effect, there have also been a few observations of strengthening with a reduction in sample size. In most studies, the external sample size was kept constant and the internal grain size was varied by thermal annealing to produce samples with different external to internal size ratios. As the mechanical properties of metals are sensitive to the internal length scales it is difficult to explicitly follow the external size effect during these experiments. Moreover, compared to internal size effects mechanistic understanding of external size effect is limited, and systematic experimental efforts are required for proper characterization of these effects. The present investigation was undertaken to improve the scientific understanding of internal and external length effects on mechanical properties of nanocrystalline and coarse grained (~ 16 – 140 µm) polycrystalline nickel. For studying the internal size effects free standing nanocrystalline nickel samples with ~ 30 nm grain size and two different textures were synthesized using galvanostatic pulsed electrodeposition technique from Watts and Sulfamate baths. The nanocrsytalline deposits from a Watts bath showed a strong fiber texture (NiS) while deposits from a Sulfamate bath were relatively weak textured (NiW), with s and w representing strong and weak texture, respectively. In situ mechanical tests at the PSI synchrotron facility in Switzerland were used to understand the nature of relaxation processes during thermal annealing and deformation of nc metals. The diffraction peak analysis showed that thermal annealing at 423 K of strong textured deposits caused a significant reduction in root mean square strain with limited grain growth. Furthermore, no residual strains developed, suggesting a homogenous distribution of relaxation processes during thermal annealing. In contrast, during deformation, structural relaxation was highly biased due to dislocation activities. The grains contributing to diffraction peak transverse to loading axis showed <b>early</b> <b>yielding</b> and faster relaxation during deformation. The inhomogeneous nature of deformation was also reflected in development of transverse tensile residual stresses in the grains. These experiments showed that relaxation processes during thermal annealing and deformation differ in their respective length scales. Nanocrsytalline deposits with two different textures were also deformed under synchrotron to access the role of GB character. As direct quantification of GB character distribution is difficult in nc metals, texture was taken as a qualitative representative for GB character. Previous studies have shown that the fraction of low angle boundaries increases with increasing sharpness of texture in fiber textured materials. Thus, the two textured deposits represented materials with two different low angle GB fractions. In situ tests showed that during the initial stages of microplastic deformation dislocation mechanisms were favored in strongly textured NiS. The transversely oriented grains showed <b>early</b> <b>yielding,</b> which caused a redistribution of stress among other grain families. However, for weakly textured NiW deposits, smaller length scale atomic activities preceded dislocation activities. All the grains supported larger elastic strains at lower stresses suggesting significant plastic activity at GB regions. At higher stresses transversely oriented grains yielded plastically and transferred elastic loads to grains. Thus, the nature of plastic deformation was observed to depend on the distribution of GB character. For understanding the external size effects on mechanical properties polycrystalline nickel samples with grain sizes of 16, 51 and 140 µm were tested uniaxially at various sample thicknesses. Three different deformation regimes were identified based on the thickness of the samples. At higher thicknesses, in regime I, no significant variation of flow strength was observed. Flow strengths in regime II, at intermediate thicknesses, showed a strengthening effect with a reduction in thickness. However at lower thicknesses in regime III, a weakening trend was observed with decreasing thickness. The cross over from strengthening to weakening was observed to depend on grain size and applied strain. Detailed microstructural analysis with electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) imaging showed that intragranular lattice rotation increases with a reduction in sample thickness. As lattice rotations may be considered to be accommodated by geometrically necessary dislocations, a semi empirical phenomenological model based on strain gradient plasticity was developed to understand the mechanics of external size effect during uniaxial test of polycrystalline samples. Further application of the model to the present experimental results showed that the characteristic length for strain gradient decreased with increasing grain size and applied strain...|$|E

40|$|Current seismic design {{practice}} promotes inelastic {{response in}} order to reduce the design forces. By allowing the structure to yield while increasing the ductility of the structure, the global forces can be kept within the limited bounds dictated by the yield strength. However, during severe earthquakes, the structures undergo significant inelastic deformations leading to stiffness and strength degradation, increased interstory drifts, and damage with residual drift. The research presented in this thesis has three components that seek to address these challenges. To prevent the inelastic effects observed in yielding systems, a new concept “apparent weakening” is proposed and verified through shake table studies in this thesis. “Apparent weakening” is introduced in the structural system using a complementary “adaptive negative stiffness device” (NSD) that mimics "yielding” of the global system thus attracting it away from the main structural system. Unlike the concept of weakening and damping, where the main structural system strength is reduced, the new system does not alter the original structural system, but produces effects compatible with an <b>early</b> <b>yielding.</b> Response reduction using NSD is achieved in a two step sequence. First the NSD, which is capable of exhibiting nonlinear elastic stiffness, is developed based on the properties of the structure. This NSD is added to the structure resulting in reduction of the stiffness of the structure and NSD assembly or “apparent weakening”-thereby resulting in the reduction of the base shear of the assembly. Then a passive damper, designed for the assembly to reduce the displacements that are caused due to the “apparent weakening”, is added to the structure-thereby reducing the base shear, acceleration and displacement in a two step process. The primary focus of this thesis is to analyze and experimentally verify the response reduction attributes of NSD in (a) elastic structural systems (b) yielding systems and (3) multistory structures. Experimental studies on 1 : 3 scale three-story frame structure have confirmed that consistent reductions in displacements, accelerations and base shear can be achieved in an elastic structure and bilinear inelastic structure by adding the NSD and viscous fluid damper. It has also been demonstrated that the stiffening in NSD will prevent the structure from collapsing. Analogous to the inelastic design, the acceleration and base shear and deformation of the structure and NSD assembly can be reduced by more than 20 % for moderate ground motions and the collapse of structure can be prevented for severe ground motions. Simulation studies have been carried on an inelastic multistoried shear building to demonstrate the effectiveness of placing NSDs and dampers at multiple locations along the height of the building; referred to as “distributed isolation”. The results reported in this study have demonstrated that by placing a NSD in a particular story the superstructure above that story can be isolated from the effects of ground motion. Since the NSDs in the bottom floors will undergo large deformations, a generalized scheme to incorporate NSDs with different force deformation behavior in each storey is proposed. The properties of NSD are varied to minimize the localized inter-story deformation and distribute it evenly along the height of the building. Additionally, two semi-active approaches have also been proposed to improve the performance of NSD in yielding structures and also adapt to varying structure properties in real time. The second component of this thesis deals with development of a novel device to control the response of structural system using adaptive length pendulum smart tuned mass damper (ALP-STMD). A mechanism to achieve the variable pendulum length is developed using shape memory alloy wire actuator. ALP-STMD acts as a vibration absorber and since the length is tuned to match the instantaneous frequency, using a STFT algorithm, all the vibrations pertaining to the dominant frequency are absorbed. ALP-STMD is capable of absorbing all the energy pertaining to the tuned-frequency of the system; the performance is experimentally verified for forced vibration (stationary and non-stationary) and free vibration. The third component of this thesis covers the development of an adaptive control algorithm to compensate hysteresis in hysteretic systems. Hysteretic system with variable stiffness hysteresis is represented as a quasi-linear parameter varying (LPV) system and a gain scheduled controller is designed for the quasi-LPV system using linear matrix inequalities approach. Designed controller is scheduled based on two parameters: linear time-varying stiffness (slow varying parameter) and the stiffness of friction hysteresis (fast varying parameter). The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical studies by comparing the proposed controller with fixed robust H∞ controller. Superior tracking performance of the LPV-GS over the robust H∞ controller in different displacement ranges and various stiffness switching cases is clearly evident from the results presented in this thesis. The LPV-GS controller is capable of adapting to the parameter changes and is effective over the entire range of parameter variations...|$|E
40|$|Based on the AFM-bending experiments, a {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) bending simulation model is established which could accurately {{account for the}} full spectrum of the mechanical properties of NWs in a double clamped beam configuration, ranging from elasticity to plasticity and failure. It is found that, loading rate exerts significant influence to the mechanical behaviours of nanowires (NWs). Specifically, a loading rate lower than 10 m/s is found reasonable for a homogonous bending deformation. Both loading rate and potential between the tip and the NW are found {{to play an important role}} in the adhesive phenomenon. The force versus displacement (F-d) curve from MD simulation is highly consistent in shapes with that from experiments. Symmetrical F-d curves during loading and unloading processes are observed, which reveal the linear-elastic and non-elastic bending deformation of NWs. The typical bending induced tensile-compressive features are observed. Meanwhile, the simulation results are excellently fitted by the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with axial effect. It is concluded that, axial tensile force becomes crucial in bending deformation when the beam size is down to nanoscale for double clamped NWs. In addition, we find shorter NWs will have an <b>earlier</b> <b>yielding</b> and a larger yielding force. Mechanical properties (Young’s modulus & yield strength) obtained from both bending and tensile deformations are found comparable with each other. Specifically, the modulus is essentially similar under these two loading methods, while the yield strength during bending is observed larger than that during tension...|$|R

(Agdas- 3, Agdas- 6, Agdas- 7, Agdas- 17) and Gossypium barbadense L. (Agdas- 21) according to randomized block design with four replications. Maras- 92 and Sayar- 314 (G. hirsutum L.) which are local standard varieties were used as standard varieties. According to four year`s results, Agdas- 3, Agdas- 7, Agdas- 17 and Agdas- 21 of the mutant varieties have germinated 2 days earlier than standard varieties. Also, the mutant varieties have opened bolls 3 - 6 days earlier than standards. Furthermore, Agdas- 3, 6, 7 and 17 were the <b>earliest</b> <b>yielding</b> varieties with 83, 82, 83, 84 % of first harvest ratio respectively. Also even though Agdas- 21 belongs to G. barbadense L. it yielded at the same time with Maras- 92 (81 %) and earlier than Sayar- 314 (78 %) and it opened its bolls almost at the same time with standards. Moreover, it was determined that Agdas- 7 (3314 kg ha 1) and Agdas- 17 (3491 kg ha 1) were better than standard varieties from the seed cotton yield point, while Agdas- 21 showed better characteristics for fiber length (33. 31 mm), fineness (4. 16 micronaire) and strength (34. 42 g tex 1) compared to standard varieties. As a result, Agdas- 7 and Agdas- 17 due to their earliness and higher seed cotton yield and in spite of its lower yield Agdas- 21 due to its earliness and superior fiber quality were found promising for this region...|$|R
