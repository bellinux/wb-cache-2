5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo probe, which entered orbit on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys {{of all the}} Galilean moons and Amalthea. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994, giving a unique vantage point for the event. Its originally <b>designed</b> <b>capacity</b> was limited by the failed deployment of its high-gain radio antenna, although extensive information was still gained about the Jovian system from Galileo.|$|E
25|$|Bangkok {{is one of}} Asia's busiest air {{transport}} hubs. Two commercial airports serve the city, the older Don Mueang International Airport and the new Bangkok International Airport, commonly known as Suvarnabhumi. Suvarnabhumi, which replaced Don Mueang as Bangkok's main airport at its opening in 2006, served 52,808,013 passengers in 2015, making it the world's 20th busiest airport by passenger volume. This amount of traffic is already over its <b>designed</b> <b>capacity</b> of 45 million passengers. Don Mueang reopened for domestic flights in 2007, and resumed international services focusing on low-cost carriers in October 2012. Suvarnabhumi is undergoing expansion to increase its capacity to 60 million by 2019 and to 90 million by 2021.|$|E

The airport was officially inaugurated on 18 May 2008 with the first flight from Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport, then from Hồ Chí Minh City on 1 July 2009. As of September 2009, the only airliner operating here is Vietnam Airlines with the destinations of Hanoi and Hồ Chí Minh City.

40|$|International audienceThe {{goal of this}} {{conceptual}} {{paper is}} to develop enhanced understandings of mathematics teacher <b>design</b> and <b>design</b> <b>capacity</b> when interacting with digital curriculum resources. We argue that digital resources in particular oﬀer incentives and increasing opportunities for mathematics teachers’ design, both individually and in collectives. Indeed they require increased design expertise because of {{the changing nature of}} the resources. Drawing on the literature we suggest ten questions providing a tool to study teacher design processes; and (2) we propose three components for exploring teacher <b>design</b> <b>capacity.</b> Building on two main theoretical areas (i. e. teaching as design; documentational approach to didactics) we propose to deepen understandings of the notions of “teacher design” and “teacher design capacity”. Drawing on two diﬀerent collective environments and two individual teacher cases working within these environments, we investigate and illustrate teachers’ design processes and <b>design</b> <b>capacity</b> building across a range of contexts and curriculum formations, with the focus on how digital resources can help to develop teacher <b>design</b> <b>capacity.</b> We claim that the evolutions of digital resources in particular require an elaboration and reﬁnement of the concept of teacher <b>design</b> <b>capacity,</b> which we develop and illustrate. Indeed, interacting with digital resources, it is claimed, might be a fruitful vehicle for developing teachers’ <b>design</b> <b>capacity,</b> in particular when working in collectives...|$|R
25|$|The {{growth of}} Hong Kong also put {{a strain on}} the airport's capacity. Its usage was close to, and for some time exceeded, the <b>{{designed}}</b> <b>capacity.</b> The airport was designed to handle 24 million passengers per year, but in 1996, Kai Tak handled 29.5 million passengers, plus 1.56 million tonnes of freight, making it the third busiest airport {{in the world in}} terms of international passenger traffic, and busiest in terms of international cargo throughput. Moreover, clearance requirements for aircraft takeoffs and landings made it necessary to limit the height of buildings that could be built in Kowloon. While Kai Tak was initially located far away from residential areas, the expansion of both residential areas and the airport resulted in Kai Tak being close to residential areas. This caused serious noise pollution for nearby residents and put height restrictions, which were removed after Kai Tak closed. A night curfew from midnight to about 6:30 in the early morning also hindered operations.|$|E
500|$|State {{and federal}} {{agencies}} {{are in the process}} of replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River. The original Tappan Zee bridge, carrying the concurrency of New York State Thruway, I-87, and I-287, is a cantilever bridge built during 1952–55. The bridge is [...] long and spans the Hudson at its second-widest point. The deteriorating current structure bears an average of 138,000vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its <b>designed</b> <b>capacity.</b> During its first decade, the bridge carried fewer than 40,000vehicles per day. Part of the justification for replacing the bridge stems from its construction immediately following the Korean War on a low budget of only $81 million. Unlike other major bridges in metropolitan New York, the Tappan Zee was designed to last only 50years. The Federal Highway Administration issued a report in October 2011 designating the Tappan Zee's replacement to be a dual-span twin bridge.|$|E

The Smallpox Hospital, designed by James Renwick, Jr., opened in 1856, and two years later, the Asylum burned down and was rebuilt on the same site; Penitentiary Hospital was destroyed in the same fire. In 1861, prisoners completed construction of Renwick's City Hospital (renamed Charity Hospital in 1870), which served both prisoners and New York City's poorer population. In 1872, the Blackwell Island Light, a [...] Gothic style lighthouse later added to the National Register of Historic Places, was built by convict labor on the island's northern tip under Renwick's supervision. Seventeen years later, in 1889, the Chapel of the Good Shepherd, designed by Frederick Clarke Withers, opened.
