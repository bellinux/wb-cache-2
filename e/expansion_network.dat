This formulation of discrete network dynamics has properties that {{are similar to those of}} a quantum field theory of bosons, which allows reuse of many conceptual and theoretical structures from QFT. The equilibrium behaviour of one of these generalised MRFs and of the adaptive cluster <b>expansion</b> <b>network</b> (ACEnet) are shown to be equivalent, which provides a way of unifying these two theories.

30|$|Most of the {{existing}} literatures relating to the outage model only focus on the steady state of the equipment; namely, the state probability of the equipment is constant and does not change with time. This kind of models is applicable to the long time scale (usually several years or longer) problems, such as the reliability analysis, capacity <b>expansion,</b> <b>network</b> planning and so on, in which the steady value of the state probability of power equipment is accurate enough. But {{in the short term}} problems (usually several weeks or months), the use of steady outage model may bring significant error, which will be explained in the next section. However, there are few literatures concerning about the special features of the outage model used in the short term problems.|$|E

Quantitative indicators of <b>network</b> <b>expansion</b> and efficiency provide a partial and inconclusive picture. Instead, an evolutionary property rights framework is favored. Examined in detail are the institutional environments that lead to particular types of property rights which in turn affect <b>network</b> <b>expansion</b> and efficiency.

MethodsPhylogeographic analysis was carried at 9 out of 12 sites of An. minimus confirmed malaria endemic places. ResultsAll sequences were Adenine-Thymine rich regions. Transitions were observed in 6 sequences where 5 mutations were synonymous substitutions and in 1 case non synonymous mutation was observed. Three distinct clusters of haplotypes were generated. Haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity were studied.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the claim that}} competition between the Bell system and independent telephone companies, and not AT&T's regulated monopoly, {{was responsible for the}} rapid growth in telephone penetration in the United States. A mathematical model is developed to test if competition contributed to network expansion, when alternative explanations such as diffusion and economic growth are also taken into account. The model is estimated with time series data on telephone penetration in the US from 1876 to 1982, using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS). The results indicate that local exchange competition is indeed a significant influence on increase in telephone penetration, even {{in the early stages of}} network development. This has clear policy implications for the current transition to competition in developing countries. Network <b>expansion</b> <b>Network</b> development Privatisation Local exchange competion...|$|E

The minimum number of quantization levels and the minimum sample rate were derived for a digital voice channel. A sample rate of 6000 samples per second and lowpass filters with a 3 db cutoff of 2400 Hz are required for 100 percent sentence intelligibility. Consonant sounds are the first speech components to be degraded by quantization noise. A compression amplifier can be used to increase the weighting of the consonant sound amplitudes in the analog-to-digital converter. An <b>expansion</b> <b>network</b> must be installed at the output of the digital-to-analog converter to restore the original weighting of the consonant sounds.

40|$|Abstract Background Miniature inverted-repeat transposable {{elements}} (MITEs) are {{widespread in}} plants and animals. Although silkworm (Bombyx mori) {{has a large}} amount of and a variety of transposable elements, the genome-wide information of the silkworm MITEs is unknown. Results We used structure-based and homology approaches to search for MITEs in the silkworm genome. We identified 17 MITE families with a total of 5785 members, accounting for ~ 0. 4 % of the genome. 7 of 17 MITE families are completely novel based on the nucleotide composition of target site duplication (TSD) and/or terminal inverted repeats (TIR). Silkworm MITEs were widely and nonrandom distributed in the genome. One family named BmMITE- 2 might experience a recent burst <b>expansion.</b> <b>Network</b> and diversity analyses for each family revealed different diversification patterns of the silkworm MITEs, reflecting the signatures of genome-shocks that silkworm experienced. Most silkworm MITEs preferentially inserted into or near genes and BmMITE- 11 that encodes a germline-restricted small RNA might silence its the closest genes in silkworm ovary through a small RNA pathway. Conclusions Silkworm harbors 17 MITE families. The silkworm MITEs preferred to reside in or near genes and one MITE might be involved in gene silence. Our results emphasize the exceptional role of MITEs in transcriptional regulation of genes and have general implications to understand interaction between MITEs and their host genome. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Transmission <b>network</b> <b>expansion</b> {{planning}} (TNEP) is a {{basic part}} of power system planning that determines where, when and how many new transmission lines should {{be added to the}} network. Up till now, various methods have been presented to solve the static transmission <b>network</b> <b>expansion</b> planning (STNEP) problem. But in all of these methods, transmission <b>expansion</b> planning considering <b>network</b> adequacy restriction has not been investigated. Thus, in this paper, STNEP problem is being studied considering network adequacy restriction using discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm. The goal of this paper is obtaining a configuration for <b>network</b> <b>expansion</b> with lowest expansion cost and a specific adequacy. The proposed idea has been tested on the Garvers network and compared with the decimal codification genetic algorithm (DCGA). The results show that the network will possess maximum efficiency economically. Also, it is shown that precision and convergence speed of the proposed DPSO based method for the solution of the STNEP problem is more than DCGA approach.

A multi-period model is formulated that combines network topology design and capacity expansion. The ability to determine <b>network</b> <b>expansion</b> schedules {{of this type}} becomes increasingly important to the telecommunications industry and to its customers. The solution technique consists of a Genetic Algorithm that allows generating several network alternatives for each time period simultaneously and shortest-path techniques to deduce from these alternatives a least-cost <b>network</b> <b>expansion</b> plan over all time periods. The multi-period planning approach is illustrated on a realistic network example.
