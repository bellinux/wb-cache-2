5000|$|Verbenone is {{also used}} to manage {{mountain}} pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestations. Verbenone is recognized by the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, a notable <b>forest</b> <b>insect</b> capable of causing extensive levels of tree mortality in western North America. Several formulations of verbenone have been registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [...] for tree protection. Failures in tree protection efficacy can be seen in situations where there is an excessive population of infesting insects, for example an area which contains more than 50 percent infested trees. Loss of response to verbenone as a repellent is not due to any particular failure of the verbenone devices but is instead a response innate to the biology of the beetles which allows populations to continue flourishing even in situations of extreme environmental stress.|$|E
50|$|A.D. Hopkins, {{commonly}} referred to as the father of forest entomology in the United States, formulated the record-keeping system that now bears his name. Hopkins brought his system to the federal government when he came to work for the Division of Entomology in the late 1890s, by which time he had already been using his record keeping system at West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, where he previously worked. Hopkins then brought the system to the USDA Division of Entomology in 1902. It was subsequently adopted by personnel of <b>Forest</b> <b>Insect</b> Investigations at field stations throughout the country. The System contains U.S. in its name to distinguish it from those earlier Hopkins records at West Virginia University. The Hopkins U.S. System became widely used by Forest Service Research, by other pest management units, and also by ARS-SEL. The it was in continuous use until the mid-1980s.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the paper}} titled [...] "Exploring Forest Management Practices Using an Agent-Based Model of <b>Forest</b> <b>Insect</b> Infestations", an {{agent-based}} model {{was developed to}} simulate attack behavior of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, (MPB) in order to evaluate how different harvesting policies influence spatial characteristics of the forest and spatial propagation of the MPB infestation over time. [...] About two-thirds {{of the land in}} British Columbia, Canada is covered by forests that are constantly being modified by natural disturbances such as fire, disease, and insect infestation. Forest resources make up approximately 15% of the province’s economy, so infestations caused by insects such as the MPB can have significant impacts on the economy. The MPB outbreaks are considered a major natural disturbance that can result in widespread mortality of the lodgepole pine tree, one of the most abundant commercial tree species in British Columbia. Insect outbreaks have resulted in the death of trees over areas of several thousand square kilometers.|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Delmar Hopkins (August 20, 1857 [...] - [...] September 22, 1948) was an American {{entomologist}} of {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Though self-taught, his scientific understanding of forest entomology was exceptional. He received an honorary doctorate from West Virginia University and in 1902 {{he went to work}} for the US Department of Agriculture. He was subsequently named head of the newly created Division of <b>Forest</b> <b>Insect</b> Investigations. He became a specialist in the bark beetle family Scolytidae, especially the genus Dendroctonus, species of which are the most destructive insects in coniferous forests of North America. His taxonomic monographs on these beetles are classics. He proposed the Law of Bioclimatics and he also developed the Hopkins Notes and Records System, a system he brought into the federal government when he first came to work for the Division of Entomology in the late 1890s. Hopkins’ research is one of the cornerstones of entomology on the North American continent and he is often referred to as the “father of North American forest entomology.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Some limited {{silvicultural}} {{control of}} the disease is possible. If bark blisters are found on branches over 10-15 cm from the bole, those branches may be pruned off, which will {{stop the spread of}} the disease to the rest of that tree. If the main trunk is affected then no control is possible, and the tree will die once the infection encircles the tree. Infected trees are often identified by [...] "flagging", when all the needles on a branch turn brown and die. Infections often occur on low branches close to the ground on young trees, so pruning of white pine can also be effective in multiple ways, as it improves the quality of timber by creating more knot-free timber, and reduces the likelihood of infection from the blister rust to a small extent. Another form of control practiced in some areas is to diligently remove Ribes plants from any area near white pines. Because the infection moves from currant plants, to pines, and back again, it cannot continue to exist without its alternate host. Although effective in theory, removal of currants is rarely successful in practice, as they readily re-grow from small pieces of root left in the soil, and the seeds are very widely spread in birds' droppings. According to the Southwest Oregon <b>Forest</b> <b>Insect</b> and Disease Service Center, white pine blister rust attacks all five needle pines.
