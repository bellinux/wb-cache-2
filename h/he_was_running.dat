5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out of money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Shumlin {{announced}} in December 2013 that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for re-election {{to a third}} term in office, but {{said that he would}} not begin campaigning until after Labor Day 2014, just two months before the election. He faced one opponent in the Democratic primary on August 26: lifelong Republican and Washington, D.C. resident H. Brooke Paige, who simultaneously ran against Democratic incumbent William Sorrell in the Democratic primary election for Vermont Attorney General. Paige was also unsuccessful in that effort, losing by 80% to 20%.|$|E
5|$|Yonekura {{and his men}} {{had reached}} Kaiapit after an {{exhausting}} night march. Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern {{was not to be}} caught in the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A torrent of fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Goebel {{was again}} {{selected}} as an All-Pro {{player with the}} Tigers, playing in ten games, making two touchdown receptions, and returning a fumble for a touchdown. In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924. While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved {{in one of the}} oddest plays in NFL history. Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> the wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Jean Cocteau, who greatly {{admired the}} film, insisted on Tiefland being {{shown at the}} Cannes Film Festival, which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> that year. In 1960, Riefenstahl {{attempted}} to prevent filmmaker Erwin Leiser from juxtaposing scenes from Triumph des Willens with footage from concentration camps in his film Mein Kampf. Riefenstahl had high hopes for a collaboration with Cocteau called Friedrich und Voltaire ("Friedrich and Voltaire"), wherein Cocteau was to play two roles. They thought the film might symbolize the love-hate relationship between Germany and France. Cocteau's illness and 1963 death {{put an end to}} the project. A musical remake of Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") with an English production company also fell apart.|$|E

5|$|Texas {{was stopped}} {{on their first}} drive due to an {{unsuccessful}} fourth down conversion. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's Michael Huff intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended {{the lead in the}} secondquarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the thirdquarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourthtouchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> and bounced right back up into his hands. Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch {{maintained}} a 1.4 second lead over Kurt Busch by the 249th lap. Three laps later, Keselowski {{drove out of}} his garage to rejoin the race. By lap 262, drivers reported their cars were sliding in the corners as their tires became worn. Green flag pit stops began on lap 265; Kyle Busch maintained the lead {{at the end of}} the cycle, ahead of Reutimann and Kenseth. On the 290th lap, Kurt Busch's crew reported to him that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> two laps short of fuel. Six laps later, Kyle Busch started to slow in the corners to conserve fuel. On the 298th lap, Martin dropped one position to run fifth. By the 302nd lap, overall speeds had dropped due to drivers starting to conserve fuel. Green flag pit stops began on lap 311, as Truex made a stop for fuel. Kyle Busch elected not to make a pit stop and increased his lead to four seconds by lap 314. Eight laps later, Kyle Busch was told by his team to reduce his speed. On lap 330, Kyle Busch drove to pit road, having run out of fuel, handing the lead to Kurt Busch. One lap later, Ambrose ran out of fuel, as Kurt Busch held the lead to win his second race of the 2009 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Kenseth in third, Martin in fourth, and Harvick in fifth. Stewart, Bowyer, Biffle, Burton and A. J. Allmendinger rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E

5|$|The writing team {{included}} Nakazawa, {{who wrote}} You's route and the Kid's common route; Nakazawa's assistant Kitaro Sasanari, who wrote Tsugumi and Sora's routes; Nobuaki Umeda; and Uchikoshi, who wrote Coco's route. The writing process for all routes were supervised by Uchikoshi, {{in an effort}} to eliminate inconsistencies in the setting or characters, and plot holes between the different parts of the story. Because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out of time at the end, he had to rush the writing of the end of Coco's route, which he described as possibly his only regret with the game. Nakazawa wrote his parts in between his directorial work, such as writing specification documents, supervising the production, and doing quality control work; {{due to the lack of}} time, he ended up having to stay overnight at KID everyday and work through the night, something he said was only possible because of how young he was at the time. Nakazawa described himself as working particularly hard on the game because he felt bitter that Never 7 had not sold particularly well.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E
