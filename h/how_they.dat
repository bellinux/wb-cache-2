5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; <b>how</b> <b>they</b> change over time; and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the nature and}} effects of collaboration in a dynamic information environment using a System Dynamics Model. We model two analysts who are attempting to acquire knowledge.

Our findings indicate a rationale for collaboration under conditions of high operational tempo. However, we also find reasons not to collaborate under other conditions. We point out connections between the rationales under our model and the behavior of real social systems...|$|R
