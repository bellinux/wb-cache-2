40|$|A {{relatively}} simple method is proposed for multiplying together the two voltage pulses corresponding to E and dE/dx for a charged particle and for gating a {{pulse height analyzer}} to record only those E pulses whose E dE/dx product is equal to some preselected value. To form the product, the amplitude-to-time conversion in the multi-channel analyzer handling the E pulse is further exploited. The time analogue of the E pulse is obtained from the analyzer and {{is fed to a}} separate circuit to be combined with the dE/dx pulse to form a pulse whose height is proportional to the product of E and dE/dx. The product pulse is then sorted by a single channel analyzer, in time to allow an <b>inhibiting</b> <b>pulse</b> to be fed back into the multi-channel analyzer if the product pulse is not of the desired value.

40|$|GNRH NEURONS PLAY {{a central}} role in the complex {{feedback}} relationships within the hypothalamohypophyseal-ovarian axis that ensure normal ovarian function (1, 2). Two distinct modes of GnRH secretion occur during the ovarian cycle: 1) the preovulatory GnRH surge that drives the LH surge responsible for ovulation and 2) basal, or tonic, GnRH secretion that occurs episodically throughout follicular and luteal phases. The preovulatory GnRH surge is induced by elevated estradiol (1, 2), whereas tonic GnRH secretion is controlled by the negative feedback actions of estradiol and progesterone (1 – 3). Specifically, progesterone <b>inhibits</b> GnRH <b>pulse</b> frequency (2 – 5) so that slowfrequency pulses are observed during the luteal phase (2, 6, 7), whereas estradiol <b>inhibits</b> GnRH <b>pulse</b> amplitude (8, 9) so that high-frequency, low-amplitude pulses occur in the follicular phase (2, 6, 7). It is now generally accepted that the inhibitory actions of endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs) play an important role in the control of GnRH secretion.

40|$|In ewes {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) synergistically regulate pulsatile lutein-izing hormone (LH) secretion. E primarily <b>inhibits</b> LH <b>pulse</b> amplitude and P <b>inhibits</b> LH <b>pulse</b> frequency. To determine if endogenous opioid pep tides (EOP) mediate these negative feedback effects, we administered the long-acting opioid antagonist WIN 44, 441 - 3 (WIN) to intact ewes during the luteal and follicular {{phases of the}} estrous cycle and to ovariectomized ewes treated with no steroids, E, P, or E plus P. Steroid levels were main-tained at levels seen during the estrous cycle by Silastic implants placed shortly after surgery. WIN increased LH pulse frequency, but not amplitude, in luteal phase ewes. In contrast, during the follicular phase, LH pulse amplitude was increased by W 1 N and pulse frequency was unchanged. Neither LH pulse frequency nor pulse amplitude was affected by WIN in long-term ovariectomized ewes untreated with steroids. In contrast, WIN slightly increased LHpulse frequency in short-term ovariectomized ewes. WIN also increased LHpulse frequency in ovariectomized ewes treated with P or F plus P. WIN did not affect pulse frequency but did increase LHpulse amplitude in E-treated ewes.

To address these constraints, we present here a simple approach for selective activation of prefrontal excitatory neurons in both in vitro and in vivo preparations. Rat prelimbic pyramidal neurons were genetically targeted to express a light-­activated nonselective cation channel, channelrhodopsin-­ 2, or a light-­driven inward chloride pump, halorhodopsin, which enabled them to be rapidly and reversibly activated or <b>inhibited</b> by <b>pulses</b> of light.

40|$|Precise {{control of}} pulsatile GnRH and LH release is {{imperative}} to ovarian cyclicity but is vulnerable to environmental perturbations, like stress. In sheep, a sustained (29 h) increase in plasma cortisol to a level observed during stress profoundly reduces GnRH pulse frequency in ovariectomized ewes treated with ovarian steroids, whereas shorter infusion (6 h) is ineffective {{in the absence of}} ovarian hormones. This study first determined whether the ovarian steroid milieu or duration of exposure is the relevant factor in determining whether cortisol reduces LH pulse frequency. Prolonged (29 h) cortisol infusion did not lower LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized ewes deprived of ovarian hormones, but it did so in ovariectomized ewes treated with estradiol and progesterone to create an artificial estrous cycle, implicating ovarian steroids as the critical factor. Importantly, this effect of cortisol was more pronounced after the simulated preovulatory estradiol rise of the artificial follicular phase. The second experiment examined which component of the ovarian steroid milieu enables cortisol to reduce LH pulse frequency in the artificial follicular phase: prior exposure to progesterone in the luteal phase, low early follicular phase estradiol levels, or the preovulatory estradiol rise. Basal estradiol enabled cortisol to decrease LH pulse frequency, but the response was potentiated by the estradiol rise. These findings lead to the conclusion that ovarian steroids, particularly estradiol, enable cortisol to <b>inhibit</b> LH <b>pulse</b> frequency. Moreover, the results provide new insight into the means by which gonadal steroids, and possibly reproductive status, modulate neuroendocrine responses to stress...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} led to the {{hypothesis}} that kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neurons in the arcuate nucleus {{play a key role in}} GnRH pulse generation, with kisspeptin driving GnRH release and neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin acting as start and stop signals, respectively. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by determining the actions, if any, of four neurotransmitters found in KNDy neurons (kisspeptin, NKB, dynorphin, and glutamate) on episodic LH secretion using local administration of agonists and antagonists to receptors for these transmitters in ovariectomized ewes. We also obtained evidence that GnRH-containing afferents contact KNDy neurons, so we tested the role of two components of these afferents: GnRH and orphanin-FQ. Microimplants of a Kiss 1 r antagonist briefly <b>inhibited</b> LH <b>pulses</b> and microinjections of 2 nmol of this antagonist produced a modest transitory decrease in LH pulse frequency. An antagonist to the NKB receptor also decreased LH pulse frequency, whereas NKB and an antagonist to the receptor for dynorphin both increased pulse frequency. In contrast, antagonists toGnRHreceptors, orphanin-FQ receptors, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor had no effect on episodic LH secretion. Wethus conclude that the KNDy neuropeptides act in the arcuate nucleus to control episodic GnRH secretion in the ewe, but afferent input from GnRH neurons to this area does not. These data support the proposed roles forNKBand dynorphin within theKNDyneural network and raise the possibility that kisspeptin contributes to the control ofGnRHpulse frequency in addition to its established role as an output signal from KNDy neurons that drives GnRH pulses.

Activation of nonmuscle myosin II (Myo-II) by kinases such as Rho-associated kinase (Rok) {{is important to}} generate contractile force during apical constriction. Cycles of Myo-II assembly and disassembly, or pulses, are associated with apical constriction during Drosophila melanogaster gastrulation. It is not understood whether Myo-II phosphoregulation organizes contractile pulses or whether pulses are important for tissue morphogenesis. Here, we show that Myo-II pulses are associated with pulses of apical Rok. Mutants that mimic Myo-II light chain phosphorylation or depletion of myosin phosphatase <b>inhibit</b> Myo-II contractile <b>pulses,</b> disrupting both actomyosin coalescence into apical foci and cycles of Myo-II assembly/disassembly. Thus, coupling dynamic Myo-II phosphorylation to upstream signals organizes contractile Myo-II pulses in both space and time.

These mutants fail to maintain intercellular actomyosin network connections during tissue invagination, suggesting that Myo-II pulses are required for tissue integrity during morphogenesis.

40|$|Summary. During the i. v. {{infusion}} of a depilatory dose (100 =m/kgbodyweight) of mouse {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) into ovariectomized Merino ewes the frequency of pulsatile LH release was significantly reduced. However, the amplitude of pulses of LH secretion, either those naturally occurring or those induced by LHRH injection, was unchanged or only slightly reduced. Similar infusions of mouse EGF were made in progestagen-treated anoestrous Merino ewes in which LH secretion was maintained by injections of LHRH. These ewes did not experience oestrus or ovulate in response to PMSG injected 1 day after mouse EGF treatment (2 days before progestagen withdrawal); both responses occurred in controls. The EGF-treated ewes experienced oestrus and ovulated following progestagen=m- 6 weeks later. These results suggest that (1) mouse EGF <b>inhibits</b> the hypothalamic <b>pulse</b> generator responsible for LH release in the ewe but has little if any effect on pituitary sensitivity to LHRH; and (2) mouse EGF apparently has a direct effect on the ovaries, temporarily impairing their ability to ovulate in response to exogenous gonadotrophin...|$|R

Antibiotic treatment for 2 h also decreased initiation synchrony in that the proportion of multiunit autoradiograms on which neighboring units showed similar replication patterns (indicating temporally coordinated initiation) was reduced by one-half.

We {{have studied the}} mechanism underlying the effect of acidosis {{on one of the}} K+ channels, Kv 1. 4 (heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes), known to underlie ito. At pH 6. 5, wild-type Kv 1. 4 current was <b>inhibited</b> during repetitive <b>pulsing,</b> in part {{as a result of a}} slowing of recovery from N-type inactivation. Acidosis still caused slowing of recovery after deletion of just one (either the first or second) of the N-terminal inactivation ball domains. However, deletion of both the N-terminal inactivation ball domains greatly reduced the inhibition. As well as the N-terminus, other parts of the channel are also required for the effect of acidosis, because, whereas the transfer of the N-terminus of Kv 1. 4 to Kv 1. 2 conferred N-type inactivation, it did not confer acidosis sensitivity. Replacement of an extracellular histidine with a glutamine residue (H 508 Q) abolished the slowing of recovery by acidosis. Reduction of C-type inactivation by raising the bathing K+ concentration or by the mutation K 532 Y also abolished the slowing. It is concluded that binding of protons to H 508 enhances C-type inactivation and this causes a slowing of recovery from N-type inactivation and, thus, an inhibition of current during repetitive pulsing...|$|R
40|$|During the {{transition}} from exponential to stationary phase E. coli produces a substantial quantity of the small, aromatic signalling molecule indole. In LB medium the supernatant indole concentration reaches a maximum of 0. 5 - 1 mM. At this concentration indole has been implicated in many processes inducing acid resistance and the modulation of virulence. It has recently been shown that cell-associated indole transiently reaches a very high concentration (approx. 60 mM) during stationary phase entry, presumably because indole is being produced more rapidly than it can leave the cell. It is proposed that this indole <b>pulse</b> <b>inhibits</b> growth and cell division, causing the culture to enter stationary phase before nutrients are completely exhausted, with benefits for survival in long-term stationary phase. This study asks how E. coli cells rapidly upregulate indole production during stationary phase entry and why the indole pulse has a duration of only 10 - 15 min. We find that {{at the start of}} the pulse tryptophanase synthesis is triggered by glucose depletion and that this is correlates with the up-regulation of indole synthesis.

The variable-gamma model with appropriate summed feedback was most accurate for describing encoding behavior of both cell types. The leaky integrator model, while useful for determining summed feedback parameters, was inadequate to account for underlying mechanisms of encoder activity. For the stretch receptor, two summed feedback processes were detected: one had a short time constant; the other, a long one. Appropriate tests indicated that the short time constant effect was from an electrogenic sodium pump, and the same is presumed for the long time constant summed feedback. Both feedbacks show seasonal and/or species variations. Short hyperpolarizing <b>pulses</b> <b>inhibited</b> the feedback from the long time constant process.

Glucose, mannose, and fructose, which are transported with high affinity by the same transport system as is xylose, inhibited xylose conversion by 99, 77, and 78 %, respectively, reflecting competitive inhibition of xylose transport.

The xylitol yields on the different cosubstrates varied widely. Galactose gave the highest xylitol yield, 5. 6 times higher than that for glucose. The difference in redox metabolism of glucose and galactose was suggested to enhance the availability of reduced cofactors for xylose reduction with galactose.

A specific inhibitor of the endosomal protease cathepsin B, Cbz-Phe-Ala-CHN 2, blocks the presentation of both CA and OVA, whereas this inhibitor has no effect on the presentation of a processing-independent OVA peptide. Furthermore, the presentation of insulin, an antigen that needs processing but no proteolytic cleavage, is enhanced when cathepsin B is <b>inhibited</b> during antigen <b>pulsing.</b> When the APC were treated with an inhibitor of acid proteases, the CA response was not affected, while the presentation of OVA was diminished under these conditions.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study is performed {{to understand and}} show the potential of high-speed, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon using oxygen inhibitor pulses {{as a replacement for}} hydro-fluorocarbons (HFCs). This process might be considered the 'holy grail' in DRIE as the environmental restrictions for the use of HFCs are becoming increasingly stronger. When compared to the usual cryogenic mixed oxygen DRIE and with respect to profile control, the proposed cryogenic pulsed oxygen DRIE is virtually independent of silicon loading, mask material and trench width, and it is less prone to the formation of black silicon (BS). Some indication is found that one of the major causes for the formation of BS is the existence of dust inside the plasma. Dust is created when oxygen and silicon tetra fluoride (SiF 4 being the reaction product of silicon etching) coincide inside the plasma glow. This occurs in mixed oxygen plasma; the silica dust falls onto the wafer where it starts to form BS when directional etching is requested. Dust particles can also form when strong polymerizing gases are fed into the plasma. This is the case for the Bosch process using HFC pulses forming carbonic dust. The particles, and consequently the BS, are observed to be limited when the SiF 4 and O 2 gases are time separated, which forms the basis of the proposed pulsed oxygen DRIE. Another advantage of pulsed oxygen DRIE with respect to Bosch processing is that the protective skin of the sidewall during etching—a kind of native oxide—is believed to be self-terminating. This makes the process insensitive to profile variations caused by parameter fluctuations. It is found that <b>inhibiting</b> oxygen <b>pulses</b> give excellent results with respect to profile control at cryogenic temperatures (between − 120 and − 80 °C) and can still compete with HFC pulses up to intermediate low temperatures (between − 80 and − 40 °C). When selecting the proper DRIE conditions, the oxygen pulsed mode performs with excellent profile verticality and selectivity while keeping the silicon clean. It also shows a high etch rate up to 25 µm min− 1 (< 1 % Si load of a 100 mm wafer). When the temperature is raised further (between − 40 and 0 °C), the strength of the oxygen sidewall protection progressively fails and more oxygen with more bias is needed to keep sufficient profile directionality. The use of stronger oxide-forming agents is suggested in order to enable good performance at the more convenient, higher temperature, low bias conditions...|$|R

This study aimed {{to assess the}} susceptibility of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis to the acute physical stress of exercise in untrained, physically inactive women. The acute effects of submaximal endurance exercise upon the pulsatile LH secretion in the follicular phase were compared with those accompanying leisurely strolling for a similar time period. SUBJECTS All subjects were eumenorrhoelc, as determined by biphasic temperature patterns, detection of the urinary LH surge, and mid-luteal serum progesterone levels. Subjects were not physically active and had little history of strenuous exercise (V o 2 max = 38 · 0 ± 1 · 8) (mean ± SEM) ml/kg/min). DESIGN All women completed a 13 · 5 -hour pulsatility test which included three consecutive 20 -minute runs on a treadmill at 50, 60 and 70 % of the subjects’maximum oxygen uptake (n = 16). Six of these same subjects completed a separate test on another occasion in which one hour of leisurely strolling was substituted for exercise. Blood was sampled every 10 minutes via an indwelling cannula for 4 · 5 hours before and 8 hours after one hour of exercise and or strolling.

Nearly 50, 000 neurostimulators are implanted worldwide annually. The {{most common type of}} implantable neurostimulators is indicated for pain relief. At the same time, commercial use of other electromagnetic technologies is expanding, making electromagnetic interference (EMI) of neurostimulator function an issue of concern. Typically reported sources of neurostimulator EMI include security systems, metal detectors and wireless equipment. When near such sources, patients with implanted neurostimulators have reported adverse events such as shock, pain, and increased stimulation. In recent in vitro studies, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been shown to <b>inhibit</b> the stimulation <b>pulse</b> of an implantable neurostimulator system during low frequency exposure at close distances. This could potentially be due to induced electrical currents inside the implantable neurostimulator leads that are caused by magnetic field coupling from the low frequency identification system. Methods To systematically address the concerns posed by EMI, we developed a test platform to assess the interference from coupled magnetic fields on implantable neurostimulator systems. To measure interference, we recorded the output of one implantable neurostimulator, programmed for best therapy threshold settings, when in close proximity to an operating low frequency RFID emitter. The output contained electrical potentials from the neurostimulator system and those induced by EMI from the RFID emitter. We also recorded the output of the same neurostimulator system programmed for best therapy threshold settings without RFID interference. Using the Spatially Extended Nonlinear Node (SENN) model, we compared threshold factors of spinal cord fiber excitation for both recorded outputs. Results The electric current induced by low frequency RFID emitter was not significant to have a noticeable effect on electrical stimulation. Conclusions We demonstrated a method for analyzing effects of coupled magnetic field interference on implantable neurostimulator system and its electrodes which could be used by device manufacturers during the design and testing phases of the development process. </p...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{the number of}} implantable neurostimulator systems {{implanted}} in patients has been rapidly growing. Nearly 50, 000 neurostimulators are implanted worldwide annually. The {{most common type of}} implantable neurostimulators is indicated for pain relief. At the same time, commercial use of other electromagnetic technologies is expanding, making electromagnetic interference neurostimulator function an issue of concern. The susceptibility of six active implantable neurostimulators with lead systems to an electromagnetic field generated by 22 radio frequency identification emitters was investigated. It was found that one implantable neurostimulation system was <b>inhibiting</b> the stimulation <b>pulse</b> during low frequency exposure at close distances. To systematically address the concerns posed by EMI, a test platform was developed to assess the interference from coupled magnetic fields on implantable neurostimulator systems. The lifetime of any active neurostimulator system heavily depends on its battery. Current technology has been able to provide solutions to power up such devices for up to five years. In fact, the latest research in this area showed that, on average, batteries last only three years. When an implantable battery needs to be replaced, a surgical procedure is required during this process. In addition, the current available implantable batteries contain potentially hazardous materials to human bodies and if leaked could cause potentially lethal complications. A system was developed that demonstrates a proof of concept based on cascaded concentration cells that can currently deliver 2 µW of power, capable of powering small scale implantable devices. Ideally, the system could replace or charge an existing battery based on concentration differences that already exist within the human body. The system has several advantages over the current implantable batteries and other proposed technologies. The most important advantage is the use of flexible, biocompatible materials. The system does not use toxic or nuclear materials and does not depend on energy sources outside of the human body or body movement. It does not heat body tissue, or require a cosmetic disadvantage. It makes use of renewable energy sources within the human body...|$|R
40|$|Many {{plant species}} adapted to P-impoverished soils, {{including}} jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), develop toxicity symptoms {{when exposed to}} high doses of phosphate (Pi) and its analogs such as phosphite (Phi) and arsenate (AsV). The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of fungal symbionts Scutellospora calospora, Scleroderma sp., and Austroboletus occidentalis on the response of jarrah to highly toxic pulses (1. 5 mmol kg− 1 soil) of Pi, Phi, and AsV. S. calospora formed an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis while both Scleroderma sp. and A. occidentalis established a non-colonizing symbiosis with jarrah plants. All these interactions significantly improved jarrah growth and Pi uptake under P-limiting conditions. The AM fungal colonization naturally declines in AM-eucalypt symbioses after 2 – 3 months; however, in the present study, the high Pi <b>pulse</b> <b>inhibited</b> the decline of AM fungal colonization in jarrah. Four weeks after exposure to the Pi pulse, plants inoculated with S. calospora had significantly lower toxicity symptoms compared to non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants, and all fungal treatments induced tolerance against Phi toxicity in jarrah. However, no tolerance was observed for AsV-treated plants even though all inoculated plants had significantly lower shoot As concentrations than the NM plants. The transcript profile of five jarrah high-affinity phosphate transporter (PHT 1 family) genes in roots was not altered in response {{to any of the}} fungal species tested. Interestingly, plants exposed to high Pi supplies for 1 day did not have reduced transcript levels for any of the five PHT 1 genes in roots, and transcript abundance of four PHT 1 genes actually increased. It is therefore suggested that jarrah, and perhaps other P-sensitive perennial species, respond positively to Pi available in the soil solution through increasing rather than decreasing the expression of selected PHT 1 genes. Furthermore, Scleroderma sp. can be considered as a fungus with dual functional capacity capable of forming both ectomycorrhizal and non-colonizing associations, where both pathways are always accompanied by evident growth and nutritional benefits...|$|R
