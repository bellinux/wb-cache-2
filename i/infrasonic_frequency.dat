The bias voltage dependence of the noise shows structure which is associated with resonances in the RF embedding circuit. Surprisingly, we find that changes in the high-frequency (100 GHz) impedance presented to the junction can dramatically affect the magnitude and voltage dependence of the low-frequency (1. 5 GHz) noise.

The bias current is supplied to the input node by two diode-connected FETs.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{results of the}} tribo-acoustic control in the integrity of real time of nominally stationary friction joints under conditions of fretting are presented. Violation of the integrity due to the wear of tribofrictions are securely fixed both by the general change in the acoustogram shape of the operating noise, and by the spectrum of noise – the emergence of strong mid-range modes of the contact gap. The emergence of two oppositely directed wave energy cascades in the fretting regimes has been noted: a direct cascade from the mod pumping {{in the direction of}} high frequencies and the reverse – toward the low <b>infrasonic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The first one is related to microplastic deformations in the zones of actual contact, the second one is related to dynamic pointing the slow angular motions in the system of friction.

40|$|This work is {{centered}} on low-frequency and high-frequency multiphysics problems of piezoelectric structures submerged in a quiescent fluid domain for the applications of vibration energy harvesting, biomimetic actuation, and contactless acoustic energy transfer. In {{the first part of}} this research, Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) -based piezoelectric structures are employed for underwater mechanical base excitation and electrical biomimetic actuation in bending mode at low frequencies (the fundamental underwater bending resonance being in the <b>infrasonic</b> <b>frequency</b> range). The MFC technology (fiber-based piezoelectric composites with interdigitated electrodes) exploits the effective 33 -mode of piezoelectricity, and strikes a balance between structural deformation and force levels for actuation to use in underwater locomotion, in addition to offering high power density for energy harvesting to enable battery-less aquatic sensors. Following in-air electroelastic composite model development, the fundamental research problem is to establish semi-analytical models that can predict the underwater dynamics of thin MFC cantilevers for different length-to-width aspect ratios. In-air analytical electroelastic dynamics of MFCs is therefore coupled with added mass and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping effects of fluid to describe the underwater electrohydroelastic dynamics in harvesting and actuation. To this end, passive plates of different aspect ratios are tested to extract and explore the repeatability of the inertia and drag coefficients in Morison’s equation. The focus is placed on the first two bending modes in this semi-empirical approach. In particular, electrode segmentation is studied for performance enhancement in the second bending mode. Additionally, nonlinear dependence of the output power density to aspect ratio is characterized theoretically and experimentally in the underwater base excitation problem. In the second part of this work, Ultrasonic Acoustic Energy Transfer via piezoelectric transduction is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Contactless energy transfer using acoustic excitation offers larger distances of power transmission as compared to well-studied inductive method. Various transmitter configurations (e. g. spherical, cylindrical, and focused) are explored for energy transfer to a piezoelectric receiver bar (operating in the longitudinal/thickness mode) that is shunted to a generalized resistive-reactive circuit. Fixed-free and free-free mechanical boundary conditions of the receiver are explored in detail. The resulting multiphysics analytical model framework is compared with finite-element simulations and experiments conducted in fluid (water and oil). Optimal piezoelectric receiver material and electrical loading conditions are sought for performance and bandwidth enhancement. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|Two qualitatively {{different}} kinds of resonant destabilization of phonon stimulated emission (SE) are experimentally revealed for periodically forced multimode ruby phaser (phonon laser) operating at SE frequencies about 9 GHz, i. e. at microwave acoustic wavelengths of 1 micron. The inversion state of Cromium(3 +) spin-system in ruby was created by electromagnetic pump at 23 GHz. Under deep modulation of pump power at low frequencies OMEGA_m = 70 - 200 Hz deterministic chaotic reconfigurations of the acoustic microwave power spectra (AMPS) were observed. This range of SE destabilization corresponds to the relaxational resonance that {{is well known for}} optical class-B lasers. Outside the relaxational resonance range, namely at ultra-low (<b>infrasonic)</b> <b>frequencies</b> OMEGA_m about 10 Hz, the other type of resonant destabilization of stationary phonon SE was observed by us for the first time. This new nonlinear resonance (we call it lambda-resonance) manifests itself as very slow and periodically repeated self-reconfigurations of AMPS. Near the vertex of lambda-resonance the period of AMPS self-reconfigurations takes giant values of several hours (at T= 1. 8 K). The second type of SE resonant destabilization is explained in terms of antiphase energy exchange between acoustic SE modes in a modulated phaser.

40|$|The sensory system {{initiating}} C-response {{and electric}} organ discharge (EOD) {{response in the}} hearing specialist elephantnose fish was studied in an experimental swing chamber set-up. The swing chamber is specially designed for producing controlled low frequency acoustic stimulus waveforms. The waveforms studied in the experiments were single cycle sinusoids of initial acoustic pressure and particle acceleration in the frequency range 10 Hz to 30 Hz, and mimicked key components in the acoustic signature of charging predatory fish attacks. The aim {{of the study was}} to reveal how initial acoustic pressure and particle acceleration trigger the inner ear sensory system in elephantnose fish to produce acoustic EOD- and C-responses. Acoustic startle behaviour was found to be optimally triggered by a combination of acoustic particle acceleration and compression, and very rarely by the same level of acoustic particle acceleration and rarefaction. Startle behaviours were highly directional, and this was ascribed to inner ear detection and coding of the direction of the initial particle acceleration. In the centre of the test chamber, acoustic startle behaviours were triggered by the particle acceleration component alone, but at significantly lower probability than when combined with compression. Startle behaviours observed in response to the low frequency stimuli greatly extended the known audible hearing range in elephantnose fish. Contrary to general opinion within the field of fish hearing, it was shown that acoustic pressure sensitivity is of behavioural relevance at very low sonic and <b>infrasonic</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The results of the study support the view that acute acoustic pressure sensitivity evolved independently several times in fish as adaptations to perform differentiated and more adaptable escapes from striking predatory attacks. EOD-responses were produced by the acoustic stimuli, and were significantly stronger to compression stimuli than to rarefaction stimuli. Why elephantnose fish emit a strong burst of EODs during acoustic startle behaviour is unclear, but may perhaps be as a distraction of electro-sensitive predators...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Many {{signals of}} {{interest}} in structural engineering, for example seismic activity, lie in the <b>infrasonic</b> range (<b>frequency</b> less than 20 Hz). This poses a significant challenge for developing batteryless sensors that are required not only to monitor rare infrasonic events but also to harvest the energy for sensing, computation and storage from the signal being monitored. In this paper, we show that a linear injection response of our previously reported piezo-floating-gate sensor is ideal for self-powered sensing and computation of infrasonic signals. Our experimental results demonstrate that the sensor fabricated in a 0. 5 µm CMOS technology can compute and record level crossing statistics of an input seismic event. Collected data are in good agreement with results obtained using a standard data acquisition system. Also, the sensor consumes less than 100 nA of current, which makes its operation based on infrasonic power-harvesting feasible. I...|$|R
