5|$|In 1902 an American {{newspaper}} {{published the}} allegation that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance, and {{that he may have}} been identified as a visitor, he contrived to bring the Prince to the house on an innocent pretext {{in the hope that the}} police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E
25|$|Llywelyn {{was born}} about 1173, {{the son of}} Iorwerth ap Owain and the {{grandson}} of Owain Gwynedd, who had been ruler of Gwynedd {{until his death in}} 1170. Llywelyn was a descendant of the senior line of Rhodri Mawr and therefore a member of the princely house of Gwynedd. He was probably born at Dolwyddelan, though not in the present Dolwyddelan castle, which was built by Llywelyn himself. He may have been born in the old castle which occupied a rocky knoll on the valley floor. Little is known about his father, Iorwerth Drwyndwn, who died when Llywelyn was an infant. There is no record of Iorwerth having taken part in the power struggle between some of Owain Gwynedd's other sons following Owain's death, although he was the eldest surviving son. There is a tradition that he was disabled or disfigured <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> excluded him from power.|$|E
500|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that the doctrine descends from Roman law. The Corpus Juris Civilis mentions a process that redirected money collected to celebrate a person's life <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> violated law to a purpose within the law. It also gives a similar justification: [...] "t would be unjust that the amount which [...] has destined to that end should revert to the heirs. Therefore, let ... an investigation be made to ascertain how the trust may be employed so that the memory of the deceased may be preserved in some other and lawful manner." [...] The Byzantine Empire used a system similar to cy-près when dealing with piae causae, charitable corporations, whereby if the corporation fell its possessions were to be transferred to the Papal treasury and spent on a purpose {{as close as possible to}} that of the original corporation.|$|E

2500|$|Back at the school, Dr. Harris {{successfully}} {{removes the}} harness from Mike's son, {{with the help}} of Anne, Dai and Lourdes. [...] Harris explains that he figured out why children always died in previous attempts to remove the harnesses: [...] they synthesize some sort of drug into the body, stimulating the brain's nerve receptors <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> facilitates mind-control. [...] Whatever this drug is, suddenly being separated from it made children die of shock. [...] Harris theorized that while they didn't know exactly what the drug was, it must have vaguely similar effects as other drugs that stimulate the cognitive centers of the brain, such as morphine. [...] Injecting a child with a large dose of morphine before removing the harness would serve as a [...] "bridge" [...] to safely transition off of the alien drug without fatally shocking the brain, after which the child could be incrementally weaned off the morphine. [...] Using this procedure, Harris and Anne are able to successfully cut the harness off Mike's son without killing him. [...] However, Harris says {{that it is impossible to}} remove the tips of the needles that have fused into the child's spine: [...] the points of the needles seem to be some sort of nanotechnology that grows into the spine the longer it is present.|$|E

5000|$|Philip K. Dick {{wrote the}} {{character}} Deckard {{as a human}} in the original novel. The film differs from the book <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> provide ambiguity on the issue.

50|$|Karina Fabian has had {{an eclectic}} writing career; one people might think is laden with contradictions. She has written devotionals as well as satirical horror. Her {{characters}} include spacefaring nuns and bisexual actors, {{all of whom are}} quite comfortable with themselves. She enjoys adding established religion and faith in her fantasy and science fiction—in fact, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> sets her apart from other writers of the genre.|$|R
50|$|While in {{the first}} case problem is {{primarily}} in the destruction of valuable scientific data, in case of the technical, the architectural, and somewhat less often, historical objects problem is that a radically restored items just simulate the original appearance of the object, and so <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> objects can be considered even as, more or less successful fakes, which only superficially simulate long-lost or never existing state of object.|$|R

5000|$|... 21 June 2005: Damon Albarn, who {{recently}} criticised Live 8 {{for the lack}} of African artists, is now reportedly happy about Live 8 now that they have addressed his criticism.

500|$|Unlike Eragon, Brisingr {{features}} multiple {{points of}} view. Parts {{of the book}} are written in Saphira's perspective {{for the first time}} in the series.
