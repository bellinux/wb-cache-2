50|$|She was {{the oldest}} {{daughter}} of the paramount general Gao <b>Huan.</b> <b>Gao</b> Huan had overthrown the Erzhu clan (members of the clan of Erzhu Rong who had overthrown Emperor Xiaozhuang after Emperor Xiaozhuang killed Erzhu Rong in 530) in 532 and removed Emperor Jiemin, making Emperor Xiaowu emperor instead. Around the new year 533, Emperor Xiaowu married her as his empress.|$|E
50|$|Around the {{new year}} 531, the general Gedouling Bufan (紇豆陵布番), who had been loyal to Emperor Xiaozhuang, {{attacked}} Erzhu Zhao from the north, and after scoring victories over him, approached Jinyang. Erzhu Zhao was fearful, and sought aid from Gao <b>Huan.</b> <b>Gao</b> agreed to help him, and together they defeated and killed Gedouling. In light of this joint victory, Erzhu Zhao and Gao swore to be brothers, and he, trusting Gao's faithfulness, gave {{the remnants of the}} rebel Ge Rong (葛榮), largely ethnic Xianbei, to Gao—a decision that he would regret later.|$|E
50|$|Emperor Xiaowu, however, {{strained}} to free himself from Gao Huan, {{and their relationship}} soon deteriorated, as Emperor Xiaowu entered into alliances with the independent generals Yuwen Tai, who controlled the western provinces, and Heba Sheng (賀拔勝), who controlled the southern provinces, against Gao Huan. In 534, when Emperor Xiaowu secretly prepared to attack Gao <b>Huan,</b> <b>Gao</b> Huan saw through his façade, and marched on Luoyang. Emperor Xiaowu fled to Yuwen Tai's territory, without taking Empress Gao with him. Gao Huan declared Yuan Shanjian, the son of Emperor Xiaowu's cousin Yuan Dan (元亶) the Prince of Qinghe emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), and Northern Wei was divided in two, Eastern Wei under Emperor Xiaojing and Western Wei under Emperor Xiaowu.|$|E
50|$|In winter 557, believing prophecies that <b>Gao</b> <b>Huàn</b> {{would be}} emperor, he ordered <b>Gao</b> <b>Huàn</b> arrested. <b>Gao</b> <b>Huàn</b> tried to resist, but was {{nevertheless}} captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (高浚) {{the prince of}} Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.|$|R
50|$|Of Han Chinese {{background}} who was Xianbeified, he {{was raised}} in Huaishuozhen while his family came from Bohai prefecture in Hebei. He became Xianbeified since his clan was raised in Inner Mongolia after being relocated from what is modern Hebei (Bohai) where his Han Chinese ancestors lived. Honorary Bohai descent was bestowed upon Gao Longshi by <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan.</b> Bohai was asserted as the ancestral home of <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> by <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 547, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> died, and <b>Gao</b> Cheng {{took over}} full {{power of the}} government.|$|R
50|$|In 525, when large {{portions}} of Northern Wei territory was overrun by agrarian rebels, Gao Huan, taking his family (then apparently made up of Lady Lou, Gao Cheng, and their oldest daughter), joined the rebellion {{of one of the}} major rebels, Du Luozhou (杜洛周), but subsequently became unimpressed with Du's behavior, and they fled from Du's camp and joined another rebel leader, Ge Rong (葛榮), but he eventually left Ge as well and joined the army of the Northern Wei general and Xiongnu tribal leader Erzhu Rong. Erzhu was initially unimpressed with Gao and did not give him great responsibilities; it was around this time that the family's wealth was so drained that Lady Lou herself made boots personally out of horse skin. Eventually, though, Gao's talent impressed Erzhu, and he became one of Erzhu's key commanders in his campaigns, first to seize power at Luoyang in 528, then on his campaign to destroy the rebels and reunify the empire. Lady Lou's brother Lou Zhao (婁昭) eventually became a key commander under Gao <b>Huan.</b> <b>Gao</b> Huan was said to also often consult Lady Lou herself for her views on important decisions.|$|E
50|$|Gao Cheng {{was born}} in 521, when his father Gao Huan was still a courier of {{documents}} between the Northern Wei capital Luoyang and the old capital Pingcheng (平城, in modern Datong, Shanxi). His mother Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy family, but Gao Huan's own household was poor. In 525, the ambitious Gao Huan joined the agrarian rebellion led by Du Luozhou (杜洛周), but subsequently became convinced that Du was not a successful leader, and sought to flee from Du's camp with his associates Wei Jing (尉景), Duan Rong (段榮), and Cai Jun (蔡雋). (Wei and Duan were also his brothers-in-law.) Lady Lou and her children (Gao Cheng and a daughter) fled as well, riding a cow. During this flight, Gao Cheng repeatedly fell off the cow, and Gao Huan considered killing him with an arrow, but Duan repeatedly saved him. The next known incident involving Gao Cheng was in 531, when Gao, then a Northern Wei general, rebelled against the members of Erzhu Rong's clan (who had dominated the political scene after they defeated Emperor Xiaozhuang in revenge of Emperor Xiaozhuang's killing of Erzhu Rong), and when an agrarian rebel leader, Gao Aocao (高敖曹), a very distant relative of Gao Huan's, refused to follow Gao <b>Huan,</b> <b>Gao</b> Huan sent Gao Cheng to visit Gao Aocao and showing respect due a granduncle, persuading Gao Aocao of Gao Huan's sincerity.|$|E
5000|$|Erzhu {{dominated}} the imperial court thereafter, the emperor held power {{in name only}} and most decisions actually went through the Erzhu. The emperor did stop most of the rebellions, largely reunifying the Northern Wei state. However, Emperor Xiaozhuang, not wishing to remain a puppet emperor and highly wary of the Erzhu clan's widespread power and questionable loyalty and intentions towards the throne (after all, this man had ordered a massacre of the court and put to death a previous emperor and empress before), killed Erzhu Rong in 530 in an ambush at the palace, {{which led to a}} resumption of civil war, initially between Erzhu's clan and Emperor Xiaozhuang, and then, after their victory over Emperor Xiaozhuang in 531, between the Erzhu clan and those who resisted their rule. In the aftermath of these wars, two generals set in motion the actions that would result in the splitting of the Northern Wei into the Eastern and Western Wei. General Gao Huan was originally from the northern frontier, one of many soldiers who had surrendered to Erzhu, who eventually became one of the Erzhu clan's top lieutenants. But later, Gao Huan gathered his own men from both Han and non-Han troops, to turn against the Erzhu clan, entering and taking the capital Luoyang in 532. Confident in his success, he set up a nominee emperor on the Luoyang throne and continued his campaigns abroad. The emperor, however, together with the military head of Luoyang, Husi Chun, began to plot against Gao <b>Huan.</b> <b>Gao</b> Huan succeeded, however, in keeping control of Luoyang, and the unfaithful ruler and a handful of followers fled west, to the region ruled by the powerful warlord Yuwen Tai. Gao Huan then announced his decision to move the Luoyang court to his capital city of Ye. [...] "Within three days of the decree, 400,000 families--perhaps 2,000,000 people--had to leave their homes in and around the capital to move to Yeh as autumn turned to winter." [...] There now existed two rival claimants to the Northern Wei throne, leading to the state's division in 534-535 into the Eastern Wei and Western Wei.|$|E
50|$|In fall 545, {{due to an}} {{alliance}} between Western Wei and Rouran to attack Eastern Wei, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> sued for peace with Rouran by requesting a marriage between a daughter of Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiulü Anagui and Gao Cheng. Yujiulü Anagui refused, stating that {{it would only be}} sufficient if <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> himself married her. <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> himself initially refused, but Princess Lou, Gao Cheng, and the general Wei Jing all persuaded him otherwise, and he married Yujiulü Anagui's daughter, referring to her as the Princess Ruru (蠕蠕公主). To facilitate this marriage, Princess Lou moved out of the mansion (and in gratitude, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> himself knelt down to Princess Lou to thank her), but <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> and Princess Lou were not formally divorced, although, at Princess Lou's own request (arguing that the Princess Ruru would realize what was happening), <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> did not visit her.|$|R
50|$|Also {{in spring}} 536, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan,</b> at <b>Gao</b> Cheng's request, made Gao Cheng the Eastern Wei prime minister, {{despite the fact}} that Gao Cheng was only 14 at this point. Gao Cheng was sent to Yecheng, and he took over actual reign of the Eastern Wei {{imperial}} government.|$|R
50|$|An {{incident}} involving Gao Cheng soon {{threatened to}} undermine {{not only his}} position as Gao Huan's heir apparent but Princess Lou. In 535, Gao Cheng was discovered to have {{had an affair with}} Gao Huan's concubine Zheng Dache (鄭大車). <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> was so angry that he caned Gao Cheng 100 times and put him under house arrest, and also refused to see Princess Lou. At that time, his favorite concubine was Erzhu Rong's daughter and Emperor Xiaozhuang's former empress Erzhu Ying'e, whose son Gao You (高浟) he now considered making heir apparent to replace Gao Cheng. Only at the intercession of Gao Huan's friend Sima Ziru (司馬子如) -- who first reminded <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> Princess Lou's contributions to his success, as well as Lou Zhao's, and then forced the main witness to the affair, Lady Zheng's servant girl, to commit suicide—were Gao Cheng and Princess Lou able to remain in their positions. Still, Princess Lou and Gao Cheng submitted themselves to humiliating apologies to <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan,</b> where they knelt at each step as they approached <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> after <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> went to see them. After the incident, however, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> appeared to continue to honor Princess Lou and turn to her for advice. For example, in 537, in the aftermaths of Gao Huan's defeat against Yuwen Tai at Shawan (沙苑, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), the general Hou Jing suggested making an ambush against Yuwen's own camp; it was Princess Lou who advised <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> against such action, noting that if Hou actually captured Yuwen, Hou would never return.|$|R
50|$|In fall 546, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> {{launched}} {{another major}} attack on Western Wei, apparently {{to make one}} final attempt to destroy it. He put Yubi under siege, intending to attract Western Wei forces to Yubi in order to destroy it, but Western Wei did not respond. The general in charge of defending Yubi, Wei Xiaokuan, however, defended against all kinds of siege tactics that <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> tried, for 50 days, and Eastern Wei forces suffered 70,000 deaths from the battle and the illnesses. <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> himself was physically and emotionally drained, and he became ill, and {{he was forced to}} withdraw. Western Wei subsequently declared that Wei had killed <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> with a powerful crossbow, and <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan,</b> in order to dispel the rumor, appeared before his army to sing Chile songs with Hulü Jin. As he did, he wept bitterly.|$|R
50|$|In fall 545, {{due to an}} {{alliance}} between Western Wei and Rouran to attack Eastern Wei, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> sued for peace with Rouran by requesting a marriage between a daughter of Yujiulü Anagui and Gao Cheng.

50|$|In late 546, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> became seriously ill, and {{he summoned}} Gao Cheng back to Jinyang to entrust the matters to him. At that time, Gao Cheng was {{apprehensive}} {{that the general}} Hou Jing, who commanded the provinces south of the Yellow River, would rebel, and <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> left him list of officials that he could trust, and specifically instructed him to make Murong Shaozong (慕容紹宗) {{the commander of the}} army against Hou if Hou rebelled. <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> died in spring 547, but Gao Cheng, also pursuant to Gao Huan's instructions, did not announce Gao Huan's death in public; rather, he returned to Yecheng, pretending that <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> was still alive.|$|R
50|$|In spring 537, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> {{launched}} a major attack three-pronged on Western Wei, commanded {{by himself and}} his key generals Dou Tai (竇泰) and Gao Aocao (高敖曹), intending to draw Yuwen's troops to himself while having Dou advance deep into Western Wei territory. Yuwen, pretending {{to be ready to}} abandon Chang'an to withdraw to modern eastern Gansu, instead {{launched a}} surprise attack on Dou's troops, slaughtering most of them. Dou committed suicide. <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> and <b>Gao</b> Aocao were forced to withdraw. In counterattacks, Western Wei took modern western Henan and southwestern Shanxi.|$|R

50|$|In 536, the 15-year-old Gao Cheng, who {{was then}} with his father at his {{military}} headquarters of Jinyang, requested permission to become {{in charge of the}} Eastern Wei imperial government at Yecheng. <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> initially refused, but Gao Huan's assistant Sun Qian (孫搴) spoke on Gao Cheng's behalf, and finally <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> agreed. <b>Gao</b> Cheng soon arrived at Yecheng and took over the imperial administration. He became known as a harsh but capable enforcer of laws, in comparison to his father's policy of relaxed enforcement. He also abolished the seniority-based system of promotion that had caused the imperial administration to stagnate, seeking out capable individuals and promoting them quickly.|$|R
5000|$|Gao Zhan {{was born}} in 537, as the fourth of six sons of Eastern Wei's {{paramount}} general <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> and his wife Lou Zhaojun (and Gao Huan's ninth son overall). In 544, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan,</b> {{in order to try}} to form an alliance with Rouran, took, as a wife for Gao Zhan, a daughter of Rouran's Khan Yujiulü Anluochen, who carried the title of Princess Linhe.

After the deaths of <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> and <b>Gao</b> Zhan's oldest brother Gao Cheng, another brother Gao Yang became regent, and in 550, he had Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan.

5000|$|In 544, Gao Cheng, {{wanting to}} place a trusted {{official}} to keep watch on Emperor Xiaojing, made his associate Cui Jishu (崔季舒) Emperor Xiaojing's secretary.

Hulü Guang was probably Hulü Jin's oldest son, and in his youth, he was known for his fighting prowess, including horseriding and archery. Once, when accompanying Hulü Jin on a campaign against Western Wei, Hulü Guang hit Yuwen's secretary Mozhe Hui (莫者暉) with an arrow, leading to Mozhe's capture by Eastern Wei troops. <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> was pleased and made him a general.

50|$|In spring 537, <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> and his generals Dou Tai (竇泰) and Gao Aocao (高敖曹) {{launched}} a major attack on Western Wei. Yuwen, correctly judging that <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> {{was trying to}} draw Yuwen toward him while allowing Dou to penetrate Western Wei defenses, {{announced that he was}} going to lead a withdraw to modern eastern Gansu but instead made a surprise attack on Dou's army at Xiaoguan (小關, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), crushing Dou's forces. Dou committed suicide in shame. <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> and <b>Gao</b> Aocao were forced to withdraw. In fall 537, Yuwen led an attack on Eastern Wei and captured Hengnong (恆農, in modern Sanmenxia as well). With Western Wei's capital region Guanzhong suffering from a famine, Yuwen remained in Hengnong to collect food from the area, but then heard that <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> was again launching another attack from the northeast, forcing him to return to the Guanzhong region. The forces engaged at Shawan (沙苑, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), after Gao rejected advice from his general Hulü Qiangju (斛律羌舉) to directly attack the Western Wei capital Chang'an. Despite Eastern Wei's numerical superiority, Yuwen's forces crushed Gao's forces, and Gao was forced to withdraw. In winter 537, the Western Wei general Dugu Xin (獨孤信) captured the former Northern Wei capital Luoyang, and several other nearby provinces also surrendered to Western Wei.|$|R

Although <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan</b> treated him with respect, real power was {{in the hands of}} <b>Gao</b> <b>Huan,</b> and then <b>Gao</b> Huan's sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang.
