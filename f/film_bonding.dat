50|$|Emotional {{branding}} is a {{term used}} within marketing communication that refers {{to the practice of}} building brands that appeal directly to a consumer's emotional state, needs and aspirations. Emotional branding is successful when it triggers an emotional response in the consumer, that is, a desire for the advertised brand (or product) that cannot fully be rationalized. Emotional brands have a significant impact when the consumer experiences a strong and lasting attachment to the brand comparable to a feeling of bonding, companionship or love. Examples of emotional branding include the nostalgic attachment to the Kodak brand of <b>film,</b> <b>bonding</b> with the Jim Beam bourbon brand, and love for the McDonald’s brand.|$|E

Water vapour desorption of leather changes according to the exponential law and for microporous film according to the linear one. Water vapour absorption/desorption mechanism depends on the leather permeability. Microporous film does not worsen moisture transfer properties of the laminated leather.

We find that practically realizable changes in moisture content affect both the creep compliance and the swelling of PVAc to a degree comparable to that resulting from realistic changes in temperature. For example, the creep rates (histories) at corresponding times for PVAc subjected to 92 % relative humidity storage are accelerated by approximately four orders of magnitude over those found for the dry material. Moreover, we find within reasonable experimental error that water concentration affects the time scale of creep like temperature through a concentration-dependent shift factor.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a {{fabrication}} method {{that is capable of}} making (3 D) microfluidic devices with multiple layers of homogeneous polystyrene (PS) film. PS film was chosen as the primary device material because of its advantageous features for microfluidics applications. Thermopress is used as a bonding method because it provides sufficient bonding strength while requiring no heterogeneous bonding materials. By aligning and sequentially stacking multiple layers (3 to 20) of patterned PS film that were achieved by a craft cutter, complicated 3 D structured microfluidic devices can be fabricated by multiple steps of thermopress bonding. The smallest feature that can be achieved with this method is approximately 100 [*]μm, which is limited by the resolution of the cutter (25 [*]μm) as well as the thickness of the PS films. Bonding characteristics of PS films are provided in this article, including a PS <b>film</b> <b>bonding</b> strength test, bonding precision assessment, and PS surface wettability manipulation.

Depending on the precipitation type, different modes of fluid failure were identified. For snow and ice pellet precipitation, failure appeared as inability of the fluid to melt the incoming precipitation elements.

This paper presents a new mapping system based on an array of Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) : electrical devices that exploit the superconducting transition of a thin film to identify temperature changes. The TES array is manufactured using photolithography to deposit a thin film on a 100 mm diameter glass wafer.

Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was demonstrated as a valuable film characterization tool to understand structure-property processing fundamentals, quantifying <b>film</b> <b>bonding</b> environments and tracing structural instabilities. Thermal lability in fluorocarbon films was attributed to terminal end groups and low molecular weight molecules. High temperature thermal stability was achieved by minimizing such labile sources through a clean deposition of high molecular weight chains of poly(tetrafluoroethylene). Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film porosity was introduced and controlled through the competition between nucleation and growth of film. Porous poly(tetrafluoroethylene) films were further integrated into a bridge layer and air gap dielectric interconnect scheme. With fluorocarbon materials deposited through such chemical vapor deposition methods, dielectric constants ranging from 2. 1 to below 1. 5 were conceivably attainable, thus potentially satisfying dielectric interconnect requirements to beyond the 0. 1 [mu]m technology node. by Kenneth Ka Shun Lau.

40|$|AbstractWe present one-cell-modules made of n-type Cz-Si {{solar cells}} with rear Al emitter. Cells are {{fabricated}} {{in an industrial}} like environment; the interconnection tabs are applied by bonding a conductive adhesive film; modules are made with an industrial type laminator. To our knowledge these are the first modules made from cells with this architecture. The main benefits of this module structure are that the conductive film used for bonding the tabbing is completely lead free, already fulfilling now future RoHS standards (restriction of hazardous substances). Additionally, the cells are completely boron-free which guarantees stable efficiencies when exposed to light. We evaluate different interconnection schemes focusing on the rear side. For that purpose the already fired Al paste on the rear is locally abrased and an interconnection tab is applied by conductive <b>film</b> <b>bonding.</b> With this simple method shunting of the Al emitter has been avoided and the interconnection of cells to strings can be realised with one less process step as compared to conventional p-type Al BSF cell production. Using the above mentioned cells and methods we produced one-cell-modules to prove stable cell interconnection. Individual cells are characterised with IV measurements after co-firing, with bonded tabbing and as a one-cell-module. Finally we performed climate chamber tests. Three modules with different rear architecture are used for damp heat tests and another two for temperature cycle tests (according to DIN EN 61215).

40|$|Trapped ions in Paul traps (radio {{frequency}} ion traps) are {{a promising}} {{candidate for the}} realization of a quantum computer. To date, experimental demonstrations of quantum computing and information processing with trapped ions have been limited to small numbers of quantum bits (qubits). The most prominent challenge to realise ion-trap quantum computation is to scale the system and control {{a large number of}} trapped ions coherently. Surface-electrode ion trap designs which are amenable to various microfabrication techniques offer a path to achieve this. In this work, design, fabrication and key operations of two types of surface-electrode ion traps, i. e. a Y-junction trap and a two-dimensional (2 D) hexagonal lattice trap developed towards scaling ion-trap architectures, are presented. The steps involved in the fabrication of the ion-trap devices included photolithography, wet etch (hydrofluoric acid etch) and dry etch (deep reactive ion and inductively coupled plasma etching), and metal evaporation. The devices were fabricated on SOI substrates with different buried oxide thicknesses (i. e. 5 um and 10 um) and different metals for the trap electrodes (i. e. gold and aluminium). An extremely high-breakdown voltage up to 1 kV was measured in vacuum for the SOI-built test devices with a 10 um-thick buried oxide formed by oxide film-to-oxide <b>film</b> <b>bonding</b> process. This is attributed to the deep V-shaped undercut profile of the buried oxide layer which resulted in a large breakdown path length, and so mitigating surface breakdown effects. Owing to the V-shaped undercut profile, the surface breakdown voltage was improved by 15 % for the devices fabricated on SOI substrates with a 10 um-thick buried oxide. In the first experiment, the demonstration of ytterbium (174 Yb+) ion trapping in the 2 D hexagonal lattice trap is achieved with a relatively long lifetime of a laser-cooled ion up to 90 minutes and ? 5 minutes without cooling in ultra-high vacuum system. The 2 D lattice trap design allows for reliable trapping of 2 D ion lattices, rudimentary shuttling between lattice sites and deterministic introducing of defects into the ion lattice. Based on all these abilities, such a 2 D lattice trap with the predicted reduction of lattice spacing down to 32 um can be configured as a versatile architecture for 2 D quantum simulations with trapped ions. In the second experiment, microparticle trapping in the 2 D lattice trap, performed in air, is achieved with the longest trapping lifetime of 60 minutes. Both gold and aluminium-coated electrodes also lead to comparable trapping performances. Furthermore, the in situ levitation of microparticles is successfully demonstrated at the maximum levitation height of 30 um. This ability provides additional control on the trapping height which increases the overall functionality of the 2 D lattice trap...|$|E
40|$|Ever growing {{demands for}} {{portability}} and functionality have always governed the electronic technology innovations. IC downscaling with Moore s law at IC level and system miniaturization with System-On-Package (SOP) paradigm at system level, have resulted {{and will continue}} to result in ultraminiaturized systems with unprecedented functionality at reduced cost. However, system miniaturization poses several electrical and thermal challenges that demand innovative solutions including advanced materials, bonding and assembly techniques. Heterogeneous material and device integration for thermal structures and IC assembly are limited by the bonding technology and the electrical and thermal impedance of the bonding interfaces. Solder - based bonding technology that is prevalent today is a major limitation to future systems. The trend towards miniaturized systems is expected to drive downscaling of IC I/O pad pitches from 40 µm to 1 - 5 µm in future. Solder technology imposes several pitch, processability and cost restrictions at such fine pitches. Furthermore, according to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS- 2006), the supply current in high performance microprocessors is expected to increase to 220 A by 2012. At such supply current, the current density will exceed the maximum allowable current density of solders. The intrinsic delay and electromigration in solders are other daunting issues that become critical at nanometer sized technology nodes. In addition, formation of intermetallics is also a bottleneck that poses significant mechanical issues. Similarly, thermal power dissipation is growing to unprecedented high with a projected power of 198 W by 2008 (ITRS 2006). Present thermal interfaces are not adequate for such high heat dissipation. Recently, copper based thin <b>film</b> <b>bonding</b> has become a promising approach to address the abovementioned challenges. However, copper-copper direct bonding without using solders has not been studied thoroughly. Typically, bonding is carried out at 400 oC for 30 min followed by annealing for 30 min. High thermal budget in such process makes it less attractive for integrated systems because of the associated process incompatibilities. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop a novel low temperature copper to copper bonding process. In the present study, nanomaterials - based copper-to-copper bonding is explored and developed as an alternative to solder-based bonding. To demonstrate fine pitch bonding, the patterning of these nanoparticles is crucial. Therefore, two novel self-patterning techniques based on: 1.) Selective wetting and 2.) Selective nanoparticle deposition, are developed to address this challenge. Nanoparticle active layer facilitates diffusion and, thus, a reliable bond can be achieved using less thermal budget. Quantitative characterization of the bonding revealed good metallurgical bonding with very high bond strength. This has been confirmed by several morphological and structural characterizations. A 30 -micron pitch IC assembly test vehicle is used to demonstrate fine pitch patternability and bonding. In conclusion, novel nanoparticle synthesis and patterning techniques were developed and demonstrated for low-impedance and low-cost electrical and thermal interfaces. M. S. Committee Chair: Rao R.
