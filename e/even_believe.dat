The Yukatek and Lacandon believe that caves and cenotes are where rain deities reside and the Yukatek {{of the sixteenth}} century sacrificed humans to appease these deities.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosing {{germ cell}} tumors may be {{difficult}} because the normal menstrual cycle and puberty can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may <b>even</b> <b>believe</b> these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of teen pregnancy. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, karyotype, human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign ovarian cyst.|$|E
25|$|Many {{students}} {{listen to}} music while they study. Many of these students maintain that the reasons why they {{listen to music}} are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some <b>even</b> <b>believe</b> that background music facilitates better work performance. However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory. They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system. This disturbance {{can be explained by}} the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does. This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music. Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process. Current research coincides with this idea and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music. However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test.|$|E
500|$|After Radoslav had {{returned}} to Serbia as a monk, {{the details of his}} relationship with Vladislav are not fully known, but he likely did not disturb Vladislav.

500|$|Critical {{interpretation}} of Bashō's poems {{continued into the}} 20th century, with notable works by Yamamoto Kenkichi, Imoto Nōichi, and Ogata Tsutomu. The 20th century also saw translations of Bashō's poems into languages and editions around the world. The position of Bashō in Western eyes as the haiku poet par excellence gives great influence to his poetry: Western preference for haiku over more traditional forms such as tanka or renga have rendered archetypal status to Bashō as Japanese poet and haiku as Japanese poetry. Some western scholars <b>even</b> <b>believe</b> that [...] Bashō invented haiku. The impressionistic and concise nature of Bashō's verse greatly influenced Ezra Pound, the Imagists, and poets of the Beat Generation.|$|E
500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't <b>even</b> <b>believe</b> it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E
500|$|Production on the band's sixth studio album {{began as}} a result of a series of events in which Shinoda decided to drop the {{electronic}} and experimental sound of the band's previous two studio albums. Shinoda had originally recorded and produced demos, which continued the sound of A Thousand Suns and Living Things, for the band's sixth studio album during the band's Living Things World Tour in 2013. He presented the demos to his bandmates, which received positive reception from the rest of the band, and to Rubin, who was also positive towards the demos, though describing them to Shinoda as more [...] "poppy" [...] than he expected. However, Shinoda, after listening to the demos again after the end of the tour, felt a strong negativity towards his material, especially after Rubin's statements. In a Warner Music interview, Shinoda stated that [...] "I don't <b>even</b> <b>believe</b> in this music. This is a mistake; I don't like what I'm making. I kind of went backwards into the process and scrapped all of it and started new stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|Ira Whipple (Gary Patent) says, [...] "In cyberspace, {{everyone}} hears you scream", {{a reference}} to the tagline of the 1979 film Alien: [...] "In space, no one can hear you scream." [...] A New York Film Academy professor refers to Holden as a [...] "James Cameron-wannabe", referring to the American director of such films as The Terminator and Aliens. The vlog in which Holden's ear is cut off is described by one characters as a rip-off of director Quentin Tarantino, {{a reference to}} his 1992 feature film debut, Reservoir Dogs. During an interrogation, Mike Logan sarcastically refers to Reggie as James Dean, the famous actor and American cultural icon. Captain Danny Ross refers to the episode's shooting as [...] "cyber-Rashomon. Reggie says Holden shot Todd, Holden says Reggie did it and Willow doesn't <b>even</b> <b>believe</b> anyone's dead." [...] This references the 1950 Japanese film Rashomon, in which multiple characters describe vastly different interpretations of the same murder. A poster for Grand Illusion, the 1932 Jean Renoir war film, hangs in Holden's apartment. In the episode's final scene, Willow is interviewed by CNN journalist Larry King, host of Larry King Live, which is shown on a giant scene in Times Square.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t <b>even</b> <b>believe.</b> In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bengali literature, {{with its}} millennium-old history and folk heritage, has {{extensively}} developed since the Bengali renaissance {{and is one}} of the most prominent and diverse literary traditions in Asia.

2500|$|Critics of self-experimenters {{point to}} other less savoury motivations such as simple self-aggrandisement. [...] Some {{scientists}} {{have resorted to}} self-experiment to avoid the [...] "red tape" [...] of seeking permission from the relevant ethics committee of their institution. [...] Werner Forssmann was so determined to proceed with his self-experiment that he continued with it even after permission had been denied. [...] He was twice dismissed for this activity, but the importance of his work was eventually recognised in a Nobel Prize. [...] Some researchers, apparently, <b>even</b> <b>believe</b> that self-experimentation is not permitted. [...] However, this is not true, {{at least in the}} United States where the same rules apply regardless of who the subject of the experiment is.|$|E
