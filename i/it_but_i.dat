25|$|When I'm in Sharjah (United Arab Emirates), I don't put up my {{hand and}} say, 'Well, why aren't you girls allowed to walk around like Western Europeans' — because that's {{the way it is}} in their country.

25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
