50|$|The British {{subsequently}} {{developed a}} cup-type launcher {{to replace the}} rod-type rifle-grenade. In this design, a can-shaped launcher {{was attached to the}} muzzle of the rifle and a gas check <b>disc</b> was <b>screwed</b> onto the base of the grenade before the grenade was placed in the launcher. The safety pin could then be removed as the launcher cup kept the safety-spoon in place. The operator inserted the blank cartridge into the rifle before setting the stock, angled on the ground to absorb the recoil of the weapon. When the cartridge was fired it pushed the grenade out of the cup releasing the spoon. The cup-type launcher could launch the grenade about 200 yards. Lee-Enfield rifles equipped with the cup launcher were modified with copper wire wrapped around the stock, to prevent the wood from cracking under the increased recoil. If necessary, both the rod and the gas check grenade could be thrown as a standard hand-grenade.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge in}} the field of dental and orthopedic implantology is the preparation of implant coatings with bioactive functions that feature a high mechanical stability {{and at the same time}} mimic structural and compositional properties of native bone for a better bone ingrowth. This study investigates the influence of magnesium addition to zirconia-calcium phosphate coatings. The mixed coatings were prepared with varying additions of either magnesium oxide or magnesium fluoride to yttria-stabilized zirconia and hydroxyapatite. The coatings were deposited on zirconia <b>discs</b> and <b>screw</b> implants by wet powder spraying. Microstructure studies confirm a porous coating with similar roughness and firm adhesion not hampered by the coating composition. The coating morphology, mechanical flexural strength and calcium dissolution showed a magnesium content-dependent effect. Moreover, the in vitro results obtained with human osteoblasts reveal an improved biological performance caused by the presence of Mg 2 + ions. The magnesiumcontaining coatings exhibited better cell proliferation and differentiation in comparison to pure zirconia-calcium phosphate coatings. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that magnesium addition increases the bioactivity potential of zirconia-calcium phosphate coatings and is thus a highly suitable candidate for bone implant coatings...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{problems}} of human aging is wearing joints, which relate to a sharp increase in abundance of various afflictions of the skeletal and joint system including fractures, vertebral degenerations, arthritis, and bone tumors. Orthopedic surgeries using artificial implants are currently the main method used for structural and functional renewal of damaged bones and joints. Materials used commonly for orthopedic implants are especially metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Metal implants (e.g., gold) are widely used in the clinical practice either as permanent replacements (e.g., hip replacements, artificial teeth) or as temporal prostheses (e.g., <b>discs,</b> hinges, <b>screws,</b> and rods used to fix fractures). Metals are favored due to their mechanical strength, resistance to wear, and nontoxicity [1 – 3]. On the other hand, their high mechanical strength and low elasticity are incompatible with the human skeletal tissue. This might {{have a negative impact on}} a bone implant, which can lead to absorption of an adjoined bone tissue and release of the implant. Polymers such as ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA), and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) are widely used in various biomedical applications. But only a limited number of polymers have been used as bone or joint replacements, since they tend to be too flexible and weak to comply with demands placed on mechanical orthopedic implants [4, 5].|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{degenerative}} {{spinal instability}} has been effectively {{treated with a}} cage. However, little {{attention is focused on}} the stiffness of the cage. Recent advances in the medical implant industry have resulted in the use of medical carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) cages. The biomechanical advantages of using different cage material in terms of stability and stresses in bone graft are not fully understood. A previously validated three-dimensional, nonlinear finite element model of an intact L 2 -L 5 segment was modified to simulate posterior interbody fusion cages made of CFRP and titanium at the L 4 -L 5 <b>disc</b> with pedicle <b>screw,</b> to investigate the effect of cage stiffness on the biomechanics of the fused segment in the lumbar region. From the results, it could be found that the use of a CFRP cage would not only reduce stress shielding, but it might also have led to increased bony fusion...|$|R

40|$|The most ideal implant {{models in}} the dental and {{orthopedic}} fields to minimize the failure rate of implantation involve the improvement of osseointegration with host bone. Therefore, a focus {{of this study is}} the preparation of surface-modified titanium (Ti) samples of <b>disc</b> and <b>screw</b> types using dexamethasone (DEX) and/or growth and differentiation factor- 5 (GDF- 5), as well as the evaluation of their efficacies on bone formation in vitro and in vivo. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle measurement were used to evaluate the surface chemical composition, surface morphology and wettability, respectively. The results showed that implant surfaces were successfully modified with DEX and/or GDF- 5, and had rough surfaces along with hydrophilicity. DEX, GDF- 5 or DEX/GDF- 5 on the surface-modified samples were rapidly released within one day and released for 28 days in a sustained manner. The proliferation and bone formation of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells cultured on pristine and surface-modified implants in vitro were examined by cell counting kit- 8 (CCK- 8) assay, as well as the measurements of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition, respectively. MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells cultured on DEX/GDF- 5 –Ti showed noticeable ALP activity and calcium deposition in vitro. Active bone formation and strong osseointegration occurred at the interface between DEX/GDF- 5 –Ti and host bone, as evaluated by micro computed-tomography (micro CT) analysis. Surface modification using DEX/GDF- 5 could be a good method for advanced implants for orthopaedic and dental applications...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{prepared}} human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (hBMP- 2) /human growth and differentiation factor- 5 (hGDF- 5) -coated titanium (Ti) <b>disc</b> and <b>screw</b> types for controlled {{release of the}} growth factors (GFs). The two growth factors were coated onto Ti with a smooth surface using their specific interaction with heparin, because they have heparin binding sites in their molecular structures. Efficacy of the two growth factor-coated Ti for enhancement of bone formation and osseointegration was compared to pristine Ti, and hBMP- 2 - and hGDF- 5 -coated Ti in vivo. The surface chemical composition, surface morphology, and wettability characteristics of the metal samples were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and contact angle measurement, respectively. The initial burst of hBMP- 2, hGDF- 5, and their combination, occurred within one day of the release study, resulting in 12. 5 %, 4. 5 %, and 13. 5 %/ 3. 2 %, {{and then there was}} a sustained, even release of these two growth factors from the coated metal for 30 days. In vitro tests revealed that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells cultured on the two growth factor-coated Ti had a higher proliferation rate and a higher activity for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which led to a larger amount of calcium deposition and larger expressions of type I collagen (COL 1), ALP, and osteocalcin (OCN) mRNAs. In vivo animal tests using ten white New Zealand rabbits showed that the two growth factor-coated Ti enhanced bone formation and osseointegration at the interface between the implants and host bone. In addition, histological evaluation showed that bone remodeling, including bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts, actively occurred between the two growth factor-coated Ti and host bone. Consequently, it is suggested that Ti surface modification with the combination of hBMP- 2 and hGDF- 5 for the two growth factor-coated Ti implants can improve the clinical properties of implants for orthopedic and dental applications...|$|R
40|$|Patients with a {{severely}} degenerated temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{may benefit from}} an alloplastic TMJ replacement. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop a safe and properly functioning TMJ prosthesis. The design was based on imitation of anterior condylar translation by an inferiorly located centre of rotation, unrestricted mandibular movements by a double articulation, correct fit to the skull by a self-adjusting skull part consisting of two connected parts, and stable fixation by bone screws that are rigidly connected to the prosthesis parts. The prosthesis consists of a titanium skull part with ceramic inlay, a titanium mandibular part,with a ceramic spherical head, and an intervening polyethylene <b>disc.</b> Titanium-alloy bone <b>screws</b> are used for fixation. All parts are available in a number of different shapes. In vitro laboratory and in vivo animal tests showed a low wear rate, the possibility of a close fit to the skull, a stable fixation, sufficient mechanical strength, appropriate choice of materials and proper functioning, Thereafter the step to first patient application was made. First patient application was carried out without adverse events. In conclusion, the presented TMJ prosthesis passed the pre-clinical tests and has progressed to clinical application. The fit to the skull. the expected lifetime of the device and the reliability of the implantation procedure require further evaluation in well-designed clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical study. OBJECTIVE: To test 2 {{different}} intervertebral {{positions of}} a semilunar cage {{and their effects}} on 3 -dimensional stability and segmental lordosis in a model of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In his original TLIF description, Harms recommended decortication of endplates, followed by placement of mesh cages in the middle-posterior intervertebral third. Subsequent studies presented conflicting recommendations: anterior placement of the spacer-cage for better load-sharing versus placement on the stronger posterolateral endplate regions. METHODS: Six human lumbar spinal functional units were first tested intact. TLIF was performed using a semilunar poly-ether-ether-ketone cage randomly inserted in the anterior (TLIF-A) or posterior (TLIF-P) <b>disc</b> space. Pedicle <b>screws</b> and rods were added. Unconstrained pure moments in axial-torsion, lateral-bending (LB), and flexion-extension (FE) were applied under 0. 05 Hz and +/- 5 Nm sinusoidal waveform. Segmental motions were recorded. Range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone (NZ) were calculated. Pairwise comparisons were made using nonparametric Wilcoxon-matched pairs signed rank sum test with statistical significance set at P 0. 05). Delta-ROM between TLIF-A and TLIF-P was not significant (P> 0. 05). TLIF-A and TLIF-P significantly decreased NZ in LB (P 0. 05). Segmental lordosis of TLIF-A and TLIF-P on C-arm views showed angle differences {{within the range of}} measurement error of Cobb angles. CONCLUSIONS: Difference in ROM and NZ between anterior (TLIF-A) or posterior (TLIF-P) positions was not statistically significant. Similarly, both positions did not influence segmental lordosis...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{stabilization}} of a degenerated intervertebral disc is an established method {{for the treatment}} of lower back pain in human medicine. This concept consists of an implant attached to the anterior and posterior vertebral body of the damaged intervertebral <b>disc</b> by pedicle <b>screws.</b> The implant contains a soft articular region between two rigid elements allowing the stabilized segment to maintain certain motility which preserves the adjacent intervertebral discs from a fast degeneration. This system is called Dynesys and was developed by the former Swiss company Sulzer which is nowadays part of ZIMMER SPINE®. SYNTHES® developed the SoFi-System using the same principle and combining it with the ClickX-system developed by the same company. The objective of this in vivo study was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the experimental posterior {{dynamic stabilization}} system called SoFi (SYNTHES, Solothurn, Switzerland) as therapy against intervertebral disc degeneration in an ovine degeneration model using immunohistochemical analysis. This posterior dynamic system was developed following the same idea behind the Dynesys system. The hypothesis of this study indicates that this experimental posterior dynamic stabilization system is capable of stopping or even revert the intervertebral disc degeneration in this ovine degeneration model. Forty sheep underwent a partial nucleotomy surgery at the intervertebral disc segment L 3 -L 4 simulating an anulus tear. The animals were distributed into four groups. Two of the four groups received additionally the posterior implant on the same segment as the partial nucleotomy. Two groups (one with and one without implant) were euthanized three months after surgery and their spines were extracted to be analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The other two groups were euthanized twelve months after the surgery and underwent the same procedure. The parameters used to evaluate the degeneration in the intervertebral discs were the immunostaining for α-SMA, Keratan sulfate, MMP 13, PGP 9. 5, Collagen type I and Collagen type II and the ratio of both collagen types in the transition zone. After dissection, the L 3 -L 4 segments of the spines were cut with a microtome into 4 µm thick samples which passed through immunohistochemical staining. The samples were recorded as digital images, and pixel analysis was performed to obtain the size of the stained area as a result. The obtained data was analyzed using descriptive statistics to make a comparison between the groups. After that, the significance level of the difference between the two coeval groups was accessed to determine the quality of the information obtained from the comparison. The disposition for angiogenesis was analyzed using an antibody against α-Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA). Due to the fact that both 3 -month groups showed evidence for a higher degeneration level, it was not possible to determine whether the implant worked as expected or not. In the other hand, the 12 -month-implant group showed smaller levels of immunopositivity against α-SMA, indicating a lower grade of degeneration in these animals confirming the effectivity of the implant. The same result was obtained from the analysis for the metalloproteinase activity (MMP 13) and the neoinnervation (PGP 9. 5) of the intervertebral disc. Both of these parameters showed no difference between both treatment groups after 3 months, but regeneration signs in the implant group after 12 months. The immunostaining for Keratan sulfate was the only parameter not showing any regeneration signals in the implant group at any time. The main Collagen types of the intervertebral disc matrix Collagen Type I and Type II were also analyzed, as well as their ratio towards each other in the transition zone between the anulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. The two criteria used to gather the information about the degeneration level using Collagen Type I as reference were the variance of the results and the distribution of the immunopositive areas inside the intervertebral disc, meaning bigger collagen I areas in the nucleus pulpous a higher degeneration level. Collagen Type I delivered an ambiguous result at the 3 -month groups, showing signs for a higher as well as for a lower degeneration level in the implant group. After 12 months however, the results revealed evidence of lower degeneration levels on the implant group and showed a satisfactory effect of the implant. The immunostaining for collagen type II revealed at each one of the analysis signs of a regenerative effect of the implant on the disc for the 3 -month-groups. These analyses consisted of the immunopositive areas of the whole intervertebral disc, of the zones and of the cartilage endplate. These results were also confirmed by the statistical tests in the whole upper cartilage endplate, the left annulus fibrous and the central nucleus pulpous RoIs. Both 12 -month groups showed very similar results though, indicating that the degeneration level was comparable in both groups. The comparison of the presence of both Collagen types in the transition zones revealed lower degeneration signs for the implant group at both sides 3 months after surgery. After 12 months however, only the right side delivered a similar result, whereas the left side (injury side) showed higher amounts of collagen type I than type II pointing out a higher degeneration level. The experimental SoFi implant delivered satisfactory results on most of the analyzed parameters of this study. From the patients point of view, the pain is surely the most important parameter for measuring the effectiveness of an intervertebral disc degeneration therapy method. According to the literature, there is a relation between neoinnervation occurrence in the intervertebral disc and the lower back pain. The neoinnervation and the mostly with it associated neoangiogenesis showed a lower degeneration ratio in the implant-groups 12 months after the surgery, even though the results varied between failure of the implant and undetermined 3 months after the surgery. From the therapist’s point of view, the collagen ratio is surely one of the most important parameters in addition to the others previously mentioned. Collagen type I and type II are the main responsible for the elasticity and pressure resistance of the intervertebral disc. This means that the analysis of these molecules delivers information on the task fulfilling capability of the intervertebral disc. Only one of four results of this comparison didnt show a satisfactory effect of the implant against degeneration. Longer term studies are necessary to better assess the effectiveness of this novel implant, in order to better survey the evolution of these analyzed parameters of disc degeneration. Hereby it would be possible to monitor the processes that take place during tissue healing and separate them from those indicating the degeneration. The angiogenesis delivers an example. Three months after surgery it could be possible to find higher angiogenesis in a tissue that has been more effectively repaired, whereas after one year angiogenesis associated with neoinnervation represents a clear sign of tissue degeneration. To completely assess the benefits of using this novel implant, the adjacent segments should also be analyzed in the same way. Hereby it would be possible to evaluate whether this implant really prevents the adjacent segments from degenerating in the way fusion does, or not. To summarize the results of this study, evidence for a lower degeneration ratio could be registered at most of the test parameters confirming the effectiveness of the implant. However only 2 of them (MMP 13 and Collagen Type II) could be statistically confirmed as significant. Therefore these results are to be considered as descriptive and not to be assigned for other animal populations than the ones used for this experiment...|$|R
