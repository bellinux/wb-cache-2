5|$|Montgomery <b>Gentry</b> was an American {{country music}} duo {{consisting}} of vocalists Eddie Montgomery and Troy <b>Gentry,</b> both natives of Kentucky. Eddie Montgomery and Troy <b>Gentry</b> began performing in the 1990s {{as part of}} two different bands with Montgomery's brother, John Michael Montgomery. Although <b>Gentry</b> won a talent contest in 1994, he reunited with Eddie Montgomery after <b>Gentry</b> {{was unable to find}} a solo record deal, and Montgomery <b>Gentry</b> was formed in 1999. The duo was known for its Southern rock influences, and collaborated with Charlie Daniels, Toby Keith, Five for Fighting, and members of The Allman Brothers Band.|$|E
5|$|After Early Tymz disbanded, the Montgomery {{brothers}} and <b>Gentry</b> briefly performed as Young Country, with John Michael as lead vocalist. John Michael {{left for a}} solo career in the early 1990s. <b>Gentry</b> went solo and won the Jim Beam National Talent Contest in 1994, which led to him opening for Patty Loveless and Tracy Byrd. <b>Gentry</b> initially wanted to pursue a solo career, but after {{he was unable to}} find a record deal, he reunited with Eddie Montgomery to form a duo called Deuce, which played at local nightclubs. The duo later changed its name to Montgomery <b>Gentry,</b> and signed with Columbia Records' Nashville division in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{intellectual}} pursuits, the <b>gentry</b> exhibited {{habits and}} cultured hobbies which marked their social status and refinement. The erudite term of enjoying {{the company of}} the 'nine guests' (九客, jiuke)—an extension of the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar—was a metaphor for accepted <b>gentry</b> pastimes of playing the Chinese zither, playing Chinese chess, Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine. The painted artwork of the <b>gentry</b> shifted dramatically in style from Northern to Southern Song, due to underlying political, demographic, and social circumstance. Northern Song <b>gentry</b> and officials, who were concerned largely with tackling issues of national interest and not much for local affairs, preferred painting huge landscape scenes where any individuals were but tiny figures immersed within a larger context. During the Southern Song, political, familial, and social concerns became heavily embedded with localized interests; these changes correlate with the chief style of Southern Song paintings, where small, intimate scenes with a primary focus on individuals was emphasized.|$|E

There were two kinds of <b>gentries.</b> Those who passed the {{entry-level}} exam of the imperial exam were called Shengyuan(生員). All Shengyuan receive a fixed amount of allowance from the imperial court. The average amount of allowance ranges from 18 tael to 12 tael. The rest of <b>gentries</b> mainly earned their living by teaching in private schools as mentors.|$|R

5|$|Appreciation of art {{among the}} <b>gentry</b> class flourished during the Song dynasty, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} paintings, which is an art practiced by many. Trends in painting styles amongst the <b>gentry</b> notably shifted from the Northern (960–1127) to Southern Song (1127–1279) periods, influenced {{in part by the}} gradual embrace of the Neo-Confucian political ideology at court.|$|E
5|$|In {{a show of}} {{solidarity}} against the eunuchs' interference in court politics with the coup against the regent Liang Ji (d. 159 CE), a widespread student protest broke out where Imperial University students {{took to the streets}} and chanted the names of the eunuchs they opposed. At the instigation of the eunuchs, Emperor Huan (r. 146168 CE) initiated the Partisan Prohibitions in 166 CE, a wide-scale proscription against Li Ying (李膺) and his associates in the Imperial University and in the provinces from holding office (branded as partisans: 黨人). With the suicide of regent Dou Wu (d. 168 CE) in his confrontation with the eunuchs shortly after Emperor Ling (r. 168189 CE) was placed on the throne, the eunuchs banned hundreds more from holding office while selling offices at the highest bidder. Repulsed by what they viewed as a corrupted government, many gentrymen considered a moral, scholarly life superior to holding office, and thus rejected nominations to serve at court. Until they were repealed in 184 CE (to garner <b>gentry</b> support against the Yellow Turban Rebellion), the partisant prohibitions created a large independent, disaffected portion of the <b>gentry</b> who did not simply return to a reclusive life in their hometowns, but maintained contacts with other <b>gentry</b> throughout China and actively engaged in the protest movement. Acknowledging that the <b>gentry</b> class was able to recruit and certify itself, the Chancellor Cao Cao (155220 CE) established the nine-rank system where a distinguished <b>gentry</b> figure in each county and commandery would assign local gentlemen a rank that the government would use to evaluate nominees for office.|$|E

5|$|Wales {{can claim}} {{one of the}} oldest {{unbroken}} literary traditions in Europe. The literary tradition of Wales stretches back to the sixth century and includes Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales, regarded by historian John Davies as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin, survive not in their original form, but in medieval versions and have undergone significant linguistic changes. Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 – 1280) and then the Poets of the <b>Gentry</b> (c. 1350 – 1650). The Poets of the Princes were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to the Welsh princes while the Poets of the <b>Gentry</b> were a school of poets that favoured the cywydd metre. The period is notable for producing one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym. After the Anglicisation of the <b>gentry</b> the tradition declined.|$|E
5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary {{to give him a}} chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. <b>Gentry</b> received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a dozen}} vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. <b>Gentry</b> was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Due to Song's {{enormous}} {{population growth}} and the body of its appointed scholar-officials being accepted in limited numbers (about 20,000 active officials during the Song period), the larger scholarly <b>gentry</b> class would now take over grassroots affairs on the vast local level. Excluding the scholar-officials in office, this elite social class consisted of exam candidates, examination degree-holders not yet assigned to an official post, local tutors, and retired officials. These learned men, degree-holders, and local elites supervised local affairs and sponsored necessary facilities of local communities; any local magistrate appointed to his office by the government relied upon {{the cooperation of the}} few or many local <b>gentry</b> in the area. For example, the Song government—excluding the educational-reformist government under Emperor Huizong—spared little amount of state revenue to maintain prefectural and county schools; instead, the bulk of the funds for schools was drawn from private financing. This limited role of government officials was a departure from the earlier Tang dynasty (618–907), when the government strictly regulated commercial markets and local affairs; now the government withdrew heavily from regulating commerce and relied upon a mass of local <b>gentry</b> to perform necessary duties in their communities.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to the {{situation}} of the <b>gentries,</b> commoners of Yuan dynasty found themselves less protected by the law. Mongol rulers did not seem to take the interests of commoners a priority. A great number of ordinary farmers were converted to plantation workers working for the <b>gentries.</b> The wealthy entered upon the properties of commoners while making them essentially slave-peasants.|$|R

5|$|Relatively isolated, <b>gentry</b> {{families}} {{spent much}} of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours. As a result, hospitality was an important part of life. Leisure activities pursued by the <b>gentry</b> included hunting, cards and chess. Music remained important in noble houses, with accounts listing professional musicians hired to entertain the family and guests. However, professional musicians were expensive to maintain. In the eighteenth century members of the household often provided musical entertainment on the harpsichord, organ and piano. House libraries often contained considerable quantities of music, as at Dalkeith Palace, where the Duke of Buccleuch's daughter collected vocal music between 1780 and 1800. In the nineteenth century it was the women of the family who were the chief performers and men were not expected to play the piano in drawing rooms.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated <b>gentry</b> and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song <b>gentry</b> —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since <b>Gentry’s</b> {{breakthrough}} {{result was}} introduced in the year 2009, the homomorphic encryption has become a very popular topic. The main contribution of <b>Gentry’s</b> thesis [9] was, that it has proven, that it actually is possible to design a fully homomorphic encryption scheme. However ground-breaking <b>Gentry’s</b> result was, the designs, that employ the bootstrapping technique suffer from terrible performance both in key generation and homomorphic evaluation of circuits. Some authors tried to design schemes, that could evaluate homomorphic circuits of arbitrarily many inputs without need of bootstrapping. This paper introduces notion of symmetric homomorphic encryption, analyses the security of four such proposals, published in three different papers ([5], [12], [15]). Our result is a known plaintext key-recovery attack on every one of these schemes...|$|R
