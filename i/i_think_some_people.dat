5000|$|In 2008, Kagan {{and others}} protested the toleration of [...] "anti-gay slurs" [...] shouted by fans at Madison Square Garden hockey games.

Commenting later on homophobia in hockey, Kagan said: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> to <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> it's just a part of the game.

It’s amazing how short people’s memories are though. A {{lot of the people}} that I’ve dealt with in media have no recollection of me ... There’s no culture these days in the mainstream really - the idea of discovering an artist, getting all their albums and getting obsessed with them is dying out.

500|$|Within {{a couple}} of hours, Michael Jensen of the gay website AfterElton.com took note of Murphy's statement, and also of the then-current cover article on Criss in Out magazine, in which Murphy was quoted as saying, [...] "Blaine will openly {{question}} whether bisexuality is real. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> will love that discussion and some will not love it." [...] Jensen pointed out that Murphy does not say that Blaine will not question his own sexuality, but clearly [...] "decides he is, in fact, gay". Ausiello posted at about that time that Blaine was indeed who {{he was referring to}} in his original story, quoted from the same Out article as Jensen, and added a new one-sentence summation from Murphy on the coming episode: [...] "I guess the moral of the story is don’t play spin the bottle while drunk on wine coolers." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Alyona Shows {{editorial}} premise was [...] "bringing you {{the real}} headlines {{with none of}} the mercy". The show began with a segment where Minkovski pointed out news stories under-covered or over-covered by the mainstream media. She wanted to bring her generation, which ignores mainstream reporting and goes online for hard news, back to television. Minkovski has said that the show's sarcastic and satirical tone is aimed at a younger audience. The programs focus on topics like government spying, the Federal Reserve, and America's undeclared wars, as well as media laziness, Washington corruption, Wall Street tomfoolery because, according to Minkovski, [...] "there is a need to open people’s eyes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that unfortunately <b>some</b> <b>people</b> don’t always want to hear the truth, and it might not be pretty, but unless you put it in their face and make them hear that truth, there can’t be change. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s the way the country becomes better." ...|$|R

5000|$|John Carpenter later reflected:Escape from L.A. {{is better}} than the first movie. Ten times better. It’s got more to it. It’s more mature.

40|$|Abstract. From online {{news and}} blog articles, a human can often deduce {{information}} and knowledge {{needed for the}} prediction of market movements or sociological trends. However, this recognition and comprehension process is very complex and requires experience {{as well as some}} context knowledge about the domain in which trends are to detect. In order to support human experts in trend analysis, I propose an automatic trend mining method based on knowledge integrating learning approach. Key words: trend mining, machine learning, knowledge acquisition, knowledge integration, semantic learning, tagging, folksonomy 1 Problem statement ”Many people have been led to believe that trends are about intuition. This is because {{the majority of the people}} who work with trends find it difficult to explain why something will happen the way they say it will. The explanation often boils down to ”because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so. ” <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> do seem to be able to predict what wil...|$|R
5000|$|The phrase {{was coined}} by blogger Cliff Pervocracy in a 2012 post on The Pervocracy, a blog about BDSM and kink. Describing {{a man in}} his social circle known to be a rapist, Pervocracy wrote People had gotten so used to working around this guy, to {{accommodating}} his [...] "special requirements," [...] that they didn't feel like there was an urgent problem in their community. They did eventually expel him, but it was after months of it being widely shared knowledge that he was a rapist. ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there were <b>some</b> <b>people</b> in the community who were intentionally protecting him, but there were more who were de facto protecting him by treating him like a missing stair. Like something you're so used to working around, you never stop to ask [...] "what if we actually fixed this?" [...] Eventually you take it for granted that working around this guy is just a fact of life, and if he hurts someone, that's the fault of whoever didn't apply the workarounds correctly.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to write and record an EP not long after Nocturnes release, Tatum noted: [...] "You {{can do whatever you}} want with EP, like it’s a free pass. People don’t really expect as much from an EP, so you’re free to do what you want to do. And that is what was so empowering about this particular experience for me. I never needed to take a step back and obsess over what kind of music I was making. <b>I</b> didn’t <b>think</b> that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> might <b>think</b> it’s weird that I’m making this electronic pop song or I’m making this really ambient, droney song. I just did what I wanted to do and it felt good not to think about the outside perspective. I do that so much. I spend a lot of time worrying about what other people think. But this EP was the most fun I’ve had writing and recording in a long time. ... A lot of times bands put out EPs with the leftover tracks that didn’t make it onto the album for some reason. But this was not like that for me." ...|$|R
