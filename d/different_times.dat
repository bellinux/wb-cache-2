40|$|The {{paper is}} the first attempt to {{estimate}} systematic risk 'beta' at <b>different</b> <b>time</b> scales {{in the context of}} the emerging Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) equity markets by applying a relatively new approach in finance known as wavelet analysis. Our results indicate that on average beta coefficients in all GCC countries show a multiscale tendency. This is consistent with our theoretical expectation that stock market investors have <b>different</b> <b>time</b> horizons due to different trading strategies and that is also reflective of the characteristics of the GCC markets in particular in that they are less developed, less liquid, involve more transaction costs, highly dependent on individual investors, and prone to infrequent trading. Further, we analyze the impact of <b>different</b> <b>time</b> scales on Value at Risk (VaR) and find that VaR measured at <b>different</b> <b>time</b> scales suggests that risk tends to be concentrated more at the higher frequencies (lower time scales) of the data. The results are plausible and intuitive and have strong policy implications. Systematic risk <b>Different</b> <b>time</b> scales Wavelet approach Value at risk Gulf stock markets...|$|R
5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at <b>different</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
