5|$|Tosca {{arrives in}} time to see her lover taken to an {{antechamber}} to be tortured. He is able to speak briefly with her, telling her to say nothing. Tosca is told by Scarpia that she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but hearing Cavaradossi's cries of agony, eventually tells Scarpia that Angelotti is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa.|$|E
5|$|Bulls and Bears, a farce {{performed}} at Drury Lane on 2 December 1715, {{was attributed to}} Cibber but was never published. The Dramatic Works of Colley Cibber, Esq. (London, 1777) includes a play called Flora, or Hob <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Well,</b> {{but it is not}} by Cibber. Hob, or the Country Wake. A Farce. By Mr. Doggett was attributed to Cibber by William Chetwood in his General History of the Stage (1749), but John Genest in Some Account of the English Stage (1832) thought it was by Thomas Doggett. Other plays attributed to Cibber but probably not by him include Cinna's Conspiracy, {{performed at}} Drury Lane on 19 February 1713, and The Temple of Dullness of 1745.|$|E

30|$|Fracture zone {{locations}} {{were first}} evaluated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> GPK- 2, GPK- 3, and GPK- 4 from mud logging, calipers, and GR data (Baumgärtner et al. 1995; Baumgärtner et al. 2000; Baumgärtner et al. 2005; Hettkamp et al. 2004). Because the wellheads {{are very close}} (less than 15  m apart) and because <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> are sub-vertical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same sedimentary section, we spatially correlated certain fracture zones. To compare <b>the</b> fracture zones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wells,</b> a similar terminology and labeling for fracture zones {{has been used for}} <b>the</b> three geothermal <b>wells.</b> A given fracture zone is not necessarily visible <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> <b>wells.</b>|$|R
5|$|It portrayed Hall as a humourless moralist {{who had a}} {{great deal}} in common with the opponents of her novel. One illustration, picking up on the theme of {{religious}} martyrdom <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Well,</b> showed Hall nailed to a cross. The image horrified Hall; her guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, The Master of the House.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} gate from this palace, which was earlier {{the main gate}} and which has carved ornamentation, leads to the royal baths and then to an elegant small dwelling unit built within a garden in typical Mughal architectural style; this had been built exclusively for Rai Parveen, the female escort of the Raja Indrajit; her large-size portrait in a revealing and seductive attire adorns hall in this Mahal. She was a poet and musician. The building is a double storied structure built with bricks, rising to {{the height of the}} trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> tended garden called Anand Mahal. The garden is laid out with octagonal flower beds and has good network of water supply. There are niches in the Mahal which permit natural light to the main hall and smaller rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and VideoDisc in pan and scan only, and on laserdisc in both pan and scan and widescreen. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in THX and made available in widescreen. The outer package was retitled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for consistency with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent DVD release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a connecting rod from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection in the glass partition separating Ford from the cobra <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> of Souls was removed. Shortly before the theatrical release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Raiders (along with The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade) was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008. The film {{was released on}} Blu-ray Disc in September 2012. Previously, only Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had been available on Blu-ray.|$|E

5|$|The only {{video game}} based {{exclusively}} on the film is Raiders of the Lost Ark, released in 1982 by Atari for their Atari 2600 console. The first third of the video game Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, released in 1994 by JVC for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System, is based entirely on the film. Several of the film's sequences are reproduced (the boulder run and the showdown with the Cairo Swordsman among them); however, several inconsistencies with the film {{are present in the}} game, such as Nazi soldiers and bats being present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> of Souls sequence, for example. The game was developed by LucasArts and Factor 5. In the 1999 game Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, a bonus level brings Jones back to the Peruvian temple of the film's opening scene. In 2008, to coincide with the release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Lego released the Lego Indiana Jones line—which included building sets based on Raiders of the Lost Ark—and LucasArts published a video game based on the toyline, , which was developed by Traveller's Tales.|$|E
5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E

25|$|A co-produced BBC and WGBH Boston {{television}} {{adaptation of}} The Ruby in the Smoke, starring Billie Piper and Julie Walters, was screened in the UK on BBC One on 27 December 2006, and broadcast on PBS Masterpiece Theatre in America on 4 February 2007. The television {{adaptation of the}} second book in the series, The Shadow in the North, aired on the BBC on 26 December 2007. The BBC and WGBH announced plans to adapt the next two Sally Lockhart novels, The Tiger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> and The Tin Princess, for television as well; however, since The Shadow in the North aired in 2007, no information has arisen regarding an adaptation of The Tiger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Well.</b>|$|E

30|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> study area, {{there is}} a {{significant}} difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> concentration of nitrate due to the point source distance (proximity). Water quality is better <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> at <b>the</b> proximity of < 20  m compared to <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> at <b>the</b> proximity of > 10  m. Average values of nitrate during the years are not statistically different. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> close to one type of point source pollution (agricultural origin or septic systems), {{there is a}}n increased nitrate concentration, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> close to both types of contamination, the water is more frequently unsafe for health. Point source distance (proximity) explains 94  % of the total variability of nitrate, which means that the proximity is a very important predictor. Bad and unsafe well construction also contributes to periodically higher nitrate concentrations. It is an indicator of pollution proximity, and it is an important prerequisite for poor water quality.|$|R
30|$|To {{optimize}} the initial {{density of the}} assay cells, we compared {{the effect of the}} cell density on the color reaction by varying the initial seeding density from 1 to 100 [*]×[*] 104 cells mL− 1.

The OD 572 /OD 600 ratio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> containing AZA was approximately half of that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative control <b>well.</b> However, when higher cell densities (between 0.5 and 1 [*]×[*] 106 cells mL− 1) were used, the OD 572 /OD 600 ratio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> containing AZA was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative control <b>well.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, when a lower cell density (1 [*]×[*] 104 cells mL− 1) than the optimal one was used, <b>the</b> ratios <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> with or without AZA did not show any significant difference (Fig.  4 a).
