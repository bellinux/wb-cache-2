5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Two songs, [...] "Low Down Freedom" [...] and [...] "Black Rose," [...] were {{produced}} by Ronny Light. [...] "We Had It All" [...] {{was produced by}} Jennings and Ken Mansfield. [...] Like the music within, the album cover was also {{at odds with the}} elaborate, often overwrought cover designs from Music Row, featuring an unpretentious shot of a smiling Jennings and his unkempt friends sat around a studio laughing and drinking. [...] In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh, Shaver said of the LP, [...] "Oh, it was great, because the songs were bigger than me. And I couldn't possibly sing as good as Waylon. And at the time, Waylon was just great, so great, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> was gonna happen good for him, and sure enough it helped me and it helped him, too, and that's a pretty good trade." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{role was}} first portrayed by {{three sets of}} twins, {{including}} Avital and Amiel Weiss, Matthew and Riley Esham, and Aiden and Andrew Gonzales {{over the course of}} 2006 to 2009. The role was then rapidly aged for the first time when Tucker assumed the role in October 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ehrich stated that he had gone through a [...] "long audition process", saying: [...] "I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone, then came back to read with Christian LeBlanc. By the end of that audition, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> felt right and that he could be my father." [...] When asked about signing a contract with the series, Ehrich stated: [...] "I'm still on recurring right now. I think it's all relevant to your character and either way, in my book, it's awesome. I would sign, yes, but it'll happen when the time is right." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Paris, they soon relocated to Antibes on the French Riviera. While Scott was absorbed writing The Great Gatsby, Zelda became infatuated with a dashing young French pilot, Edouard S. Jozan. She spent afternoons swimming {{at the beach}} and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan. After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: [...] "They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination." [...] In Fitzgerald's, [...] "A Life in Letters," [...] Fitzgerald referred to the Jozan affair in his August letter to Ludlow Fowler. He writes of lost illusions in The Great Gatsby as his lost certainty in Zelda's fidelity. The book reflected the dramatized pivotal aspects of his and Zelda's love, of courtship, break, restoration with financial success, and the Jozan betrayal: [...] "I feel old too, this summer... the whole burden of this novel—the loss of those illusions that give such color {{to the world that}} you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory." [...] The Great Gatsby was in draft form during the July 1924 Jozan crisis; the typescript was sent to Scribners at the end of October. Fitzgerald wrote in his notebooks, [...] "That September 1924, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> had happened that could never be repaired." ...|$|E
