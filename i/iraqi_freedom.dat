40|$|The {{complexity}} of injuries that can arise from combat situations, specifically {{as a result}} of the Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom/Operation Enduring <b>Freedom</b> conflicts, is challenging. As injured troops leave the war zone early for medical care, they are treated by an interwoven system of care that includes both the Department of Defense and Veterans Health Administration. Physicians across these settings are increasingly faced with patients who have multiple rehabilitation diagnoses {{as a result of}} the severity of blast injuries; therefore, the importance of active communication across the system must be highlighted. This case describes the seamless transition of an injured soldier across the continuum of care...|$|R
40|$|Multiple-limb loss due to war-theater {{injuries}} {{results in}} a unique group of servicemembers requiring intensiverehabilitation and diverse prosthetic devices. This article compares the Vietnam and the Operation <b>Iraqi</b> Freedom/OperationEnduring <b>Freedom</b> (OIF/OEF) groups with war-theater-associated multiple-limb loss to document significant changes in health status, prosthetic-device use, and long-term prognosis. During 2007 and 2008, a national survey queried 73 Vietnamveterans and 61 OIF/OEF servicemembers sustaining multiple-limb loss. Average years since limb loss are 39 for Vietnam veterans and 3 for OIF/OEF servicemembers. Self-rated health status was excellent or very good in 38. 9 % of the Vietnam group and 60. 7 % of the OIF/OEF group (p = 0. 01). More of the OIF/OEF group than the Vietnam group reported performing high-impact aerobic activities, 18 % versus 3 % (p = 0. 005). The OIF/OEF group currently uses more diverse prosthetic-device types than the Vietnam group. Based on Vietnam veterans’ 39 -year experience, the long-term prognosis for OIF/OEF servicemembers with multiple-limb loss is an active, fulfillinglife. The healthcare team caring for these patients should carefully address proper prosthesis fit and maintenance of good health and function...|$|R
