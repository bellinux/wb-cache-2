50|$|Like Mir and the Russian {{orbital segment}} of the ISS, the CSS modules will be fully {{assembled}} in orbit, {{in contrast to the}} US Orbital Segment of the ISS, which required spacewalking to <b>interconnect</b> <b>cables,</b> piping, and structural elements manually.

5000|$|Another {{closely related}} type is the {{stackable}} connector for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets {{on the opposite}} surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic milk crates. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and <b>interconnect</b> <b>cables</b> specified for the IEEE-488 instrumentation bus. Stackable mezzanine bus connectors are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the Arduino add-on daughterboards called [...] "shields". The older PC/104 embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.|$|E
50|$|DS3 <b>interconnect</b> <b>cables</b> must be {{made with}} true 75-ohm coaxial cable and {{connectors}}. Cables or connectors which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower {{the performance of the}} connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, Generic Requirements for Central Office Coaxial Cable, defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and cable stripping tools used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the true 75 ohm connectors known to work. RG-6 or even inexpensive RG-59 cable may work temporarily when properly connectorized, though it does not meet telephony technical standards. Type 735 26 AWG is used for interconnects up to 225 feet, and Type 734 20 AWG is used for interconnects up to 450 feet.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{technologies}} are now ubiquitous in data communication, telecommunication, and computing networks for transmission distances beyond a few meters. The use of optical to transmit voice communication {{has changed the}} nature of the industry and been driving photonic component innovation for the past 30 years. Never before has the world demanded more data to run its collective everyday lives. Technological lifecycles have shortened and {{to keep pace with the}} rapidly increasing quantities and demands of data needs, firms are placing a stronger emphasis on the development of new technologies to replace old ones. The use of electrical interconnects has been the workhorse for data transmission for over a century and a new technology is poised to succeed it. Due to the limitation of current transmission medium, an adoption of new technology is inevitable and the question is when and what are the drivers? In this thesis, an analysis will be conducted to examine the adoption of optical <b>interconnect</b> <b>cables</b> in different lengths using different costs of new technology. These results will be used to understand how each driver affects the overall adoption of optical <b>interconnect</b> <b>cables,</b> the limitation of adoption, and a potential timeline of adoption for each length examined. by Louisa Chiao.
