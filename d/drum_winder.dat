40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale <b>drum</b> <b>winder</b> {{has been designed}} and built {{for the production of}} pre-preg. Cross-ply hybrid matrix laminates were made from the pre-preg with glass fibres/epoxy resin in the longitudinal plies and glass fibres/epoxy resin-urethane elastomer in the transverse ply. The addition of urethane to the matrix in the transverse plies alone increased the applied strains necessary for the initiation and development of transverse cracking during the extension of cross-ply laminates. This resulted in a smaller reduction in laminate stiffness (due to damage) at a prescribed level of strain. Damage resistance was similar to that in cross-ply laminates with urethane additions to the matrix in both the transverse and longitudinal plies (a uniform matrix laminate). It was found that urethane additions lead to improved damage resistance in cross-ply laminates because they lower the transverse ply modulus and increase the matrix toughness in the transverse ply. During the extension of cross-ply laminates, stable (constrained) transverse cracking was observed in thin transverse plies and unstable (brittle) transverse cracking in thick transverse plies. The effects of urethane additions on the development of constrained transverse cracking and brittle transverse cracking were modelled with a shear lag stress analysis combined with an energy balance and a statistical expression for the transverse ply strength respectively. The ultimate properties of hybrid matrix laminates, having improved damage resistance, were expected to be better than uniform matrix laminates with a similar urethane content in the matrix. However, the tensile strength of circular centre-notched (0, 90) s hybrid matrix laminates was lower than uniform matrix counterparts and the compressive strength of (02, 902) 2 s hybrid matrix laminates was similar to uniform matrix counterparts...|$|E

40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{requirements}} for an effective reliable inspection and discard policy based on monitoring the condition of ropes used in Indian mines. This contrasts with current practice which is based upon a policy of 'Statutory Life Policy'. Data have been collected data on rope service to study the influence of operating parameters on the degradation mechanisms affecting hoisting ropes in Indian mines. In addition to this, records on failed/premature discarded hoisting ropes from Indian mines have been also collected to classify the prominent causes of failure in terms of operating parameters. These data include 645 records of ropes (606 from 303 <b>drum</b> <b>winders</b> and 39 from 11 friction winders) which have been In service, and 45 records of failure and premature discard categorized in terms of different parameters. These data inform the proposed recommendations for policy to minimised failure through the adoption an efficacious inspection procedure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} model is presented which investigates the dynamic response {{of a deep}} mine hoisting cable system during a winding cycle. The response, namely the lateral motions of the catenary cable and the longitudinal motion of the vertical rope with conveyance is observed on the fast time scale, and the slow time scale is introduced to monitor the variation of slowly varying parameters of the system. The cable equivalent proportional damping parameters, and periodic excitation functions resulting from the cross-over cable motion on the <b>winder</b> <b>drum</b> are identified. Subsequently, the model is solved numerically using parameters of a double-drum multi-rope system. Since the system eigenvalues are widely spread {{and the problem is}} of stiff nature, the numerical simulation is conducted using a stiff solver. The results of the simulation demonstrate various transient non-linear resonance phenomena arising in the system during the wind. The nominal ascending cycle simulation results reveal adverse dynamic behaviour of the catenary largely due to the autoparametric interactions between the in- and out-of-plane modes. Principal parametric resonances of the lateral modes also occur, and conditions for autoparametric interactions between the lateral and longitudinal modes arise. Additionally, a transition through a number of primary longitudinal resonances takes place during the wind. The adverse dynamic motions in the system promote large oscillations in the cable tension which must be considered significant with respect to fatigue of the cable. It is noted that a small change in the winding velocity may cause large changes in the dynamic response due to the resonance region shifts. Consequently, the resonance modal interactions can be avoided, to a large extent, if the winding velocity is increased to an appropriate level. ...|$|R
