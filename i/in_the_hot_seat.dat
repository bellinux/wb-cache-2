After the 1993 tour, Emerson was forced to take a year off from playing due to a nerve condition affecting his right hand (see Health issues). Following his recovery, ELP resumed touring in 1996, including a successful US tour with Jethro Tull, but broke up again in August 1998.|$|E
25|$|To {{promote the}} 2001 movie Moulin Rouge!, he {{appeared}} on a celebrity edition of the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? with Kelly Ripa, Kevin Sorbo, Alfre Woodard, Martin Short and Chevy Chase.

50|$|Stan Ternent {{replaced}} Bob Stokoe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Blackpool <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> during <b>the</b> close season, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following 1979-80 campaign, Weston made 35 league {{appearances and}} scored three goals.

50|$|Oates' strike-rate {{dried up}} in 1965-66, {{with only one}} goal in 21 league appearances, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first two-thirds of the 1966-67 campaign, Ron Suart gave Oates only three starts. Stan Mortensen {{replaced}} Suart <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Blackpool <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Year, and the former Blackpool striker provided more opportunities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team. Oates scored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final league game of the season, a 3-1 victory against Liverpool at Anfield on 13 May 1967. Blackpool, however, had already been relegated to Division Two at that point.|$|R
500|$|The format in the Play It! {{attraction}} {{was very}} {{similar to that of the}} television show that inspired it.

However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became Phone a Complete Stranger which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a Millionaire CD game, to a 3-night Disney Cruise.|$|E

50|$|A poor {{start to}} season 2010-11 saw John O'Neill and {{assistant}} Roddy Grant under pressure. After six straight league defeats, including three by {{five or more}} goals, the management team were let go <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of 6-1 drubbing at Partick Thistle on 15 January. Former Dundee and Aberdeen manager Jocky Scott replaced John O'Neill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Stirling <b>hot</b> <b>seat.</b> Jocky was assisted by ex-Hibernian manager John Blackley. Only months after their appointment, the Binos were relegated back to the Second Division on 9 April 2011, with four games to spare.

However, at the halfway stage of the 2003/04 season, the Committee replaced Cross with ex-boss Dave Williams with player Gary Emberton acting as assistant, and the club successfully secured their position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second tier of Welsh senior football. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer of 2004 ex Alex player and Flint Town United manager Terry Wheeler was appointed as first team manager but Wheeler only lasted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alyn Park <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> until <b>the</b> autumn.

2500|$|Patti LuPone, who {{initially}} {{had been promised}} the Broadway run, sued Lloyd Webber and received a settlement reported to be $1 million. Frank Rich, <b>in</b> his book <b>The</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat,</b> noted that these lawsuits contributed to Sunset Boulevard setting {{the record for the}} most money lost by a theatrical endeavour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the United States. [...] According to The New York Times, operating costs soared far beyond the budget, and the [...] "Broadway production has earned back, at best, 80% of the initial $13 million". [...] For example, during the week of 2 July 1995, [...] "it cost $731,304 to run Sunset Boulevard, including... advertising fees of $138,352 (which had been budgeted at $40,000 a week)." [...] The road companies also generated large financial losses. [...] Rich puts the final figure near or above US$20 million lost, making the show what he termed a [...] "flop-hit," [...] as it ran more than two years. The musical sold over a million tickets on Broadway.|$|R

50|$|The next season, 1996-97, saw {{the club}} take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Champions League {{for the first}} time. With {{expectations}} and ambitions raised, the most notable summer transfer signings were striker Juan Esnáider from Real Madrid and Radek Bejbl, who was coming off a great showing for Czech Republic at Euro 1996. Playing on two fronts, Atlético {{fell out of the}} league title contention early while, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Champions League, they were eliminated by Ajax <b>in</b> extra-time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter-finals. Before the 1997-98 season, the heavy spending continued with the signings of Christian Vieri and Juninho. All of the success, however, produced little change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overall Gil strategy, and although Antić survived three consecutive seasons in charge, he was replaced during the summer of 1998 with Arrigo Sacchi, who himself only remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> managerial <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> for less than six months. Antić then returned briefly in early 1999 only to be replaced with Claudio Ranieri {{at the end of the}} season. The 1999-2000 season proved disastrous for Atlético. In December 1999, Gil and his board were suspended pending an investigation into the misuse of club funds, with government-appointed administrator José Manuel Rubí running Atlético's day-to-day operations. With the removal of club President Jesús Gil and his board, the players performed poorly and the club floundered. Ranieri handed in his resignation with the club sitting 17th out of 20 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league table and heading towards relegation. Antić, returning for his third coaching stint, was unable to prevent the inevitable. Despite reaching the Copa del Rey final, Atlético were relegated.|$|R
25|$|In his decade-long {{pursuit of}} an elusive title, Mike Thibault found himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proverbial <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> to {{engineer}} a deep run. But {{an absence of}} urgency was reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team's free agency approach – making small waves to pry Thompson and Cash from their respective teams – to solely ink rugged forward Mistie Mims in relief of Charles. Sticking {{with the status quo}} meant the roster was set {{so much so that the}} Sun drafted an unheralded Malian prospect. Going into the season, Thibault had assembled a deep roster that necessitated only a couple minor moves to cap the off-season process. The coach's patience paid dividends when his burgeoning core bolted to a 6–1 start highlighted by a chafed Montgomery turning the starting reins over to Hightower. Leading into the 1-month Olympic hiatus, the Sun strung together a five-win streak to improve to a league-best 15–4 mark. Following the ill-timed Games, which saw the club's Jones-Charles tandem help capture gold for Team USA, Connecticut continued to perform superbly while short-handed. They finished the season 25–9, with a better road record (13–4) than as hosts. The Sun fended off late Liberty rallies to sweep their way into a joust with <b>the</b> Fever <b>in</b> what was <b>the</b> team's first Conference finals since 2010's radical facelift. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> series, the Sun took themselves to the doorstep of a Finals berth after notching a decisive Game 1 rout. But building on a stirring two-point Game 2 win and a rally cry after losing Douglas, Indiana derailed the Sun's seemingly predestined trip in a 71–87 home romp, a defeat that essentially cost longtime coach Thibault his job. The lion's share of the season's fortunes came from the talented triumvirate of Lawson, Jones and league MVP Tina Charles flanked by Mims and sixth woman Montgomery carving a niche as an energy duo off the pines. Though failure was what came to mind in taking stock of the team's decade season; the Fever capturing the year's title being emblematic of that.|$|R
