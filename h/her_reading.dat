5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in <b>her</b> <b>reading</b> by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, {{the rear}} {{section of the}} centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie {{was one of several}} actresses to {{audition}} for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, sister of Tom Six and the film's producer, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of <b>her</b> <b>reading,</b> until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.|$|E

5|$|The early {{models for}} the Imagist group were from Japan, and H.D. often visited the {{exclusive}} Print Room at the British Museum {{in the company of}} Richard Aldington and the curator and poet Laurence Binyon in order to examine Nishiki-e prints that incorporated traditional Japanese verse. However, she also derived her way of making poems from <b>her</b> <b>reading</b> of Classical Greek literature and especially of Sappho, an interest she shared with Aldington and Pound, each of whom produced versions of the Greek poet's work. In 1915, H.D. and Aldington launched the Poets' Translation Series, pamphlets of translations from Greek and Latin classics. H.D. worked on the plays by Euripides, publishing in 1916 a translation of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis, in 1919 a translation of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis and Hippolytus, an adaptation of Hippolytus called Hippolytus Temporizes (1927), a translation of choruses from The Bacchae and Hecuba (1931), and Euripides' Ion (1937) a loose translation of Ion.|$|E
5|$|My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy {{opens with}} a {{dedication}} to Daws Butler, a list of acknowledgements and a foreword from Cartwright's The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta. The first chapter of the book details Cartwright's life and career prior to 1987. In the second chapter, Cartwright recalls the day she went to audition for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. The shorts were about a dysfunctional family and Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the eldest daughter. Upon arriving at the audition, she found the role of her brother Bart to be much more interesting. Matt Groening, creator of the shorts, allowed her to audition for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot after hearing <b>her</b> <b>reading.</b> From there, the book contains her experiences as the voice of Bart. After three seasons of shorts, a half-hour spinoff called The Simpsons debuted in 1989. In the following chapters, she recalls the early days of The Simpsons, commenting on the recording process and her co-stars and revealing how she got the roles of some of the other characters she voices, including Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum. In the 15th chapter, she discusses her experiences of voicing a famous character, but rarely being recognized.|$|E
5|$|The script of Human Revolution {{was written}} by Mary DeMarle, who was {{narrative}} director and main writer. While she did act as chief writer, DeMarle also worked {{on a number of}} other people throughout development so the story could be conveyed through environments and dialogue, along with handling how its progression was influenced by player choices. Sheldon Pacotti, main writer for the first two Deus Ex titles, was brought in as story consultant during the early stages, and was also contacted regularly through production to ensure that the storyline fitted properly within the series chronology. A total of four writers worked on the game, including author James Swallow. DeMarle was brought onto the project four months into its development, after it had been decided that it would be prequel to the first game, focusing on mechanical rather than nanotechnological enhancement technology. As part of her research, DeMarle looked up multiple subjects, from speculated conspiracy theories to the current level of biotechnology: the final story was influenced in large part by <b>her</b> <b>reading</b> of non-fiction and writings concerning transhumanism. DeMarle compared the game's study of transhumanism through main character Adam to that in the 1982 film Blade Runner, while also using the video game medium to put questions surrounding the ethics and motivations surrounding transhumanism in a nuanced way. She also stated that Adam being forced to confront these issues in person was the narrative's central irony, something that had previously been explored using different narrative elements in Deus Ex. The ending, which was ultimately decided using a choice of buttons, was chosen because of technical and time constraints while retaining player interaction. While the gameplay evolved continually through development and some elements required cutting, the story remained almost unchanged, instead being further refined and improved to work out plot holes.|$|E

25|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose power depended on letters as well as arms, and she {{was familiar with the}} writing of Erasmus, among others, on the subject. She enjoyed and collected books, and moved the royal collection to the Louvre, her principal residence. She delighted in the company of learned men and women, and her court was highly literary. Her government officials, such as secretary-of-state Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, whose wife translated the epistles of Ovid, were perfectly at home in literary circles. When she could find the time, Catherine occasionally wrote verses herself, which she would show to the court poets. <b>Her</b> <b>reading</b> was not entirely highbrow, however. A superstitious woman, she believed implicitly in astrology and soothsaying, and <b>her</b> <b>reading</b> matter included The Book of Sibyls and the almanacs of Nostradamus.|$|E

25|$|Though {{a dynamic}} stage personality, Atwell was, in person, a shy, {{retiring}} and soft-spoken woman of modesty. Eloquent and intellectual, {{she was well}} read and, unlike many {{in the world of}} professional showbusiness, keenly interested in and informed about issues and current events. Voracious in <b>her</b> <b>reading</b> habits and a devotee of crosswords, she confessed to an inordinate love of mangoes, a dislike of new shoes, and a keen interest in televised cricket (she backed England). She was also a devout Catholic, who unpretentiously played the organ for her parish church.|$|E

25|$|Freud himself {{reserved}} initial judgement on the matter, and was swiftly told by Dora {{that her}} father had a relationship with Frau K, and that she felt he was surreptitiously palming her off on Herr K in return. By initially accepting <b>her</b> <b>reading</b> of events, Freud was able to remove her cough symptom; but by pressing her to accept her own implication in the complex interfamily drama, and an attraction to Herr K, he alienated his patient, who abruptly finished the treatment after 11 weeks, producing, Freud reported bitterly, a therapeutic failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{legacy of}} {{psychoanalysis}} {{in art history}} has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in <b>her</b> <b>reading</b> into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With Griselda Pollock's reading of French feminist psychoanalysis {{and in particular the}} writings of Julia Kristeva and Bracha L. Ettinger, as with Rosalind Krauss readings of Jacques Lacan and Jean-François Lyotard and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, Feminist theory written in the fields of French feminism and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.|$|E

In early May 2014, the Snyder County District Attorney, Michael Piecuch, reported his investigation found insufficient evidence to file criminal charges against Snook. Piecuch noted that Snook did access emails she was directed to not open, referring the matter as a District personnel issue.|$|E

25|$|Benaderet {{moved to}} Los Angeles station KHJ in 1936. She made her network radio debut upon being hired by Orson Welles for his Mercury Theatre {{repertory}} company heard on The Campbell Playhouse. The following year she received her first big {{break in the}} industry on The Jack Benny Program, where she played Gertrude Gearshift, a wisecracking Brooklyn-accented telephone operator who gossiped about Jack Benny with her cohort Mabel Flapsaddle (Sara Berner). Intended as a one-time appearance, the pair became a recurring role starting in the 1945-46 season, and in early 1947, Benaderet and Berner momentarily took over the actual NBC switchboards in Hollywood for publicity photos. She performed {{in as many as}} five shows daily, causing her rehearsal dates to conflict with those of The Jack Benny Program and resulting in <b>her</b> <b>reading</b> live as Gertrude from a marked script she was handed upon entering the studio.|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} in 1939 of Mary Lascelles's Jane Austen and Her Art, the academic study of Austen took hold.
