Objects and creatures are represented on screen by single characters, sometimes using <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> mode.

40|$|Abstract:- The intercommunications {{between the}} video devices using {{different}} standards {{are so much}} inconvenient, thus video codec suppor ting multiple standards are more useful and more attractive. In this brief, a low cost very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture is designed for multistandard inverse Discrete Cosine transform. It is used in multistandard decoder of MPEG- 2, MPEG- 4 ASP, and VC- 1. Two circuit share strategies, factor share (FS) an adder share (AS) are applied to the inverse transform architecture for saving its circuit resource. Pipelined stages are used in this Multistandard inverse transform to increase the operational speed. Keywords:- Hardware Share, multiple <b>inverse</b> transform, <b>Video</b> decoding,factor share,adder share. 1...|$|R
50|$|Note the {{asymmetry}} in {{the selection}} of graphics characters: There are lower triangles but no upper triangles, a left half block but no right half block, and a lower half block but no upper half block. These missing characters could be displayed by using <b>inverse</b> <b>video.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Atari BASIC uses a {{line editor}} and {{immediately}} checks {{the line for}} syntax errors {{as soon as the}} [...] key is pressed. If a problem is found it re-displays the line, highlighting the text near the error in <b>inverse</b> <b>video.</b> This can make catching syntax errors on the Atari much easier than on other editors; most BASICs will not display the errors until the program is executed.|$|E
50|$|There are 11 block {{graphics}} characters, counting code point 0 which also doubles as space. Together with the 11 <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> versions these 22 code points provide every {{combination of the}} character cell divided into 2×2 black-and-white block pixels for low-resolution 64×48 pixel graphics, or into 1×2 black, white or dithered gray wide block pixels for a 32×48 resolution. The 2×2 versions of these are also present in the Block Elements Unicode block.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a VLSI architecture for the low-power and low-complexity implementation of 2 D discrete cosine transform and its <b>inverse</b> (DCT/IDCT) in <b>video</b> coding applications. A circuit {{based on the}} Chen algorithm and the distributed arithmetic approach is described. Since DCT/IDCT coefficients are typically quite small we use a data driven clock gating strategy to turn off some portions of the circuit when operating on input data equal to zero or whose most significant bits are just sign extensions. For typical H. 263 /MPEG video coding applications this approach provides 26 % and 36 % power reduction in the DCT and IDCT modes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. HEVC video coding {{standard}} {{is the next}} generation of H. 264 {{coding standard}}, which is able to achieve twice coding efficiency compared with H. 264 /AVC High Profile. This paper analyzes the key features of HEVC standard based on HEVC reference software HM 12. 0. Experiments cover different resolutions ranging from 240 p to 1600 p. The most complex parts of HEVC decoder are intra prediction, loop filter and <b>inverse</b> transform when <b>video</b> sequences are coded with all-intra configuration. When video sequences are coded in random-access configuration, HEVC decoding process is occupied by motion compensation, which takes nearly half of the decoding time. Experiment results indicate that HEVC standard can achieve 50 % average bit-rate saving compared with H. 264...|$|R
50|$|Reverse video (or invert {{video or}} <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> or ''''reverse screen'''') is a {{computer}} display technique whereby the background and text color values are inverted. On older computers, displays were usually designed to display text on a black background by default. For emphasis, the color scheme was swapped to bright background with dark text. Nowadays the two tend to be switched, since most computers today default to white as a background color. The opposite of reverse video is known as true video.|$|E
5000|$|The {{front part}} of the case is {{occupied}} by an integrated 40-key membrane keyboard displaying 20 graphic and 54 <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> characters. Each key has up to five functions, accessed via the SHIFT and FUNCTION keys or depending on context. For example, the P key combined the letter , the [...] character and the BASIC commands [...] and [...] The ZX81 uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout. The keyboard is mechanically very simple, consisting of 40 pressure-pad switches and 8 diodes under a plastic overlay, connected in a matrix of 8 rows and 5 columns.|$|E
5000|$|Multi-Color: ANTIC Modes 4 and 5. In these {{character}} modes {{each pair}} of bits in the character glyph represents a pixel one color clock wide, thus a single byte of glyph information represents 4 pixels rather than the 8 pixels of other modes. The character set uses 128 characters and requires 1024 bytes of RAM. The background color is COLBK. This mode allows up to four colors (including the background) to be displayed in one character matrix. If the high bit of the character value is set (i.e. <b>inverse</b> <b>video)</b> then a fifth color, COLPF3, is displayed {{in place of the}} pixel bit pattern [...] "11" [...] that ordinarily shows COLPF2. The color choices based on the bit pairs of the character glyph: ...|$|E
5000|$|Modern teleprompters {{for news}} {{programs}} {{consist of a}} personal computer, connected to video monitors on each professional video camera. In certain systems, the PC connects to an external scroll device over IP to offer greater flexibility in setup, distances and cabling. The monitors are often black-and-white monochrome and have the scanning reversed {{to compensate for the}} reflection of the mirror. A peripheral device attached has a knob that can be turned to speed up, slow down, or even reverse the scrolling of the text. The text is usually displayed in white letters on a black background for the best readability, while cues are in <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> (black on white). Difficult words (mainly international names) are spelled out phonetically, as are other particulars like [...] "Nine-eleven" [...] (to specify that the event 9/11 should not be pronounced [...] "nine-one-one", for example).|$|E
40|$|Modifications {{have been}} made to the {{department}} 2 ̆ 7 s Volker Craig VC 404 and VC 4404 terminals 2 ̆ 7 to enable characters to be displayed in <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> on an individual character by character basis. This feature has been put to good use in programs such as 2 ̆ 2 Explain 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Edit 2 ̆ 2 where {{there is a need to}} highlight character strings. The two terminal models have different internal designs necessitating the use of different control sequences to enable and disable <b>inverse</b> <b>video.</b> The VC 404 uses 2 ̆ 2 control Q 2 ̆ 2 to toggle between normal and <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> while the VC 4404 uses 2 ̆ 2 control Q 2 ̆ 2 to enable <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> and 2 ̆ 2 control O 2 ̆ 2 to disable it...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} usability studies, {{commonly used in}} industry, are rarely conducted with educational software and children. The problem addressed in {{this study examined the}} issue of educational software usability studies with children. The researcher conducted an experimental, randomized control-group posttest study investigating the redesign of the human-computer interface of educational simulation software. The study employed a testing instrument designed by the researcher. The validation of the instrument is contained within this study. Along with the test instrument embedded counters were used to collect data for this study. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ANOVA. Results showed that software rewritten with a redesigned human-computer interface was easier for students to use. This was an expected outcome. An item analysis of the test instrument was used to attempt to explain why the new interface was easier for the students. The human-computer interface was rewritten using human factors guidelines. Results were that menus may be a better interface than sentence direction, if the task is not too difficult. When the difficulty increased, the data yielded evidence that menus may not be any more effective than sentence directions. The use of <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> for giving directions was also examined. The results showed a definite increase in effectiveness when <b>inverse</b> <b>video</b> directions were changed to a menu format. A focus {{of this study was to}} determine if usability studies should be conducted on childhood populations. It is the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s belief that this is essential for major improvements in educational software...|$|E
