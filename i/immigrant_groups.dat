40|$|This study {{undertakes}} three comparisons using Cycle 2 (1996 - 97) {{data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) in Canada. First, the study compares the health outcomes of children of the Native-born Canadian (NBC) group {{with those of the}} <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> in general. Differences are also investigated within the three immigrant sub-groups: the American <b>immigrant</b> <b>group,</b> the European <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> and Asian <b>immigrant</b> <b>group.</b> Second, this study tests the hypothesis that the children of any <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> in Canada would have a higher level of health outcomes for the same level of resources. Third, the study examines the association of time of residency of <b>immigrants</b> in different <b>groups</b> and the health outcomes of their children. An immigrant family is defined as one in which {{at least one of the}} parents is foreign-born. Health outcomes are measured by the PMK's (person most knowledgeable about the child) assessment of the child's health. Ordered logit models are employed for estimation. The children selected for analysis are 4 to 13 years of age. The NLSCY data suggest that the health outcomes of children in the immigrant families in general are similar to that in the NBC group. However, the health outcomes of the Asian <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> are slightly lower and those of the American <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> are markedly better. Except for the American <b>immigrant</b> <b>group,</b> there is evidence that the children of any other <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> would have lower health status for the same level of resources. Decomposition results indicate that a higher level of observable and unobservable resources is responsible for markedly better outcomes for the American immigrant group; while a lower level of observable and unobservable resources is responsible for the lower level of outcomes for the Asian <b>immigrant</b> <b>group.</b> On the other hand, health outcomes are higher for the European <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> than for the NBC group when variation in resources is considered, while lower when variation in productivity coefficients is examined. Finally, there is statistical evidence that the health status of children of immigrant families would improve with the time of residency of immigrant parents, if it were lower initially. The findings of the study indicate that present health outcomes of children in the immigrant families, on average, are not a great concern. However, those of the Asian <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> may be a concern.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to further {{our understanding of}} the contextual sources of anti-immigrant sentiments by simultaneously examining the impact of <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size, negative immigration-related news reports and their interaction on natives' perceived group threat. We test our theoretical assumptions using repeated cross-sectional survey data from Spain during the time period 1996 - 2007, enriched with regional statistics on <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size and information from a longitudinal content analysis of newspaper reports. Drawing on multilevel regression models, our findings show that a greater number of negative immigration-related news reports increases perceived group threat over and above the influence of <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size. Additionally, our findings indicate that the impact of negative immigration-related news reports on perceived group threat is amplified (weakened) in regions with a smaller (larger) <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size. Collectively, these results testify to the importance of <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size and negative immigration-related news reports as key contextual sources of natives' perceived group threa...|$|R
5|$|Downtown had short skyscraper-building booms {{beginning}} in the 1970s. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new <b>immigrant</b> <b>groups</b> to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is {{the location of the}} Hmong Archives.|$|E
5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial <b>immigrant</b> <b>groups</b> became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread {{over most of the}} City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E
5|$|Turkey schnitzel is an Israeli {{adaptation}} of veal schnitzel, {{and is an}} example of the transformations common in Israeli cooking. The schnitzel was brought to Israel by Jews from Central Europe, but before and during the early years of the State of Israel veal was unobtainable and chicken or turkey was an inexpensive and tasty substitute. Furthermore, a Wiener schnitzel is cooked in both butter and oil, but in Israel only oil is used, because of kashrut. Today, most cooks buy schnitzel already breaded and serve it with hummus, tahina, and other salads for a quick main meal. Other <b>immigrant</b> <b>groups</b> have added variations from their own backgrounds; Yemenite Jews, for example, flavor it with hawaij. In addition, vegetarian versions have become popular and the Israeli food company, Tiv′ol, was the first to produce a vegetarian schnitzel from a soya meat-substitute.|$|E

5|$|As late as 1795, the {{population}} of Massachusetts was nearly 95% of English ancestry. During the early and mid 19th century, <b>immigrant</b> <b>groups</b> began arriving in Massachusetts in large numbers; first from Ireland in the 1840s; today the Irish and part-Irish are the largest ancestry group in the state at nearly 25% of the total population. Others arrived later from Quebec as well as places in Europe such as Italy, Portugal, and Poland. In the early 20th century, a number of African Americans migrated to Massachusetts, although in somewhat fewer numbers than many other Northern states. Later in the 20th century, immigration from Latin America increased considerably. Over 156,000 Chinese Americans made their home in Massachusetts in 2014, and Boston hosts a growing Chinatown accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines to and from Chinatown, Manhattan in New York City. Massachusetts also has large Puerto Rican, Dominican, Haitian, Cape Verdean and Brazilian populations. Boston's South End and Jamaica Plain are both gay villages, as is nearby Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} to draw investment {{to the city}} after the hurricane, Galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity. Development was also hindered by {{the construction of the}} Houston Ship Channel, which brought the Port of Houston into competition with the natural harbor of the Port of Galveston for sea traffic. To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of Rabbi Henry Cohen and Congregation B'nai Israel, Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the Galveston Movement that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 Eastern European Jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the Northeastern United States. Additionally numerous other <b>immigrant</b> <b>groups,</b> including Greeks, Italians and Russian Jews, came to the city during this period. This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S.|$|E

40|$|Although anti-immigrant attitudes {{represent}} a widespread social problem in many European societies, research has only partially understood {{the role the}} demographic size of the immigrant population plays for the prevalence of such attitudes. In this study, we use group threat- and intergroup contact theory to derive competing hypotheses on the role {{the size of the}} immigrant population plays for explaining the anti-immigrant attitudes of Dutch citizens. To this end, we used structural equation modeling with robust standard errors on nationally representative individual-level survey data enriched with official municipality-level statistics. We found empirical evidence for both group threat- and intergroup contact theory. Objective measurements of <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size corresponded with subjective perceptions of a larger <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size. Conversely, subjective perceptions of a larger <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size were associated with perceptions of threatened group interests, which in turn related to anti-immigrant attitudes. On the other hand, however, larger <b>immigrant</b> <b>group</b> size facilitates intergroup contact, which was negatively associated with perceived threat and subsequent anti-immigrant attitudes. ...|$|R
