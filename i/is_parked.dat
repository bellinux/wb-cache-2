Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E

Their alibi will be the bridge game for which she has set up the cards with false scores to indicate the progress of some time having elapsed. She tells them that her motive is Henry's diplomatic visit. The three somewhat incredulous men fall in uneasily with her plan but only after Sir Rowland has been told by Clarissa of Pippa's supposed involvement.

During the chorus Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take place {{in front of the}} camera, walking behind Diddy miming Grey's words. Later in the clip, during the second verse, Diddy sits in a burned out building singing to himself.

500|$|DNeg TV {{provided}} the visual effects for the season, with Sheena Duggal returning as visual effects supervisor. Effects {{created for the}} season included the Zero Matter and its related properties, such as people being frozen and shattered by it, the dimensional rifts and the levitated objects that get sucked into them, and Wilkes becoming intangible. Frost's Zero Matter [...] "crack" [...] on her face was also augmented with visual effects, to add depth, sentience, and an [...] "infinite black" [...] by color-correcting the image, with the effects animators studying [...] "cracking glass to better capture the animation effect." [...] 20 cast members were digitally scanned and modeled for interaction with Zero Matter, while many other instances required facial tracking markers on actors. For the Zero Matter itself, the design {{was described as a}} cross between [...] "liquid spiders" [...] and magnetic ferrofluid, the latter being used as an on set reference for the actors by Duggal. The main dimensional rifts were designed as black holes, {{based on the work of}} theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, which also inspired Double Negative's visual effects for Interstellar; the software developed for the film was reused for the series. DNeg TV also worked on Howard Stark's Hover car, using the original computer asset for the version seen in Captain America: The First Avenger. Despite the original car from the film being only a shell and destroyed after the picture, an identical Cadillac was found for DNeg to laser scan and incorporate into the episode along with the real car when it <b>is</b> <b>parked</b> on the ground.|$|E
