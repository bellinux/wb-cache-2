40|$|ObjectiveThis paper {{provides}} a {{brief review of}} relatively new additive manufacturing technologies for the fabrication of unusual and complex metal and alloy products by laser and electron beam melting. A number of process features and product microstructures are illustrated utilizing 3 D optical and transmission electron microscope <b>image</b> <b>compositions</b> representing examples of 3 D materials science. MethodsProcessing methods involving electron beam melting (EBM) and a process referred to as direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), often called selective laser melting (SLM) are described along with the use of light (optical) microscopy (OM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to elucidate microstructural phenomena. ResultsExamples of EBM and SLM studies are presented in 3 D <b>image</b> <b>compositions.</b> These include EBM of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, Cu, Co-base superalloy and Inconel 625; and SLM of 17 - 4 PH stainless steel, Inconel 718 and Inconel 625. Conclusions 3 D <b>image</b> <b>compositions</b> constituting 3 D materials science provide effective visualization for directional solidification-related phenomena associated with the EBM and SLM fabrication of a range of metals and alloys, especially microstructures and microstructural architectures...|$|R

50|$|In the mid nineties Wandrey discovers a new subject. The {{resulting}} motifs {{deal with}} the simplest forms of visualization, in other words the question of imagery itself. They are pictures without content, simply emblematic allusions to destruction by such implements as scissors, saws, knives, axes and hatchets. They suggest damage and even destruction to the revered image, and Wandrey transforms them into aluminum reliefs, plots, paintings and works in wood. The focus on destruction continues with sawed-up classicist picture frames in the digitalistic <b>image</b> <b>compositions</b> of several relief groups, such as Misfit 1-5 (2003) or Flash-Back 1-2 (2006).|$|R

More _exibility is obtained through a wider palette of visual techniques and support for iterative construction of <b>images,</b> <b>composition</b> and parametric displays. More ef_cient processes are obtained with the use of the SVG standard to import graphics, support for linking graphics and behaviour, and a unifying model-driven architecture.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} {{issues in}} the development of continuous media (CM) applications. CM applications process, transport, or store CM data such as digital audio and video. Introduction of video into applications will require support for sophisticated video effects such as <b>image</b> processing, <b>composition</b> and digital filtering. Traditional <b>image</b> processing and <b>composition</b> algorithms operate on uncompressed images, while video is typically stored and delivered in a compressed form.

The Juxtapoze {{workflow}} (from left to right) : (1) {{exploring the}} shape database using scribbled input; (2) edit a selected shape using standard drawing operations; (3) drag the shape into {{position on the}} canvas; (4) compose it with other shapes; and (5) repeat for a full drawing. Juxtapoze is a clipart composition workflow that supports cre-ative expression and serendipitous discoveries in the shape domain. We achieve creative expression by supporting a workflow of searching, editing, and composing: the user queries the shape database using strokes, selects the desired search result, and finally modifies the selected image before composing it into the overall drawing. Serendipitous dis-covery of shapes is facilitated by allowing multiple explo-ration channels, such as doodles, shape filtering, and relaxed search. Results from a qualitative evaluation show that Jux-tapoze makes {{the process of creating}} <b>image</b> <b>compositions</b> en-joyable and supports creative expression and serendipity.

50|$|Letterboxing {{is used as}} an {{alternative}} to a full-screen, pan-and-scan transfer of a widescreen film image to videotape or videodisc. In pan-and-scan transfers, the original image is cropped to the narrower aspect ratio of the destination format, usually the 1.33:1 (4:3) ratio of the standard television screen, whereas letterboxing preserves the film's original <b>image</b> <b>composition</b> as seen in the cinema. Letterboxing was developed for use in 4:3 television displays before widescreen television screens were available, but it is also necessary to represent on a 16:9 widescreen display the unaltered original composition of a film with a wider aspect ratio, such as Panavision's 2.35:1 ratio.|$|E

40|$|This {{is a short}} {{introduction}} to the efficient calculation of <b>image</b> <b>compositions.</b> Some of the techniques shown here are not well known, and should be. In particular, we will explain the difference between premultiplied alpha and not 1. These two related notions are often confused, or not even understood. We shall show that premultiplied alpha is more efficient, yields more elegant formulas, and occurs commonly in practice. We shall show that the non-premultiplied alpha formulation is not closed on over, the fundamental image compositing operator as usually defined. Most importantly, the notion of premultiplied alpha leads directly {{to the notion of}} image object, or sprite a shaped image with partial transparencies. The Basic Model There are two ways to think of the alpha of a pixel. As is usual in computer graphics, one interpretation comes from the geometry half {{of the world and the}} other from the imaging half.
