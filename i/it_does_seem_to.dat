25|$|Awareness {{in species}} is {{difficult}} to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will {{fall out of the}} hole in the wall. It doesn’t need awareness, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> me that Deerslayer {{is not a}} work of art in any sense; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> me that it is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of {{a work of art}}; in truth, {{it seems to me that}} Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|E
