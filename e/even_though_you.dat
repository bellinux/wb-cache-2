5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{compared}} [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] {{to previous}} works by Ne-Yo. Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "second cousin" [...] of Ne-Yo's singles [...] "Sexy Love" [...] and [...] "Because of You". Regarding the lyrics, Rihanna said, [...] "When you're {{in love with}} someone, even though they keep hurting you, you're so naive and you love them {{so much that you}} put all the negative behind <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> keep getting hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{is written}} from the {{perspectives}} of Keys and Usher, who play the role of an ex-couple. For him, Usher and Keys [...] "talk about how they used to be in love and how those feelings are still lingering despite the two not being involved anymore." [...] For Keys, [...] "The song is talking about the first person you ever really had feelings for. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> move on and meet new people, you always remember that first person." ...|$|E

So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E

500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E
500|$|DeeKay of SoulCulture {{commented that}} [...] "even with the straightforward, hugely {{predictable}} electro-pop on the Swedish House Mafia-produced 'Numb' and 'Euphoria', Usher is operating {{at a level}} above his David Guetta and RedOne-loving peers." [...] Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that [...] "Numb" [...] is a single quality track, [...] "which we can see seeping through the radio {{in the latter half}} of 2012– with the mantra of letting your problems go and dance." [...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> can call it [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E
500|$|Critics commented {{positively}} on {{the development}} of Will and Emma's relationship; TV Guide Natalie Abrams wrote that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode. Flandez felt that the kiss made the [...] "poignant moment" [...] of the glee club's final performance [...] "even more dear", and hoped {{that it would not be}} the last between them, while Aly Semigran of MTV praised the development and called the kiss [...] "sweet [...] longing". Goldman wrote: [...] "Schue and Emma finally coming together was very hard to not feel good about, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> know it just won't be that easy when the show returns". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was clear Ken and Emma would not marry, and added that when Will kissed Emma: [...] "I died". In discussing Will and Emma's conversation about how she would have left Ken if Will had shown any interest in her, Pardue commented: [...] "That's maybe the sweetest and the saddest thing I've ever heard." [...] She called the kiss between Will and Emma [...] "romantic" [...] commenting that it made her [...] "heart happy". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson commented that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, or [...] "before she smiled approvingly after their kiss", questioning whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship, or [...] "about freakin' time".|$|E

5000|$|EPA {{whistleblower}} Hugh Kaufman gave {{an interview}} to Democracy Now {{during the height of}} the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill news coverage and explained his views on the use of Corexit, saying [...] "EPA now is taking the position that they really don’t know how dangerous it is, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> if <b>you</b> read the label, it tells you how dangerous it is. And, for example, in the Exxon Valdez case, people who worked with dispersants, most of them are dead now. The average death age is around fifty.

5000|$|The rock'n'roll {{spirit is}} not survival. Of course {{the people who}} play rock'n'roll should survive. But {{the essence of the}} rock'n'roll spirit to me, is that it's better to burn out really bright than to sort of decay off into infinity. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> if <b>you</b> look at it in a mature way, you'll think, [...] "well, yes ... you should decay off into infinity, and keep going along". Rock'n'roll doesn't look that far ahead. Rock'n'roll is right now. What's {{happening}} right this second. Is it bright? Or is it dim because it's waiting for tomorrow—that's what people want to know. And that's why I say that.|$|R

2500|$|In his Harmony of the Gospels, Augustine of Hippo {{produced}} a 5th-century {{attempt to explain}} away all of the apparent contradictions he was aware of. He wrote that because {{there are those who}} would [...] "rob [...] of their credit as veracious historians", [...] "we must prove that the writers in question do not stand in any antagonism to each other."

Okereke explained the album title, saying [...] "as a boxer, you have to rely on nobody else but yourself to achieve what it is you want to achieve. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>you</b> take hits, you have to keep focus on your priorities and keep going.
