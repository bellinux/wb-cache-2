We aimed to describe and analyze connectedness in a regional network of <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> involved in ambulatory treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods Observational study with 104 <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> who had joined a newly established network (ParkinsonNet) {{were asked to complete}} a pre-structured form to report on their professional contacts with others in the network. Using social networks methods, network measures were calculated for the total network and for the networks of individual <b>health</b> <b>professionals.</b> We planned to test differences between subgroups of <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> regarding 12 network measures, using a random permutation method. Results Ninety-six <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> (92 %) provided data on 101 professionals. The reciprocity of reported connections was 0. 42 in the network of professional contacts. Measures characterizing the individual networks showed a wide variation; e. g., density varied between 0 and 100 % (mean value 28. 4 %). <b>Health</b> <b>professionals</b> with ≥ 10 PD patients had higher values on 7 out of 12 network measures compare to those with Conclusions Our measure of professional connectedness proved to be feasible in a regional disease-specific network of <b>health</b> <b>professionals.</b> Network measures describing patterns in the professional contacts showed relevant variation across professionals.

40|$|The recruitment, education, {{training}} {{and support of}} allied <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> in rural and remote Australia is {{a major issue in}} the provision of appropriate levels of care to rural communities. Allied <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> are an essential element of primary health care teams but are often more readily available in city than country areas. Who are the allied <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> we are talking about? Allied <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> in the context of rural practice most commonly include physiotherapists, podiatrists, occupa-tional therapists, speech pathologists, clinical psychologists, social workers, audiologists, podiatrists, dieticians and radiographers. Allied <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> broadly encompass terti-ary trained <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> other than medical practitioners, nurses, dentists, pharma-cists and administrators. There are a number of issues faced by al-lied <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> that are unique to rural and remote practice. These include utilising different service delivery techniques, a short-age of specific education on rural and remote practice, professional isolation, limited career progression, social isolation and family issues. Other <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> in rural and remote practice face many of the same issues. Allied <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> have to modify their service deliv-ery techniques for use in rural and remote practice. These service delivery techniques are “characterised by designing programs for others to carry out; reliance on other professionals to provide fol-low up; delegation of tasks; emphasis on patient/client self-management; telephone consultation; one-off visits for assess-ment and intervention strategies; improvisation and use of less specialized equipment. ” (Bishop 1996) 24 Hours: A {{day in the life of}} a larrikin from Cooktown [...] ...|$|R

Interviewees were self-selecting responders to an invitation for rural <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> who were ‘formally or informally generating community associations or networking that produced social outcomes’. We found that rural <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> initiated many community activities with social outcomes, most related to health.
