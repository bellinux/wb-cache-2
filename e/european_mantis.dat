50|$|As adults, {{both sexes}} have a {{distinctive}} white spot on their wings. They have a yellowish color on their inner fore leg distinguishable {{from the black}} eyespot and white dots of the <b>European</b> <b>mantis</b> Mantis religiosa with which it shares some range.|$|E
50|$|This {{species of}} mantis, {{although}} similar {{in size to}} the common <b>European</b> Praying <b>mantis</b> (Mantis religiosa), is easily distinguished by the protrusion from its crown. Both male and females, even from first hatching carry this tall extension giving them a very alien appearance. They live {{in areas that are}} warm and dry and use their cryptic colouring of either greens and pinks or various shades of brown to keep them hidden from predators. The female may grow to a length of 10cm while the male is shorter and slimmer. The male has distinctive ‘feather’ type antennae as shown on the image above.|$|R
50|$|Vápenice is also {{important}} from an entomological point of view. There live a number of insects dependent on the local shrub-steppe grasslands. Some of notable species which were observed here are for example <b>European</b> <b>Mantis</b> (Mantis religiosa) and butterfly Jersey Tiger (Euplagia quadripunctaria).|$|E
50|$|Many {{species are}} found in North America, the three most common being the <b>European</b> <b>Mantis</b> (Mantis religiosa), the Chinese Mantis (Tenodera sinensis), and the Carolina Mantis (Stagmomantis carolina). Of these, only the last is native to the {{continent}} - the European and Chinese species were introduced in the 20th century as predators {{in an attempt to}} control pest populations in gardens.|$|E
50|$|A. falcata is {{relatively}} easy to breed in captivity and has become widely distributed through the pet trade. Females have a lifespan of about 6 months at 25-30 °C, laying up to 16 slender oothecae at 8 day intervals. Each ootheca usually contains 25-35 eggs, which hatch after 16-19 days. From hatching to adulthood takes about 2 months and 7 molts. Male adults live up to a month after their final molt, and are often able to escape unharmed after mating, rather than falling prey to the female as in the <b>European</b> <b>mantis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Juveniles {{require a}} host {{in which to}} {{complete}} their development. Upon emergence from the egg the larva swims about until it is consumed by a host insect. Most Gordius worms are parasites of beetles. Other recorded hosts include mantids such as the <b>European</b> <b>mantis</b> (Mantis religiosa) and Hierodula membranacea, Idolomantis diabolica, Sphodromantis viridis, and Stagmatoptera praecaria. Species have been observed in caddisfly and mosquito larvae. Once ingested by the insect the worm larva penetrates the gut wall and develops in a cyst in the tissue outside. It emerges as an adult worm in a few months.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>mantis</b> or Mantis religiosa {{is a large}} hemimetabolic insect in {{the family}} of the Mantidae (‘mantids’), which is the largest family of the order Mantodea (mantises). Their common name—praying mantis—is derived from the {{distinctive}} posture of the first pair of legs that can be observed in animals in repose. It resembles a praying attitude. Both males and females have elongated bodies with two pair of wings. The most striking features that all Mantodea share are a very mobile, triangular head with large compound eyes and their first pair of legs (the ‘raptorial legs’) which is highly modified for the efficient capture and restrain of fast moving or flying prey.|$|E
50|$|Mantids show strong deimatic display {{from very}} early life stages on. This {{behavior}} can be observed throughout different groups of animals and is used to scare or startle potential predators {{in order to give}} the attacked animal a chance to escape. The deimatic display in M. religiosa involves wing spreading and bending of the raptorial legs to reveal two matched black eyespots with a yellow or white center {{at the base of the}} coxae (the base of the leg). It makes the animal appear much larger and more of a threat to the attacker. The black eyespots are also a distinct feature for species discrimination of the <b>European</b> <b>mantis.</b> Another unique feature of M. religiosa is its midline metathoracic ear (see Ultrasound avoidance). This “tympanal auditory organ” is an unpaired structure found on the ventral side of the animal on the metathorax between the third pair of legs. Unlike other sound-processing organs found among different groups of insects, the metathoracic ear has a high sensitivity across high and low frequencies and even ultrasound. Therefore the authors call it a ‘true ear’.|$|E
