50|$|In 2009, {{in order}} to protect {{threatened}} salmon and steelhead under CWA and ESA, EPA and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) recommended limits on the use of chlorpyrifos in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington and requested that manufacturers voluntarily add buffer zones, application limits and <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> to the standard labeling requirements for all chlorpyrifos-based products. Manufacturers rejected the request. In February 2013 in Dow AgroSciences vs NMFS, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated EPA’s order for these labeling requirements. In August 2014, in the settlement of a suit brought by environmental and fisheries advocacy groups against EPA in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, EPA agreed to re-instate no-spray stream buffer zones in California, Oregon and Washington, restricting aerial spraying (300 ft.) and ground-based applications (60 ft.) near salmon populations. These buffers will remain until EPA makes a permanent decision in consultation with NMFS.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{testing has}} been {{conducted}} since the 1860 's {{in order to help}} define safe levels of chemical contaminants in lakes, rivers and coastal waters. The historical emphasis on acute lethality testing of chemicals has more recently focussed on long term sublethal effects of chemicals on fish and their prey species. <b>Fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> testing is now embedded in much environment legislation on chemical safety while it is recognized that animal use should be Replaced, Reduced and Refined (the 3 Rs) where possible. The OECD <b>Fish</b> <b>Toxicity</b> Testing Framework provides a useful structure with which {{to address the needs of}} environmental safety assessment whilst implementing the 3 Rs.

50|$|<b>Fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> {{syndrome}} (FATS) {{is a set}} {{of common}} chemical and functional responses in fish resulting from a short-term, acute exposure to a lethal concentration of a toxicant, a chemical or material that can produce an unfavorable effect in a living organism. By definition, modes of action are characterized by FATS because the combination of common responses that represent each <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> syndrome characterize an adverse biological effect. Therefore, toxicants that have the same mode of action elicit similar sets of responses in the organism and can be classified by the same <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> syndrome.|$|R
40|$|<b>Fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> {{studies are}} {{required}} for environmental hazard and risk assessment of chemicals by national and international legislations such as REACH, the regulations of plant protection products and biocidal products, or the GHS (globally harmonised system) for classification and labelling of chemicals. Alternative methods like QSARs (quantitative structure-activity relationships) can replace many ecotoxicity tests. However, complete substitution of in vivo animal tests by in silico methods may not be realistic. For the so-called baseline toxicants, {{it is possible to}} predict the <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> with sufficient accuracy from log Kow and, hence, valid QSARs can replace in vivo testing. In contrast, excess toxicants and chemicals not reliably classified as baseline toxicants require further in silico, in vitro or in vivo assessments. Thus, the critical task is to discriminate between baseline and excess toxicants. For <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity,</b> we derived a scheme based on structural alerts and physicochemical property thresholds to classify chemicals as either baseline toxicants (=predictable by QSARs) or as potential excess toxicants (=not predictable by baseline QSARs). The step-wise approach identifies baseline toxicants (true negatives) in a precautionary way to avoid false negative predictions. Therefore, a certain fraction of false positives can be tolerated, i. e. baseline toxicants without specific effects that may be tested instead of predicted. Application of the classification scheme to a new heterogeneous dataset for diverse fish species results in 40 % baseline toxicants, 24 % excess toxicants and 36 % compounds not classified. Thus, we can conclude that replacing about half of the <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> tests by QSAR predictions is realistic to be achieved in the short-term. The long-term goals are classification criteria also for further groups of toxicants and to replace as many in vivo <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> tests as possible with valid QSAR predictions...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{concern about}} the adverse {{environmental}} and human health effects {{of a wide range}} of micropollutants requires the development of novel tools and approaches to enable holistic monitoring of their occurrence, fate and effects in the aquatic environment. A European-wide demonstration program (EDP) for effect-based monitoring of micropollutants in surface waters was carried out within the Marie Curie Initial Training Network EDA-EMERGE. The main objectives of the EDP were to apply a simplified protocol for effect-directed analysis, to link biological effects to target compounds and to estimate their risk to aquatic biota. Onsite large volume solid phase extraction of 50 L of surface water was performed at 18 sampling sites in four European river basins. Extracts were subjected to effect-based analysis (<b>toxicity</b> to algae, <b>fish</b> embryo <b>toxicity,</b> neurotoxicity, (anti-) estrogenicity, (anti-) androgenicity, glucocorticoid activity and thyroid activity), to target analysis (151 organic micropollutants) and to nontarget screening. The most pronounced effects were estrogenicity, toxicity to algae and <b>fish</b> embryo <b>toxicity.</b> In most bioassays, major portions of the observed effects could not be explained by target compounds, especially in case of androgenicity, glucocorticoid activity and <b>fish</b> embryo <b>toxicity.</b> Estrone and nonylphenoxyacetic acid were identified as the strongest contributors to estrogenicity, while herbicides, with a minor contribution from other micropollutants, were linked to the observed toxicity to algae. Fipronil and nonylphenol were partially responsible for the <b>fish</b> embryo <b>toxicity.</b> Within the EDP, 21 target compounds were prioritized on the basis of their frequency and extent of exceedance of predicted no effect concentrations. The EDP priority list included 6 compounds, which are already addressed by European legislation, and 15 micropollutants that may be important for future monitoring of surface waters. The study presents a novel simplified protocol for effect-based monitoring and draws a comprehensive picture of the surface water status across Europe...|$|R

40|$|Acute <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{testing is}} an {{important}} component of the environmental hazard assessment of chemicals. Since many years, (zebra-) fish embryo-based methods have been proposed as alternatives to the acute <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> test carried out with juvenile or adult fish. On behalf of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the European Union Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing (EURL ECVAM) coordinated during 2008 - 2012 the validation of the zebrafish embryo acute toxicity test method (ZFET) to evaluate its reproducibility in support to the development of an OECD Test Guideline. In parallel to this study, Belanger and colleagues continued to collect acute fish embryo toxicity and acute <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> data to assess the relevance, predictive capacity and applicability of the ZFET and submitted their report to EURL ECVAM in July 2012. Following independent scientific peer review by EURL ECVAM's Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) of both studies and having considered input from regulators, stakeholders, international partners and the general public, EURL ECVAM concluded that the ZFET - being available as OECD TG 236 since 2013 – should be used for generating information on acute <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity,</b> where appropriate. Its use would result in an overall reduction of the numbers of juvenile and adult fish for aquatic toxicity testing. It is recognised that further guidance on the use of OECD TG 236 across the various regulatory frameworks and regions should be developed addressing in particular the possible use of the ZFET to generate information on acute <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> and its potential limitations.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} from natural pyrethrins to synthetic pyrethroids, their applications have expanded from household insecticides {{for indoor use}} against sanitary pests to outdoor use for agriculture, forestry, animal health, termite control, and many other pest situations. However, high <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> and development of pyrethroid resistance in some pests have been cited as common shortcomings of pyrethroids. To overcome these pyrethroid problems such as high <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity,</b> Katsuda and fellow scientists invented silafluofen by introducing a silicone atom into the pyrethroidal chemical structure in 1984. In addition to the high insecticidal activity and low mammalian toxicity, this compound features low <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity,</b> chemical stability under sunlight, in the soil and under alkaline environments. These features make silafluofen unique among pyrethroids. In Japan, silafluofen {{has been used as}} an agricultural insecticide for 15 years since 1995 for various plants, especially useful for paddy rice protection because of its low <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Over the last 20 years, silafluofen-based termiticides including emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and oil formulations have been widely used in Japan for soil treatment and timber treatments. Additional silafluofen product lines include anti-termitic plastic sheets which are laid under buildings. In this paper, literature on the development of silafluofen and its use in Japan are reviewed. On the other hand, in Thailand, we proceeded with development works of silafluofen-based termiticides from 2005 by starting laboratory efficacy tests and field efficacy tests in Phuket. Both laboratory and field tests showed good efficacy as a soil termiticide, suggesting that the material will perform well for commercial use in high biological hazard environments such as Thailand and can be used in environments close to water where <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> might be a concern with other pyrethroids...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> tests play an {{important}} role in environmental risk assessment and hazard classification because they allow for first estimates of the relative toxicity of various chemicals in various species. However, such tests need to be carefully interpreted. Here we shortly summarize the main issues which are linked to the genetics and the condition of the test animals, the standardized test situations, the uncertainty about whether a given test species can be seen as representative to a given fish fauna, the often missing knowledge about possible interaction effects, especially with micropathogens, and statistical problems like small sample sizes and, in some cases, pseudoreplication. We suggest that multi-factorial embryo tests on ecologically relevant species solve many of these issues, and we shortly explain how such tests could be done to avoid the weaker points of <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> tests...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to complement analyses according to the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) with a sediment toxicity analysis as part of an integrated river assessment. To this end, Hessian water courses were analyzed using the sediment quality triad concept according to Chapman with chemical analyses, in situ effect evaluations, and ecotoxicological assessments. For the ecotoxicological assessment (<b>fish</b> embryo <b>toxicity</b> test with Danio rerio), a new evaluation scheme was developed, the fish teratogenicity index (FTI), that allows for a classification of sediments into ecological quality classes compliant to the WFD. Materials and methods: Sediment and macrozoobenthos samples were taken from tributaries of the rivers Fulda and Lahn. Sediments were characterized regarding particle size, carbon, heavy metals, and polyaromatic hydrocarbon content. Macroinvertebrate samples were taken via multi-habitat sampling. The <b>fish</b> embryo <b>toxicity</b> te st with D. rerio was conducted as a contact assay on the basis of DIN 38415 - 6. Results and discussion: The integrated assessment indicated a significant influence of heavy metals and carbon content on macroinvertebrate communities. The bioaccessibility of sediment pollutants were clearly demonstrated by the FTI, which showed a wide range of adverse effects. A significant linear relationship between metals and the FTI was detected. However, there was no statistically significant evidence that macroinvertebrate communities were affected by the hydromorphological quality elements at the sampling sites. Conclusions: The new scheme for the assessment of <b>fish</b> embryo <b>toxicity</b> test was successfully applied. The results suggest that sediment compounds impact macroinvertebrate communities and early development of fish. It demonstrates that the quality of sediments should be evaluated on a routine basis as part of an integrated river assessment...|$|R
40|$|Hydroquinone when {{added to}} the {{aquarium}} water {{was found to be}} about a hundred times more toxic than phenol, to goldfish (and to Daphnia magna), but is only about twice as toxic when injected into fish or mammals. Tertiarybutyl catechol shows a similar high toxicity in the aquarium, while the toxicity of catechol, resorcinol, and pyrogallol approaches more closely that of phenol. As the substances of high aquarium toxicity are known to inhibit many oxidative and polymerizing autocatalytic "chain reactions," rank correlations were tabulated between the recorded inhibitory potency of various substances in these processes, and their aquarium toxicity for goldfish. The correlation between aquarium <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> and electric oxidation potential (P 0. 09) is more than suggestive, and becomes still more so if explainable discrepancies are excluded. Antioxidant fat stabilizers show suggestive correlation with <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> (0. 20), and better with electric oxidation potential (0. 10). The photographic reduction potential gives suggestive correlation with <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> (0. 20) and somewhat better with the oxidation potential (0. 15). The gasoline induction period correlation is more than suggestive with the oxidation potential (0. 099), but rather poor for <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> (0. 265). The rubber anti-aging potency gives only poor correlation (0. 39) with <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity.</b> The reasons for these divergencies are not clear; they may perhaps be connected with the solvent properties of the substrate. As an example, Lea (p. 175) cites that 0. 01 per cent of maleic acid prevents rancidity of fats, but is rendered ineffective by the presence of water. Taken by themselves, no one of the P values is entirely convincing of the relationships stressed in this paper. However, the consistent finding of relatively small values of P lends considerable weight to the hypothesis that these chemicals act in a related manner; and that the chemical activity of a substance may furnish useful suggestions of its biologic potency, perhaps more so than the chemical constitution as such. The aquarium toxicity, for goldfish is a convenient means of classifying the biologic potency...|$|E

30|$|NOEC {{values as}} {{toxicity}} measures derived by hypothesis testing depend strongly on the statistical {{design of a}} study (e.g., the number of selected test concentrations and replicates), {{but they do not}} relate to an identical fixed-effect level across studies with identical designs [19]. Yet, the CA concept assumes that the effect concentrations used for the individual components in the mixture relate to a defined fixed-effect level, e.g., 50 % inhibition. The large and frequent deviations between predicted and measured chronic Daphnia and <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> of the combination products in the present study demonstrate that the use of NOEC values results in a much higher unreliability of mixture toxicity predictions in comparison to using ECx values as input data. The use of ECx values for the growth inhibition of Lemna and algae (a chronic endpoint) resulted in an overall good compliance between mixture toxicity prediction and observation. This indicates that the reason of unreliable predictions for chronic Daphnia and <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> is not a per se non-predictability of chronic effects by mixture toxicity concepts but rather due to the violation of the fixed-effect level assumption of the CA concept by using NOEC values. As heterogeneity in the input data decreases the reliability of the mixture toxicity prediction, {{it could be argued that}} the large variability particularly in the chronic fish studies caused the poor compliance. However, using NOEC values from highly standardized D. magna reproduction tests (relatively low data heterogeneity) achieved a similar frequency distribution of MDR values as for chronic <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Overall, the use of NOEC data for CA-based mixture toxicity predictions is not advocated.|$|E

30|$|Overestimation {{of product}} {{toxicity}} was particularly evident for fish. This may indicate a generally lower {{sensitivity of the}} fish embryo toxicity test (conducted with the products in the present study) compared to an adult fish mortality test (from which the input data for single substances originate). While reported correlations between acute toxicity in fish embryos and adult fish are highly significant [19, 25, 29], the toxicity for an individual substance can easily differ by one to three orders of magnitude between the two life stages [26, 29]. Hence, a deviation between the predicted and observed <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> by about factor 10 appears as {{within the range of}} predictability. Life stage-specific toxicity may particularly explain the strong overestimation of <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> for product 22, which contained the pyrethroid permethrin. Pyrethroids are neurotoxic agents, a mode-of-action group that was found to exhibit low or no toxicity towards fish embryos in contrast to the high toxicity observed in adult fish [25]. While results were not conclusive for permethrin in that study [25], the present study does support in line with [26] the lack of correlation between the two fish life stages for the toxicity of permethrin.|$|E

In line with such research, {{the objective of}} this study was to determine what factors influence the correlation between in vitro and <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> data. Basal cytotoxicity (IC(50)) and acute toxicity data from fathead minnow (LC(50)) of 82 industrial organic chemicals were obtained from the Halle Registry of Cytotoxicity and the US EPA Fathead Minnow Database.

Using multiple regression analysis, the octanol-water partition coefficient (K(OW)) and the Henry's Law Constant (H) were found to significantly explain the low absolute sensitivity. The mode of action (MOA) of the chemical was found to significantly explain the general variation in the logIC(50) /log LC(50) regression line.

The evaluation of existing data on Daphnia and <b>fish</b> <b>toxicity</b> testing shows that acute-to-chronic extrapolation represents a reasonable approach for environmental hazard estimation by considering an adequate assessment factor.

Data variability is of interest to predict uncertainties and refinement options. The study indicates that bioactive compounds such as pesticides as well as polar narcotics show increased ACRs. On the other hand, non-polar narcosis is associated with reduced ACRs.

30|$|Posters in {{this session}} {{provided}} information on chemical-specific effects {{as well as}} new methodological approaches. The toxic effects of nanomaterial-bound antifungal agents, TCC, pharmaceuticals (e.g., metoprolol), metals (methylmercury and lead chromate), and pesticides (i.e., metamitron) were investigated using a variety of aquatic bioassays. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was applied to predict the internal exposure concentrations in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) organs based on in vivo exposure concentrations. <b>Fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> was predicted using the rainbow trout gill cell line (RTgill-W 1) as an animal-free alternative to the <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> testing. It was demonstrated that results of an in vitro metabolism assay developed for rainbow trout were transferrable to other species, such as common carp, and the presence of a defense system in early life stages of rainbow trout was confirmed. Effect-directed analysis (EDA) was shown to be a promising tool for water quality assessment, combining the advantages of bioassays with chemical analytics to identify compounds causing toxicity. EDA was used to identify the source of unexplained toxic and teratogenic activities found in surface water receiving untreated wastewater discharges in Germany. Complementary to the more established in vitro bioassays, a small-scale genotoxicity assay (micronucleus tests) with a zebrafish liver cell line and larvae was successfully incorporated into EDA studies. Finally, the relevance of pulsed dosing tests in higher-tier risk assessment of plant production products (PPP) was highlighted.|$|R
40|$|Rotenone, {{a natural}} {{compound}} derived from plants {{of the genera}} Derris and Lonchocarpus, is used worldwide as a pesticide and piscicide. This study aims to assess short-term toxicity of rotenone to early-life stages of the fish Danio rerio and Poecilia reticulata using a wide and integrative range of biomarkers (developmental, biochemical, behavioral, and histopathological). Moreover, the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach {{was used to compare}} rotenone acute <b>toxicity</b> to <b>fish</b> species. <b>Toxicity</b> tests were based on the OECD protocols, <b>fish</b> embryo <b>toxicity</b> test (for D. rerio embryos), and <b>fish</b> acute <b>toxicity</b> test (for P. reticulata juveniles). D. rerio embryos were used to estimate lethal concentrations and analyze embryonic and enzymatic alterations (activity of catalase, glutathione- S-transferase, and cholinesterase), while P. reticulata juveniles were used for the assessment of histological damage in the gills and liver. Rotenone induced significant mortality in zebrafish embryos with a 96 -h lethal concentration 50 % (LC 50) = 12. 2 μg/L. Rotenone was embryotoxic, affecting the development of D. rerio embryos, which showed cardiac edema; tail deformities; loss of equilibrium; and a general delay characterized by lack of tail detachment, delayed somite formation, yolk sac absorption, and lack of pigmentation. Biochemical biomarker inhibition was observed for concentrations ≥ 1 μg/L for CAT and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and for cholinesterase (ChE) in concentration from 10 μg/L. Behavioral changes were observed for P. reticulata juveniles exposed to concentrations equal to or above 25 μg/L of rotenone; moreover, histological damage in the liver and gills of fish exposed to concentrations equal to or above 2. 5 μg/L could be observed. A hazard concentration 5 % (HC 5) of 3. 2 μg/L was estimated considering the acute toxicity data for different fish species (n= 49). Lethal and sublethal effects of rotenone raise a concern about its effects on nontarget fish species, especially because rotenone and its metabolite rotenolone are frequently reported in the microgram range in natural environments for several days after field applications. Rotenone should be used with caution. Given the high toxicity and wide range of sublethal effects here reported, further studies in a chronic exposure scenario are recommended...|$|R
