25|$|Experiments {{were tried}} in fitting carbon skids for current {{collection}} instead of trolley wheels, and five cars were experimentally fitted: these were {{reputed to be}} nos. 74, 121, 136, 147 and 160; the last three <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> skids. A bow collector was suggested, but as the skids were not considered a success, nothing further was done about this, and these cars later had wheels refitted.|$|E
25|$|After Uragan was {{commissioned}} four more ships were laid down for {{service in the}} Far East, two each at Leningrad and Nikolayev. They were built in sections and transported {{by the end of}} 1933 to the Dalzavod Shipyard in Vladivostok for assembly. The four Series III ships were laid down in 1934, three at the Zhandov Yard and one at the Marti Yard. One ship from each shipyard were sent to the Far East. Sources differ if these ships were simply repeats of the Series I ships or if they had been improved in detail and known as Project 39. These changes were fairly minor, other than some improvements to the turbines that it was hoped would increase speed by a knot or so. The two ships of Series IV <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> the improvements and were built at Leningrad for service with the Baltic Fleet.|$|E

500|$|Three {{days later}} Kirchherr met Lennon, McCartney and Best at the Hamburg airport (they were {{returning}} to Hamburg to perform) {{and told them}} Sutcliffe {{had died of a}} brain haemorrhage. Harrison and manager Brian Epstein arrived on another plane sometime later with Sutcliffe's mother, who had been informed by telegram. Harrison and Lennon were helpful towards the distraught Kirchherr, with Lennon telling her one day that she <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> to decide if she wanted to [...] "Live or die, there is no other question." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode is}} a {{favorite}} of both creator Carter, who calls it his favorite episode of the first season and actress Gillian Anderson. Co-writer Morgan also praises it as a script he is proud of. Director Nutter says of the episode, [...] "I think it's the most accomplished piece of directing of actors I've been able to do ... I think this episode really made a difference in how the audience looks at Scully. I think it brought a lot of dimension to her character and for her person it <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> a lot of impact." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> a knack for that".|$|E

5000|$|One example would be: [...] "Every unicorn <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> a horn on its forehead". It {{does not}} imply that there are any unicorns at all in the world, and thus it cannot be assumed that, if the {{statement}} were true, somewhere there is a unicorn in the world (with a horn on its forehead). The statement, if assumed true, implies only that if there were any unicorns, each would <b>definitely</b> <b>have</b> a horn on its forehead.|$|R

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, Blaine's musical {{performances}} leading the Warblers became so prevalent that he was called out for it on-screen. Criss offered the insight: [...] "Blaine <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> his moment in the sun. I think it's time to focus back on the characters that fans of the show really know and love. Completely objectively from watching the show, I was like, 'Why does Blaine get all these songs? This is ridiculous. I want to hear other people doing stuff.' I think we're focusing a little more back on New Directions and taking {{a little bit of a}} break from the Warblers." ...|$|E
500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} {{that he had been}} in a motor vehicle accident in September 2007 and had fractured his clavicle, and had subsequently decided to expand the band from four to five members. By the time of the live recording, he had healed sufficiently to both perform as frontman and play guitar, and the band was reduced back to its normal size of four members. This was Wednesday 13's first live album. In an interview with SF Weekly, Wednesday 13 spoke about his touring band. [...] "This is like my favorite lineup that I've ever had, and I've <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> members come and go for many different reasons over the years." ...|$|E
500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} Jay Worth found {{inspiration for}} the ash storyline from holding his grandmother-in-law's hands while at her funeral. He noted during production, [...] "The Ash Man <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> {{its own set of}} challenges, because we wanted to utilize a lot of real elements, and because we didn't have the time to do all the simulation and particle work needed to make it look real. The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot: This half-disintegrated body with a pile of ash for the head on the ground. It ended up being a layering, compositing, tweaking challenge beyond belief. I got to shoot the elements myself and had more control over them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Zack Furniss's {{score of}} 7/10 on Destructoid said that [...] "Solid and <b>definitely</b> <b>has</b> an audience. There {{could be some}} hard-to-ignore faults, but the {{experience}} is fun." ...|$|R

500|$|The Cambridge's men's {{president}} Leichter was {{generous in}} defeat: [...] "It was 100% fair. It was very painful but they took us round {{the outside of}} Surrey and we couldn't respond" [...] while four-time winner Louloudis was content: [...] "We stuck to our plan and executed a really good race". [...] Oxford's coach Bowden said of his eleven victories with the Dark Blues in the event, [...] "they are all different and tough but we came together well". [...] He went on to honour the former Oxford coach Dan Topolski {{who had died in}} February: [...] "We <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> Dan in our hearts throughout the campaign and we’re just so pleased to have won in style for him".|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney {{told that}} Staley wasn't {{the only one}} battling addiction. [...] "He was the focal point, like singers are. So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. I <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the {{greatest}} career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There was a bit of trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> every single door shut in my face... there were {{not a lot of people}} who stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E

500|$|After the tour, Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich, who, {{according}} to Yorke, [...] "gave us a walloping kick up the arse". In October 2006, recording started at Tottenham House in Marlborough, Wiltshire, a country house scouted by Godrich where Radiohead worked for three weeks. The band members lived in caravans, as {{the building was}} in a state of disrepair; Yorke described it as [...] "derelict in the stricter sense of the word, where there's holes in the floor, rain coming through the ceilings, half the window panes missing ... There were places you just basically didn't go. It <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> an effect. It had some pretty strange vibes." [...] The sessions were productive, and the band recorded [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] and [...] "Bodysnatchers". In October, Yorke wrote on Dead Air Space that Radiohead had [...] "started the record properly now ... starting to get somewhere I think. Finally." ...|$|E
500|$|Bhatti {{was already}} known to EastEnders {{executive}} producer Bryan Kirkwood when he auditioned for the part, as Kirkwood and Bhatti worked on Coronation Street {{at the same}} time. Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef. In fact, Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef, as she [...] "thought that he <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> the quality that Yusef would need—which is a very ambiguous but charming quality!" [...] Bhatti explained to Digital Spy that the EastEnders cast are very welcoming. He explained: [...] "They're so welcoming. There's a lot of joking about. I'm {{having a great time}} at EastEnders - it's a real privilege to be here. I've known Nitin and Nina Wadia, who plays Zainab, {{for a very long time}} and we've always got on very well. Nitin and I play tense scenes together so it's nice that we can have a laugh afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2012, Aguilera {{revealed}} that the album was taking a while to record because [...] "I don't like to just get songs from producers. I like them {{to come from a}} personal place... I'm very excited. It's fun, exciting, introspective, it's going to be great". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Aguilera said that the album was a [...] "very multi-layered, very heartfelt record" [...] reflecting different sides of her personality. On Lotus, Aguilera worked with new producers, notably Alex da Kid and Max Martin. Alex da Kid, who first teamed with Aguilera in the song [...] "Castle Walls" [...] from T.I.'s No Mercy (2010), commented about Aguilera's approach [...] in recording Lotus, [...] "She <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> a strong opinion, but she'll go with the best idea in the room. That's really rare for someone that's had so much success." [...] Speaking about working with Max Martin, Aguilera said, [...] "Max is legendary in the business. He's known about me but we haven't crossed paths. [...] It's taken us a decade in the same business and watching each other from a distance, so for us to now come together and respect each other's work ethic and how we like to be heard and making a marriage out of it, I think 'Your Body' is the best culmination of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Minor Threat's {{influence}} is still obvious in tracks like [...] "Face to Face," [...] but The Faith <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> {{their own thing}} going on. For one thing, Alec's voice is totally spiteful, and the slow songs really have a darkness that no other D.C. band came near to. His intense vocals were what really set them apart from any of their hardcore contemporaries. Instead of [...] just the normal-typical hardcore brash screaming and pushing everything all in one verse, Alec {{had a way of}} making these minute blast songs almost melodic without compromising or losing any intensity.|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{said that}} he [...] "was in a rather unique position" [...] in the {{disinformation}} campaign: [...] "judging by {{the positions of the}} people I knew to be directly involved in it, [...] <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> something to do with national security. There was no way I was going to allow the opportunity to pass me by ... I would play the disinformation game, get my hands dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing I was doing what they wanted me to do, and all the while continuing to burrow my way into the matrix so as {{to learn as much as}} possible about who was directing it and why."(ibid., 164) ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, at the Australian Open, Levine beat Martín Vassallo Argüello of Argentina, a 26-year-old veteran ranked # 77 in the world, {{to advance}} to the Open's second round. [...] There, Levine played a scrappy match against fellow lefty, No. 24 seed Jarkko Nieminen. [...] But despite serving for the set at 5–3 in both the second and third sets, Levine went down 2–6, 5–7, 6–7(2–7) to the Finn. [...] "I felt like I was right there, and <b>definitely</b> <b>had</b> my chances {{in the second and third}} (sets). I have to work on {{converting}} a little better", said Levine. [...] "Maybe I got a little too antsy, and tried to go for a little too much, maybe stepped too hard on the pedal instead of taking a foot off." ...|$|E
