40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 27 - 29, 1971 / Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D. C. The <b>Improved</b> <b>TIROS</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Satellite</b> (ITOS) System uses a {{spacecraft}} in a sun-synchronous (1500 L) polar orbit. A two-channel scanning radiometer on the spacecraft provides information in the. 52 - to. 73 - micrometer visible range and the 10. 5 - to 12. 5 - micrometer infrared water vapor window. Operational processing of the scanning radiometer data leads to mapped products and derived products. In the former the image data are transformed {{to fit a}} common type of map projection such as polar stereographic or mercator. Derived products are the measurements and interpretive type products obtained from the gridded or mapped imagery. Automated procedures are being developed to derive quantitative information from mapped image data. Parameters sought include the sea-surface temperature and cloud top temperature which {{can be converted to}} height. Procedures are also being developed which combine the data from the two channels to derive quantitative information...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the SEDS was to build a versatile, yet economical, interactive system on the existing digital PDP 11 / 45 computers used in the Skylab production processing system. Previous experience on various interactive systems gave some background in the best methods of handling image data, registering and correcting the data, and extracting useful information from the images. The screwworm was eliminated {{in many parts of the}} United States by air-dropping sterile screwworms in areas where screwworms breed. The reproduction of the screwworm can be more or less predicted based on weather conditions [...] cold weather slows the breeding, warm weather fosters it, and some moisture appears to enhance breeding conditions which, in turn, improves the chances of screwworm population growth. To obtain temperature and moisture conditions from remote areas, the NOAA <b>improved</b> <b>TIROS</b> <b>operational</b> <b>satellite</b> was selected to give data from the very high resolution radiometer (VHRR). The VHRR is a two-channel scanning instrument sensitive to energy in the visible spectrum from 0. 6 to 0. 7 micrometers and the infrared spectrum from 10. 5 to 12. 5 micrometers...|$|E
40|$|Satellite data {{analysis}} tools are developed and implemented for {{the diagnosis of}} atmospheric circulation systems over the tropical Pacific Ocean. The tools include statistical multi-variate procedures, a multi-spectral radiative transfer model, and the global spectral forecast model at NMC. Data include in-situ observations; satellite observations from VAS (moisture, infrared and visible) NOAA polar orbiters (including <b>Tiros</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Satellite</b> System (TOVS) multi-channel sounding data and OLR grids) and scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR); and European Centre for Medium Weather Forecasts (ECHMWF) analyses. A primary goal is {{a better understanding of}} the relation between synoptic structures of the area, particularly tropical plumes, and the general circulation, especially the Hadley circulation. A second goal is the definition of the quantitative structure and behavior of all Pacific tropical synoptic systems. Finally, strategies are examined for extracting new and additional information from existing satellite observations. Although moisture structure is emphasized, thermal patterns are also analyzed. Both horizontal and vertical structures are studied and objective quantitative results are emphasized...|$|R
40|$|One {{objective}} of the FIRE Cirrus IFO is to characterize relationships between cloud properties inferred from satellite observations at various scales to those obtained directly or inferred from very high resolution measurements.

McCoy site. The results of this intercomparison should be useful in planning future cloud experiments...|$|R
40|$|At the NASA Goddard Data Assimilation Office (DAO), a 1 D variational {{radiance}} {{assimilation system}} has been developed. This system, called DAOTOVS (<b>Tiros</b> <b>operational</b> vertical sounder (TOVS)), uses (A) TOVS level 1 b radiances. It has been implemented within the DAO's semi-operational system as well as within the next generation data assimilation system that uses a finite-volume dynamical core.

40|$|TOVS (<b>Tiros</b> <b>Operational</b> Vertical Sounder) is {{the suite}} of infra-red and {{microwave}} sounding instruments, including HIRS- 2 and MSU, that have flown on the NOAA Polar orbiting <b>operational</b> <b>satellites</b> TIROS-N, NOAA 6 - 14 from November 1978 {{to the present}} day. Data has been analyzed for the entire time period using a consistent methodology to produce twice daily per satellite global fields of surface skin temperature, atmospheric temperature-moisture profile, cloud top pressure, and fractional cloud cover, OLR and clear sky OLR, and precipitation. All parameters were found {{to depend on the}} orbit time of observation which differed as a function of time both because of differing initial satellite orbits and orbit drift. This must be accounted for before one can attempt to find trends in the data. Methodology to account for orbit drift will be shown. Trends will then be shown, over the 21 year period 1979 - 1999, for surface skin temperature and atmospheric temperature profile. There has been global warming near the surface which falls off rapidly with height. Trends will also be shown for values of MSU 2 R and MSU 4 which are computed from the soundings. These will be compared to trends of MSU 2 R and MSU 4 observed by Spencer and Christy. There is generally good agreement between Spencer and Christy MSU 2 R trends and those computed from the TOVS Pathfinder data set, with the largest differences over the tropics...|$|R

40|$|Ground based {{pyranometer}} {{measurements were}} combined with meteorological {{data from the}} Tiros N satellite in order to estimate clear-sky insolations at five U. S. sites for five weeks {{during the spring of}} 1979. The estimates were used to develop a semi-empirical model of clear-sky insolation for the interpretation of input data from the <b>Tiros</b> <b>Operational</b> Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Using only satellite data, the estimated standard errors in the model were about 2 percent. The introduction of ground based data reduced errors to around 1 percent. It is shown that although the errors in the model were reduced by only 1 percent, TOVS data products are still adequate for estimating clear-sky insolation...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{attempts}} to use VAS (visible IR spin scan radiometer atmospheric sounder) data for predicting tropical cyclones are reported. VAS, mounted on a GEO platform, has 14 detectors for upwelling radiance. The McIDAS software was, by the 1983 hurricane season, upgraded to providing imagery and mass, motion and moisture patterns using the satellite data, which also permitted determinations of accurate temperature and moisture profiles. Comparisons made between VAS and radiosonde data revealed fairly close agreement of satellite and in-situ conditions during the 1983 season. When combined with data from the <b>Tiros</b> <b>operational</b> vertical sounder (TOVS) to define wind streamlines and predict {{the path of a}} hurricane from data fed into numerical models, sufficiently good agreement was obtained to initiate plans to forecast a hurricane trajectory during the 1984 season...|$|R

They will deliver high-resolution sounding and also high-resolution imagery in global coverage. Three METOP spacecraft are foreseen for a sun synchronous orbit in the 9 : 30 AM equator crossing (descending node). They will provide polar data from 2006 onwards. The EPS programme is planned to cover 14 years of operation. This paper will give an overview on the EPS mission and the products and services provided to users...|$|R
