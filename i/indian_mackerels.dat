40|$|An {{attempt was}} {{conducted}} to understand the genetic population structure and historic demography of Indian mackerel, Rastrelliger kanagurta from Indian peninsular waters using mitochondrial DNA markers. A total of 241 sequences of mitochondrial control region and 271 sequences of mitochondrial ATPase gene region were amplified and analyzed in <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerels</b> collected from 10 different locations along Indian coast resulting in 123 and 155 haplotypes respectively. In addition, control region sequences representing samples from Thailand downloaded from NCBI were also used for analysis. Significant genetic differentiation (�ST value of 0. 38; P < 0. 001) was recorded between samples from mainland India, Portblair and Thailand when both control region and ATPase gene sequences were analyzed. Whilst, �ST values were not significant when analyses were carried out between samples collected from mainland India. Oceanographic and environmental barriers between mainland India, Portblair and Thailand contribute to limited larval dispersal and restricted mixing between populations resulting in subtle genetic differentiation. The lack of genetic subdivision between populations from mainland India indicates adequate gene flow and mixing within Indian waters. Bayesian skyline plots revealed a history of population expansion taken place approximately 10000 years ago coinciding with the time after the last glacial maximum or early Holocene. Intensification of monsoon events after the last glacial maximum or early Holocene along the Indian subcontinent contributed to increased productivity in the Tropical Indian Ocean and consequent demographic expansion of mackerel populations historically. Management measures for Indian mackerel populations could be devised regionally so as to conserve intra-specific diversity and biocomplexity of this important resource...|$|E
40|$|Utilization {{of fishing}} area in Banten Bay by various {{activities}} may cause multi sectors conflicts related to {{management of the}} bay. The integrated zone system in that area has not been established yet; therefore it is needed to be studied. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) determine fishing season and fishing ground; 2) determine indicators and criteria of fishing zone; 3) establish fishing zone. The study was conducted in four fish landing centers which are located in Karangantu, Terate, Wadas, and Kepuh from January to April 2010. Data were collected by surveying analyzed using the fishing season index analysis, relationship analysis between sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and fish abundance, and GIS analysis. Based on the results, it were revealed that 1) peak fishing season of pelagic fish was from November to January and demersal fish was from November to December; 2) the catches from fishing grounds surrounding Panjang island were anchovies, trevallies, squids, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerels,</b> pony fishes, Fringescale sardinella; surrounding Pamujan besar island were threadfin bream, shrimps; and surrounding Tunda island were eastern little tuna, narrow barred king mackerels, black pomfret, red snapper, great trevally, scads, mullets, squids; 3) development indicators of fishing zone were (i) feasibility of fishing ground, (ii) compatibility of fishing gears with fishing grounds, (iii) possibility of conflicts, (iv) infrastructure, (v) carrying capacity of environment; 4) Banten bay water was divided into three fishing zones, they were (i) passive zone, (ii) passive and outboard motor zone, (iii) active and inboard motor zone...|$|E
40|$|This study {{described}} the Condition factor, Length-Weight relationship, Gonadosomatic index and sex ratio of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Rastrelliger kanagurta) {{which is an}} important fish in the Kuantan coastal water, Malaysia.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine Hg levels in edible tissues of the <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> Rastrelliger kanagurta collected at Karachi Harbour of Pakistan between March 2013 and February 2014. Hg levels ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 09 with mean ± SD 0. 042 ± 0. 023 mg/kg dry wt. The Hg level in R. kanagurta is relatively low when compared to those studied {{in other parts of the}} world and is able to meet the legal standards by EU Commission Regulation and other international food standards. The findings obtained were also compared with established allowable weekly intake values. It is concluded that the Hg levels in the <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> from Karachi coasts did not exceed the permission limits (0. 5 mg/kg). The results show that the <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> appears to be useful bio-indicator due to their accumulation of Hg, however, continued sampling is required for further researches...|$|R

40|$|Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad, India {{provides}} fishery forecast services {{all along}} the Indian coast free of cost, referred to as ‘Potential Fishery Zone (PFZ) Advisories’. These services include georeferenced maps showing marked regions where probability of finding sizeable schools of fishes is high. These advisories are provided to help the fisher folks to improve their income from fishing by saving engine fuel for searching and locating fish stocks. Based on 124 controlled fishing experiments {{carried out in the}} PFZ and Non-PFZ zones along the Kerala coast during 2008 - 2012 periods, the present study evidenced that commercially important fishes were abundant in the PFZ, forming richer fisheries compared to the non-PFZ areas. The profit from controlled experiments showed consistently higher values in the PFZ than that in the non-PFZ. The highest profit during the entire controlled fishing experiments was obtained when the catch was dominated by relatively high-priced fishes such as tunas, carangids, seer fishes and <b>mackerel.</b> <b>Indian</b> oil sardine was the major single species obtained during the Northeast Monsoon (November-February), whereas, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> dominated during the Southwest Monsoon (June-October) and Spring Intermonsoon (March – May) periods. Anchovies were found to dominate only in two fishing experiments in the entire study period. The analyses of catch data of the small pelagic fishes of interest (Indian oil sardine, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Commerson’s anchovy) showed that the PFZ advisories better predicted the catches of Indian oil sardine during the Northeast Monsoon (November- February) and <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{during the rest of the}} period. Conversely, the catch data of controlled experiments showed that PFZ advisory has less efficiency to support the exploitation of anchovies. Attempts have been made to outline the recurrent PFZ along the Kerala coast based on the advisories generated for the study period (2008 - 2012). Altogether 432 PFZ advisories were digitised and month-wise repeat PFZs have been demarcated. In general, most of the very prominent recurrent PFZs were found within the 50 m depth contour. The highest number of recurrent PFZs was in December, January and February. On the other hand, the lowest number of recurrent PFZs was found in April, May and June. Plankton components in the diet of Indian oil sardine, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Commerson’s anchovy based on fortnightly fish samples analysed during a year period are presented. Coscinodiscus, Nitzschia, Pleurosigma and Thalassiosira were found in the gut of Indian oil sardine almost throughout the year, whereas microzooplankton was mostly dominant only during the October – December period. Coscinodiscus and Tintinids were predominant in the gut of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> throughout the year. Furthermore, Thalassiosira, Ceratium, Dinophysis, Protoperidinium, Pyrophacus and copepods were also found in the gut of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> almost throughout the year. The dominant value index showed the dominance of phytoplankton, microzooplankton and copepods in the diet of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> throughout the year, indicating their almost equal preference for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. The food items in the gut content of Commerson’s anchovy showed characteristic difference from both Indian oil sardine and <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and found to be a zooplankton feeder predominantly feeding on copepods, fish eggs, ostracods, lucifers and tintinids. The environmental observations based on monthly field sampling carried out in two locations (10 m and 20 m depth contours) situated off Kochi are presented. During seven out of nine observations, PFZ bands were observed around 10 m location. High values of chlorophyll (> 3 mg m- 3) were found in August, September and October, which could be attributed to the combined effect of Cochin backwater influx and upwelling. The seasonal evolution of hydrographical parameters showed significantly higher concentration of nutrients and chlorophyll during the Southwest Monsoon period compared to the rest of the sampling. The chlorophyll concentration was found to be significantly higher in 10 m location (PFZ) compared to the 20 m location (non-PFZ). The status of the Length-Weight Relationship (LWR) and condition factor of Indian oil sardine, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Commerson’s anchovy along the Kerala coast is presented. The LWR of Commerson’s anchovy is the very first detailed report from this region. LWR and condition factor of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Oil sardine were not significantly different from the values reported in the historical studies, indicating that these parameters are not affected significantly by the expected long-term environmental changes. The results of the growth and maturity studies of the small pelagic fishes of interest have been discussed. The analyses were based on a fortnightly sampling carried out in two major landing centres during 2010 – 2011 periods. The maximum life span of Indian oil sardine was estimated to be 2. 63 years. Two peaks of recruitment of juveniles to the fishery were observed; a large peak during July - August and a small peak in February - March. The length at first maturity was calculated as 15. 7 cm while the length at first capture was 15 cm, suggesting that the peak exploitation of the species occurs before they attain sexual maturity. Comparison of the length at first maturity of oil sardine reported in historical studies with the present study shows that only minor variation exists between the two. The life span of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> is estimated to be 2 years. The recruitment pattern showed the presence of mature mackerel all year round.
