25|$|The {{urbanisation}} of the Isle of Dogs {{took place}} in the 19th century following the construction of the West India Docks, which opened in 1802. This heralded the area's most successful period, when it became an important centre for trade. The East India Docks were subsequently opened in 1806, followed by Millwall Dock in 1868. By the 1880s, the casual <b>employment</b> <b>system</b> caused Dock workers to unionise under Ben Tillett and John Burns. This led to a demand for 6d per hour (2.5p), and an end to casual labour in the docks. After a bitter struggle, the London Dock Strike of 1889 was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the unionisation of casual workers.|$|E

25|$|Under the Lebanese <b>employment</b> <b>system,</b> {{recruitment}} {{agencies are}} liable to provide a replacement within {{the first three months}} after a migrant domestic worker decides to discontinue work. These first three months are a preliminary “trial period”. In order to minimize having to do this, agencies advice employers to take measures to limit the freedom of the migrant domestic workers through the confiscation of their passport and restrict their communication with the outside world. Recruitment agencies have been known to encourage employers to place restrictions on migrant domestic workers which include the confiscation of their passport and confinement to the residence. Recruitment agencies in Lebanon receive very little state supervision. A Human Rights Watch report found that workers are often made false promises about the country they are moving to, as well as the work they will do, and the conditions expected in the workplace. They are also misled about the salaries they can expect to receive.|$|E
2500|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} in {{enrollment}} practices were reforms (adopted 1986) in the faculty appointment system, which ended the [...] "iron rice bowl" [...] <b>employment</b> <b>system</b> and permitted colleges and universities to decide which academic departments, which academic majors, and how many teachers they needed. Teachers in {{institutions of higher learning}} were hired on a basis, usually for two to four years at a time. The teaching positions available on basis were teaching assistant, lecturer, associate professor, and professor. The system was tested in eight major universities in Beijing and Shanghai before it was instituted nationwide at the end of 1985. University presidents headed groups in charge of appointing professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants according to their academic levels and teaching abilities, and a more rational wage system, geared to different job levels, was inaugurated. Universities and colleges with surplus professors and researchers were advised to grant them appropriate academic titles and encourage them to work for their current pay in schools of higher learning where they were needed. The new system was to be extended to schools of all kinds and other education departments within two years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of mining deposits in Zacatecas and Guanajuato in the mid-sixteenth century {{and later in}} San Luis Potosí stimulated the Bajío's development to supply the mines with food and livestock. A network of Spanish towns was established in this region of commercial agriculture, with Querétaro also becoming a center of textile production. Although there were no dense indigenous populations or network of settlements, Indians migrated to the Bajío to work as resident employees on the region's haciendas and ranchos or rented land (terrasguerros). From diverse cultural backgrounds and with no sustaining indigenous communities, these indios were quickly hispanized, but largely remained {{at the bottom of}} the economic hierarchy. Although Indians migrated willingly to the region, they did so in such small numbers that labor shortages prompted Spanish hacendados to provide incentives to attract workers, especially in the initial boom period of the early seventeenth century. Land owners lent workers money, which could be seen as a perpetual indebtedness, but it can be seen not as coercing Indians to stay but a way estate owners sweetened their terms of employment, beyond their basic wage labor. For example, in 1775 the Spanish administrator of a San Luis Potosí estate [...] "had to scour both Mexico City and the northern towns to find enough blue French linen to satisfy the resident employees." [...] Other types of goods they received on credit were textiles, hats, shoes, candles, meat, beans, and a guaranteed ration of maize. However, where labor was more abundant or market conditions depressed, estate owners paid lower wages. The more sparsely populated northern Bajío tended to pay higher wages than the southern Bajío, which was increasingly integrated in the economy of central Mexico. The credit-based <b>employment</b> <b>system</b> often privileged those holding higher ranked positions on the estate (supervisors, craftsmen, other specialists) who were mostly white, and the estates did not demand repayment.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] During {{the past}} two decades there have been {{significant}} changes in <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> across industrialized countries. Converging Divergences: Worldwide Changes in <b>Employment</b> <b>Systems,</b> by Harry C. Katz and Owen Darbishire, examines changes since 1980 in employment practices in seven industrialized countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Japan, Sweden, and Italy—with a focus on the automotive and telecommunications industries. Katz and Darbishire find that variations in employment patterns within these countries have been increasing over {{the past two}} decades. The increase in variation is not simply a result of a decline in union strength in some sectors of the economy; variation has increased within both union and nonunion sectors. Despite this within-country divergence, Katz and Darbishire find that <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> across countries are converging toward four common patterns of work practices: a low-wage employment pattern; the human resource management (HRM) employment pattern; a Japanese-oriented employment pattern; and a joint team-based employment pattern. Significant differences in national employment-related institutions have resulted in some variation across countries in how these work patterns are implemented. Still, Katz and Darbishire find that there are 2 ̆ 2 many commonalities in the <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> of the seven countries and in the processes through which these commonalities have developed. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|The {{four major}} {{telecommunications}} local networks and network services—fixed wire line, wireless, cable television, and the Internet—are undergoing transformations propelled by network digitalization, service competition, and corporate consolidations. Using data from surveys conducted in 1998 and 2003, together with field interviews, site visits at major telecommunications firms, and discussions with industry experts, regulators, and analysts, the author examines how these forces reshaped technician <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> across these formerly specialized telecommunications networks and services. The principal {{finding is that}} despite rising inter-network competition and common digital technologies, most of these networks’ fundamental <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> continued with little change. Consistent with predictions from an evolution­ary perspective on institutional change, the three facilities-based networks—wireless, cable television distribution, and wire line—maintained distinctive <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> “imprinted” by their respective institutional histories, while the Internet Service Provid­ers exhibited fragmentation reflecting their meteoric rise and the industry’s current business difficulties and uncertain future...|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} {{undertaken}} with an intent {{to understand the}} development of structured <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> within Japanese retail companies overseas. A majority of existing studies on Japanese international management focus on national origins as {{a major source of}} the core-periphery distinction within Japanese companies overseas. In addition, the structured <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> model incorporates skills, profession, hierarchy, employment status and gender as well. The four Japanese companies employ various employee groups by different human resource management practices — recruitment and selection, pay and benefit, and training and development - involving varying costs. These differences are reinforced by the fact that different employee groups are managed by different organisational practices —job assignment, communication and decision-making. Thus, employees are employed in different labour market systems. The Japanese companies possess four structured employment features - polarisation between Japanese and local employees, polarisation between local professional staff and local employees with low skills, casualisation of local employees with low skills, and under-utilisation of female staff When compared with the <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> of the British company and existing literature, Japanese MNCs tend to polarise between Japanese and local employees, and under-utilise female staff because of the characteristics of Japanese culture. The polarisation between local professional and staff with low skills, and casualisation are mainly attributable to the sectoral/technological characteristics of the retail industry, and the contextual factors of the company. The ethnocentric management approach persists in all Japanese case companies. Although market pressures have induced certain changes in some Japanese companies to make fuller use of local professional staff, they have not introduced fundamental changes in the <b>employment</b> <b>systems</b> in providing equal employment opportunity for all local employees. It is suggested that this ethnocentrism could adversely affect the development of Japanese retail companies in a business environment requiring adaptability to local market and preferences...|$|R
