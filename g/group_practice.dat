40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{practice}} setting is, {{next to the}} GP and staff, {{an important}} determinant {{of the quality of}} care. Differences between single-handed <b>practices</b> and <b>group</b> <b>practices</b> in practice management and organization could therefore provide clues for improvement. An explorative, cross sectional survey was conducted in 766 general practices in The Netherlands comparing single-handed <b>practices</b> with <b>group</b> <b>practices.</b> OBJECTIVE: The study is looking for answers on aspects of the organization and management that are lost or gained when single-handed GPs and practices are replaced by <b>group</b> <b>practices.</b> METHODS: Between 1999 and 2003 GPs and their practices were assessed using a validated practice visit method (VIP) consisting of 303 indicators describing 56 dimensions of practice management. Instruments used consisted of questionnaires for patients, GPs, practice assistant and a direct observer in the practice. Single-handed practices (1 GP) were compared to <b>group</b> <b>practices</b> or health centres (> 2. 0 GPs) comparing raw scores on dimensions of practice management. In addition, data were analysed in a regression model with specific aspects of practice management as dependent variables using a general linear model procedure. Independent variables included 'single-handed/group practice', 'rural/ urban' 'part-time/full-time' and 'male/female'. RESULTS: <b>Group</b> <b>practices</b> scored better on nearly all aspects of infrastructure except those rated by patients. Patients gave single-handed practices higher marks for service, accessibility and even for the facilities. In single-handed practices GPs reported that they worked more and experienced higher levels of job stress. They delegated less of the medical technical tasks but there is no difference in delegation of preventive tasks/treatment of chronic diseases. <b>Group</b> <b>practices</b> had more computerized medical information and more quality assurance activities, but gave less patient information. Single-handed practices spent more hours on continuous medical education. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The quality of the practice infrastructure and the team scored better in <b>group</b> <b>practices,</b> but patients appreciated the single-handed practice better. The advantages of single-handed practices could be a challenge for <b>group</b> <b>practices</b> to give better personal, continuous care and to put the patient perspective before organizational considerations. This is underlined by the better score on patient information of single-handed practices. Single-handed practices can reduce their vulnerability and openness to high demand by opening up to the requirements of organised primary care...|$|R

25|$|<b>Group</b> <b>practice</b> is {{the most}} {{traditional}} private practice model. In this arrangement, a group of senior pathologists will control a partnership that employs junior pathologists and contracts independently with hospitals to provide diagnostic services, as well as attracting referral business from local clinicians who practice in the outpatient setting. The group often owns a laboratory for histology and ancillary testing of tissue, and may hold contracts to run hospital-owned labs. Many pathologists who practice in this setting are trained and certified in both anatomical pathology and clinical pathology, which allows them to supervise blood banks, clinical chemistry laboratories, and medical microbiology laboratories as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{severity}} of the situation that the Japanese Army faced in New Guinea is demonstrated by the incidents of cannibalism that occurred there. Some commentators think that Takenaga's unit was among those where cannibalism was practised. There was suspicion that directly before they surrendered, Takenaga's unit ate the body {{of one of the}} villagers from Tau that had been killed in the fighting there, and the Australian Army decided to investigate. When they interrogated the prisoners from Takenaga's unit, they received statements indicating that some of the unit had been involved in eating the villager, but that the soldiers responsible had since died. For this reason, the Australian Army did not bring any charges of cannibalism against the prisoners. There are also records from survivors written after the war admitting that they were involved. From the fact that Australian Army records state that Takenaga's unit was healthy and orderly, Yuki Tanaka infers that the whole unit regularly practised cannibalism as a group. Kiyohiko Satō, while admitting that some of the unit members were involved in cannibalism, casts doubt over Tanaka's conclusions by pointing to evidence such as descriptions in notes left by the soldiers that suggests cannibalism was not a <b>group</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{government}} setting large bounties on them, it proved difficult {{to crack the}} organization. On one hand, it was popular among many workers; on the other hand, {{those who did not}} sympathize with them were fearful of the <b>group</b> <b>practice</b> of murdering informants. Dłużewski died in the spring of 1911 {{as a result of the}} tip-off of an informant, who was later executed by the group when his betrayal was discovered. One year later, on the anniversary of Dłużewski's death, the group declared that they would kill all policeman they saw on the streets. On that day, 75% of the police officers did not turn up for work. In another well-known event, one of the group members survived a three-day siege in an attic; he killed a policeman, and then left the scene in his victim's uniform. In October 1939 Piątek was arrested. Heavily injured, Piątek was taken to hospital. He scared the policeman interviewing him into believing that he had a bomb, and according to reports, died laughing. Eventually, in around November 1913, a high-ranking member of the group, Michał Zakrzewski, was captured and successfully interrogated. The arrest enabled the group to be dismantled by the authorities by February next year, with 51 of its active members arrested. Due to outbreak of World War I, many of the accused were transported to Moscow, where the trials were finished. Many were executed, others were deported to Siberia.|$|E

500|$|Dr. William Worrall Mayo, {{the founder}} of the Mayo Clinic, emigrated from Salford, United Kingdom to the United States in 1846 and became a medical doctor in 1850. In 1863, Mayo moved to Rochester, {{followed}} by his family the next year. In the summer of 1883, an F5 tornado struck, dubbed the 1883 Rochester tornado, causing a substantial number of deaths and injuries. Dr. W. W. Mayo worked with nuns from the Sisters of St. Francis to treat the survivors. After the disaster, Mother Alfred Moes and Dr. Mayo recognized the need for a hospital and joined together to build the 27-bed Saint Marys Hospital which opened in 1889. [...] The hospital, with over 1100 beds, is now part of the Mayo Clinic, which grew out of the practice of William Worrall Mayo and his sons, William James Mayo (1861–1939) and Charles Horace Mayo. Dr. Henry Stanley Plummer joined the Mayo Brothers' practice in 1901.

Laibach, a Slovenian group who began while Yugoslavia remained a single state, were very controversial for their iconographic borrowings from Stalinist, Nazi, Titoist, Dada, and Russian Futurist imagery, conflating Yugoslav patriotism with its German authoritarian adversary.
