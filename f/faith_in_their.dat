5|$|An armed {{reconnaissance}} by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December resulted in five being lost as the formation, {{at very low}} level because of the low cloud base, was heavily engaged by both fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. The RAF believed {{that none of the}} lost Wellingtons had been shot down by fighters, however, and so maintained <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations. This summation was odd considering the evidence available. The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory. Several of the returning RAF bombers clearly had small arms damage from machine gun rounds, making the summation of the RAF that FlaK did the damage highly suspect.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{is confronted}} by Jiraiya while infiltrating Amegakure, {{resulting}} in a fight that ends with his mentor's death. However, Pain's captured Animal Path vessel is replaced shortly afterwards for Pain's attack on Konoha. The rest of the Paths are destroyed {{in the fight against}} Naruto, while Nagato recovers his <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> mentor and world peace when talking personally. Then, he sacrifices his life to revive the people he killed in Konoha. However, Nagato is reanimated by Kabuto and sent alongside Itachi to battle Naruto and Killer Bee. Though he regains his ability to fight at his full potential, Nagato is sealed by Itachi and sent back to the afterlife. In the Japanese anime, Nagato's voice actor is Junpei Morita and the Deva Path's being Kenyu Horiuchi; in the English dub, Nagato is voiced by Vic Mignogna and his Deva Path is voiced by Troy Baker.|$|E

5000|$|The {{legal and}} {{security}} {{situation of the}} Jews in the Muslim world was generally better than in Christendom, because in the former, Jews were not the sole [...] "infidels", because {{in comparison to the}} Christians, Jews were less dangerous and more loyal to the Muslim regime, and because the rapidity and the territorial scope of the Muslim conquests imposed upon them a reduction in persecution and a granting of better possibility for the survival of members of other <b>faiths</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lands.|$|R
5|$|Winter in America juxtaposes {{themes of}} nostalgic hope {{to the social}} {{problems}} of the early 1970s, particularly in the African-American community and inner cities. Also a prominent theme in Scott-Heron's lyrics is people's <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> culture in a bleak, impoverished environment. The album features Scott-Heron's examination of maintaining one's cultural roots in a discouraging environment. Other themes include love, fatherhood, freedom, alcoholism, and political scandal. The themes of social disillusionment and the human condition featured on the album are also depicted on the Winter collage, representing the grim, sullen images of poverty, decay, and death in generally urban areas and ghettos. Created by artist Peggy Harris, the collage was featured on the original LP's inner sleeve and in the liner booklet of Winter in Americas CD reissue.|$|E

50|$|Manava Bharati is {{situated}} at Panchsheel Park (South), adjacent to Sadhna Enclave, New Delhi. The school’s campus is spread over approximately eight acres. The uniqueness of school’s {{buildings and the}} ample infrastructure is immediately obvious on entering the campus. The school buildings collectively direct the mind towards the five elements of nature (Panchtatava), underlining the spiritual unity of all mankind. This blend of the traditional with a modern outlook is epitomized by the school’s Sarva Dharma Prarthana that brings together all <b>faiths</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pursuit of scholastic excellence.|$|R
25|$|Franklin {{and his men}} {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of the summer of 1820 trekking north to a point {{on the bank of the}} Coppermine River which Akaitcho had chosen as their winter quarters. Food quickly ran short and the voyageurs began to lose <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> leader; Franklin's threats of severe punishment prevented a mutiny in the short term, but eroded the remaining goodwill felt by the men. The encampment, which Franklin named Fort Enterprise, was reached without further incident, and wooden huts were constructed as winter quarters.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 Swiss Finance Institute {{study of}} {{structured}} debt ratings from S, Moody's, and Fitch found that agencies provide better {{ratings for the}} structured products of issuers that provide them with more overall bilateral rating business. This effect {{was found to be}} particularly pronounced {{in the run-up to the}} subprime mortgage crisis. Alternative accounts of the agencies' inaccurate ratings before the crisis downplay the conflict of interest factor and focus instead on the agencies' overconfidence in rating securities, which stemmed from <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> methodologies and past successes with subprime securitizations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to what}} caused {{the demise of the}} Moche political structure. Some scholars have emphasised the role of environmental change. Studies of ice cores drilled from glaciers in the Andes reveal climatic events between 536 and 594 AD, possibly a super El Niño, that resulted in 30 years of intense rain and flooding followed by 30 years of drought, part of the aftermath of the climate changes of 535–536. These weather events could have disrupted the Moche way of life and shattered their <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> religion, which had promised stable weather through sacrifices.|$|E

25|$|The Kara-Khanid Khanate arose {{some time}} in the ninth century from a {{confederation}} of Turkic tribes living in Semirechye, Western Tian Shan (modern Kyrgyzstan), and Western Xinjiang (Kashgaria). They later occupied Transoxania. The Karakhanids were made up mainly of the Karluks, Chigils and Yaghma tribes. The capital of Karakhanid Khanate was Balasaghun on the Chu River, later also Samarkand and Kashgar. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam, whereas the Uyghur state in eastern Xinjiang remained Manicheaean, but later converted to Buddhism. Nestorian Christianity was also a prominent <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> kingdom. The Turkic Muslim Karakhanid Khanate attacked and conquered the Buddhist Saka Kingdom of Khotan.|$|E
25|$|Another famous {{philosophy}} is that formulated by Nachman of Breslov and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast {{to most of}} his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics {{and the manner in}} which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see the world as it truly is.|$|E
25|$|With the war having turned decisively {{against the}} Central Powers, {{the people of}} Austria-Hungary lost <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> allied countries, and even before the {{armistice}} in November, radical nationalism had already led to several declarations of independence in south-central Europe after November 1918. As the central government had ceased to operate in vast areas, these regions found themselves without a government and many new groups attempted to fill the void. During this same period, the population was facing food shortages and was, for the most part, demoralized by the losses incurred during the war. Various political parties, ranging from ardent nationalists, to social democrats, to communists attempted to set up governments {{in the names of}} the different nationalities. In other areas, existing nation states such as Romania engaged regions that they considered to be theirs. These moves created de facto governments that complicated life for diplomats, idealists, and the Western allies.|$|E

25|$|Philip {{began by}} {{ordering}} Martín de Padilla, the Count of Santa Gadea, the Adelantado {{to assemble a}} new fleet intending to land on Ireland {{in the hope of}} increasing the rebellion under Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. As early as 1595 O'Neill and Hugh Roe O'Donnell wrote to Philip for help and offered to be his vassals. He also proposed that his cousin Archduke Albert be made Prince of Ireland, but nothing came of this. Philip replied encouraging them in January 1596 to keep their <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> Catholic religion, Spanish intervention and not to make peace with Elizabeth. For the Spanish the strategy was simple – the war in Ireland would create a new front, hoping to draw English troops away from the fighting in the United Provinces, and from which the English would have to fight. In Spain's eyes, the English fighting on this new front was one they could not afford to do.|$|E
25|$|The Amarr, a militantly theocratic empire, was {{the first}} of the playable races to rediscover faster-than-light travel. Armed with this new {{technology}} and the strength of their <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> god, the Amarr expanded their empire by conquering and enslaving several races, including the Minmatar race, who had only just begun colonizing other planets. Generations later, after the intense culture shock of encountering the Gallente Federation, and in the wake of a disastrous attempted invasion of Jovian space, many Minmatar took the opportunity to rebel and successfully overthrew their enslavers, forming their own government. However, much of their population remain enslaved by the Amarr, and some, having adopted the Amarrian religion and sided with their masters during the revolution, were released from bondage and incorporated into the Empire as commoners in the Ammatar Mandate. The free Minmatar Republic, taking as inspiration the ideals and practices of the Gallente Federation, is presently a strong military and economic power actively seeking the emancipation of their brethren and all other slaves.|$|E
25|$|During the war the Ottomans {{managed to}} take Sisak. On 24 August 1593 the Ottomans used {{the absence of a}} large army near Sisak, which was defended by 100 soldiers. With strong cannon fire they managed to break through the walls and on 30 August the {{fortress}} surrendered. Sisak was liberated on 11 August 1594, when the Ottoman garrison fled and set the fortress on fire. The Long War ended with the Peace of Zsitvatorok on 11 November 1606, marking the first sign of the suppression of Ottoman expansion into Central Europe and stabilization of the frontier for half a century. Inner Austria with the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola remained free from Ottoman control. Croatia was also able to maintain its independence from further Ottoman incursions and made some territorial gains following the peace treaty, such as Petrinja, Moslavina and Čazma. It is also {{important to point out that}} after this first great Ottoman defeat in northwestern Balkans, the Orthodox Christian subjects of the empire, particularly Serbs and Vlachs (who had been loyal and military useful) began then to lose <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> Muslim masters, and began passing slowly over to the Habsburg side by emigrating from Ottoman-controlled lands to those of the Habsburgs, or even revolting against the Ottomans in their own territory (Uprising in Banat).|$|E
