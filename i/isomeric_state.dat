5000|$|Some {{problems}} were encountered regarding the theoretically predicted versus the empirically discovered properties of these super-heavy elements. One {{problem was that}} the deduced cross-section of these super-heavy elements was approximately 4 mb, whereas their typical measured cross-sections was about 1 pb, thus creating a difference of 9 orders of magnitude.It has already been shown that deformations have strong effect on the fusion cross-sections; this can explain 4 to 5 orders of magnitude, leaving about 4-5 orders of magnitude in the fusion cross-section to be explained. The answer was found by studying actinides that were separated from the Tungsten target. In the actinide spectra other α particle groups were observed that were impossible to identify with any known activity in the whole nuclear chart and did not fit with the systematic of α - particles; their energies were too low, and they passed the Coulomb barrier too fast. By using a pelletron accelerator and measuring α - γ coincidences from the catcher foil, Marinov and his group found 5.2 MeV α - particle group in coincidence with various γ - rays of σ ≈ 30 nb, which was identified as a transition from 210Fr to 206At; and the reason that it decayed with low energy when much higher energy was available was that it was enhanced by a factor of 3x105. This explained the remaining 5 orders of magnitude, with the conclusion that the 5.2 MeV α - particles decay to a superdeformed band state.In the 1990s Marinov began to search for the existence of super-heavy elements in nature. The assumed existence of long-lived isomeric states has already led to a consistent interpretation of results in the super-heavy region. [...] These isomeric states were observed in Americium and Berkelium nuclei sources separated from a CERN Tungsten target, and were interpreted due to the production of long-lived isomeric states in neutron-deficient 236Am and 236Bk which decay to 236Pu.In order to measure the accurate mass of an atom, a high-resolution mass spectrometer, based on the principle that the mass of any molecule (except for multi-hydrogen molecules) is lower than the mass of an atom with the same mass number, was used in order to separate between the mass of an atom and the masses of molecules of the same mass number was used. Measuring neutron-deficient nuclei from a pure Thorium solution, Marinov discovered that the relative abundance of various Thorium isotopes (211, 213, 217, 218) compared to 232Th is (1 -10)x10−11.If the terrestrial concentration of these isotopes was initially the same as of 232Th, then their half-lives would be >= 108 years. Marinov concluded therefore that long-lived isomeric states with half-lives 1016 to 1022 [...] longer than their corresponding ground states have been found in the neutron-deficient 211,213,217,218Th nuclei.Long-lived isomeric states were also observed in 16O + 197Au reaction at 80 MeV. [...] In this experiment Marinov searched for long-lived isomeric states in pure Gold solution looking for high masses, assuming that if Roentgenium (eka-Gold, element 111) exists in nature it may be found together with Gold. The relative abundance of isotopes 261Rg and 265Rg compared to 197Au was found to be (1-10)x10−10. He therefore assumed that the observed nuclei of atomic mass number A=261 and 265 nuclei were respectively 261Rg and 265Rg (element 111) respectively.Marinov's third experiment consisted of searching for super-heavy elements in Thorium solution at high masses from 287 to 294, looking for super-actinide nuclei. According to Seaborg's extended periodic table of elements, elements 122 and 124 are placed as eka-Thorium and eka-Uranium respectively. It was discovered that nuclei of atomic mass A=292 are in abundance of (1-10)x10−12 (relative to 232Th), and have a half-life which is >= 108 years. Since the predicted half-lives of nuclei around 292122 is 10−6 to 10−8 seconds, and the empirically measured half-lives of these nuclei is >= 108 years, Marinov concluded that this was an <b>isomeric</b> <b>state</b> in the nucleus of atomic mass A=292 and atomic number Z~=122.Thus, the discovery of long-lived high spin isomeric states in the second minimum (the super-deformed minimum) and in the third minimum (the hyper-deformed minimum) of the potential energy of nuclei when displayed as a function of deformation, and the fact that these isomeric states have unusual radioactive decay properties and much longer lifetimes than their corresponding ground states, have led Marinov to his recent discovery of evidence for a long-lived super-heavy nucleus with atomic mass number A=292 and atomic number Z~=122 in natural Thorium.|$|E
