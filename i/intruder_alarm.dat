50|$|Dual-loop is {{a method}} of {{electrical}} circuit termination used in electronic security applications, particularly modern <b>intruder</b> <b>alarms.</b> It is called 'dual-loop' because two circuits (alarm and anti-tamper) are combined into one using resistors. Its use became widespread in the early 21st century, replacing the basic closed-circuit system, mainly because of changes in international standards and practices.|$|R
50|$|Electrical works: Rewired all {{electrical}} {{cables and}} installed a new main circuit board; Installed new lighting throughout, including new pendant lights centred {{on the two}} aisles - lights are movement sensitive in ancillary rooms; installed new <b>intruder</b> <b>alarms</b> on all external doors and PIRs in selected locations; installed a new sound system, including speakers and a main control panel; Installed security lights at each external door and emergency lights throughout.|$|R

50|$|ADSL {{deployment}} on {{an existing}} {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) telephone line presents some problems because the DSL is within a frequency band that might interact unfavourably with existing equipment {{connected to the}} line. It is therefore necessary to install appropriate frequency filters at the customer's premises to avoid interference between the DSL, voice services, and any other connections to the line (for example <b>intruder</b> <b>alarms).</b> This is desirable for the voice service and essential for a reliable ADSL connection.|$|R
50|$|Because {{exhibited}} {{items are}} often of special interest, they demand {{a high level}} of security {{to reduce the risk of}} loss from theft or vandalism. Exhibition cases should be securely locked. In addition, cases may be glazed with a material that hinders penetration and that when broken does not risk shards of glass falling on the exhibits. Whenever possible, the exhibition area should be patrolled; a 24-hour security presence is recommended when precious treasures are exhibited. Finally, the exhibition is best protected when equipped with <b>intruder</b> <b>alarms,</b> which can be fitted at entry points to the building and internal areas.|$|R
50|$|Some {{insurance}} companies and local agencies require that alarm systems be installed to code or be certified by an independent third party. The alarm system is required to have a maintenance check carried out every 6 - 12 months (in the UK, 'Audible Only' <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> systems require a routine service visit once every 12 months and monitored <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> systems require a check twice in every 12-month period) to ensure all internal components, sensors and PSUs are functioning correctly. In the past, this would require an alarm service engineer to attend site and carry the checks out. With {{the use of the}} Internet or radio path and a compatible IP/radio transmitting device (at the alarmed premises), some checks can now be carried out remotely from the central station.|$|E

40|$|The CELS project aims {{to provide}} an {{intelligent}} databasing solution to a restricted but highly useful domain: event logging in carpark environments. Events are temporally extended phenomena such as the arrival, parking and departure of vehicles, and passage of people. A loosely coupled system of asynchronous information sources are employed to annotate the raw visual data to enable sophisticated although retrospective queries. The primary data source described at some length in this correspondence is FREDA, the fast and robust event detection algorithm, which detects motion and tracks events as they traverse the scene. Introduction Automatically deriving information from the tremendous number of video cameras currently being installed in public spaces has become a central focus for vision research[1].

50|$|A {{security}} alarm {{is a system}} designed to detect intrusion - unauthorized entry - into a building or other area. Security alarms are used in residential, commercial, industrial, and military properties for protection against burglary (theft) or property damage, as well as personal protection against <b>intruders.</b> Car <b>alarms</b> likewise help protect vehicles and their contents. Prisons also use security systems for control of inmates.|$|R
50|$|Most {{systems may}} also be {{equipped}} with smoke, heat, and/or carbon monoxide detectors. These are also known as 24-hour zones (which are on at all times). Smoke and heat detectors protect from the risk of fire using different detection methods. Carbon monoxide detectors help protect from the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Although an <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> panel may also have these detectors connected, it may not meet all the local fire code requirements of a fire alarm system.|$|E

40|$|Most {{linguistic}} landscape {{research to}} date has focused on how people read and write language in the material world. Much less {{attention has been paid}} to the way linguistic landscapes sometimes read and write their inhabitants through technologies like CCTV cameras, <b>intruder</b> <b>alarms,</b> and other aspects of the built environment designed to make people ‘visible’—what I call surveillant landscapes. This article puts forth a framework for analyzing the surveillant nature of linguistic landscapes based on tools from mediated discourse analysis. It sees surveillant landscapes in terms of the way they communicate practices of surveillance to the people who inhabit them (‘discourses in place’), the kinds of social relationships and social identities that they make possible (‘interaction orders’), and the ways architectures of surveillance come to be internalized by citizens, while at the same time aspects of their behaviors and identities come to be sedimented into their environments (‘historical bodies’). I argue that studies of linguistic landscapes should take more account of the agenitive nature of linguistic landscapes and their increasing ability to recognize and to entextualize what takes place within them, and the consequences of this both on situated social interactions and on broader political and economic realities. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{optical fibre}} Sagnac {{interferometer}} was first demonstrated over 25 years ago. Immediately {{its potential for}} gyroscopic measurements became apparent and since the first demonstration substantial research and development investment has evolved a diversity of rotation measuring instruments. The fibre Sagnac interferometer has, however, also ventured into unexpected domains. The fibre loop mirror has become the ubiquitous reflector. Sagnac-based <b>intruder</b> <b>alarms,</b> hydrophones, geophones and current measuring systems have emerged. The Sagnac interferometer has expanded from the rotation measuring instrument into a very versatile sensing tool. Indeed, it {{is arguably the most}} successful of optical fibre sensing technologies. In this paper, we review both the principles and applications of the fibre Sagnac interferometer. The background theory highlights the need to understand the conditions for reciprocity within the interferometer network. The applications range from the expected gyroscopes into novel hydrophone arrays and intruder detection systems. The basic interferometer is now well understood and the engineering required to realize useful and effective instruments has been carefully defined. Its versatility though continues to amaze even the most experienced practitioner and doubtless its applications potential will continue to expand...|$|R

50|$|Dual-loop {{allows the}} burglar alarm control panel {{to read the}} values of end-of-line {{resistors}} {{for the purpose of}} telling a zone's status. For example: if an alarm system's software uses 2K ohms as its non-alarm value, an inactive detector will give a reading of 2K ohms as the circuit is passing through just one resistor. When the detector goes into an active state (i.e. a door contact being opened), the circuit path has been altered and it must now pass through a second resistor wired in series with the first. This gives a reading of 4K ohms and will trigger an <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm.</b> If a resistance reading is not recognised by the system either due to short-circuit or open-circuit, an anti-tamper alarm will trigger.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presented}} {{an overview of}} the training available to <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> installers. A survey of domestic and commercial <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> systems (n= 20) were completed across Perth, Western Australia, metropolitan area. The gathered data were evaluated against Australian Standard AS 2201. 1 for <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> systems, to determine whether alarm installations comply with two parts of the standard, being that of control panel location and zone supervision. AS 2201. 1 requires that <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> control equipment shall be located within the alarmed area, located outside the entry/exit point and operate as dual endofline supervision. The study presents significant findings into the compliance of installed <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> systems. A significant proportion of the intruder alarms measured did not comply with AS 2201. 1, with the panel located outside an alarmed area (30 %), located in the entry/exit point (15 %) and not capable of dual endofline supervision (30 %). These items contravene Australian Standard AS 2201. 1. Assumptions suggest that noncompliance is {{due to a lack of}} industry focused vocational training, industry self regulation and supervision, licensing regime and legislation. No single aspect could be considered ineffective; rather it is argued that all of these areas need to be addressed. Key words Intruder alarms, legislation, compliance, training, awarenes...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{presentation}} of the <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> system and installation of such system in residential building. In the first part I described the different types of security, which are offered in security services in Slovenia. In addition to the physical and technical security, there is also available a combination of both. <b>Intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> system is an example of one of the technical protection. Protection can also be classified in physical or electronic security. The second part describes the <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> system and a description of security installations, which are divided according to the complexity. The next chapter describes the SISTE EN 50131 and SIST EN 50136 standard, which determine the properties of <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> system and time requirements for transmission of alarm messages. In the third part I presented all the important devices which composed the <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> system. These devices are: alarm control panel, keypad, sensors and siren. I devoted special attention to PIR and MW sensor and the composition and functionality of both. In the fourth part I presented the alarm devices of the DSC manufacturer, their mutual comparison and communication between them. For communication the I 2 C bus and protocol is used. Here we can mention the GSM/GPRS GS 3055 -I universal wireless communicator which operates in GSM network. It provides us an additional way of communication where telephone lines are not available or in case of broken lines. In the fifth part I presented the example of installation of <b>intruder</b> <b>alarm</b> system with devices of DSC manufacturer. With AutoCAD Electrical 2009 I have made plans for the individual floor with elements of intrusion. Then I described the important programming settings of the alarm system which can be set up with keypad. ...|$|E

40|$|Both {{people and}} {{organization}} are widely accepting and adopting the functionalities {{offered by the}} smart home or smart building applications. This {{is due to the}} many advantages, in easing users’ every-day life and work, provided by the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and devices, equipped with sensors, cameras, or actuators, and able either to acquire information from the environment or to perform proper tasks. The main features of smart homes/buildings include real-time monitoring, remote control, safety from <b>intruders,</b> gas/fire <b>alarm,</b> and so on. Since within smart homes/buildings sensitive and private information are managed, security and privacy solutions must be put in place, in order to protect users/businesses’ data against violation attempts as well as to guarantee the provision of reliable services. To this end, rules, in the form of policies, associated to the smart home/building resources, must be defined and correctly enforced, by means of a robust framework for handling the huge amount of IoT data managed. In this paper, the effectiveness and potentialities of a strategy based on sticky policies, integrated into a security and privacy-aware IoT middleware, are demonstrated within a smart home scenario.
