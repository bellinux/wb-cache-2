Includes replaceable tip comprising ferrule and tubular <b>expansion</b> <b>sleeve</b> sized for sliding fit into tube to be expanded. <b>Expansion</b> <b>sleeve</b> swells in response to internal hydraulic pressure generated by turning handle and thereby advancing piston...|$|E
50|$|The {{expander}} system {{consists of}} patented {{products that are}} intended {{to take the place}} of conventional pivot pins in heavy machinery and equipment. Conventional pivot pins may wear in a way that requires a costly repair process for pivot lug holes, called line boring. The expander system uses <b>expansion</b> <b>sleeves</b> that can eliminate this wear problem.|$|R
5000|$|Most hoppers hold about 200 paintballs, {{and many}} modern {{electropneumatic}} markers can empty a full hopper in 10 seconds of sustained fire. In woodsball, {{and especially in}} scenario paintball, a player may be away from a base at which they can reload {{for an extended period}} of time. In speedball, the necessity of suppressing fire requires a very large amount of paint for a single game or match. In both cases, a harness with pods allows a player to have a portable supply of paint, without weighing down his or her marker with an enormous hopper. Harnesses capable of carrying a tank in addition to pods are usually labeled with a +1 (e.g. A harness capable of carrying four pods and a tank would be labeled 4+1). In addition, newer harness design make use of collapsible [...] "expansion sleeves" [...] in between the [...] "main" [...] <b>sleeves.</b> Packs with <b>expansion</b> <b>sleeves</b> are generally labelled X+Y, for instance 4+5, and indicate the number of main sleeves followed by the number of <b>expansion</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Some packs have multiple [...] "tiers" [...] of <b>expansions</b> or extra <b>sleeves</b> in very different locations on the harness, and may be labelled 4+3+2 where the last number is the additional set of expansions.|$|R
5000|$|Harnesses for woodsball have {{features}} {{designed to}} aid concealment, such as camouflage colors. Simpler harnesses {{consist of a}} belt pack with a number (usually 4, 6, or 8) of formed pockets for pods. They less often feature <b>expansion</b> <b>sleeves</b> (though some do). They {{are more likely to}} have the pockets side-facing, or in front of the player, which allows the player to more easily place an empty pod back in its pocket. This is necessary as discarding and retrieving [...] "spent" [...] pods is infeasible on a woodsball field consisting of many acres of dense forest. They usually, but not always, feature a tank pouch, allowing use of a remote line with a [...] "mil-sim" [...] marker for added realism.|$|R
50|$|Harnesses for {{speedball}} tend {{to consist}} of a bellyband with sleeves in the back for the pods, and are designed to carry widely varying amounts of paint while maintaining a small profile. They more often have <b>expansion</b> <b>sleeves,</b> though some woodsball harnesses feature them as well. Pods most often face lid-down, so that any pod {{can be reached by}} either of the player's hands and pulled out quickly, regardless of how the player is situated. Speedball harnesses rarely feature tank pouches; speedball players must refill tanks often, and switch hands often to lean out from the left or right of a bunker, both of which are made more complicated when using a remote line. For speed and convenience, speedball players often temporarily discard empty pods on the ground and retrieve them between games; for this reason, ease of reloading pods into the harness is often a secondary concern to player profile and ease of access.|$|R
50|$|Since then, {{the company}} has {{significantly}} expanded its range of travel gear ranging from uncomplicated, single-volume holdalls to two and even four-wheeled trolleys with single or dual compartments, {{in a range of}} sizes from strict carry-on to standard carry-on and larger. Most styles integrate other design features such as adjustable shoulder straps, organizer pouches, laptop and multimedia <b>sleeves,</b> <b>expansion</b> zips and straps, “add-a-bag” loops and security lock rings.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{method is}} {{established}} for joining a tube to a tubesheet by expanding the tube to the tubesheet. The expansion done using different method such as rolling. The joint integrity {{is important to}} ensure the roundness {{of the structure of}} the heat exchanger, and to prevent leakage. Many parameters affect the joint integrity such as the initial clearance, wall reduction and material properties. The residual contact stress is the main parameter indicating the strength of the joint. In this paper, the two dimensional planar FE model is established for the tube to tubesheet roller expansion. The planar model is great way for our attempt to understand and analyze the problem. The planar model reveals a realistic motion of the rollers in addition to the exact geometry of the tubesheet. This eliminates the need for the assumption of uniform <b>expansion</b> and tubesheet <b>sleeve</b> diameter sets on the axisymmetric model. That, the ligament dimensional effect will be shown on this model...|$|R
