40|$|The {{effect of}} wind speed upon aerosol {{penetration}} into an idealized <b>enclosure</b> was studied The idealized <b>enclosure</b> was a painted plywood box that was 1 2 X 1 2 XI meters in volume Two fans supplied 1 7 m 3 /min of filtered air to this <b>enclosure</b> at a static pressure of 2 8 mm of water The <b>enclosure</b> had a 7 5 cm diameter vent port which was {{isolated from the}} air flow around the <b>enclosure</b> To simulate holes in real <b>enclosures,</b> three 16 -cm diameter holes were drilled {{on the front and}} back sides of the <b>enclosure</b> This simulated <b>enclosure</b> was placed in a tunnel-like structure The air flow from an ultra-light air craft was directed {{at the front of the}} <b>enclosure</b> The air speeds were varied between 14 and 36 km/hr as measured by rotating vane anemometer Static pressure in the <b>enclosure</b> was measured with an electronic manometer Two optical particle counters measured the particle number concentration of particles between the 0 35 to 0 5 25 m inside and outside of the <b>enclosure</b> Aerosol penetration into the <b>enclosure</b> was computed as the ratio of the aerosol concentration inside the <b>enclosure</b> to the concentration outside of the <b>enclosure</b> The <b>enclosure</b> static pressures measured increase from 2 8 to 3 4 mm of water (P= 00001) Aerosol penetration into the <b>enclosure</b> increased linearly with air velocity above 20 km/hr Theoretically estimated penetrations were correlated with observed penetration into the simulated <b>enclosure</b> When simple linear regression was used to model the observed penetration as a function of the estimated penetration, the value of the slope was 0 69210 12 and the P value for the regression model was less than 0 0001 These results indicate that <b>enclosure</b> static pressure needs to be higher than the wind's velocity pressure in order to minimize aerosol penetration into these <b>enclosure...</b>|$|R
50|$|Richmond Castle {{consists}} of four main parts: a triangular main <b>enclosure,</b> an outer <b>enclosure</b> to the east, a keep at the northern corner of the main <b>enclosure,</b> and a small <b>enclosure</b> around the keep.|$|R
30|$|Using a {{checklist}} of more than 400 <b>enclosure</b> owners in each location, systematic random sampling was used to select 40 <b>enclosure</b> owners {{in each of the}} three locations in Chepareria ward to attain a sample of 120 households. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data on household demographic characteristics, age of <b>enclosure</b> since establishment, the number and size of <b>enclosure,</b> <b>enclosure</b> income, <b>enclosure</b> management practices/regimes, <b>enclosure</b> ownership and distance from <b>enclosure</b> to tarmac and Chepareria market. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) were used to complement the information gathered through the semi-structured questionnaire. Five KIIs and eight FGDs were conducted to clarify and give more insights on aspects of <b>enclosure</b> management, ownership/tenure, size and reasons for <b>enclosure</b> establishment. Literature review was used to contextualize the study while observation was critical in identifying the stated management systems.|$|R

5000|$|SCSI {{attached}} <b>enclosure</b> {{services is}} a computer protocol used mainly with disk storage <b>enclosures.</b> It allows a host computer {{to communicate with the}} <b>enclosure</b> to access its power, cooling, and other non-data characteristics. [...] The host computer communicates with the disks in the <b>enclosure</b> via a SCSI interface which may be Parallel SCSI, FC-AL, SAS, or SSA. One of the disk devices located in the <b>enclosure</b> is set up to allow SCSI <b>Enclosure</b> Services (SES) communication through a logical unit. The disk-drive then communicates with the SES processor in the <b>enclosure,</b> usually via <b>Enclosure</b> Services Interface (ESI), or a protocol called DSI for SSA <b>enclosures.</b> The data sent over the ESI or DSI interface is simply the contents of a SCSI command and the response to that command.|$|R

50|$|The {{recommended}} use of archival <b>enclosures</b> includes each item having its own <b>enclosure</b> {{and that each}} <b>enclosure</b> is of the appropriate size. Archival <b>enclosures</b> may come in two different forms: paper or plastic. Choosing either option has its advantages and disadvantages.|$|R
30|$|<b>Enclosures</b> {{were mainly}} {{established}} to address land degradation in Chepareria. However, the continuous adoption and adaptation of <b>enclosures</b> has also enabled agricultural diversification among <b>enclosure</b> owners in Chepareria {{as evidenced by}} the four <b>enclosure</b> management regimes identified. The dominance of livestock-based <b>enclosure</b> management regimes in Chepareria indicates that livestock production is still the mainstay of agropastoralists in Chepareria. More so, <b>enclosure</b> owners are increasingly engaging in crop-based <b>enclosure</b> regimes where and when rain-fed agriculture is possible for subsistence or for sale to satisfy existing market needs. With increasing flexibility on land use, livestock management and the adoption of alternative income-generating activities in Chepareria, <b>enclosure</b> owners may continue to diversify or intensify <b>enclosure</b> management regimes. However, agroecological zonation, land tenure, livestock owned and household income are significant factors which will continue to influence the choice of management regimes among agropastoralists in Chepareria. To ensure that restored areas in <b>enclosures</b> do not revert to their previous state, {{there is a need for}} research to be conducted to identify the impacts of <b>enclosure</b> management regimes/systems on rangeland rehabilitation in Chepareria.|$|R

This paper develops a framework for efficiently computing <b>enclosures</b> for multivariate polynomials and, in particular, derives piecewise bilinear <b>enclosures</b> for bivariate polynomials in tensor-product Bezier form. Runtime computation of <b>enclosures</b> consists of looking up dim pre-optimized <b>enclosures</b> and linearly combining them with the second differences of. The width of these <b>enclosures</b> scales by a factor 1 / 4 under midpoint subdivision. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Storwize family {{hardware}} {{consists of}} control <b>enclosures</b> and expansion <b>enclosures,</b> connected with wide SAS cables (Four lanes of 6Gbit/s or 12Gbit/s).

40|$|I used <b>enclosures</b> with exits for {{emigration}} to {{test whether}} house mice could regulate their numbers by emigration to two levels of resources. Exits had a water obstacle likley to be crossed only by true emigrants. <b>Enclosures</b> had excess food and water {{and the number of}} shelters was held constant. I introduced a pair of mice into <b>enclosures</b> about every other night, until no more would become residents. I ran 7 trials in single <b>enclosures</b> and 8 in double <b>enclosures</b> (2 single <b>enclosures</b> joined with a tunnel). The number of mice that stayed within a given size <b>enclosure</b> was consistant, and was 2. 3 times higher in double <b>enclosures</b> than in single <b>enclosures.</b> Weather, predation, starvation, and disease did not act in any trials. My data support the contention that house mice can control their population numbers through spacing and emigration...|$|R
50|$|Entirely {{outside the}} phalanx of the <b>enclosure</b> are the {{guardian}} stones {{at a number}} of rectangular <b>enclosures.</b> These blocks are anta-like extensions of the stone sides of the <b>enclosure</b> and stand in front of it. Other guardian stones stand out very little or not at all {{from the rest of the}} stone <b>enclosure.</b> Examples are the <b>enclosures</b> of Grevesmühlen-Barendorf, Nordwestmecklenburg, Barkvieren, Rostock county and Mankmoos, Nordwestmecklenburg.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 58 All {{flexible}} shaft couplings must {{be surrounded by}} a guard, in order to comply with OHSA requirements. For turbomachinery applications, this guard is an oil-tight <b>enclosure</b> and {{the purpose is to}} trap any oil escaping the machinery seals. When couplings rotate at high speeds in oil-tight <b>enclosures,</b> they shear the air, and this shearing results in a significant heat generation. The temperature of the <b>enclosure,</b> as well as the coupling, depends on the amount of air shearing and on the ability of the <b>enclosure</b> to dissipate the heat. Another problem with couplings operating in oil-tight <b>enclosures</b> is that negative pressures are created occasionally in the vicinity of machinery seals, causing oil to be sucked in the <b>enclosure,</b> which is particularly detrimental for gear reducers. Numerous tests were conducted at Koppers' Power Transmission facilities with various types and sizes of couplings, operating at various speeds, within <b>enclosures</b> of many configurations. Measurements were taken of the coupling and the <b>enclosure</b> temperatures, pressures in the <b>enclosures,</b> and the cooling effect of air flow and oil spray. Formulas useful in calculating <b>enclosure</b> temperatures are presented. Design guides for fabricating <b>enclosures</b> which operate at acceptable temperatures are also produced. <b>Enclosures</b> fabricated using these guidelines are successfully operating in petrochemical plants...|$|R
30|$|A {{few studies}} have {{documented}} the management of private <b>enclosures</b> (Mureithi et al. 2010; Verdoodt et al. 2010). While these studies outlined the utilization of communal and private <b>enclosures</b> in the Lake Baringo Basin, there are increasing calls for further investigation on the applied past and present management systems of private <b>enclosures</b> in Chepareria (Svanlund 2014). Studies have been conducted on driving forces in the expansion of <b>enclosures</b> (Beyene 2010). However, limited information exists on factors influencing the choice of <b>enclosure</b> management regimes/systems. In discerning <b>enclosure</b> management regimes and factors influencing their choice, we reiterate the concerns of Keene (2008) in questioning what could right holders do with their <b>enclosures.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since blade <b>enclosures</b> {{provide a}} {{standard}} method for delivering basic services to computer devices, {{other types of}} devices can also utilize blade <b>enclosures.</b> Blades providing switching, routing, storage, SAN and fibre-channel access can slot into the <b>enclosure</b> to provide these services to {{all members of the}} <b>enclosure.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{southern}} pudu (Pudu puda) was {{performed at the}} zoo Nordens Ark in Bohuslän, Sweden during twelve days in Mars and April 2014. Observations were performed during twilight. Time budget and <b>enclosure</b> use was examined, when the animals {{had access to the}} whole <b>enclosure</b> of 1000 m 2 or a smaller part of the <b>enclosure</b> of 200 m 2. There was almost no difference in time budget between the two <b>enclosure</b> sizes. At both <b>enclosure</b> sizes the animals spent most of the time at a place that was hidden from outside the <b>enclosure.</b> The hidden place was situated in the house. Also {{the rest of the house}} was a place where the animals spent a lot of time. The big <b>enclosure</b> part, the part of the <b>enclosure</b> that the animals did not have access to in the 200 m 2 <b>enclosure,</b> was more rocky and hilly, which might have been features the animals preferred. Another reason to the preference of the big <b>enclosure</b> part might have been that the animals didn’t have access to that part of the <b>enclosure</b> the whole time and therefor found it more exciting. The three small shelters in the <b>enclosure</b> were seldom used. The shelter that was used the most was located in the part of the <b>enclosure</b> the animals didn’t have access to when they were in the small <b>enclosure.</b> The pudus seemed to be affected by not always having access to the whole <b>enclosure,</b> but additional observations are desired to ensure chance didn’t impact on the results. In the future it would be interesting to do a follow-up to study the animals at different times of the day. It would also be interesting to study enrichments to see if the animals would like to spend more time in other places than the house if the rest of the <b>enclosure</b> was enriched...|$|R

40|$|A {{pulsating}} impeller {{system is}} provided for moving a body through a fluid medium. The pulsating impeller includes an <b>enclosure</b> {{mounted on a}} vessel or other body. The <b>enclosure</b> is provided with an inlet-outlet aperture to facilitate {{the flow of the}} fluid medium {{into and out of the}} <b>enclosure.</b> An expansible membrane is positioned in the <b>enclosure.</b> The volume of the expansible membrane is inflated and deflated on a regular cycle by a compressed air or other similar system in the vessel. When the <b>enclosure</b> is placed in a fluid, such as water, and the expansible membrane inside the <b>enclosure</b> is inflated, the volume of the membrane is increased, which results in the water being forced through the outlet hole in the <b>enclosure</b> to propel the vessel. This force will generate a reactive force which will thrust the <b>enclosure</b> and vessel in the opposite direction. The vessel may be provided with a plurality of <b>enclosures,</b> and each <b>enclosure</b> may have one or more expansible membranes. The force provided to drive the vessel depends on the number and positioning of the <b>enclosures</b> and the operating cycles for the expansible membranes...|$|R

50|$|Situated on {{high ground}} within the outer {{boundary}} are four connected <b>enclosures</b> (1-4). <b>Enclosures</b> 1 and 2 {{are the largest}} of the group and share a northwest-southeast aligned ditch having two openings and that is only partially banked on the north side. <b>Enclosures</b> 3 and 4 are smaller and connected to the eastern ends of 1 and 2 (respectively) with a single opening between the large and small <b>enclosures.</b> <b>Enclosures</b> 1, 2, and 4 each have two external openings, while <b>enclosure</b> 3 only has one external opening. When measured {{from the base of the}} ditch to the top of the adjacent bank, the inner <b>enclosures</b> measure from 4 to 7 meters high. Three mounds, ranging from 2 to 3 meters tall, are found within (Mounds I and II) and adjacent to <b>Enclosure</b> 2 (Mound III). Of note, Mound III is positioned such that the western ditch of <b>Enclosure</b> 2 was constructed to avoid it. The lack of an embankment for much of the ditch between <b>Enclosures</b> 1 and 2 suggests the upcast soil was used to create one or more of the mounds.|$|R
50|$|Simple dolmens once lay within stone <b>enclosures</b> {{or under}} {{circular}} mounds, {{but many of}} these have been removed.
