40|$|Pectins are {{a diverse}} family of biopolymers with an anionic {{polysaccharide}} backbone of α- 1, 4 -linked d-galacturonic acids in common. They {{have been widely}} used as emulsifiers, gelling <b>agents,</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>agents,</b> stabilizers, and/or thickeners in food, pharmaceutical, personal care and polymer products. Commercial pectin is classified as high methoxy pectin (HMP) with a degree of methylation (DM) > 50 % and low methoxy pectin (LMP) with a DM < 50 %. Amidated low methoxy pectins (ALMP) can be obtained through aminolysis of HMP. HMP gels by cross-linking through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces between the methyl groups, assisted by a high co-solute concentration and low pH. In contrast, LMP gels by forming ionic linkages via calcium bridges between two carboxyl groups from two different chains in close proximity, known as the ‘egg-box’ model. Pectin gels exhibit Newtonian behaviour at low shear rates and shear-thinning behaviour when the shear rate is increased. An overview of pectin from its origin to its physicochemical properties is presented in this review...|$|R
5000|$|Natural {{glazing agents}} have been found, usually in plants or insects. In nature, the agents {{are used to}} keep the {{moisture}} in the organism, but science has harnessed this characteristic by {{turning it into a}} <b>glazing</b> <b>agent</b> that acts as a coating. The <b>glazing</b> <b>agent</b> is made up of a substance that is classified as a wax. A natural wax is chemically defined as an ester with a very long hydrocarbon chain that also includes a long chain alcohol. However, in a wax there have been many different chemical structures that can be included in a definition of a wax, such as: wax esters, sterol esters, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, hydrocarbons, and sterols.|$|E

50|$|Dammar {{is used in}} foods, as a {{clouding}} or <b>glazing</b> <b>agent,</b> and in incense, varnish {{and other}} products. Dammar varnish, made from dammar gum mixed with turpentine, was introduced as a picture varnish in 1826; commonly used in oil painting, both during the painting process and after the painting is finished.|$|E
50|$|John Bauer {{has devoted}} {{his career to}} {{investigating}} the nature of porcelain, and exploring its full potential as an artistic medium. He ceaselessly experiments with the chemical composition of his clay, and tries out new moulding and firing techniques, <b>glazes</b> and colouring <b>agents.</b> Imperial Chinese porcelains of the Sung Dynasty (960-1,279) {{have always been the}} principal influence upon him, setting the lofty aesthetic and technical standards he has always striven to maintain. In the course of his researches, he invented a secret process for executing incised ornament that greatly accelerated his rate of production. His prolific output is purely once-off, and consists of highly decorative, yet functional, pieces. There are two mainstreams.|$|R
40|$|The {{compounds}} {{responsible for}} the colours and decorations in glass and glazed ceramics include: colouring agents (transition metal ions), pigments (micro-and nano-precipitates of compounds that either do not dissolve or recrystallize in the glassy matrix) and opacifiers (microcrystalline compounds with high light scattering capability). Their composition, structure and range of stability are highly dependent {{not only on the}} composition but also on the procedures followed to obtain them. Chemical composition of the colorants and crystallites may be obtained by means of SEM-EDX and WDX. Synchrotron Radiation micro-X-ray Diffraction has a small beam size adequate (10 to 50 microns footprint size) to obtain the structural information of crystalline compounds and high brilliance, optimal for determining the crystallites even when present in low amounts. In addition, in glass decorations the crystallites often appear forming thin layers (from 10 to 100 micrometers thick) and they show a depth dependent composition and crystal structure. Their nature and distribution across the glass/glazes decorations gives direct information on the technology of production and stability and {{may be related to the}} color and appearance. A selection of glass and <b>glaze</b> coloring <b>agents</b> and decorations are studied by means of SR-micro- XRD and SEM-EDX including: manganese brown, antimony yellow, red copper lusters and cobalt blue. The selection includes Medieval (Islamic, and Hispano Moresque) and renaissance tin glazed ceramics from the 10 th to the 17 th century AD...|$|R
50|$|It {{is mostly}} used mixed with other waxes to harden them without raising their melting point. As a food additive, {{candelilla}} wax has the E number E 902 {{and is used}} as a <b>glazing</b> <b>agent.</b> It also finds use in cosmetic industry, as a component of lip balms and lotion bars. One of its major uses is as a binder for chewing gums.|$|E
50|$|The forty-ninth {{report was}} {{released}} as World Health Organization Technical Report Series No. 884 in 1999. Evaluations {{are presented in}} this report for one antioxidant (tert-butylhydroquinone), two emulsifiers (microcrystalline cellulose and sucrose esters of fatty acids and sucroglycerides), two enzyme preparations (alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase and maltogenic amylase), one flavoring agent (trans-anethole), one <b>glazing</b> <b>agent</b> (hydrogenated poly-1-decene), one sweetening agent (maltitol syrup), and the reduced calorie replacement for conventional fats and oils, salatrim.|$|E
50|$|Shellac, edible, {{is used as}} a <b>glazing</b> <b>agent</b> on pills (see excipient) and sweets, in {{the form}} of {{pharmaceutical}} glaze (or, confectioner's glaze). Because of its acidic properties (resisting stomach acids), shellac-coated pills may be used for a timed enteric or colonic release. Shellac {{is used as a}} 'wax' coating on citrus fruit to prolong its shelf/storage life. It is also used to replace the natural wax of the apple, which is removed during the cleaning process. When used for this purpose, it has the food additive E number E904.|$|E
50|$|Beeswax has long-standing {{applications}} in human food and flavoring. For example, {{it is used}} as a <b>glazing</b> <b>agent,</b> a sweetener, or as a light/heat source. It is edible, in the sense of having similar negligible toxicity to plant waxes, and is approved for food use in most countries and the European Union under the E number E901. However, the wax monoesters in beeswax are poorly hydrolysed in the guts of humans and other mammals, so they have insignificant nutritional value. Some birds, such as honeyguides, can digest beeswax. Beeswax is the main diet of Wax moth larvae.|$|E
50|$|Beeswax {{has many}} and varied uses. Primarily, {{it is used}} by the bees in making their honeycombs.Apart from this use by bees, the use of beeswax has become {{widespread}} and varied. Purified and bleached beeswax is used in the production of food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. The three main types of beeswax products are yellow, white, and beeswax absolute. Yellow beeswax is the crude product obtained from the honeycomb, white beeswax is bleached or filtered yellow beeswax, and beeswax absolute is yellow beeswax treated with alcohol.In food preparation, it is used as a coating for cheese; by sealing out the air, protection is given against spoilage (mold growth). Beeswax may also be used as a food additive E901, in small quantities acting as a <b>glazing</b> <b>agent,</b> which serves to prevent water loss, or used to provide surface protection for some fruits. Soft gelatin capsules and tablet coatings may also use E901. Beeswax is also a common ingredient of natural chewing gum.|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Commission, the Panel on Food additives, Flavourings, Processing aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC), was asked to update {{the opinion of the}} Scientific Committee on Food of the European Commission (SCF) on the safety in use of beeswax and to {{consider}} also in its opinion the additional use of beeswax as a carrier of flavours. Beeswax was evaluated by the SCF in 1990, which concluded that because of the paucity of experimental toxicological data it was unable to establish the full safety of this compound but considered that its use as <b>glazing</b> <b>agent</b> was temporarily acceptable. Beeswax is an authorised food additive in the European Union, permitted as a <b>glazing</b> <b>agent</b> on confectionery (excluding chocolate), small products of fine bakery wares coated with chocolate, snacks, nuts and coffee beans and for the surface treatment only of certain fruits (fresh citrus fruits, melons, apples, pears, peaches and pineapples). It is also permitted in food supplements and as a carrier for colours. Beeswax is a complex mixture of saturated and unsaturated linear and complex monoesters, hydrocarbons, free fatty acids, free fatty alcohols, and other minor substances produced by the worker honeybee...|$|E
40|$|Coating is an {{industrial}} process whereby {{a layer of}} liquid or powder is applied {{on the surface of}} a product, whatever its shape, in order to confer organoleptic (<b>glazing</b> <b>agent,</b> etc.), nutritional (add of vitamins, etc.) or functional properties (anti-caking agent, etc.). This paper is focusing on oils and fats used in agri-food industry: what are their main uses? What are the main vegetable fats used as coating agent? Then, some examples are given (wafer cones, dried fruits, pearl sugar, wrapped or covered cheese, IQF frozen products) ...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources {{added to}} Food (ANS) {{delivers}} a scientific opinion re-evaluating {{the safety of}} candelilla wax (E 902). Candelilla wax (E 902) is authorised in the EU as a food additive as a <b>glazing</b> <b>agent.</b> It has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The JECFA and the SCF did not establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) but considered the use of candelilla wax as a <b>glazing</b> <b>agent</b> acceptable. Candelilla wax is obtained from leaves of candelilla plants Euphorbia antisyphilitica found in semi-desert regions. It is a complex mixture composed of wax hydrocarbons, wax, resin esters, lactones, free wax resin alcohols, and free wax resin acids. The Panel considered that absorption of candelilla wax {{is expected to be}} low, and that upon absorption the components would be incorporated into normal metabolic pathways. The Panel noted that there were limited data comparing the composition of the candelilla wax tested with the specification of the food additive. However the Panel considered that the materials tested were likely to be broadly similar in composition to the food additive. Overall, the Panel considered that the available data suggest that candelilla wax is not genotoxic. The Panel considered that long-term toxicity data on candelilla wax were lacking and therefore did not establish an ADI. However, the Panel noted that available toxicity studies consistently reported no findings associated with intake of the main components constituting candelilla wax. Furthermore, consideration of the exposure estimates to candelilla wax, using the Maximum Permitted Level (MPL) of carnauba wax, indicated sufficient margins of safety. This allowed the Panel to conclude that the use of candelilla wax as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern...|$|E
