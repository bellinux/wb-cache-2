5|$|In Hans Christian Andersen's {{version of}} the story, a bluebird had been viewing Thumbelina's story since the {{beginning}} and had {{been in love with}} her since. In the end, the bird is heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower-fairy prince, and <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> eventually arriving at a small house. There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself and chronicles the story in a book.|$|E
5|$|The {{spirits are}} {{forced into the}} head of a Krazoa statue, which reveals itself to be the revived Andross, the mastermind behind the spirit scheme, who <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> to resume his conquest of the Lylat System. When Falco Lombardi arrives in space, he helps Fox defeat Andross, {{restoring}} and repairing the Krazoa spirits to the planet. Afterwards, Falco rejoins the Star Fox team and Krystal is recruited.|$|E

5|$|Although the American white ibis is {{predominantly}} monogamous and both sexes provide parental care to their young, the male often <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> {{to engage in}} extra-pair copulation with other nesting females after mating with its primary female partner. These extra-pair copulations are usually done after the within-pair copulations, and make up about 45% of all total matings, although only about 15% of all extra-pair copulations are successful. By not restricting the number of females it copulates with, the male is able to increase its reproductive success considerably. Although females are receptive towards extra-pair copulations, male mate-guarding greatly reduces the rate of successful female involvement in attempted extra-pair copulations by other males.|$|E
5|$|Betty instantaneously {{realizes that}} Simon needs magic {{in order to}} survive, so she places him on the magic carpet and flies it to Wizard City. On the way, Death (voiced by Miguel Ferrer) appears to Simon in a vision, {{offering}} his one and only chance of escaping {{the curse of the}} crown. Simon refuses, and Betty attacks and eventually destroys Bella Noche. Simon reverts to Ice King, unaware of what happened. Later, he recounts the events to a captured Muscle Princess, while Betty—who survived the struggle with Bella Noche—watches sadly from a window and <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> on the magic carpet.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it <b>flies</b> <b>off.</b> Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E

5|$|In Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr {{sits on a}} barrow, {{plaiting}} golden collars for {{his female}} dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the elves; why is Loki alone in Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir—that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr {{says that he has}} hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved, but only if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki <b>flies</b> <b>off,</b> the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods.|$|E
5|$|In the comedic poem Þrymskviða, Thor again plays {{a central}} role. In the poem, Thor wakes and finds that his {{powerful}} hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki, {{and tells him}} that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two go to the dwelling of the goddess Freyja, and so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir, Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak. Freyja agrees, and says she would lend it to Thor {{even if it were}} made of silver or gold, and Loki <b>flies</b> <b>off,</b> the feather cloak whistling.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the game, Crash Bandicoot aids Coco with a butter-recycling device. Doctor Neo Cortex arrives, captures Aku Aku and Coco and encases Crunch in ice. Crash throws Coco's machine at Cortex's airship, severing the chain holding Aku Aku's cage, which causes the cage to fall into the nearby forest. After Crash rescues Aku Aku, they discover that Cortex and Uka Uka are stealing Mojo from a nearby temple and decide to stop them. On reaching the temple, Cortex reveals his plot to use the stolen Mojo to create an army of loyal mutants, which will be used to build a robot known as the Doominator, that will crush the Wumpa Islands and take over the world. After failing to defeat Crash with his Yuktopus cyborg, Cortex boasts that Crash will never find his base and <b>flies</b> <b>off,</b> leaving Crash and Aku Aku to follow him.|$|E

5|$|Tatum is paroled and {{the media}} begins hyping the fight. Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer is in any danger, he will throw in the towel. The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> into the night.|$|E
5|$|The family finds {{work in a}} fish-gutting {{factory in}} Osaka, where they notice a TV game show called The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show. They go on it, telling the host Wink that they wish for plane tickets to Springfield. In order to get them, they go through {{physical}} torture (particularly Homer), then must pick them up from a rickety bridge over an active volcano. Lisa is {{able to get the}} tickets, but Wink breaks the bridge and the whole family falls into the volcano, which is actually orangeade with lots of wasabi added. As the Simpsons leave Japan, their plane is briefly confronted by four giant monsters – Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and Rodan before it <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> on the journey to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E

5|$|The {{party is}} warped {{back to the}} top of Holy Loly Mountain, where the party discovers George's grave. Large rocks block the {{entrance}} to a cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but are cleared by the power of Maria's conscience. The party encounters the Mother Ship and a fluid-filled tank that contains Giygas. The alien expresses its gratefulness to Ninten's family for raising it, but explains that George stole vital information from its people that could have been used to betray them, and proceeds to accuse Ninten of interfering with their plans. Giygas offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship. When Ninten declines, Giygas attempts to put Ninten to sleep. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies while Giygas tries to quiet the party through an attack. When the party finishes the lullaby, Giygas is overcome with emotion at the thought of Maria's motherly love. Giygas says they will meet again and <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> in the Mother Ship. The game ends with Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd facing the player as the credits roll behind them.|$|E

In the Afghan culture, the soldiers only ride stallions into battle. The horses could be difficult to control, and the statue depicts the horse rearing back. The horse tack depicted by Blumberg is traditional to the Aghani people. A tasseled breast collar helps keep the <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> the chest and legs. The statue’s base reflects the steep, precipitous slopes the soldiers often traveled on horseback.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{response}} to a bouncer is for the batsman simply to duck underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case. The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible as the likely result {{of this will be}} that the ball <b>flies</b> <b>off</b> the bat at an uncontrolled angle making for an easy catch. Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.|$|E
