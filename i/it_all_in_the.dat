500|$|... "What Is... Cliff Clavin?" [...] is {{an eighth}} season {{episode of the}} American {{television}} series Cheers. It was directed by Andy Ackerman rather than James Burrowswho directed 243 out of 273 episodes of the showand originally aired January 18, 1990 on NBC. [...] In this episode, Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) appears on the game show Jeopardy! and game show host Alex Trebek guest stars as himself. Cliff racks up [...] during the game but loses <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final round, and he unsuccessfully demands that his answer be accepted. Back at Cheers, Trebek encounters Cliff and announces his resignation from the game show, prompting Cliff to reconsider. Unbeknownst to Cliff, Trebek did that mainly to avoid him. Meanwhile, Sam retrieves his address book from a teenage boy Timmy, who repeatedly calls Sam's past dates, and ironically encourages Timmy to stick to girls around his age. The episode received praise from critics for its concept and its guest star.|$|E
500|$|Development and {{production}} for Tucker: The Man and His Dream included {{the involvement of}} Tucker's children and grandchildren. Jeff Bridges was cast {{in the title role}} and, for research, studied Preston Tucker's mannerisms and movements through home movies. Tucker's descendants also granted Bridges the opportunity to sport the man's black pearl ring and cuff links for his wardrobe. Preston's son, John Tucker, said that Bridges has [...] "got <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mannerisms and the look. My father was very positive, always thinking of what came next. Jeff captures that." [...] Martin Landau was enthusiastic about accepting the pivotal role of Abe Karatz as a means to avoid typecasting. The construct of family values {{played a crucial role in}} the Tuckers' life and Coppola studiously selected Joan Allen for the part of Vera, Tucker's devoted wife while Christian Slater and Elias Koteas fill in the other central roles of eldest son and Tucker's friend and confederate, Alex Tremulis. Coppola's family was undergoing a stressful time during the production and he dedicated the film to Gio, his eldest son, who died before filming began.|$|E

500|$|Pfefferberg, {{one of the}} Schindlerjuden, made it his life's {{mission to}} tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg {{attempted}} to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with MGM in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through. In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel Schindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a New York Times review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. [...] "I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character," [...] he said. [...] "What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> service of saving these lives?" [...] Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel. At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years. In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.|$|E
