40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a technique for producing economical solutions for conventional structural <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> using topology optimization on the lateral bracing scheme. The study focuses mainly on minimizing {{the amount of}} material used and optimizing the placement of bracing elements in typical <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures to achieve economical and realistic solutions. Linear structural analysis is performed on <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures while considering static gravity and wind loading. The optimization scheme uses a "multi-level design" approach with two distinct optimization loops. The optimal beam and column sizes in a structural <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> system are generated in the first optimization loop and a bracing removal criterion is derived in the second loop to optimize the lateral bracing topology. A space constraint is imposed on the <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structure to enable designers to specify large empty spaces. A performance index is proposed to compare the cost between structural <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> designed using conventional approaches, which rely on engineering experience and trial-and-error, and the approach specified in this study, which uses a multi-step optimization scheme. Two case studies are made, comparing <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures designed using the proposed method with one designed using the traditional method.

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} effect of damping on seismic {{performance}} of <b>steel</b> <b>frame,</b> using the pseudo dynamic test by inputting damping and no damping to analyze the seismic performance of semi-rigid <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> Analysis was focused on {{the effect of}} damping on the panel zone strain, story drift and interlayer force. The conclusion was that under the more severe earthquake, the structural damping had effects on the seismic performance of semi-rigid <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> Intruduction Damping was a kind of features during free vibration which was due to external influence or structural effect that decreased amplitude of structure {{and was one of the}} important characteristics that formed the seismic performance of structure. In the process of the amplitude decreasing, vibration system dissipated energy through different mechanisms of action. When researchers analyzed the seismic performance of <b>steel</b> <b>frame,</b> they often idealized the damping through setting linear viscous dampers or shock absorber in the <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> that could’t reflect the real implication of the damping to the structure. Calculating the damping coefficient of the semi-rigid <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> and inputting damping value and undamped in the pseudo dynamic test, the variations about displacements,strains and loads for the semi-rigid <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> were analyzed.

Such light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floor systems are widely accepted in industrial and commercial building construction. Light gauge <b>steel</b> <b>framing</b> floor systems must {{be designed to}} serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance. Floor assemblies with higher fire resistance rating are needed to develop resilient building systems for extreme fire events.

40|$|Using fluid dampers {{to connect}} {{adjacent}} buildings for enhancing their seismic resistant performance has been recently investigated but limited to linear elastic adjacent buildings only. This paper presents {{a study of}} inelastic seismic response of adjacent buildings linked by fluid dampers. A nonlinear finite element planar model using plastic beam element is first constructed to simulate two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> connected by fluid dampers. Computed linear elastic seismic responses of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> with and without fluid dampers under moderate seismic events are then compared with the experimental results obtained from shaking table tests. Finally, elastic-plastic seismic responses of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> with and without fluid dampers are extensively computed, and the fluid damper performance on controlling inelastic seismic response of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> is assessed. The effects of the fundamental frequency ratio and structural damping ratio of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> on the damper performance are also examined. The results show that not only in linear elastic stage but also in inelastic stage, the seismic resistant performance of the two <b>steel</b> <b>frames</b> of different fundamental frequencies can be significantly enhanced if they are properly linked by fluid dampers of appropriate parameters.

40|$|Recently an {{innovative}} composite panel system was developed, where a thin insulation layer was used externally between two plasterboards {{to improve the}} fire performance of light gauge cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> walls. In this research, finite-element thermal models of both the traditional light gauge cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> wall panels with cavity insulation and the new light gauge cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> composite wall panels were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic fire conditions.

5000|$|Hybrid masonry is a {{new type}} of {{building}} system that uses engineered, reinforced masonry to brace frame structures. Typically, hybrid masonry is implemented with concrete masonry panels used to brace <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> structures. The basic concept is to attach a reinforced concrete masonry panel to a structural <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> such that some combination of gravity forces, story shears and overturning moments can be transferred to the masonry. The structural engineer can choose from three different types of hybrid masonry (I, II, or III) and two different reinforcement anchorage types (a & b). In conventional <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> building systems, the vertical force resisting <b>steel</b> <b>frame</b> system is supported in the lateral direction by steel bracing or an equivalent system. When the architectural plans call for concrete masonry walls to be placed within the frame, extra labor is required to ensure the masonry fits around the <b>steel</b> <b>frame.</b> Usually, this placement does not take advantage of the structural properties of the masonry panels. In hybrid masonry, the masonry panels take the place of conventional steel bracing, utilizing the structural properties of reinforced concrete masonry walls.|$|R
