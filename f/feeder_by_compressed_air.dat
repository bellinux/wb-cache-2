50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1982. The antenna towers took {{three months to}} assemble. Smedjebacken-Boxholm made the {{drawings}} and Wibe assembled them. They weigh 70 tonnes each. In the ground around the towers, 8 km of copper wire were dug down which ends up in large copper plates to get optimal grounding. Two 350-metre-long <b>feeder</b> cables isolated <b>by</b> <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> go from the station building {{to each of the}} antennas. The transmitter is a Telefunken S4006. Major parts of the transmitter are cooled by water with forced ventilation on some exposed parts. The efficiency lies around 73%, which is almost as high as theoretically possible.|$|R

50|$|The {{room and}} pillar method allowed an {{increasing}} mechanization of stoping operations {{that led to the}} use of drilling machines, first <b>by</b> <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and then electro-hydraulic. It also allowed the use of loaders, first <b>by</b> <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> then electrical and presently diesel. The cost of labor and materials associated to the wooden piles for total recovery of the ore, is the reason why residual pillars with ore (16%) are left behind, leading to a 84% recovery of the deposit.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{based on}} the application, a {{pneumatic}} cylinder is usually a single acting cylinder, {{where there is a}} single port in the cylinder and were cylinder extension is done <b>by</b> <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and retraction <b>by</b> means of open coiled spring.
