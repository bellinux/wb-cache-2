500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, <b>garlic</b> <b>powder,</b> onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E

40|$|Background: Garlic {{is widely}} {{promoted}} as a cholesterol-lowering agent, but efficacy studies have produced con-flicting results. Garlic supplements differ in bioavailabil-ity of key phytochemicals. We evaluated {{the effect of}} raw garlic and 2 commonly used garlic supplements on cho-lesterol concentrations in adults with moderate hyper-cholesterolemia. Methods: In this parallel-design trial, 192 adults with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentra-tions of 130 to 190 mg/dL (3. 36 - 4. 91 mmol/L) were ran-domly assigned to 1 of the following 4 treatment arms: raw <b>garlic,</b> <b>powdered</b> <b>garlic</b> supplement, aged garlic ex-tract supplement, or placebo.

Powdered samples were analysed immediately after production and during long periods of storage (after 30, 90, 120, 180 and 270 days). The investigations were focused on the correlation between packaging materials performances (light, water vapour and air permeability), and the changes of etheric oil and moisture content in <b>powdered</b> <b>garlic.</b> In order to describe the changes in etheric oil content during time, as well as to predict changes in packed <b>powdered</b> <b>garlic,</b> a statistical procedure was applied for all examined packaging materials and curve fitting data were estimated (the least square approach). ...|$|R

At these concentrations, the decimal reduction times were 1. 1 and 1. 2 hr, respectively, for resting cell cultures and 1. 8 and 2. 1 hr, respectively, for growing cultures. Of the major volatile aliphatic disulfide compounds of onions, n-propyl allyl and di-n-propyl, at concentrations of 0. 1 %, showed a comparable activity against resting cells but only a bacteriostatic effect toward actively growing cultures, which overcame this effect in 2 to 6 hr. At comparable concentrations, growing cultures of Escherichia coli were as susceptible to garlic, but apparently more resistant to onion, than were those of S. typhimurium...|$|R
