5|$|However, despite Ohio's large {{presence}} in the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> steel market, employment rates have declined in Ohio, generally attributed to weakening national economy. Between 1998 and 2005, the number of Ohio <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> steel industry workers decreased from 52,700 to 34,000. The Ohio Department of Development predicts the decreases will continue in coming years. The average annual salary for <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> steel industry workers in Ohio was $59,686, compared the national industry average of $53,352.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> pig iron could be converted into wrought <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> steel using a fining process.|$|E
