40|$|First {{normal stress}} {{difference}} (N 1) behaviour of polymer nanocomposites and liquid crystalline polymers {{is a measure}} of elasticity and is affected by shear stress due to the change in the morphology at the molecular and nanostructure level. Generally for macromolecules the first normal stress difference increases with increase in stress level. However, in polymeric nanocomposites, N 1 is affected by the level of loading and the dispersion of nanofillers. The relationship between N 1 and <b>filler</b> <b>contents</b> {{could be used as a}} scale to verify the level of dispersion as N 1 behaves independent of <b>filler</b> <b>contents</b> in intercalated systems but is dependent in exfoliated systems. In this study, the steady shear rheological behaviours of polylactide (PLA) and nanographite platelets (NGP) bionanocomposites with 1, 2, 3, and 5 wt% <b>filler</b> <b>contents</b> have been investigated. In addition the shear rheological properties of glass filled liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) have also been examined. The objective has been to obtain a correlation between N 1, <b>filler</b> <b>contents,</b> and shear rate of the measurements. The results suggest that the N 1 in PLA/NGP bionanocomposites is dependent on the level of loading and on shear rate beyond a critical value. However, a similar correlation between N 1 and shear rate for liquid crystalline polymer composites could not be obtained in both high and low rate regions.

40|$|International audienceExtensive {{research}} is being {{conducted on the}} development of inorganic/organic nanocomposites {{for a wide variety of}} applications in microelectronics, biotechnologies, photonics, adhesives, or optical coatings. High <b>filler</b> <b>contents</b> are usually required to fully optimize the nanocomposites properties. However, numerous studies demonstrated that traditional composite viscosity increases with increasing the filler concentration reducing therefore significantly the material processability. In this work, we synthesized inorganic/organic core-shell nanocomposites with different shell thicknesses. By reducing the shell thickness while maintaining a constant core size, the nanopar- ticle molecular mass decreases but the nanocomposite filler fraction is correlatively increased. We performed viscosity measurements, which clearly highlighted that intrinsic viscosity of hybrid nanoparticles decreases as the molecular mass decreases, and thus, as the filler fraction increases, as opposed to Einstein predictions about the viscosity of traditional inorganic/polymer two-phase mixtures. This exceptional behavior, modeled by Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation, proves to be a significant breakthrough for the development of industrializable nanocomposites with high <b>filler</b> <b>contents...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{penny press}} {{newspapers}} became more widely read because journalists made {{the effort to}} keep their content understandable to less educated audiences. They also focused on investigating topics with more factual-based information rather than opinion-based articles, which gave the paper a less biased form of news than the elite newspapers, which were often published by those with special interests. News items and stories were also shorter than those found in elite papers. It was also believed that the working-class audiences would not have enough free time to read longer editorials, hence the shorter and more concise editorials. Human interest stories were also popular with the penny press audiences. Such items took up more space compared to earlier, more expensive papers that used human interest stories more as <b>filler</b> <b>content.</b> The New York penny papers were particularly known for publishing stories about interesting personalities and covering {{different aspects of the}} human condition. To connect with the urban, mostly working-class readership, New York reporters wrote about ordinary people and their experiences. They also wrote about the stock market, entertainers, politics, sports, and weather, all of which became important news and are still considered absolute necessities in a newspaper, thanks to the penny press. Reporters strove to deliver news in a timely manner and sometimes relied on the electric telegraph to gather and share information. Penny press journalists were the first people to report on crises and crime news, something that has become a staple in newspapers since. Continuing reports on the same story were introduced in penny press papers and were read by thousands of people on the same day. This, in combination with the speed of news delivery and thoroughness in the coverage of local news, forever changed the direction of American journalism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method using attenuated total reflectance infra-red spectroscopy {{to determine the}} surface concentration of calcium carbonate in paper samples, by applying the linear relationship between the relative infra-red absorption integrals and the concentration. The method was able to detect micro-variations in the surface concentration and could also distinguish between different sheets {{as well as between}} the top and bottom side of one sheet. The samples were also split and the calcium carbonate concentration was determined within and compared to bulk calcium carbonate concentration determined from ash testing. The surface results were also compared with analysed scanning electron microscopy images generated from back-scattering electrons. The comparison shows that both sets of results are in excellent agreement. Depending on the sample, large errors (95 % confidence) were observed. These, however, are caused by micro-variations of the surface concentration, rather than by inaccuracies of the technique, which is estimated to be less than 1 %. Furthermore, measurements of various sample orientations suggest that anisotropic polarisation effects can be neglected. The method can be applied to paper and cellulose matrices having calcium carbonate <b>filler</b> <b>contents</b> of less than 50 %.

Curing time decreased as the <b>filler</b> <b>content</b> increased. The minimum tack-free time of 27 Â s was obtained at a <b>filler</b> <b>content</b> of 70 Â wt%.

Three composites, classified according to filler size, were selected: Filtek Supreme nanofill (3 M/ESPE), Esthet-X minifill (Dentsply/Caulk) and Renamel microfill (Cosmedent Inc.). Ten disk-shaped specimens of each resin composite were made and stored in desiccators until constant mass was achieved.
