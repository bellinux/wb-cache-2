5|$|Four Egyptian gymnasts, three {{artistic and}} one rhythmic, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. Mohamed El-Saharty, the lone male, was invited to London as the highest-ranked African in the individual all-around at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. He was individual all-around Arab Champion in 2011 and 2012, African Champion in 2010 and 2012, and Pan Arab Champion in 2011. At the latter tournament, he had also taken gold in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar,</b> the pommel horse, the vault, and the team event. In London his best event was the vault, where he finished 12th. He was 52nd in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar,</b> 56th in the floor, 57th in the pommel horse, 61st in the rings, and 65th in the parallel bars. His final rank in the individual all-around was 37th.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E

50|$|A final {{piece was}} a {{separate}} vertical bar {{connected to the}} two horizontals and pivoted {{in the same way}} so that it remained pointing vertically as the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> were rotated. This bar was able to be moved along the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars,</b> fore and aft, which was used to adjust the estimated altitude.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 198 events in 23 {{different}} sports were contested at the Montreal Games. In boxing and judo, two bronze medals were awarded for each weight class. In gymnastics, two bronze medals were awarded for third–place ties in the men's pommel horse and men's <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> events, and a second–place tie in the women's vault resulted in two silver medals and no bronze medal awarded for that event.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the flags used by the military, several other flag designs were inspired by the national flag. The former Japan Post flag consisted of the Hinomaru with a red <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> placed {{in the center of}} the flag. There was also a thin white ring around the red sun. It was later replaced by a flag that consisted of the 〒 postal mark in red on a white background.|$|E
5|$|In the Catholic Church, {{display of}} a cross behind the shield is {{restricted}} to bishops as a mark of their dignity. The cross of an ordinary bishop has a single <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> or traverse, {{also known as a}} Latin cross. A patriarch uses the patriarchal cross with two traverses, also called the cross of Lorraine. The papal cross has three traverses, but this is never displayed behind the papal arms.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off {{from one foot to}} jump over a <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The modern event sees athletes {{run down}} {{a strip of}} track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> before {{letting go of the}} pole and falling {{backwards}} onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre. The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a three-way tie in the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event meant that no bronze was awarded. In athletics, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's high jump event. In wushu, a tie for the silver-medal position in the men's changquan event (taolu discipline) resulted in no bronze being awarded; a three-way tie in the men's nanquan event (also taolu discipline) resulted in three bronze medals being awarded. In gymnastics, many shared medals were awarded. A tie for first place in the pommel horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a tie for third place in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar,</b> pommel horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way tie for second position in the parallel bars meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E

5|$|The XrossMediaBar, {{originally}} {{used on the}} PSX, is a graphical {{user interface}} currently used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, {{as well as a}} variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar,</b> several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by the up and down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games.|$|E
5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E
5|$|Luis Rivera {{represented}} Puerto Rico in artistic gymnastics, and was {{the only}} Puerto Rican gymnast to appear at the Beijing Olympics. Born in Humacao, a city on Puerto Rico's southeastern coast, Rivera has been affiliated with the Federación Puertorriqueña de Gimnasia (English: Puerto Rican Federation of Gymnastics) and participated in Beijing at age 21. He had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the preliminary round, which took place on August 9, Rivera competed against 97 other athletes. During the floor exercise, Rivera scored 15.125 points, placing 24th of the 98 athletes in this event. During the horse vault, Rivera ranked 13th after scoring 16.225 (this was on his first jump; his second jump scored 15.200). Next, during the parallel bars event, Luis Rivera ranked 61st after earning 14.575 points, and later earned 14.675 points in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar.</b> Rivera ranked 22nd in the still rings event after earning 15.250 points and placing 22nd, and finished out the qualification round on the pommel horse by ranking 20th with a score of 14.750. Overall, the Puerto Rican gymnast ranked 13th of the 27 advancing athletes, ending with a total score of 90.600 points. He placed ahead of Russia's Maxim Devyatovskiy (90.350 points) and behind Belarus' Dmitry Savitski (90.650 points). He advanced to the final round.|$|E

50|$|The flag of Chechnya is a {{rectangle}} with {{sides in the}} ratio 2:3, the same ratio as {{the flag of the}} Russian Federation. The flag is composed of three <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> of, from top to bottom: green, representing Islam; white; and red; superimposed on them is a narrow vertical white band at the hoist, containing the national ornament, a design of four golden scroll shapes. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> are in the proportions 4:1:3.|$|R
5000|$|The Cross of Lorraine (Croix de Lorraine) was {{originally}} a heraldic cross. The two-barred cross {{consists of a}} vertical line crossed by two shorter <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars.</b> In most renditions, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bars</b> are [...] "graded" [...] with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen. The Lorraine name has come to signify several cross variations, including the patriarchal cross with its bars near the top.|$|R
5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bar</b> meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
