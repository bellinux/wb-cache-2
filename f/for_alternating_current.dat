Each main generator was rated at 360 kilowatts while the auxiliaries had {{a capacity of}} 200 kilowatts each. These powered the complex electrical system that combined alternating current for most equipment with direct current for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors. No diesel generators were provided.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, Tesla {{presented}} his paper A New System <b>for</b> <b>Alternating</b> <b>Current</b> Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: {{one with a}} four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} ballast <b>for</b> <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC) use is an inductor {{placed in}} series, {{consisting of a}} winding on a laminated magnetic core. The inductance of this winding limits the flow of AC current. This type is still used, for example, in 120 volt operated desk lamps using relatively short lamps. Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. Where the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, the ballast is often a step-up autotransformer with substantial leakage inductance (so as to limit the current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a capacitor for power factor correction.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings <b>for</b> <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, Bombardier {{gave the}} Class 185 family a brand name, TRAXX, {{intended}} to allude {{to the terms}} 'traction', 'track' and 'attraction'. The acronym stands for Transnational Railway Applications with eXtreme fleXibility. The first letter of TRAXX type designations provides for differentiation according {{to the area of}} application, with F for freight and P for passenger. The original system also tentatively included H for heavy-haul and S for high-speed, but no actual vehicles were delivered under this designation. The number following the first letter indicates the top speed of the locomotive in kilometers per hour. The next two letters indicate the supply system, with AC <b>for</b> <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electric locomotives, DC for direct current electric locomotives, MS for multi-system locomotives capable of operating both under AC and DC overhead wires, and DE was foreseen from the start for an eventual Diesel-electric version. An extra P letter at the end was to designate powerheads (traction heads), that is locomotives with one driving cabin for push-pull operation. An also optional number at the end designates different versions, later used for the designation of generations.|$|E

2500|$|... "Armature"-type relays have a {{pivoted lever}} {{supported}} on a hinge or knife-edge pivot, which carries a moving contact. These relays may work on either alternating or direct current, but <b>for</b> <b>alternating</b> <b>current,</b> a shading coil on the pole {{is used to}} maintain contact force throughout the alternating current cycle.

2500|$|The SD70 {{uses the}} smaller {{standard}} cab or spartan cab, common on older 60 Series locomotives, {{instead of the}} larger, more modern comfort cab. This {{makes it hard to}} distinguish from the nearly-identical SD60, the only difference being the use of the HTCR radial truck instead of the HT-C truck mounted under the SD60. The main spotting feature is the difference in length between the two models - the SD60's 71 feet, 2 inches vs. the SD70's 72 feet, 4 inches. The SD70 also rides higher as its frame is approximately [...] higher than the SD60's. [...] This model is equipped with direct current (DC) traction motors, which simplifies the locomotive's electrical system by obviating the need for computer-controlled inverters (as are required <b>for</b> <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC) power). It is equipped with the , 16-cylinder EMD 710 prime mover. One hundred and twenty-two examples of this model locomotive were produced for Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), Conrail (CR), Illinois Central Railroad (IC) and Southern Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC). Conrail's assets were split between Norfolk Southern (PRR) [...] and CSX Transportation in 1999, and all 24 of Conrail's SD70 units went to NS.

40|$|An <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> {{induction}} motor is a nonlinear, multi-variable, and strong-coupled {{system that is}} difficult to control. To address this problem, a novel control strategy based on nonlinear differential geometry theory was proposed. First, a five-order affine mathematical model <b>for</b> an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> {{induction motor}} was provided. Then, the feedback linearization method was used to realize decoupling and full linearization of the system model. Moreover, a general and simplified control law was adopted to facilitate practical applications. Finally, a controller was designed using the pole assignment method. Simulation results show that the proposed method can decouple the system model into two independent subsystems, and that the closed-loop system exhibits good dynamic and static performances. The proposed decoupling control method is useful to reduce the system complexity of an induction motor and to improve its control performance, thereby providing a new and feasible dynamic decoupling control <b>for</b> an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> induction motor...|$|R
