40|$|In {{order to}} improve risk {{characterization}} and remediation measures for soil and groundwater contamination, {{there is a need}} to improve in situ vadose zone characterization. However, most available technologies have been developed in the context of agricultural soils. Such méthodologies are not applicable at industrial sites, where soils and contamination differ in origin and composition. In addition, most technologies are applicable only in the first meters of soils, leaving deeper vadose zones with lack of information, in particular on field scale heterogeneity. In order to overcome such difficulties, a vadose zone experiment has been setup at a former industrial site in Belgium. Industrial activities carried out on site left a legacy of soil and groundwater contamination in BTEX, PAH, cyanide and heavy metals. The experiment comprises the combination of two techniques: the Vadose Zone Monitoring System (VMS) and cross-hole geophysics. The VMS allows continuous measurements of water content and temperature at different depths of the vadose zone. In addition, it provides the possibility of pore water sampling at different depths. The system is formed by a <b>flexible</b> <b>sleeve</b> containing monitoring units along its depth which is installed in a slanted borehole. The <b>flexible</b> <b>sleeve</b> contains three types of monitoring units in the vadose zone: Time Domain Transmissometry (TDT), which allows water content measurements; Vadose Sampling Ports (VSP), used for collecting water samples coming from the matrix; the Fracture Samplers (FS), which are used for retrieving water samples from the fractures. Cross-hole geophysics techniques consist in the injection of an electrical current using electrodes installed in vertical boreholes. From measured potential differences, detailed spatial patterns about electrical properties of the subsurface can be inferred. Such spatial patterns are related with subsurface heterogeneities, water content and solute concentrations. Two VMS were installed in two slanted boreholes on site, together with four vertical boreholes containing electrodes for geophysical measurements. Currently the site is being monitored under natural recharge conditions. Initial results show the reaction of the vadose zone to rainfall events, as well as chemical evolution of soil water with depth...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a response-effort intervention on the occurrence of self-injurious hand mouthing and a competing response (object manipulation) with 4 individuals who had profound developmental disabilities. During Phase 1, results of functional analyses showed that all participants engaged in high levels of hand mouthing in the absence of social contingencies, suggesting that the behavior was maintained by automatic reinforcement. In Phase 2, preferred leisure items were identified for participants during assessments in which duration of leisure item manipulation was used as the index of preference. In Phase 3, participants were observed to engage in high levels of hand mouthing and in varying levels of object manipulation when they had free access to their most preferred leisure items during baseline. The effects of increased response effort on hand mouthing and object manipulation were then evaluated in mixed multiple baseline and reversal designs. The response-effort condition was identical to baseline, except that participants wore soft, <b>flexible</b> <b>sleeves</b> that increased resistance for elbow flexion but still enabled participants to engage in hand mouthing. Results showed consistent decreases in SIB and increases in object manipulation during the response-effort condition for all participants. These results suggested that a less preferred reinforcer (produced by object manipulation) may substitute for a more highly preferred reinforcer (produced by hand mouthing) when response effort for hand mouthing was increased.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to propose a new {{numerical}} elastohydrodynamic analysis method suited to cinematic pairs lubricated with aqueous dispersions of collagen gelled media. In comparison with traditional lubricants, these media are characterized by an apparent viscosity that increases with film thickness.

The proposed analysis method has been applied to a 180 degs partial bearing, which rigid journal rotates in a <b>flexible</b> <b>sleeve,</b> made up by a resin shell. The results of this tribological analysis have been compared with those concerning traditional isoviscous fluids which viscosity has been set equal to the viscosity of the gelled media when the film thickness is constant, i. e. in the unloaded bearing. When the cinematic pair is lubricated with the aqueous gel media, film thickness distribution over the bearing surface is more uniform, active film region is wider and, consequently, peak pressure is lower than when the isoviscous lubricant is employed.

The system is formed by a <b>flexible</b> <b>sleeve</b> installed in a slanted borehole (Fig. 1) and containing monitoring units along its depth (Fig. 2).

Cross-hole electrical tomography measurements are carried providing detailed spatial patterns about electrical properties of the subsurface. Such properties are related with subsurface heterogeneities, water content and solute concentrations. Two VMS were installed on site, together with four vertical boreholes containing electrodes for geophysical measurements. The site has been monitored under natural recharge conditions during the summer, autumn and winter. Results show reactions in the soil at depths up to 6 m as a consequence of rainfall infiltration and groundwater level fluctuations. In addition, the chemistry of the soil water changes with depth and water infiltration. Background images obtained from geophysical measurements show a highly conductive subsurface due to the lithologies and the high mineralization of the water in the vadose zone. The combination of cross-hole geophysics with the VMS has provided an effective tool for characterizing the chemistry and the structure of the vadose zone. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBasically robots are {{designed}} in such {{way that they}} remove human intervention from labour intensive and hazardous work environment, sometimes they are also used to explore inaccessible work places which are generally impossible to access by humans. The inspection of pipe comes in same category because they carry toxic chemicals, fluids {{and most of the}} time has small internal diameter or bends which become inaccessible to human. The complex internal geometry and hazard content constraints of pipes demand robots for inspection of such pipes in order to check corrosion level of pipe, recovery of usable parts from pipe interior, sampling of sludge and scale formation on pipe internal surface etc. Several designs of In-pipe inspection robots (IPIR) have been proposed in the literature to solve the problems related with inspection of these complicated internal geometries. Designing of an in-pipe inspection robot (IPIR) is a difficult task and hence the designer must take care of the design issues like Mobility, Steer ability, Turning radius, Size and shape adaptability, Online adaptability, Flexibility, Stability, Autonomous operation and obstacle avoidance, Efficiency at uneven surface, Safe operation, Material selection, Type of task to be performed inside the pipe, Number of actuators, Operation in active pipe line, Retrieval of robot, User friendly navigation and control system, Range of operation, Quantitative analysis of defects inside the pipe. Based on above, this research work presents investigations into design issues pertaining to development of In-pipe inspection robotics and proposes a new model of an In-pipe inspection robot to overcome some critical design issues. This proposed model is a screw drive type wall press adaptable wheeled In-pipe inspection robot. It is able to move through vertical, horizontal pipes and it can easily pass through elbow of a pipe line. This model comprises of three modules- rotor, stator and control unit. The Rotor module has three wheels mounted on the outer periphery with a helix angle of 15 °. Wheels of rotor follow the helical path on the internal surface of pipe line and move in the longitudinal direction inside the pipe. A geared DC motor of 200 RPM is connected to rotor by a <b>flexible</b> <b>sleeve</b> coupling. Due to its flexibility motor can transmit torque to rotor even in case of minor misalignments and can easily be stopped at any point of journey inside the vertical or horizontal pipeline, thereby eliminating the need of braking system to achieve stability.

Spring loaded wheels of rotor and stator provide it shape adaptability and enhance friction between wheels and pipe interior...|$|E

A soft actuation mechanism was developed in this work, taking inspiration from the arm of the Octopus vulgaris, specifically from the muscular hydrostat which represents its constitutive muscular structure.

50|$|Knob-and-tube wiring (sometimes {{abbreviated}} K&T) is {{an early}} standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s. It consisted of single-insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities, passing through joist and stud drill-holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes, and supported along their length on nailed-down porcelain knob insulators. Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they were protected by <b>flexible</b> cloth insulating <b>sleeving</b> called loom. The first insulation was asphalt-saturated cotton cloth, then rubber became common. Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength, then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape (asphalt saturated cloth), or made inside metal junction boxes.|$|R
50|$|Many chucks have jaws, (sometimes called dogs) {{that are}} {{arranged}} in a radially symmetrical pattern like the points of a star. The jaws are tightened up to hold the tool or workpiece. Often the jaws will be tightened or loosened {{with the help of}} a chuck key, which is a wrench-like tool made for the purpose. Many jawed chucks, however, are of the keyless variety, and their tightening and loosening is by hand force alone. Keyless designs offer the convenience of quicker and easier chucking and unchucking, but have lower gripping force to hold the tool or workpiece, which is potentially more of a problem with cylindrical than hexagonal shanks. Some lathe chucks have independently moving jaws which can also hold irregularly shaped objects (ones that lack radial symmetry). Collet chucks, rather than having jaws, have collets, which are <b>flexible</b> collars or <b>sleeves</b> that fit closely around the tool or workpiece and grip it when squeezed. A few chuck designs are more complex yet, and they involve specially shaped jaws, higher numbers of jaws, quick-release mechanisms, or other special features.|$|R
40|$|We studied stem bending in cut Gerbera flowers (Gerbera jamesonii cv. Tamara). Bending {{might be}} due to turgor loss. During vase life water uptake {{decreased}} more rapidly than transpiration, hence the flowers lost water. Net water loss did not occur in the floral head, but was found in the stem. It was largest in the segment (10 - 15 cm below the floral head) where bending was localised. When comparing flowers that showed stem bending with those that did not, on day 7 of vase life, the fresh weight loss of 5 cm stem segments was higher in the stems that had bent. Covering the stems with a <b>flexible,</b> thin <b>sleeve</b> of polypropylene plastic reduced transpiration and increased the time to stem bending from d 7 to d 14 of vase life. Additionally, stem bending might relate to stem elongation and to stem morphology and anatomy. Stems elongated by 1 - 1. 5 cm, in the uppermost 10 cm, during the first two days of vase life. No relationship was found between stem elongation and bending. At harvest, the stems contained a large central cavity, starting at about 5 cm from the root-shoot junction, and ending about 10 cm below the floral head. The cavity extended upwards and laterally during vase life, but no relationship was found between cavity formation and stem bending. A cylinder of sclerenchyma in the stems was found to end about 20 cm below the floral head, in summer. Bending was correlated with the extent of sclerenchyma formation and stem lignin levels. It is concluded that stem bending is due to net water loss from the stem. particularly in the area of bending, and to low mechanical strength in {{the upper part of the}} stems, which lack a sclerenchyma cylinder...|$|R
40|$|An {{external}} catheter is a urine (conduit) containment {{device that}} fits over the penis and {{is attached to}} a urinary drainage bag. The most commonly used external catheter is a soft <b>flexible</b> sheath or <b>sleeve</b> that fits over the penis. External catheters are self-adherent with an adhesive that is integrated into the sheath or they are secured by an adhesive or silicone applied to the penis prior to application, or a strap applied over the penis and sheath after the catheter is applied. Other names for this type of catheter include: condom catheter, urinary sheath, penile sheath and other brand names as numerous as their manufacturers. External catheters also include ostomy-like bags that fit over the penis, adhesive free sheaths that are held in place by a belt or special underwear, and catheters that attach directly to the glans penis. ACTIONS External catheters are used to channel male urinary leakage and protect the skin. External catheters may be preferred over indwelling catheters because external devices are less invasive and carry less risk for urinary complications that are associated with instrumentation of the urethra. External catheters can be used in conjunction with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). INDICATIONS External catheters are indicated to prevent wetness that results from temporary or chronic urinary incontinence of men who have little or no post void residual. Specific indications for external catheter use include the following problems: • Sphincter damage following prostatectomy • Reflexive voiding in spinal cord injured patients • Urgency and/or frequency (i. e., unable to reach a toilet in time) • Impaired skin integrity resulting from incontinence • Limited toilet/urinal access due to poor mobility, dementia, impaired vision, or other factors • Safety issues with toilet and/or urinal use CONTRAINDICATIONS • Allergy to adhesive and/or latex (e. g., latex sheath catheters) • Skin irritation, open lesion(s), or ulcer(s) on the glans penis and/or penile shaft • A risk of trauma related to improper catheter removal due to patient agitation or confusion • Phimosis and paraphimosis • Catheter induced hypospadia...|$|R
40|$|A {{new test}} rig has been {{developed}} for simulating high-speed turbomachinery shafting using Oil-Free foil air bearing technology. Foil air journal bearings are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings with a <b>flexible</b> inner <b>sleeve</b> surface using air as the lubricant. These bearings {{have been used in}} turbomachinery, primarily air cycle machines, for the past four decades to eliminate the need for oil lubrication. More recently, interest has been growing in applying foil bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines. They offer potential improvements in efficiency and power density, decreased maintenance costs, and other secondary benefits. The goal of applying foil air bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines prompted the fabrication of this test rig. The facility enables bearing designers to test potential bearing designs with shafts that simulate the rotating components of a target engine without the high cost of building actual flight hardware. The data collected from this rig {{can be used to make}} changes to the shaft and bearings in subsequent design iterations. The rest of this article describes the new test rig and demonstrates some of its capabilities with an initial simulated shaft system. The test rig has two support structures, each housing a foil air journal bearing. The structures are designed to accept any size foil journal bearing smaller than 63 mm (2. 5 in.) in diameter. The bearing support structures are mounted to a 91 - by 152 -cm (3 - by 5 -ft) table and can be separated by as much as 122 cm (4 ft) and as little as 20 cm (8 in.) to accommodate a wide range of shaft sizes. In the initial configuration, a 9. 5 -cm (3. 75 -in.) impulse air turbine drives the test shaft. The impulse turbine, as well as virtually any number of "dummy" compressor and turbine disks, can be mounted on the shaft inboard or outboard of the bearings. This flexibility allows researchers to simulate various engine shaft configurations. The bearing support structures include a unique bearing mounting fixture that rotates to accommodate a laserbased alignment system. This can measure the misalignment of the bearing centers in each of 2 translational degrees of freedom and 2 rotational degrees of freedom. In the initial configuration, with roughly a 30. 5 -cm- (12 -in. -) long shaft, two simulated aerocomponent disks, and two 50. 8 -cm (2 -in.) foil journal bearings, the rig can operate at 65, 000 rpm at room temperature. The test facility can measure shaft displacements in both the vertical and horizontal directions at each bearing location. Horizontal and vertical structural vibrations are monitored using accelerometers mounted on the bearing support structures. This information is used to determine system rotordynamic response, including critical speeds, mode shapes, orbit size and shape, and potentially the onset of instabilities. Bearing torque can be monitored as well to predict the power loss in the foil bearings. All of this information is fed back and forth between NASA and the foil bearing designers in an iterative fashion to converge on a final bearing and shaft design for a given engine application. In addition to its application development capabilities, the test rig offers several unique capabilities for basic bearing research. Using the laser alignment system mentioned earlier, the facility will be used to map foil air journal bearing performance. A known misalignment of increasing severity will be induced to determine the sensitivity of foil bearings to misalignment. Other future plans include oil-free integral starter generator testing and development, and dynamic load testing of foil journal bearings...|$|R
