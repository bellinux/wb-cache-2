40|$|International audienceThe factors {{influencing}} prolactin (PRL) variation in birds and in wildlife in general have rarely been investigated {{with respect to}} the physiological impacts of exposure to environmental contaminants. We investigated the associations between circulating baseline PRL levels and concentrations of eight persistent organohalogen contaminant (OHC) classes (i. e., major organochlorines and brominated flame retardants, and associated metabolic products) in blood (plasma) of free-ranging <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus hyperboreus), a top predator in the Norwegian Arctic, engaged in the process of incubation. We further examined whether plasma OHC concentrations were associated with the variation of PRL in <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls</b> exposed to a standardized capture/restraint protocol. Plasma OHC concentrations in male <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls</b> were 2 - to 3 -fold higher relative to females. Baseline PRL levels tended to be higher in females compared to males, although not significantly (p = 0. 20). In both males and females, the 30 -min capture/restraint protocol led on average to a 26 % decrease in PRL levels, which resulted in a rate of PRL decrease of 0. 76 ng/mL/min. The baseline PRL levels and the rate of decrease in PRL levels tended to vary negatively with plasma OHC concentrations in males, but not in females, although several of these associations did not adhere with the criterion of significance (a = 0. 05). Present results suggest that in highly OHC-exposed male <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls,</b> the control of PRL release may be affected by the direct or indirect modulating actions of OHCs and/or their metabolically derived products. We conclude that potentially OHC-mediated impact on PRL secretion in <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls</b> (males) may be a contributing factor to the adverse effects observed on the reproductive behavior, development and population size of <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls</b> breeding in the Norwegian Arctic...|$|R

40|$|<b>Glaucous</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus hyperboreus) {{and their}} eggs from Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic) {{have been used}} as biomonitors of {{contaminants}} in the marine environment. In this study, the enantiomer fractions (EFs) of chiral chlordanes and atropisomeric polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were determined in the blood plasma of adult male and female <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls</b> from three breeding colonies in Svalbard. Plasma EFs were similar in magnitude and direction to EFs previously reported in <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls</b> from other arctic food webs, suggesting overall similarities in the biochemical processes influencing the EFs of bioaccumulated organochlorine (OC) contaminants within the food webs at those locations. Additionally, EFs in yolk of eggs collected concurrently from within the same nesting colonies varied with location, laying date, and OC concentrations, and may be influenced by changes in the local feeding ecology between those colonies. No {{differences were found between the}} EFs for any analyte in female gulls compared to those found in egg yolk, indicating that processes involved in the maternal transfer of chlordanes and PCBs to eggs do not modulate the stereochemical ratio between enantiomers. Therefore, the use of eggs as a valuable and noninvasive means of OC biomonitoring may also extend to enantiomer compositions in <b>glaucous</b> <b>gulls,</b> and perhaps also in other seabird species from arctic regions...|$|R

40|$|Heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) {{concentrations}} were determined in different tissues (muscle, kidney, liver, brain, gonads, heart and feathers) of <b>Glaucous</b> <b>Gulls</b> (Larus hyperboreus) from Bjornoya and Jan Mayen. The age and spatial dependent variations in heavy metals were quantified and interpreted {{in view of}} the three chemometric techniques, i. e. non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, redundancy gradient analysis and detrended correspondence analysis. The <b>Glaucous</b> <b>Gulls</b> from Bjornoya contained significantly higher (p < 0. 05) levels of Cd, Cu and Zn than those inhabited Jan Mayen. Adult birds were characterized by greater (p < 0. 01) concentration of muscle, hepatic and renal heavy metals in comparison to chicks. Insignificantly higher slope constant Zn/Cd for the liver than for the kidney may reflect insignificant Cd exposure.

40|$|Although egg size is {{a widely}} studied life-history trait in {{evolutionary}} ecology, it is largely unknown whether exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can influence the allocation of resources to avian eggs and, if so, how. It is well established that female birds exposed to POPs transfer these compounds to their eggs. However, little is documented with regard to contaminant-related changes in egg quality, such as egg mass, albumen mass, yolk mass, lipid, and water content. We report positive correlations between the concentrations of several major classes of POPs (organochlorines, brominated flame-retardants, and metabolically derived products) in plasma of Arctic-breeding <b>Glaucous</b> <b>Gulls</b> (Larus hyperboreus) and in the yolk of the last-laid egg of their clutches. The contributions of the different POP classes to the summed POP concentration were also positively correlated between female plasma and egg yolk. In addition, <b>Glaucous</b> <b>Gulls</b> with a relatively high concentration of sum (Sigma) chlordanes and total-(alpha) -hexabromocyclododecane in their plasma laid smaller eggs. Eggs into which females had deposited a relatively low concentration of Sigma PCB and a relatively high concentration of Sigma DDT were also smaller. The POP patterns of yolk and maternal plasma were associated with changes in water and lipid content of the yolk. These results suggest that egg quality-and, thus, offspring performance-may be affected {{not only by the}} direct transfer of contaminants from the female to the egg, but also through associated changes in egg size and composition...|$|R
