50|$|By {{the time}} the A7s entered LNER {{ownership}} in 1923, the A7s had been relegated to shunting in the larger marshalling yards. Their power was invaluable when shunting heavy trains over the <b>shunting</b> <b>hump.</b> In the 1930s, Nos. 1136 and 1175 were allocated to hauling chalk quarry trains from Hessle Quarry to Stoneferry Cement Works, in the Hull area.|$|R
50|$|The {{yard was}} {{completed}} in 1921 and incorporated two gravity <b>shunting</b> <b>humps</b> and equipped with the latest automated technology including electrically operated points, and widespread use of Track circuits. With its 32 mi of track, (the longest siding being 1662 ft in length and the shortest being 1331 ft), it could handle 2500 wagons a day. These were brought in by 50 down and 26 up trains, and being removed by 18 down and 46 up services. This was, probably, the busiest marshalling yard {{in the country at}} that time. Up to 3390 wagons could be sorted per day and an incoming train of wagons could be sorted in 12 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Teesside had {{a number}} of {{marshalling}} yards servicing the coal mines and steel mills of Consett, West County Durham and North Yorkshire, as well as those for Middlesbrough Dock. The decision was hence taken to rationalise these to one yard, and in 1957 to the immediate west of Erimus, BR developed the new Tees Marshalling Yard and associated Thornaby TMD. Initially developed as a <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> facility, by the time construction was completed in 1963 wagon-shunting had been replaced by Containerisation and Merry-go-round trains, and hence <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> ceased.|$|E
50|$|The Great Central Railway Class 8H (LNER Class S1) was a {{class of}} 0-8-4T steam tank {{locomotives}} designed by John G. Robinson for <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> at Wath marshalling yard.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} to the specifications of LMS CME W.A. Stanier for general and <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> at the company's Derby Works using engine and electric equipment {{supplied by the}} English Electric Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} intention {{had been}} to employ these engines in the <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> yards at Aintree. However problems with the spring hangers fouling the electric third rail system on the lines from Liverpool to Ormskirk between the engine shed and the sidings led to their withdrawal from this service.|$|E
50|$|In 1973 Kingmoor Down Yard closed. In 1977 British Rail {{introduced}} a new wagonload network named Speedlink. Modern wagons capable of 75 mph running worked in a timetabled network, but the network was much reduced; the traditional wagons were phased out, and in 1981 <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> at the remaining yard was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|With {{the end of}} <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> at Tinsley {{the class}} became obsolete. The unique qualities of the {{locomotives}} were not required elsewhere and so withdrawal was inevitable; 13002 was withdrawn in 1983, with the remaining two locomotives going with the closure of Tinsley hump in 1985. None of this unusual class survives.|$|E
50|$|After {{closure of}} the 1950s {{developed}} <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> yard, freight since the 2008 credit crunch have declined significantly, and the associated Bescot TMD now carries no allocation of locomotives. DB Schenker services workings are still the mainstay of operations in the area, Direct Rail Services nuclear flask trains pass {{once or twice a}} week, and Freightliner Group Intermodal and Automotive trains also pass through. Regular Freightliner Coal trains also run around on the up goods on their way to Rugeley Power Station.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the computer-based Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) and consequent renumbering, classes were identified by the two upper-case letters with the first letter remaining D or E respectively and sub-classes being indicated by a third upper-case letter, such as DAA (DA modified for <b>hump</b> <b>shunting),</b> DAR (DA with rebuilt superstructure), DFT (DF with turbo-conversion), DXR (rebuilt DX) and so on. Most diesel-electric shunting locomotives have a three-letter classification with DS as the first two letters, following on from the original diesel-electric shunting class that was known simply as the DS class.|$|E
50|$|It was a <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> yard {{built by}} the North British Railway (NBR) in October 1901 {{as part of the}} Sighthill Goods Yard and High Street Goods Yard {{modernisation}} scheme. In the early days the majority of the railway workings were {{on the north side of}} the E&G, i.e., the up-yard. The hump was located to the North-West. With the modern changes of emphasis in British Rail freight almost all of the rail workings on the north side and signal boxes were removed in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The new {{yard was}} {{built as a}} <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> (gravity) yard capable of {{handling}} 4,000 wagons a day. The reception sidings were built west of the River Calder, the main yard {{was built on the}} extended site of the former sidings. The main control tower was located south of the main line and the Calder Vale Dye Works near to the river. The yard opened in 1963 at a cost of Â£3.5 million. The diesel motive power depot at Healey Mills (Healey Mills Diesel Depot or Healey Mills TMD) opened in 1967.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} members were {{purchased}} {{for use in}} <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> at Forrestfield yard. In 1973 a further three were purchased. These differed in having Caterpillar engines, were much lighter and could operate in multiple with each other. These were designated as the MA class. In January 1994, four were written off and later sold to CSR for use on its sugar cane railways in Queensland. MA1862 remained in service with Transperth as the Claisebrook depot shunter until 2014. In 2015, it was sold to the Hotham Valley Railway.|$|E
50|$|The first {{tanks were}} {{labelled}} externally as being glass-lined (they were actually vitreous enamel), {{meaning that the}} wagons themselves were unauthorised for loose or <b>hump</b> <b>shunting,</b> a reminder of which was applied in large capital letters to the chassis. Early tank design had no baffles, meaning that the milk self-churned during the journey, and made the wagon highly unstable. After the required improvement in milk quality was not gained, {{and a number of}} derailment accidents, 13 ft three-axled six-wheel wagons were introduce from 1931, and baffles became standard practise. The last of the two-axle design were withdrawn pre-World War II, while three-axle designs continued in production under British Railways into the early 1950s, but now with stainless steel linings.|$|E
50|$|The first {{example was}} the Great Central Railway Class 8H of 1907. These were {{designed}} for <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> and so required high tractive effort, good adhesion and traction for starting from rest. Although developed from the 8A tender class, and having some interchangeable parts in their running gear, they also had three cylinders rather than two. The three cylinder tank locomotive was in fashion at this time, {{as a means of}} achieving good acceleration from rest, owing to their more even power delivery and the reduced risk of wheelslip. This three-cylindered pattern had begun with Holden's Decapod of 1902 and carried through into Worsdell and Raven's fast passenger tank locomotives of 4-6-2T and 4-4-4T layout for the North Eastern Railway in 1910 and 1913. Worsdell also designed a comparable heavy shunter of his own, the Class X, although this used the 4-8-0T layout with a leading bogie, rather than trailing.|$|E
50|$|From 1903 and Ivatt's Class L1, {{several of}} the UK railway {{companies}} introduced extremely large tank engines that were eight- or even ten-coupled, with few carrying axles, so as to achieve the maximum adhesive weight over their driving wheels. Although limited in their maximum speed {{by the lack of}} any pilot truck; their size was the maximum permitted by the loading gauge and their axle loading, and so they could achieve a high tractive effort. On some lines this was put to use for accelerating suburban passenger services, in competition with the new electric railways. Other railways required heavy shunters, to cope with the increasing weight of freight trains. These were particularly needed for the new technology of <b>hump</b> <b>shunting.</b> Although the tank engine layout restricted the coal and water capacity that could be provided (their large boilers left little space for side tanks), all of these uses were relatively short ranged, and so the engines did not require long endurance.|$|E
50|$|The {{reversing}} gear was originally mechanical, but was replaced on {{all but two}} of the locomotives (nos. 1355/8) by steam-operated {{reversing gear}} between 1932 and 1934. The steam reversing gear was removed again between 1941 and 1947.In 1929, No. 1656 was moved to the newly built Whitemoor Yard at March, Cambridgeshire. In 1932, this locomotive was replaced by Nos. 1355 and 1358. Whitemoor preferred the ex-GCR 0-8-4T (LNER Class S1) for <b>hump</b> <b>shunting,</b> so in 1934 No 1358 was moved to Doncaster, and No. 1355 to Mexborough. In 1936, No. 1355 moved to King's Cross to shunt the engine shed for seven weeks, before joining No. 1358 in Doncaster. These two locomotives were scrapped at Doncaster in 1937. The remaining T1s continued to work coal trains at various docks and marshalling yards throughout North East England. After World War II, coal exports never returned to their pre-war levels. Hence, many of the T1s moved to other sheds for heavy shunting duties.|$|E
50|$|With need to marshall coal traffic, a {{location}} {{close to the}} strategically located Trent Junction became obvious, and hence the development of Toton as a railway yard from the late 19th century. The yards eventually spanned: the Old/New Banks; North Yard; West Yard; Sandiacre Ballast Sidings. Coal traffic reached its peak through the yards post World War II in the 1950s, with over 1million wagons per year passing through {{what was then the}} largest marshalling yard in Europe, and the third largest in the world. Local traffic included coal and iron ore and steel from the nearby Stanton Ironworks. With the coming of the Beeching Axe, British Railways shelved all proposed development of any other marshalling yards, thereby increasing traffic through the yards further. This was the peak of Toton traffic. However, by the 1970s the yard was in decline. With the introduction of Merry-go-round trains direct from colliery to power station, and the decline in the use of domestic coal in favour of North Sea gas, rail traffic through the yards was diminishing quickly. The Down Side ceased <b>hump</b> <b>shunting</b> in 1978, followed by the Up Side in 1984. Many of the yards were lifted during the 1970s and 1980s, and in the late 1980s the yards were rationalised to the basic shape seen today. This was the era when Toton TMD was the home of Class 20, Class 56 and Class 58.|$|E
