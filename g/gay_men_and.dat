5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

5|$|Lesbian {{consciousness}} {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1986, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians from its midst. State persecution prevented {{the formation of}} associations until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was Nosotras, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when Grupo Safo– Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|The city, {{along with}} {{adjacent}} small cities Oakland Park and Wilton Manors, {{is known for}} its large LGBT community and {{has one of the highest}} ratios of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians, with gay men being more largely present, in the United States. The city is also known as a popular vacation spot for gays and lesbians, with many LGBT or LGBT-friendly hotels and guesthouses. Fort Lauderdale hosts the Stonewall Library & Archives, and in neighboring Wilton Manors there is a large LGBT community center, the Pride Center, and the World AIDS Museum and Educational Center.|$|E

5|$|The {{program was}} {{initially}} proposed in 1964. The first version {{was produced by}} William Peters, with production supervised by executive producer Fred W. Friendly. Upon accepting the assignment, Peters began his research by reading books and consulting with experts in the field. Peters suggested that the program focus exclusively on <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> that he cover lesbians in a second program, and Friendly agreed. Principal filming took place starting {{in the fall of}} 1964 and continued through early 1965. Peters interviewed men in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Charlotte and New York City, accumulating 30 hours of footage.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians {{to serve}} openly. Openly {{gay and lesbian}} {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service {{did not have any}} negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E

5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E
5|$|Several {{popularity}} polls {{conducted over}} the past decade indicate that Freddie Mercury's reputation may, in fact, have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the 100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC. He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes. Despite {{the fact that he had}} been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential <b>Gay</b> <b>Men</b> <b>and</b> Lesbians, Past and Present. In 2008 Rolling Stone ranked Mercury 18 on its list of the Top 100 Singers Of All Time. Mercury was voted the greatest male singer in MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In 2011 a Rolling Stone readers' pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine's Best Lead Singers of All Time.|$|E
