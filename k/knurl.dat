5000|$|More {{common than}} <b>knurl</b> cutting, <b>knurl</b> rolling is usually {{accomplished}} using {{one or more}} very hard rollers that contain the reverse of the pattern to be imposed. It is possible for a [...] "straight" [...] <b>knurl</b> (not criss-crossed) to be pressed with a single roller, however the material needs to be supported adequately to avoid deformation. A criss-cross pattern can be accomplished using any of: ...|$|E
5000|$|Cut <b>knurling</b> often employs {{automatic}} feed, the tooling for cut <b>knurling</b> {{resembles that}} for form <b>knurling</b> {{with the exception}} that the <b>knurls</b> have sharp edges and are presented to the work at an angle allowing the sharp edges to cut the work, angled, diamond and straight <b>knurling</b> are all supported by cut <b>knurling</b> [...] It is impossible to cut <b>knurling</b> [...] "Like extremely coarse pitch threads" [...] both because lathe gear trains will not support such longitudinal speeds and because reasonable cutting speeds {{would be impossible to}} achieve.|$|R
50|$|<b>Knurling</b> is {{also used}} on the grips of darts and the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Aside from adding {{functionality}} to an object (valve repairs and hand grips being {{some of the most}} common), <b>knurling</b> also adds a decorative pattern to the material. The <b>knurled</b> nut is one such application, which uses a <b>knurled</b> finish instead of hexagonal or square edges which helps in tightening or loosening the nut without the use of a tool. The <b>knurled</b> surfaces provide enough grip to hold the nut between the thumb and forefinger. Hence it is also called a thumb nut. It is mainly used on small diameter bolts.Knurled nuts are typically used in electrical components, musical instruments and in automobiles.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knurling</b> : The {{cutting of}} a {{serrated}} pattern {{onto the surface}} of a part to use as a hand grip using a special purpose <b>knurling</b> tool.|$|R
5000|$|Type of tool (a small drill {{or a large}} drill, {{high speed}} or carbide, a boxtool or recess, a thin form tool or wide form tool, a slide <b>knurl</b> or a turret {{straddle}} <b>knurl).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Knurl</b> point screws are {{generally}} used to secure one object within another. The serrated ridge on the <b>knurl</b> cup set screw helps reduce loosening due to vibration. The knurled point combines digging {{action of the}} cup point with counter-clockwise locking knurls that have a ratchet-locking action which helps resist loosening, even under the most severe vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|Linear knurl: Used with mating plastic pieces, the Linear <b>Knurl</b> allows greater torsion between components.|$|E
50|$|A <b>knurled</b> nut is a nut with a <b>knurled</b> outside surface. This {{facilitates}} tightening by hand (thumb nut) or secures the nut in a substrate (insertion nut).|$|R

50|$|<b>Knurling</b> {{may also}} be used as a repair method: because a rolled-in <b>knurled</b> surface has raised-up areas {{surrounding}} the depressed areas, these raised areas can make up for wear on the part. In the days when labor was cheap and parts expensive, this repair method was feasible on pistons of internal combustion engines, where the skirt of a worn piston was expanded back to the nominal size using a <b>knurling</b> process. As auto parts have become less expensive, <b>knurling</b> has become less prevalent than it once was, and is specifically discouraged by performance engine builders.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knurl</b> is {{the noise}} music project of Alan Bloor, Canadian {{experimental}} composer and sculptor. Based in Toronto, Ontario, Bloor has been performing and recording <b>Knurl</b> material since 1994, when his seminal harsh noise releases [...] "Nervescrap" [...] and [...] "Initial Shock" [...] were recorded and released. He has released over twenty albums internationally, and has collaborated with sound sculptors such as Jim O'Rourke, Thurston Moore, and Aube.|$|E
50|$|Press-in studs are {{installed}} {{from the back}} side of the disk or drum hub and may require removal of the hub from the vehicle for installation or removal. They consist of a threaded portion and a larger diameter section, called the <b>knurl,</b> that is splined to prevent rotation. The diameter of the <b>knurl</b> is larger than the hole in the hub requiring a press fit to seat the stud. The stud is prevented from being pulled through the hub by a larger diameter stop on the end.|$|E
50|$|As of 591 CY, {{the most}} populous towns are <b>Knurl</b> (13,500), Spinecastle (pop. 6,300(?)), and Johnsport (pop. 3,500(?)). The numbers above do {{not take into account}} the large number of other uncounted goblins, gnolls, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operation}} is performed for producing indentations on {{a part of}} a workpiece. <b>Knurling</b> allows hands or fingers to get a better grip on the <b>knurled</b> object than would be provided by the originally smooth metal surface. Occasionally, the <b>knurled</b> pattern is a series of straight ridges or a helix of [...] "straight" [...] ridges rather than the more-usual criss-cross pattern.|$|R
50|$|Hand <b>knurling</b> {{tools are}} available. These {{resemble}} pipecutters but contain <b>knurling</b> wheels rather than cutting wheels. Usually, three wheels are {{carried by the}} tool: two left-handed wheels and one right-handed wheel or vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} clutch uses a <b>knurled</b> collar partially threaded {{below the}} cymbal {{and a pair}} of <b>knurled</b> rings above it. The collar is tightened against the end of the thread, while the rings are tightened against each other.|$|R

50|$|They have {{performed}} in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Japan and the United States, sharing the stage with, among others, artists as Kayo Dot, <b>Knurl,</b> Khanate, Francisco López, Isis, thisquietarmy, BHUTAN drone, stilte, Dronevil and Mare.|$|E
50|$|A popular myth is that rolled knurls are {{somewhat}} more complicated to design than cut knurls because the outer {{diameter of the}} work piece must be chosen to allow the roller to roll an integral number of patterns around the workpiece, in practice if the <b>knurl</b> is applied positively, it will engage with its own impression and create a proper <b>knurl</b> on any diameter of work. The integer number of knurls for any given diameter typically varies by three repetitions from the bottom {{to the top of}} the pattern. By comparison, for cut knurls, the spacing of the cuts is not preset and can be adjusted to allow an integral number of patterns around the workpiece no matter what the diameter of the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|The frame {{provides}} a mounting point for various microscope controls. Normally {{this will include}} controls for focusing, typically a large <b>knurled</b> wheel to adjust coarse focus, together with a smaller <b>knurled</b> wheel to control fine focus. Other features may be lamp controls and/or controls for adjusting the condenser.|$|R

50|$|A women's Olympic bar {{is similar}} to the men's bar, but is shorter - 2.01 m - and lighter - 15 kg - with a smaller grip section {{diameter}} (25 mm). Also in contrast to the men's bar, the women's bar does not sport a center <b>knurl.</b> Powerlifting utilizes the same bar for both male and female competitors.|$|E
50|$|Knurl's {{objective}} is to take music and strip it entirely {{of what we know}} music to be: it's rhythm, melody, vocals, even production quality which is most associated with music today. Bloor records and performs without the assistance of computers, synthesizers or samplers. Labels that have released <b>Knurl</b> material include Alien8 Recordings, RRRecords, Solipsism, Harshnoise, Troniks, Gameboy, and Obscurica.|$|E

50|$|<b>Knurling</b> {{can also}} be used when a {{component}} will be assembled into a low precision component, for example a metal pin into a plastic molding. The outer surface of the metal pin is <b>knurled</b> so that the raised detail 'bites' into the plastic irrespective of whether the size of the hole in the plastic closely matches the diameter of the pin.|$|R

5000|$|Ranald Zal'honan died as {{a result}} of a {{dissipate}} and gluttonous lifestyle, and Firan returned to his home, assuming the seat of power and ruling as [...] "Azal'Lan," [...] or wizard-king. His credits include reversing the decline that <b>Knurl</b> suffered under Ranald's reign, and returning it to economic and military significance. Also, under his reign, magic once again became an important part of Knurl's daily life.|$|E
50|$|Azal'Lan {{was finally}} lured {{out of his}} {{defenses}} {{by the promise of}} a new magical spell that could allow a mage to restore true life to a corpse. Blinded by his hopes for restoring his son, Azal'Lan went forth with a small retinue of guards, and was then ambushed by a group of mercenaries. Fleeing their pursuit, he entered a dense fog to lose them. He was never to see <b>Knurl</b> again.|$|E
50|$|Since that time, Bloor has delved {{heavily into}} {{experimentation}} with found objects as sound sources, which have included fan blades, typewriters, scrap metal and car springs. He has also supplied musical scores for performers Andrew Hammerson (ex DV-8) from the UK and Jake Brown, Montreal. Since {{the beginning of}} 1995 he has been performing solo as <b>Knurl</b> in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Detroit, and has explored a less harsh side of noise music in his acclaimed ambient music project called Pholde.|$|E
