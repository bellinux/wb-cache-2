25|$|Hadith are Muslim traditions {{relating}} to the Sunnah (words and deeds) of Muhammad. They are drawn from the writings of scholars writing between 844 and 874 CE, more than 200 years {{after the death of}} Mohammed in 632 CE. Within Islam, different schools and sects have different opinions on the proper selection and use of Hadith. The four schools of Sunni Islam all consider Hadith second only to the Quran, although they differ on how much <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> should be allowed to legal scholars. Shi'i scholars disagree with Sunni scholars as to which Hadith should be considered reliable. The Shi'as accept the Sunnah of Ali and the Imams as authoritative in addition to the Sunnah of Muhammad, and as a consequence they maintain their own, different, collections of Hadith.|$|E

2500|$|Bishops {{still had}} a <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> [...] The {{competing}} versions of Christianity led many bishops who subscribed {{to what is now}} the mainstream version of Christianity to rally more closely together. [...] Bishops would call synods to discuss problems or doctrinal differences in certain regions; the first of these to be documented occurred in Roman Asia in about 160. [...] Some bishops began to take on a more authoritative role for a region; in many cases, the bishop of the church located in the capital city of a province became the central authority for all churches in that province. [...] These more centralized authorities were known as metropolitan churches headed by a Metropolitan bishop. [...] The churches in Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome exerted authority over groups of these metropolitan churches.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} of Fluxus documents a {{conversation on the}} concepts, media forms and practices developed in an international laboratory of artists, architects, composers, designers and poets. It also documents a dramatic shift in impact and reception. Half a century ago, Fluxus participants did most of their own writing. Today, a far broader conversation includes {{a wide variety of}} writers from many fields and disciplines. This article traces a half-century of change and growth from a critical perspective. It addresses problems in the work of early writers, enthusiastic but personal, often flawed by inaccuracies reflecting personal positions while lacking historiographic awareness. It also raises questions and issues that scholars and critics must consider in today's intermedia era. Serious contributions to the {{literature of}} Fluxus now join personal reflection, philosophical depth and careful scholarship. The growth of excellent writing and the accessibility of source documents make this a time of renewal and opportunity for the literature of Fluxus. The claims of history require establishing a literary space in which the original Fluxus voices speak while allowing writers the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>interpretations...</b>|$|R
2500|$|For modern Disciples the one {{essential}} is {{the acceptance}} of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and obedience to him in baptism. There is no requirement to give assent to any other statement of belief or creed. Nor is there any [...] "official" [...] <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the Bible. Hierarchical doctrine was traditionally rejected by Disciples as human-made and divisive, and subsequently, <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> belief and scriptural interpretation allows many Disciples to question or even deny beliefs common in doctrinal churches such as the Incarnation, the Trinity, and the Atonement. Beyond the essential commitment to follow Jesus {{there is a tremendous}} <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> belief and <b>interpretation.</b> As the basic teachings of Jesus are studied and applied to life, there is the freedom to interpret Jesus' teaching in different ways. As would be expected from such an approach, there is a wide diversity among Disciples in what individuals and congregations believe. It is not uncommon to find individuals who seemingly hold diametrically opposed beliefs within the same congregation affirming one another's journeys of faith as sisters and brothers in Christ.|$|R

40|$|This article explores a site-specific, {{narrative}} {{approach to}} placemaking {{in order to}} reveal ways of reading and reacting to spatial atmospheres. The contribution presents an MSc Architecture project that results {{in the design of}} three particular places on the fringes of the Dutch urban landscape by means of utilizing a narrative approach to reading and analysing the existing site-specific atmospheres. The three architectural follies designed within the landscape present opportunities for the insertion of narrative through experience, illuminating the contents within the existing context. The intention of the project was to explore how an architectural installation could serve as a locus for the generation of new trajectories of perception and understanding. Through a sequencing of events within each landscape folly, the existing site is revealed to the reader in a new way, establishing new circumstances to engage with the landscape. The implementation of narrative within the processes of placemaking allowed for the overlay <b>of</b> subjective <b>interpretations</b> through personal experience, creating spaces saturated with personal signification and interpretation.
