40|$|The {{possibility}} of collecting cotton stalks in Greece {{and using them}} for energy production was investigated. The production and properties of cotton stalks were studied and a system for collection of the aerial part is proposed as a feasible solution to avoid wet conditions under the local climate. A successful method for collection and packaging of the residue was applied, using conventional but highly advantageous equipment, offering reduced investment cost and use of existing machinery. The energy required to <b>harvest</b> <b>cotton</b> stalks was measured by an instrumented tractor. The tractor was able to measure the developed forces between tractor and implement, the power absorbed through the PTO, as well as tractor velocity and fuel consumption. The energy consumed for the operation was calculated and {{when compared to the}} energy of the biomass collected gave a positive balance. The work proved the feasibility of <b>harvesting</b> <b>cotton</b> stalks using conventional machinery giving the possibility to collect energy material with a total energy content of 500, 000 tons of oil equivalent at national level.

50|$|The Dayak life centres on the paddy {{planting}} activity every year. The Iban Dayak {{has their}} own year-long calendar with 12 consecutive months which are one month later than the Roman calendar. The months are named in accordance to the paddy farming activities and the activities in between. Other than paddy, also planted in the farm are vegetables like ensabi, pumpkin, round brinjal, cucumber, corn, lingkau and other food sources like tapioca, sugarcane, sweet potatoes and finally after the paddy has been <b>harvested,</b> <b>cotton</b> is planted which takes about two months to complete its cycle. The cotton is used for weaving before commercial cotton is traded. Fresh lands cleared by each Dayak family will belong to that family and the longhouse community can also use the land with permission from the owning family. Usually, in one riverine system, a special tract of land is reserved for the use by the community itself to get natural supplies of wood, rattan and other wild plants which are necessary for building houses, boats, coffins and other living purposes, and also to leave living space for wild animals which {{is a source of}} meat. Beside farming, Dayaks plant fruit trees like rambutan, langsat, durian, isu and mangosteen near their longhouse or on their land plots to amrk their ownership of the land. They also grow plants which produce dyes for colouring their cotton treads if not taken from the wild forest. Major fishing using the tuba root is normally done by the whole longhouse as the river may take some time to recover. Any wild meat obtained will distribute according to a certain customary law.|$|E

40|$|The {{timing of}} harvest aid {{application}} on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is critical, and poses potential problems when mistimed. The consequences of premature harvest aid application {{could result in}} reduced profit to the grower through {{the need for additional}} applications, reduced lint yield, poor fiber quality, and/or delayed harvest. A delayed application of harvest aid materials may also reduce lint yield and fiber quality if late season inclement weather patterns are established. Currently, there are many methods utilized for determining application of harvest aid materials. One method utilizes accumulated heat units, or growing degree days (HU or DD 60 ??s), following plant physiological maturity. Physiological maturity (cutout) is identified as nodes above white flower equals 5 (NAWF= 5). This method triggers the application of harvest aid chemicals when 850 HU have been accumulated beyond cutout. Due to differing environmental and edaphic characteristics across the Cotton Belt, application of harvest aid chemicals at this time may be premature in terms of optimizing lint yield and fiber quality. A two-year study was established to determine the proper timing of harvest aid application for picker <b>harvested</b> <b>cotton</b> in south central Texas. The design utilized a split-plot with four replications. The main plots consisted of three nodal positions(NAWF= 3, 4, and 5), and the subplots were five HU accumulations (650, 750, 850, 950, and 1050) that corresponded to each of the nodal positions. In both years, lint yields increased with an increase in HU accumulation. Greater yields were achieved when HU accumulation was initiated after NAWF = 4. This two-year study indicates that harvest aid applications made at NAWF = 4 plus 1050 HU would optimize yield potential for picker <b>harvested</b> <b>cotton</b> in south central Texas...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to estimate the effect of using bur extractors in cotton stripping on foreign material in <b>harvested</b> <b>cotton,</b> on both quality attributes and lint turnout, and to determine the minimum harvested acres a producer must have for a bur extractor to be cost effective. Results indicate that the bur extractor has significant effect in reducing bur percent, stick percent, and in increasing seed cotton percent and lint turnout, while is showed no statistically significant effect on any of the quality attributes. Results also suggest that investment in bur extractors is profitable for both irrigated and dryland cotton production situations with an operation of at least 750 acres. This study provides a simple method that can be employed by producers of stripper-harvested cotton to determine the cost effectiveness of a bur extractor given individualized production scenarios.

30|$|In the two villages studied, {{the date}} of opening the fields for common grazing is not set in a {{collective}} manner. Pastoralists first use their own crop residues, followed by those of farmer ‘friends’ who keep them informed about which plots have been harvested. The law authorizes the common grazing of fields after crops have been removed. However, farmers who also own animals consider that their animals have priority rights over the residues on their own fields. To obstruct the entry of pastoralists’ herds, some farmers {{take the risk of}} storing the <b>harvested</b> <b>cotton</b> crop on the field as long as possible. Given this situation, in Ourolabo III, pastoralists follow very closely the progress of crops harvested and do not hesitate to bring their herds to the fields at night without permission as soon as the crop has been cleared. Pastoralists consider crop residues as a recompense for the fodder lost when rangelands are cleared for cultivation by farmers.|$|E
40|$|Modules for cotton {{storage and}} {{transport}} should be constructed with a shape that will resist collecting water to maintain the quality of seed cotton during storage. Meeting this specification requires knowledge {{of the relationship between}} the applied compressive force, deformation, and time for seed cotton. Several factors were tested to determine their effects on the height and density of seed cotton during compression, creep loading, and recovery. Models were used to describe these processes. These results were used to develop an algorithm capable of providing information on module shape to the module builder operator. The initial loading density did not affect the compressed density, but a slight effect was observed in the recovered density, due to the weight of the seed cotton. Picker <b>harvested</b> <b>cotton</b> was compressed to a greater density than stripper <b>harvested</b> <b>cotton,</b> but expanded more during recovery, resulting in similar final densities. Multiple compressions increased the density, but this increase was not physically significant after the third compression. Higher moisture content increased the density seed cotton could be compressed to slightly. Viscoelastic behavior was observed; however, the effect on density was small. Both the compression and creep curves were described using mathematical models. A compression model using an asymptotic true strain measure yielded high R 2 values; however, some aspect of this process remained unexplained and the equation was limited in its predictive ability. Creep behavior was described using a modified Burgers model. This model was more accurate than the creep model, although a definite trend existed in the creep model residuals. A feedback algorithm was developed based on the observation that the compressed density was primarily dependent on the mass of seed cotton and not the initial density. By measuring the compressed depth of cotton in a module and the hydraulic pressure of the tramper foot cylinder, the resulting shape of the module can be predicted. Improved loading of the module builder is necessary to produce a desirably shaped module. More seed cotton needs to be placed in the center of the module, resulting in a surface that slopes down towards the outer edges...|$|E
