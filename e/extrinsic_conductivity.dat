40|$|After a brief {{survey of}} the defects {{introduced}} by plastic deformation and of their removal by annealing, the influence of plastic deformation upon ionic conductivity is considered. Both enhancement and suppression of the extrinsic conduction has been found experimentally {{in addition to an}} enhancement at very high temperatures in the intrinsic region I'. These effects can be explained in terms of dislocations and their interactions during plastic flow. In polycrystaline material of near theoretical density, the grain boundaries appear to enhance only the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>conductivity</b> and to increase the observed activation energy in this region...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Zinc {{telluride}} {{thin films}} have been grown {{at room temperature}} and higher temperature substrates by thermal evaporation technique in a vacuum of 10 – 6 torr. A main peak in the photocurrent is observed at 781 nm (1 ⋅ 58 eV) with two lower amplitude peaks on the lower wavelength side and one on higher wavelength side. The evaluated thermal activation energy is found to correspond well with the main spectral peak. From these studies it can be inferred that temperatures up to 453 K {{is still in the}} <b>extrinsic</b> <b>conductivity</b> region of the studied ZnTe thin films...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the <b>extrinsic</b> spin Hall <b>conductivity</b> {{induced by}} the skew scattering is performed from the fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach in (001) GaAs symmetric quantum well. In the steady state, the extrinsic spin Hall current/conductivity vanishes for the linear- k dependent spin-orbit coupling and is very small for the cubic- k dependent spin-orbit coupling. The spin precession {{induced by the}} Dresselhaus/Rashba spin-orbit coupling plays {{a very important role}} in the vanishment of the <b>extrinsic</b> spin Hall <b>conductivity</b> in the steady state. An in-plane spin polarization is induced by the skew scattering, {{with the help of the}} spin-orbit coupling. This spin polarization is very different from the current-induced spin polarization.

40|$|URL:[URL] DOI: 10. 1103 /PhysRevB. 73. 115339 We {{develop the}} {{microscopic}} {{theory of the}} <b>extrinsic</b> spin-Hall <b>conductivity</b> of a two- dimensional electron gas, including skew- scattering, side-jump, and Coulomb interaction effects. We find that while the spin-Hall conductivity connected with the side jump is independent {{of the strength of}} electron-electron interactions, the skew-scattering term is reduced by the spin-Coulomb drag, so the total spin current and the total spin-Hall conductivity are reduced for typical experimental mobilities. Further, we predict that in paramagnetic systems the spin-Coulomb drag reduces the spin accumulations in two different ways: (i) directly through the reduction of the skew-scattering contribution, and (ii) indirectly through the reduction of the spin diffusion length. Explicit expressions for the various contributions to the spin-Hall conductivity are obtained using an exactly solvable model of the skew scattering.

40|$|Intrinsic and {{extrinsic}} spin Hall {{effects are}} considered together {{on an equal}} theoretical footing for the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional (2 D) electron and hole systems, using the diagrammatic method for calculating the spin Hall conductivity. Our analytic theory for the 2 D holes shows the expected lowest-order additive result for the spin Hall conductivity. But, the 2 D electrons manifest a very surprising result, exhibiting a non-analyticity in the Rashba coupling strength α where the strictly <b>extrinsic</b> spin Hall <b>conductivity</b> (for α = 0) cannot be recovered from the α→ 0 limit of the combined theory.

40|$|Topological {{insulators}} {{represent a}} novel {{state of matter}} with surface charge carriers having a massless Dirac dispersion and locked helical spin polarization. Many exciting experiments have been proposed by theory, yet their execution has been hampered by the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>conductivity</b> associated with the unavoidable presence of defects in Bi 2 Te 3 and Bi 2 Se 3 bulk single crystals, as well as impurities on their surfaces. Here we present the preparation of Bi 2 Te 3 thin films that are insulating in the bulk and the four-point probe measurement of the conductivity of the Dirac states on surfaces that are intrinsically clean. The total amount of charge carriers in the experiment is {{of the order of}} 1012 cm− 2 only, and mobilities up to 4, 600 cm 2 /Vs have been observed. These values are achieved by carrying out the preparation, structural characterization, angle-resolved and X-ray photoemission analysis, and temperature-dependent four-point probe conductivity measurement all in situ under ultra-high-vacuum conditions. This experimental approach opens the way to prepare devices that can exploit the intrinsic topological properties of the Dirac surface states...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} spin Hall device to induce a large spin Hall effect in a superconductor/normal metal (SN) junction. The side jump and skew {{scattering}} mechanisms are both {{taken into account}} to calculate the <b>extrinsic</b> spin Hall <b>conductivity</b> in the normal metal. We find that both contributions are anomalously enhanced when the voltage between the superconductor and the normal metal approaches to the superconducting gap. This enhancement is attributed to the resonant increase of the density of states in the normal metal at the Fermi level. Our results demonstrate a novel way to control and amplify the spin Hall conductivity by applying an external dc electric field, suggesting that a SN junction has a potential application for a spintronic device with a large spin Hall effect.

40|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity and chlorine ion diffusion in KC 1 and KCl:SrC 12 single crystals have been analyzed by least-squares methods, using {{as a model}} a perfect crystal perturbed by five defects: isolated anion vacancies, isolated cation vacancies, divalent cation impurities, divalent cation-impurity-cation-vacancy complexes, and vacancy pairs. The transport equations were derived from this five-defect model using a simple theory for noninteracting particles, except for the nearest-neighbor binding to form complexes and vacancy pairs, and using the same theory including long-range Coulomb interactions between the isolated defects. This latter theory yielded the better description of the experimental results. However, the analyses showed that significant nonrandom deviations exist between theory and experiment. These deviations exist in both the intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> regions of <b>conductivity.</b> The failure of existing concepts for these transport properties is {{discussed in terms of}} possible additional mechanisms, i. e., electrons, cationic Frenkel defects, or trivacancies, and in terms of more complete theoretical treatment...|$|R
40|$|The spin {{relaxation}} {{induced by}} the Elliott-Yafet mechanism and the <b>extrinsic</b> spin Hall <b>conductivity</b> due to the skew scattering are investigated in 5 d transition-metal ultrathin films with self-adatom impurities as scatterers. The values of the Elliott-Yafet parameter and of the spin-flip relaxation rate reveal a correlation with each other that is {{in agreement with the}} Elliott approximation. At 10 -layer thickness, the spin-flip relaxation time in 5 d transition-metal films is quantitatively reported about few hundred nanoseconds at atomic percent. This time scale is one and two orders of magnitude shorter than the values in Au and Cu thin films, respectively. The anisotropy effect of the Elliott-Yafet parameter and of the spin-flip relaxation rate with respect to the direction of the spin-quantization axis in relation to the crystallographic axes is also analyzed. We find that the anisotropy of the spin-flip relaxation rate is enhanced due to the Rashba surface states on the Fermi surface, reaching values as high as 97 % in 10 -layer Hf(0001) film or 71 % in 10 -layer W(110) film. Finally, the spin Hall conductivity as well as the spin Hall angle due to the skew scattering off self-adatom impurities are calculated using the Boltzmann approach. Our calculations employ a relativistic version of the first-principles full-potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function method...|$|R
