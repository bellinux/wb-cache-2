40|$|We numerically {{study the}} static {{structure}} and the mechanical response of two-dimensional granular piles. The piles consist of polydisperse disks with and without friction. Special attention is paid for the rigid grain limit by examining the systems with various disk elasticities. It is shown that the static pile structure of frictionless disks becomes isostatic in the rigid limit, while the isostaticity of <b>frictional</b> <b>pile</b> depends on the pile forming procedure, {{but in the case}} of the infinite friction is effective, the structure becomes very close to isostatic in the rigid limit. The mechanical response of the piles are studied by infinitesimally displacing one of the disks at the bottom. It is shown that the total amount of the displacement in the pile caused by the perturbation diverges in the case of frictionless pile as it becomes isostatic, while the response remains finite for the <b>frictional</b> <b>pile.</b> In the frictionless isostatic pile, the displacement response in each sample behaves rather complicated way, but its average shows wave like propagation.

40|$|We have {{performed}} numerical studies of dense granular flows on an incline with a rough bottom {{in two and}} three dimensions. This flow geometry produces a constant density profile that satisfies scaling relations of the Bagnold, rather than the viscous, kind. No surface-only flows were observed. The bulk and the surface layer differ in their rheology, {{as evidenced by the}} change in principal stress directions near the surface; a Mohr–Coulomb type failure criterion is seen only near the surface. In the bulk, normal stress anomalies are observed both in two and in three dimensions. We do not observe isostaticity in static <b>frictional</b> <b>piles</b> obtained by arresting the flow. Granular flow, rheology, non-Newtonian fluid dynamics, granular packings, powder mechanics, iso-staticity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the behavior of batter pile groups under seismic excitations. Using 3 D Finite Element Method a model has been developed to investigate dynamic response of batter pile groups. The governing constitutive model behavior for analysis is a Hardening Drucker-Prager behavior. In order to implement boundary conditions to soil medium series of Dashpot Elements are attached to the media so that absorbing boundary conditions have been taken into account. The pile group model has been affected by seismic excitations and the analysis has been performed using Rayleigh damping through dynamic explicit method. The group pile studied in the present work consists of four <b>frictional</b> <b>piles</b> which different model groups have been created during parametric study. The present research aims to study the effect of pile inclination angle on the performance of batter pile groups under seismic motions. Moreover, the influences of slenderness and spacing ratios on performance of group piles have been also considered...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a settlement-based method is {{proposed}} to design piled raft foundation. The proposed design method {{is found to}} be very efficient, economical and requires less calculation time. Simple software can be used to execute all the interactions and loop calculations. Unlike methods with numerical techniques, there are practically no limitations for the number of individual piles under the raft, size of the group and the group shape or layout. It can also be applied to piles with different length or piles that are located within multi-layered soils. The raft is designed first according to the allowable settlement that is pre-defined by the structural requirements and with the necessary factor of safety. When raft suffers excessive settlement, then the load that causes excess raft settlement beyond the required limit is to be transferred to the fully mobilised <b>frictional</b> <b>piles.</b> The fully mobilised shaft (with no end bearing) piles are designed with factor of safety close to unity since their function is only to reduce raft settlement and since the raft has an adequate bearing capacity. Geometry of these piles is chosen to fully mobilise their shafts capacity with low settlement level in order to comply with load/settlement requirement and reduce raft settlement to the pre-defined level.

40|$|Abstract. The {{squeezed}} branch pile {{is a kind}} of <b>frictional</b> {{end bearing}} <b>pile</b> which is variable cross-section, a new type of pile foundation with characteristics of high bearing capacity and low settlement. In order to explore vertical settlement regularity of the squeezed branch pile, this paper carries out the theoretical analysis and experimental research on the consolidation settlement law of the squeezed branch pile through the numerical method and static load test. The results of numerical analysis and experimental research show that vertical consolidation settlement is reduced along with increase of the squeezed branch pile diameter, and the settlement of the squeezed branch pile is given priority to consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Pile-slab {{structure}} {{is a new}} subgrade construction {{with the development of}} high-speed railways in China. It is currently used in a number of high-speed railways. However, it is mainly designed by the empirical design method since the interaction mechanism among piles, slab and subgrade soil is not clear. The supporting effect on the slab and the lateral constraint effect on piles caused by subgrade soil is not considered using the empirical design method. A three-dimensional finite element model including train, track and pile-slab {{structure is}} established so as to make a systemic mechanical analysis of the slab, piles and subgrade soil in pile-slab structure. The conclusions is as follows:(1) When the supporting effect on the slab is not considered, the stress of the slab increases by 11. 8 % ~ 13. 4 %, the stress at the bottom of piles increases by 10. 3 % ~ 11. 2 %, the deflection of the slab increases by 11. 0 % ~ 12. 0 %. (2) The vertical displacement of the slab increases by about 52. 9 % that of piles increases by about 69. 4 % after removing the soil of the embankment and the soft soil in the roadbed. This indicates that the embankment soil plays {{a significant role in the}} supporting effect on the slab and provides a positive <b>frictional</b> resistance on <b>piles.</b> (3) The lateral deformation of the pile-slab structure increases by approximately 25 % when slab and soil doesn't contact, indicating that the contact between slab and soil has a certain effect on the lateral deformation of the pile-slab structure. The lateral deformation of the pile-slab structure increases by about 2. 5 times when removing the embankment layer, indicating that the latera...|$|R
