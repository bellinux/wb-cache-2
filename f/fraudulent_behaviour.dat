40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of technology}} for both productive and managerial business functions raises new issues related to fraud and internal control. Fraud is on an increasing trend and if left unchecked can cause significant losses to employers. This study therefore investigates the relationship between employees' attitudes toward <b>fraudulent</b> <b>behaviours</b> at workplace and the control environment. A sample 433 employees in Malaysia were involved in this empirical study. Data was gathered via a self-administered questionnaire survey. Results of the regression analyses performed identify elements of the control environment that could influence employees' attitudes towards employee fraud and thus highlight elements that should receive more attention. Ultimately, an organization must put in place an information system that can detect <b>fraudulent</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{and at the same}} time develop the right control environment that can prevent fraudulent activities...|$|R

40|$|Acting {{within the}} agency theory {{theoretical}} framework, the paper {{focuses on the}} role of the corporate governance as a system to monitor and predict the fraud occurrence and magnitude. Specifically, the study examines the impact of the quality of the corporate governance of the firms, for which a fraud was detected, on the fraud occurrence and magnitude. We posit that <b>fraudulent</b> <b>behaviours,</b> by those who can take advantage of information asymmetry and gain personal benefits from them, can occur when strong agency problems emerge and a weak governance exists. Thus, the financial statement fraud can be seen as the result of high agency problems and high conflicts of interests not solved by the company. Starting from a sample of 101 listed companies, for which a fraud was detected, using a principal component analysis, we develop a corporate governance index, which measures the quality of the governance system of the firms. To test the hypothesis, we run a multinomial logistic regression on a cross-sectional analysis, controlling the results with a matched sample of firms that did not experienced any fraud. Empirical evidences seem to confirm the existence of a negative relationship between the quality of the corporate governance system of a firm and both the financial statement fraud occurrence and magnitude, indicating the governance system of the firm as a fraud deterrent for any amount of financial statement fraud. These findings are even stronger for firms characterized by the presence of a blockholder. This study contributes to the governance literature by focusing on the corporate governance quality and its impact on financial statement frauds. Moreover, the analysis suggests that a good level of governance can help companies to mitigate the agency problems and to detect <b>fraudulent</b> <b>behaviours,</b> thus our empirical evidence can guide regulators in developing regulations to avoid the fraud occurrence...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{studies have}} shown fraud to be {{pervasive}} in Nigeria. Findings from numerous studies which investigated the typology and occurrence of fraud in the Nigerian financial institutions show that most <b>fraudulent</b> <b>behaviours</b> occur in the banking industry.

A total of 600 participants were used for the study, divided into three samples: convicted bankers, non-convicted bankers, and employees other than bankers. Data was collected using demographic questionnaire and the Extravagant Lifestyle Scale (ELAS). The results showed that the convicted bankers had significantly higher ELAS scores than non-convicted bankers and non-bankers (F(2, 597) = 26. 94; p <. 01).

40|$|Although {{there is}} a growing volume of {{research}} on different types of fraud, relatively little has been written about <b>fraudulent</b> consumer <b>behaviour.</b> Even fewer studies have been written about <b>fraudulent</b> consumer <b>behaviour</b> in the retail sector, nor of the strategies for managing such fraud. This study filled this identified gap. The focus of this study is not on large-scale corporate fraud but on consumers who misrepresent the facts of their interaction with a retailer for personal gain. The ethnographic case study method employing semi-structured interviews and observation (in one of the companies) was used for the study. Given the size of the companies and the financial implication of this fraud, it was expected that there would be clear action plans for managing such an issue. In order to ensure the success of this study, the fraud management lifecycle theory was used to organise, discuss and assess the approaches used within the companies. First party fraud was found to be reinforced by numerous factors such as the availability of opportunities, retail employees that abuse their trusted positions, law enforcement officials who often do not view this behaviour as criminal and inappropriate sanctions by retailers sometimes on the verge of toleration; hence first party fraud is thus made easier. This study shows that first party fraud is mostly an opportunistic crime. It also emerged that some of the retailers did not realise they had a fraud problem and even when they did, found it cost-effective to ignore some of it. However, one retailer had good action plan, which helped them reduce first party fraud losses to a greater extent. This study found that managing first party fraud effectively is possible if retailers acknowledge that {{there is a}} serious problem to address. First party fraud requires effective: deterrence, prevention, detection and mitigation, analysis, investigation and sanction...|$|R

This study enunciates non-fraudulent claiming behaviour as the sample included only a low number of suspected fraud cases. Variables contained {{within each of the}} claim files were analysed, as were the statements of the insured individuals. Each claimant is required to provide two written statements to the local insurance company and these statements were analysed for consistency and detail. The overall findings revealed that claimants were generally employed, middle-aged males who were sober {{at the time of the}} theft and had good driving records. A majority of the stolen vehicles were located, and one-third of these vehicles were damaged beyond repair. Most vehicles stolen were either Holden or Ford models and were low-value. Vehicles were more likely to be stolen from shopping centre car parks than from the insureds’ residences. A statement typology consisting of four categories – adequate, garrulous, reticent and phlegmatic – was proposed. A majority of the statements were categorised as adequate where sufficient detail regarding times and witnesses were provided. Several statements were considered phlegmatic and lacked sufficient detail. Over three-quarters of the insureds’ written statements were consistent with one another. Given the exploratory nature of this study, no strong inferences should be made. Rather this study serves as a catalyst for further research into Australia’s insurance industry. Specifically, future research should explore fraudulent automobile insurance claims thus providing greater insight into <b>fraudulent</b> claiming <b>behaviour,</b> with the potential to likewise explore compliant behaviour by those insured...|$|R
40|$|According to a {{large part}} of now-day historiography, the XVIIIth century economy is {{comparable}} to a mechanism that produces development and, at the same time, control and marginalisation. At the top there are big merchants and states that control production, market, political and military hierarchy, leaving scant spaces to the other subjects, who reach sometimes the upper levels of the market only through "irregular" and <b>fraudulent</b> entrepreneurial <b>behaviours.</b> Following the suggestions of some recent work, the author suggests a different image of the XVIIIth century commercial development in the Mediterranean, in which a large part in plaid by "minor" actors and marginal places who are not able to mobilise significant amount of capital, information, state protection. The Genovesi at the centre of this easy, and at the centre of {{an important part of the}} XVIIIth century Mediterranean economy, are not from Genoa, and they have nothing to do with the illustrious early-modern Genoese entrepreneurial and financial tradition. they are micro-merchants, often captains of their own ships, born and grown in tiny seaside villages of the western Riviera of Liguria, who are able to invent new ways to conquer information, trust, capitals, contacts and market spaces. a most important asset in their command is the relationship with their Riviera villages: very weak from the demographic, institutional, financial and commercial point of view, they possess an important "relational" capital largely employed in order to achieve commercial success even in far aesy important market places. Through a series of individual and group biography, the essay suggets the image of a Mediterranean crowed by actors, practices and places often forgotten in the history books. leaving them off the picture, we run the risk of misunderstanding the actual working of this late-modern economy in a decisive moment of its growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{current crisis}} {{is viewed by}} most analysts as a {{financial}} one, generated by malfunctioning financial market rules affecting the real economy through wealth effects, rising uncertainty and credit crunch. This interpretation is certainly consistent with a vision of crises as exogenous shocks, produced {{from time to time}} by more or less unforeseeable events, such as natural catastrophes, political disturbances, terrorist attacks, breaches in the international order, wars, and even the <b>fraudulent,</b> opportunistic <b>behaviours</b> of greedy and unscrupulous financial operators. In the nineteenth century most economists believed business crises were periodic. In the twentieth century economic fluctuations were not empirically regular and modern macroeconomics abandoned attempts to interpret them by means of deterministic cycles. Yet the persistent recurrence of economic crises in the economic history of last two centuries may suggest that they are phases of a cyclical pattern ingrained in the development dynamics of capitalist economies. In which case, explanations founded on exogenous and random causes prove hardly very convincing. In economic literature there are many theories on business cycles, some “endogenous”, others “exogenous”. But most endogenous theories of business cycles do not refer to monetary and financial aspects, while exogenous theories refer to them only as random initial causes. Yet in the history of economic thought we find different interpretations of the relationships between economic and financial crises, such as that of Marx, which set out to show a causative relationship proceeding from the real to the financial, even though the latter tends to appear first. In this paper we attempt to contextualize this kind of interpretation, analysing its internal logic and its consistency with empirical experience. We dwell in particular upon the different abstract causes of economic crises that we can identify in Marx’s works, analysing the way they interact with each other in determining the features of concrete crises in the real world. We also endeavour to draw from these causes some useful implications for {{a better understanding of the}} present crisis and to forecast its probable future trends. In particular, in the conclusions, we underline the possible role of underconsumption in determining the current crisis and the ways by which this kind of phenomenon was able to assume the form of a highly speculative and extremely instable credit chain, fed by speculative bubbles...|$|R

40|$|Peer reviewedThis paper {{engages in}} a doctrinal {{analysis}} of historical precedent on aggrieved shareholder {{claims in the}} UK. It does {{so in order to}} expose the basis for the judgment of the House of Lords in the foundational case of Houldsworth v City of Glasgow Bank (1880) 5 App Cas 317, which held in cases involving <b>fraudulent</b> or misleading <b>behaviour</b> inducing share purchase that it would be inconsistent with a shareholder’s membership contract to ‘claim back’ amounts originally committed to the company for the pursuit of its business objects and the payment of its liabilities. This analysis will demonstrate that the judgments in Houldsworth (which have prevented shareholders ranking on par with unsecured creditors up until the determination of the High Court in Sons of Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) v Margaretic (2007) HCA 1) ignored relevant legislation in the form of s 38 (7) of the Companies Act 1862 UK which was specifically applicable to cases involving aggrieved shareholder claims, instead relying on principles drawn from the law of partnerships to decide the case. While it is submitted that the High Court was justified in choosing not to apply Houldsworth, the rule may still prove good law in certain circumstances. Having been the subject of a recent Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee review the issue of aggrieved shareholder claims is current as ever, though the veins of the problem run rather deep in the history of Australian and UK corporations law.

40|$|At the {{crossroads}} of insolvency and securities law lies {{the question as to}} whether defrauded shareholders should rank equally with unsecured creditors in cases involving <b>fraudulent</b> or misleading <b>behaviour.</b> Important questions arise at this juncture concerning the efficiency, certainty, transparency and fairness of the treatment of such claims in insolvency situations. In Sons of Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) v Margaretic [2007] HCA 1, the High Court chose not to apply a rule said to be germane to insolvency cases involving fraudulent or misleading conduct inducing share purchase known as the rule in Houldsworth&# 146;s Case. The &# 147;rule&# 148; said to have been developed in Houldsworth v City of Glasgow Bank (1880) 5 App Cas 317 had up until the High Court&# 146;s decision been used to interpret legislative provisions concerning shareholder claims, resulting in problematic determinations in the context of modern developed markets. While it is submitted the High Court was justified in choosing not to apply the rule in Houldsworth&# 146;s Case and thus allowing shareholders to claim as unsecured creditors, the rule may still prove good law in certain cases. Indeed, the referral of the High Court&# 146;s decision to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee for review may result in legislative change which reverts to the traditional treatment of shareholders in such circumstances. Accordingly this dissertation engages in a doctrinal analysis of historical precedent on defrauded shareholder claims in the UK and Australia to demonstrate that the decision in Houldsworth and subsequent interpretation and application of the &# 147;rule&# 148; therein suffer from deep flaws, and have been productive of relative injustice. It is argued {{that it is necessary to}} put the current uncertainty surrounding the applicability of Houldsworth in Australia beyond doubt through legislative abrogation of the rule in Houldsworth&# 146;s Case. As the result of such abrogation would represent a significant policy shift in Australian corporate law, the merits and difficulties of the resulting position will be addressed by this dissertation. It will be argued that a policy of shareholder parity with unsecured creditors best meets the goals of insolvency and securities law regimes while contributing to the sustainability of a fair and efficient market, and investor participation in it...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a set of four sole-authored, reviewed and published papers which develop the theme that company accounting policies, particularly those relating to asset valuation, depreciation and dividend policy, developed in response to a change in the general perception {{of the nature of the}} property rights of the original owners. The original owners of commercial and industrial concerns in the early nineteenth century were the partners. After incorporation they and others became the shareholders of the company. The origin of commercial and industrial companies as partnerships influenced the British government and legal thinking for nearly a century from 1856 to 1945, the date of the Cohen Committee. It was the age of laissez-faire and has been much discussed: Parliament was less keen to intervene in connection with the generality of companies, where the view expressed in 1856 by Robert Lowe, then President of the Board of Trade, that `having given [companies] a pattern the State leaves then to manage their own affairs [...] . (quoted in Hein, 1978, p. 149) provided a rationalization of the widespread belief that it was no business of the state to interfere in what were seen as private contracts between shareholders (Sugarman and-Rubin, 1984, p. 12). Moreover, a laissez-faire approach on the part of the courts, where `formalist' views were at their height (Atiyah, 1979, pp. 388 - 97), seems also to have affected the attitude to accounts on the part of the courts. This may be observed in the series of `dividend' cases in the nineteenth century (French, 1977) where judges on the whole were loath to go beyond the companies' Articles of Association and the latter of the Companies' Acts (unless they could adduce <b>fraudulent</b> or improper <b>behaviour</b> on the part of directors) in assessing matters of valuation, income measurement and profit determination. (Napier and Noke, 1992, p. 38, emphasis added). These issues `matters of valuation, income measurement and profit determination' form the basis for much of this dissertation.
