5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight <b>doors.</b> The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing <b>doors</b> that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the <b>doors.</b> Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the <b>doors</b> closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|Equipped {{with special}} Allied Full Cushion {{high-speed}} swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers {{were designed to}} be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end <b>doors</b> {{similar to those found}} on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide <b>doors</b> positioned on each side {{at the center of the}} cars with built-in trap <b>doors</b> and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E

5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front <b>doors</b> to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front <b>doors</b> from view. Once inside the modern <b>doors,</b> the nonfunctional original <b>doors</b> can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the <b>doors,</b> in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|On November 28, 2009, two <b>doors</b> {{fell off}} from an AirTrain {{that had just}} been maintained. Since the {{incident}} happened in the overnight hours, no one was aboard the train when the <b>doors</b> fell off.|$|E
5|$|Other rooms {{include the}} casino, where creatures gamble for either {{pleasure}} {{or to be}} exploited for gold, the Workshop, where traps and <b>doors</b> are produced, the torture chamber, where creatures are tortured. Traps include the Sentry trap, which shoots nearby enemy creatures, the Fear trap, which scares enemies away, and the Alarm trap, which alerts its owner if it detect enemy creatures nearby. <b>Doors</b> block enemies while still allowing its owner's creatures passage. They come in various forms, such as Wooden, Braced, Secret, and Magic. Secret <b>doors</b> imitate walls, and Magic <b>doors</b> defend themselves by shooting enemy creatures. Bridges connect areas and facilitate transport over water and lava tiles, the latter harming most creatures and burning Wooden Bridges. Stone Bridges are immune.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of the <b>door</b> open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the <b>door,</b> typically until a timeout occurs and the <b>door</b> closes. The {{operation of}} the <b>door</b> close button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that the <b>door</b> close button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working <b>door</b> open and <b>door</b> close buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, the <b>door</b> open and <b>door</b> close buttons are used to manually open or close the <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some <b>door</b> close buttons immediately closing the <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so the <b>door</b> cannot be closed until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), the <b>door</b> close button has no effect. However, the <b>door</b> close button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the <b>door</b> won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the <b>door</b> close will immediately close the <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a <b>door</b> open push. The minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> closing in the US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{are built}} {{on top of a}} {{standard}} <b>door</b> closer. To open the <b>door,</b> the operator forces the closer in the opening direction. Then, the closer closes the <b>door.</b> The user may open the <b>door</b> manually, using just the <b>door</b> closer. In case of power failure while the <b>door</b> is open, the closer itself closes the <b>door.</b>|$|R
5|$|The 767 {{interior}} introduced larger overhead bins {{and more}} lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft <b>doors,</b> allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and service <b>doors</b> are an overhead plug type, which retract upwards, and commonly used <b>doors</b> can {{be equipped with}} an electric-assist system.|$|E
5|$|The MTA also {{expressed}} interest in starting a pilot program to install platform edge <b>doors.</b> Several planned stations in the New York City Subway may possibly feature platform screen <b>doors,</b> possibly including future stations such as those part of the Second Avenue Subway. Currently, the MTA is planning a test program to install screen <b>doors</b> at a subway station on the BMT Canarsie Line. As part of the 2010–2014 capital program, the station {{was going to be}} Sixth Avenue, but it is uncertain whether or not that this will be the station chosen. Following a series of incidents during one week in November 2016, in which 3 people were injured or killed after being pushed onto the tracks, the MTA started to consider installing platform edge <b>doors</b> for the 42nd Street Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{designed in the}} Italianate style, with the specialty leanings demanded by a schoolhouse. The front facade, which faces southwest today, is adorned with three doorways—left, right, and center— which span a front porch beneath the bell tower. When the school was open, {{the use of the}} <b>doors</b> was restricted. The left and right <b>doors</b> were used by boys in first through eighth grades while the middle door was earmarked as an entry for girls of all ages. Each of the <b>doors</b> feature transoms topped with cornices.|$|E

5|$|The train <b>doors</b> were {{originally}} designed to be opened and closed automatically and the <b>doors</b> would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator <b>doors</b> do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the <b>doors</b> may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio <b>doors</b> at the back. (The patio <b>doors</b> could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio <b>doors</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at the Necromanteion, the reunited crew is {{attacked}} by Clytius, Pasiphaë, {{and a group}} of their minions. Each of the demigods uses some aspect of their newly strengthened powers or identities to help defeat these monsters; for example, Hazel's new power and alliance with Hecate helps her defeat Pasiphaë and Clytius. During the questers' journey in the mortal world, Percy and Annabeth have been travelling through Tartarus {{to the other side of}} the <b>Doors</b> of Death, aided by the Titan Iapetus (Bob) and a few other beings. As the other demigods fight in the world above, Percy and Annabeth's group reaches the <b>Doors</b> and fights the personification of Tartarus to destroy the chains holding the <b>Doors</b> in place. Bob stays behind amongst hordes of angry monsters to defend the <b>Doors</b> while Percy and Annabeth escape. Once the full quest group is safely reassembled in the mortal world, Reyna arrives on her dying Pegasus. Annabeth says that Reyna, as a Roman, should bring the Athena Parthenos (in the Argo IIs hold) back to Camp Half-Blood to appease both the Greeks and Romans, with Nico and Coach Hedge volunteering to accompany her.|$|E
50|$|A {{doorstop}} (also <b>door</b> stopper, <b>door</b> stop or <b>door</b> wedge) is {{an object}} or device {{used to hold}} a <b>door</b> open or closed, or to prevent a <b>door</b> from opening too widely. Alternatively, a doorstop can be a thin slat built inside a <b>door</b> frame to prevent a <b>door</b> from swinging through when closed. A doorstop (applied) {{may also be a}} small bracket or 90 degree piece of metal applied to the frame of a <b>door</b> to stop the <b>door</b> from swinging (bi-directional) and converting that <b>door</b> to a single direction (in-swing push or out-swing pull).|$|R
50|$|A sliding <b>door</b> {{operator}} (or sliding <b>door</b> opener or automatic sliding <b>door</b> operator) is {{a device}} that operates a sliding <b>door</b> for pedestrian use. It opens the <b>door</b> automatically, waits, then closes it.|$|R

5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the <b>doors</b> of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the <b>doors.</b> The patio <b>doors</b> could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|By 14 March 2012, all {{elevated}} {{stations have}} been retrofitted with the <b>doors</b> and are operational. These <b>doors</b> prevent suicides and unauthorised access to restricted areas. Under the Rapid Transit Systems Act, acts such as smoking, eating or drinking in stations and trains, {{the misuse of}} emergency equipment and trespassing on the railway tracks are illegal, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked <b>doors.</b> Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some <b>doors</b> are locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these <b>doors,</b> the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E
5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} the <b>doors</b> and flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The <b>doors</b> {{can only be}} closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the <b>doors</b> too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E

They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast {{in one piece}} using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. The <b>doors</b> are decorated with scenes {{from the history of}} Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important {{in the construction of the}} capitol, like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew Quay, decorate the edges of the <b>doors.</b> The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole.|$|E
