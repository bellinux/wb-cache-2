Shorter product development time along with being more environmentally friendly are among the benefits offered by hard turning, which potentially results in lower manufacturing cost per part. However, common tool materials for hard turning applications are expensive. Due to the continuous developments in cutting tool materials and coating technology, inexpensive coated carbide cutting tools are being investigated to determine the potential of using them for use in extreme conditions as in hard turning.

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{precision}} mechanical components such as bearings, fuel injectors and gears, which are made of hardened steels, and have to be machined to a high degree of precision. Because of the stringent performance and functional requirements for these components, surface quality in terms of surface topography, microhardness, microstructure, and residual stresses must be specified and achieved through the appropriate manufacturing process sequence. The availability of hard cubic boron nitride (CBN) cutting tools has opened up the possibility of achieving these requirements by a <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> process, while requiring little or no grinding. A study has been made of the nature of surfaces of M 2 high speed steel produced by <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> with CBN tools. This has involved measurement of forces, surface finish, residual stresses, form errors and metallurgical changes associated with CBN turning of hard steels. The force measurements have enabled a characterization of the mechanics of the <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> process in terms of the mechanical and thermal loads. It is found that the specific energy for machining M 2 steel is around 7 Joules/mm 3 which is ten times smaller than that found in grinding. Using forces, an estimate has been made of the friction coefficient at the tool-chip interface and the shear plane temperature. The surface finish and form measurements show that roughness values down to 0. 13 μ m Ra, and straightness, roundness, cylindricity, and parallelism values of 1 μm or smaller can be attained through the proper selection of process parameters. Various aspects of machining residual stresses have been investigated such as the effect of process parameters on the stress state, principal stresses, repeatability of the process in the context of residual stress generation and the evolution of residual stresses from heat treatment through to <b>finish</b> <b>machining.</b> A qualitative correlation has been established between work surface temperature and the residual stress state, just as in the grinding of hardened steels. The effect of process parameters on microhardness, microstructure and chip formation has also been investigated. The implications of this study to the <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> of precision mechanical components are discussed. ...|$|R

Experiments on high speed rough <b>machining</b> and <b>finishing</b> <b>machining</b> of the commonly used 6061 aluminum alloy are conducted to find its performance and best combination of machining parameters. The rough machining experiment is to find the best machining parameters to achieve maximum material removal rate (MRR). It is found that MRR can be improved 2. 4 times by reducing spindle speed and increasing depth of cut via simple chatter tests. The <b>finishing</b> <b>machining</b> experiments, based on Taguchi experimental design, emphasizes on the optimal machining parameters with minimum machining force and acceptable surface finish. Experimental results show that cutting force can be reduced with good surface finish by proper combination of machining parameters. 本研究針對國產高速加工機，以常用之 6061 鋁合金之面銑和端銑為標的，規劃並進行粗切削與精切削實驗，以探討該機器之高進切削性能以及最佳的切削參數。粗切削實驗是探討以最大材料移除率為目標之切削參數，實驗透過簡單的切削顫振實驗，可以在較低的轉速下採用較高的切削深度，其材料移除率則可提高 2. 4 倍。而精切則過過田口式實驗法來規劃實驗，實驗時同時量測其削力與表面精度，以探討最佳切削力之製程參數組合，實驗結果顯示切削深度與每刃進給是影響切削力的最大因素，透過適當的切削參數組合，可以獲得較低的切削力與較佳的表精度...|$|R
