25|$|This {{prompted}} {{an investigation}} beginning in February 2010 {{by the office}} of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. into possible improprieties. The Independence Party later questioned how Haggerty spent the money, which was to go to poll-watchers. Former New York State Senator Martin Connor contended that because the Bloomberg donations were made to an Independence Party <b>housekeeping</b> <b>account</b> rather than to an account meant for current campaigns, this was a violation of campaign finance laws. Haggerty also spent money from a separate $200,000 donation from Bloomberg on office space.|$|E

50|$|The {{orchestra}} of the Royal Swedish Opera, the Royal Swedish Orchestra, Kungliga Hovkapellet, {{dates back}} to 1526. Royal <b>housekeeping</b> <b>accounts</b> from 1526 mention twelve musicians including wind players and a timpanist but no string players. Consequently, the Royal Swedish Orchestra {{is one of the}} oldest orchestras in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|The commission's {{investigations}} included {{looking into}} the use of [...] "housekeeping accounts" [...] held by politicians, and how the funds contributed to these accounts were used. In New York, such accounts are permitted for general administrative expenses and are allowed to accept unlimited donations—but the funds {{may not be used}} for campaign expenses, including political advertising. According to the New York Times, one target for this element of the investigation was the New York Democratic Party, which is alleged to have spent as much as $4 million from <b>housekeeping</b> <b>accounts</b> on television advertising.|$|R
2500|$|Gustav I has {{subsequently}} been labelled {{the founder}} of modern Sweden, and the [...] "father of the nation". Gustav liked to compare himself to Moses, whom he believed to have also liberated his people and established a sovereign state. As a person, Gustav was known for ruthless methods and a bad temper, but also a fondness for music and had a certain sly wit and ability to outmaneuver and annihilate his opponents. He founded one of the now oldest orchestras of the world, the Kungliga Hovkapellet (Royal Court Orchestra). Royal <b>housekeeping</b> <b>accounts</b> from 1526 mention twelve musicians including wind players and a timpanist but no string players. Today the Kungliga Hovkapellet is the orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera.|$|R
50|$|Margery lies {{to shield}} {{her new husband}} when Beringar {{questions}} her. Margery establishes her power and stops Daniel's wanderings, while removing the suspicion of murder from his head. Together Daniel and Margery confess the truth of Daniel's whereabouts {{the night of the}} murder to Hugh Beringar. Secure with her husband, Margery vies with her sister-in-law Susanna for the role of housekeeper. Susanna was not allowed a dowry by her father; she is the housekeeper for her father, brother and grandmother over 15 years. Margery wins. Dame Juliana decides this while Cadfael is present, to be effective the next morning. Susanna puts her <b>housekeeping</b> <b>accounts</b> in order. Her grandmother hears her late in the evening at this task and comes out to talk with her, giving a compliment on her management of the stores of oatmeal, which Rannilt overhears. Dame Juliana suffers her fatal stroke. Her dying words to Cadfael are that she wishes she could have held her great-grandchild.|$|R
60|$|On the whole, she was displeased {{with things}} {{in general and}} {{inclined}} to regret that she had driven into the settlement, which she had done {{in a fit of}} compunction. Hitherto she had contented herself with sending the storekeeper an order for goods to be supplied, without any attempt to investigate his charges, but now, with Elcot's harvest ruined it had appeared her duty to consider carefully the subject of <b>housekeeping</b> <b>accounts.</b> She rather resented the fact that her first experiment had proved unpleasant, for she had shrunk from the sight of the slabs of half-melted pork flung down for her inspection, and having hitherto shopped only in England and eastern Canada she had found the naïve abruptness of the western storekeeper somewhat hard on her temper. Retail dealers in the prairie settlements seldom defer to their customers. If the latter do not like their goods or charges they are generally favored with a hint that they would better go somewhere else, and there is an end of the matter. It really did not look as if much encouragement was held out to those who aspired to cultivate the domestic virtues. At length the storekeeper appeared with several large packages.|$|R
40|$|The {{mother had}} {{attended}} the Zerco Business School in Hobart after leaving school and, no doubt {{because of her}} training, kept careful, detailed accounts of all minor cash payments for <b>housekeeping</b> expenses. These <b>accounts</b> were entered in octavo cash books or diaries and include details of each purchase or expense, totalled {{at the end of}} each page. Cash payments included groceries, meat, vegetables, fruit, bread, milk and also occasional minor expenses such as "shirts", "clinic", gas, cleaner, shoes, shoe repair, sweets, tram fares and later petrol, creche, nappies. There were occasional treats such as cake, pictures [movies], theatre, ices, "solo losses", tennis, and incidentals such as raffle tickets, church magazine, Sunday School magazine, chiropodist. The accounts only record small cash payments, possibly from a housekeeping allowance, and not major expenses such as house rates, rent or repairs, insurance, clothing or household furnishing, school or medical expenses. They are, however, a useful record of the cost of basic foods. - Private Deposit DX. 2...|$|R
