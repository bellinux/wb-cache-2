5|$|Before the {{ceremony}} began, King Edward VIII, present {{in his capacity}} as king of Canada, inspected the guard of honour, was introduced to the honoured guests, and spent approximately half an hour speaking with veterans in the crowd. Two Royal Air Force and two French Air Force squadrons flew over the monument and dipped their wings in salute. The ceremony itself began with prayers from chaplains representing the Church of England, the United Church of Canada, and the Roman Catholic Church. Ernest Lapointe, Canadian Minister of Justice, spoke first, followed by Edward VIII who, in both French and English, thanked France for its generosity and assured those assembled that Canada would never forget its war missing and dead. The King then pulled the Royal Union Flag from the central figure of Canada Bereft and the military band played the Last Post. The ceremony was one of the King's few official duties before he abdicated the throne. The pilgrimage continued, and most participants toured Ypres before being taken to London to be hosted by the British Legion. One-third of the pilgrims left from London for Canada on 1 August, while the majority returned to France as <b>guests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government for another week of touring before going home.|$|E
5|$|Crossing into Afghanistan, {{the group}} found fresh water in an {{irrigation}} channel by a deserted hamlet. Albeit teeming with leeches, the water saved the group from dying of thirst. Marching {{for another two}} days, they reached the vicinity of Herat, where they made contact with Afghan authorities. Unsure what reception awaited them, von Hentig sent Barkatullah, an Islamic scholar of some fame, to advise the governor that the expedition had arrived and was bearing the Kaiser's message and gifts for the Emir. The governor sent a grand welcome, with noblemen bearing cloths and gifts, a caravan of servants, and a column of hundred armed escorts. The expedition was invited into the city as <b>guests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Afghan government. With von Hentig in the lead in his Cuirassiers uniform, they entered Herat on 24 August, in a procession welcomed by Turkish troops. They were housed at the Emir's provincial palace. They were officially met by the governor {{a few days later}} when, according to British agents, von Hentig showed him the Turkish Sultan's proclamation of jihad and announced the Kaiser's promise to recognise Afghan sovereignty and provide German assistance. The Kaiser also promised to grant territory to Afghanistan as far north as Samarkand in Russian Turkestan and as far into India as Bombay.|$|E

5|$|The hotel, {{which today}} has 159 rooms, {{was founded in}} 1898 by the Swiss hotelier, César Ritz, in {{collaboration}} with the French chef, Auguste Escoffier. The new hotel was constructed behind the façade of an 18th-century town house, overlooking one of Paris's central squares. It was among the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom en suite, a telephone and electricity for each room. It quickly established a reputation for luxury, with clients including royalty, politicians, writers, film stars and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous <b>guests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel, including Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway, who lived at the hotel for years. One of the bars of the hotel, Bar Hemingway, is devoted to Hemingway. L'Espadon is a world-renowned restaurant, attracting aspiring chefs {{from all over the world}} who come to learn at the adjacent Ritz-Escoffier School. The grandest suite of the hotel, called the Suite Impériale, has been listed by the French government as a national monument in its own right.|$|E
5|$|To attract {{support from}} Kenya's Indian community, he {{made contact with}} Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the newly {{independent}} Indian republic. Nehru's response was supportive, {{sending a message to}} Kenya's Indian minority reminding them that they were the <b>guests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous African population. Relations with the white minority nevertheless remained strained; for most white Kenyans, Kenyatta was their principal enemy, an agitator with links to the Soviet Union and who had the impertinence to marry a white woman. They too increasingly called for further Kenyan autonomy from the British government, but wanted continued white-minority rule and closer links to the white-minority governments of South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia; they viewed the newly elected Labour Party government of Britain with great suspicion. The white Electors' Union had put forward a 'Kenya Plan' which proposed greater white settlement in Kenya, bringing Tanganyika into the British Empire, and incorporating it within their new British East African Dominion. In April 1950, Kenyatta was present at a joint meeting of KAU and the East African Indian National Congress in which they both expressed opposition to the Kenya Plan.|$|E
