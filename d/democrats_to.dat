5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{announced}} on 10 May 2010 {{that he would}} stand down as Labour Leader, {{with a view to}} a successor being chosen before the next Labour Party Conference in September 2010. The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> form a coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government. He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers made it impossible for <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> win.|$|E
5|$|Kilroy {{became the}} first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} the district in 42 years (since Secrest). She {{is only the second}} <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent a significant portion of Columbus since 1967. The last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent the city, Bob Shamansky, represented the neighboring 12th District from 1981 to 1983.|$|R

50|$|Davis {{was elected}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the 32nd and 33rd Congresses but was {{unsuccessful}} {{for re-election in}} 1854 to the 34th Congress. He was elected as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the 35th Congress and re-elected as an Anti-Lecompton <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the 36th Congress, {{he was not a}} candidate for renomination in 1860 to the Thirty-seventh Congress.|$|R
5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the Republican {{candidate}} for governor. Willson's opponent had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced the <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 senatorial election {{while he was still}} serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence the selection of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he assured the selection of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E
5|$|King's {{stance on}} Vietnam {{encouraged}} Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, {{with the support}} of anti-war <b>Democrats,</b> <b>to</b> attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 United States presidential election. King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal on the grounds that he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself better suited for his morally unambiguous role as an activist.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May, the True Finns {{announced}} that they would withdraw from the government formation negotiations due to the bailout issue. Soini said he would remain true to the True Finns' campaign promises and not compromise the party's core principles. After Soini's announcement, Jyrki Katainen invited the SDP, Green League, SPP and Christian <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> negotiate on forming a coalition led by the NCP. On 18 May, Katainen {{announced that}} he would invite the Left Alliance to negotiate as well, beginning on 20 May. The Left Alliance's participation had been demanded by the Social Democrats.|$|E
50|$|Clark {{was elected}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Thirty-fifth Congress and reelected as an Anti-Lecompton <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Thirty-sixth Congress (March 4, 1857 - March 3, 1861).|$|R
50|$|Clinton was {{the first}} <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> win {{re-election}} to the presidency since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the first Southern <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> win re-election since Andrew Jackson in 1832.|$|R
50|$|He {{was elected}} to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1992â€”the first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} Christian County, Missouri since 1904 and the first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent heavily Republican southwest Missouri since 1955.|$|R
5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> {{join them in}} forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E
5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Thompson assumed {{office in}} a Upstate New York district. When Thompson took office in January 2007, he, along with Diane Savino and Jeffrey Klein (both of whom later {{defected}} from the <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> form {{the core of the}} Independent Democratic Conference), assumed the chairmanship of the New York Democratic Senate Campaign Committee by assuming control of Democratic campaigns development. He retained this position through the 2008 general election.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} in 1891 as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the 52nd Congress and reelected as an Independent <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the 53rd Congress. He was an {{unsuccessful}} candidate for renomination in 1894, but was re-elected as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the 55th and 56th Congresses. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1900. He resumed business activities in Philadelphia and died in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, aged 74.|$|R
5000|$|Paul L Mangieri, first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> {{be elected}} Knox County State's Attorney {{in the history}} of Knox County; first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> be elected circuit wide circuit judge for the Ninth Judicial Circuit since Stephen A. Douglas.|$|R
50|$|Merriman {{was elected}} as an Independent (non-Tammany) <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Forty-ninth Congress and reelected as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Fiftieth Congress (March 4, 1885 - March 3, 1889). He {{was not a}} {{candidate}} for renomination in 1888.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the session, Rice {{prominently}} {{broke with}} <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> oppose the removal of capital gains tax breaks and to oppose granting unemployment benefits to locked-out workers. Rice also sponsored legislation backed by the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce to create a hybrid public-private health insurance system to cover all Colorado residents; however, these plans were put on hold after proponents of a single payer health care system advanced their competing proposal in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Willson further alienated the {{legislature}} by issuing pardons for several individuals convicted of {{complicity in the}} assassination of Governor William Goebel (1900). These included former Republican governor William S. Taylor (18991900) and Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Henry Youtsey, who was convicted for complicity in the assassination but turned state's evidence, was not pardoned, leading <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> portray the pardons of Taylor and Powers as partisan. Goebel's likeness was also removed from state checks and documents {{and was replaced by}} likenesses of either Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, or John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, he {{returned}} to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed {{that many of the}} legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. In light of this belief, he urged the <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers. This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{was elected}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses and reelected as an Independent <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Thirtieth Congress (March 4, 1843 - March 3, 1849). He served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Roads and Canals (Twenty-ninth Congress).|$|R
50|$|It statewide {{races for}} {{governor}} and the U.S. Senate, the county has slowly trended Republican. The last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> carry the county in a gubernatorial race was Tony Sanchez in 2002, while Rick Noriega in 2008 is the last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> carry it in a senatorial race.|$|R
50|$|Fourteen years later, in 1980, Shamansky {{challenged}} Devine again. This time, he {{was successful}} in unseating the long-time incumbent Devine, becoming the first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent the district since 1939. He {{was also the first}} <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent {{a significant portion of the}} state capital, Columbus, since 1967.|$|R
5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} a third party in hopes of inducing the <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.|$|E
5|$|In the 1854 elections, Lincoln {{was elected}} to the Illinois {{legislature}} but declined to take his seat. In the aftermath of the elections, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Lincoln instead sought election to the United States Senate. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting, but unable to obtain a majority, Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson.|$|E
5|$|McClellan was {{nominated}} by the <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> run against Abraham Lincoln in the 1864 U.S. presidential election. Following {{the example of}} Winfield Scott, he ran as a U.S. Army general still on active duty; he did not resign his commission until election day, November 8, 1864. McClellan supported continuation {{of the war and}} restoration of the Union (but not the abolition of slavery), but the party platform, written by Copperhead leader Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, was opposed to this position. The platform called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy. McClellan was forced to repudiate the platform, which made his campaign inconsistent and difficult. He also was not helped by the party's choice for vice president, George H. Pendleton, a peace candidate from Ohio.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Thirty-fifth Congress {{and as an}} Anti-Lecompton <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Thirty-sixth Congress, serving in Congress from March 4, 1857 to March 3, 1861, where he {{represented}} New Jersey's 3rd congressional district. He {{was chairman of the}} Engraving Committee in both congresses.|$|R
50|$|Bissell {{was elected}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Thirty-first and Thirty-second Congresses {{and as an}} Independent <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Thirty-third Congress (March 4, 1849 - March 3, 1855); he was {{chairman}} of the Committee on Military Affairs (Thirty-second and Thirty-third Congresses). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1854.|$|R
50|$|In Mississippi and Louisiana, {{there were}} no party changes (in both cases, from <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> <b>Democrat).</b> In Kentucky, there was a Democratic gain.|$|R
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
5|$|The {{coalition}} {{was successful}} in taking control of both houses of the legislature; with the Senate election to be held just over a week later, intense politicking took place. Some lawmakers went into hiding for fear they would be pressured by the other side. The coalition decided on McKisson as their candidate {{the day before the}} balloting began. Three Republican state representatives who had voted with the <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority in both the short and long term elections. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders complained to the United States Senate, which took no action against Hanna. McKisson lost a re-election bid as mayor in 1899; Hanna remained a powerful figure in the Senate until his death in 1904.|$|E
5|$|The electoral {{majority}} {{that brought the}} <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> power in 1951 combined organization Democrats with reform-minded independents. While successful in winning the election, the coalition started to fray soon after taking office. By 1954, however, Democrat James Hugh Joseph Tate and others in Council attempted to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees to be active in party politics. Dallas stood with the reform wing of the party, and the amendment effort fell {{just short of the}} two-thirds vote in Council to put the proposed charter amendment on the ballot. In doing so, Dallas worked against the wishes of Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green, Jr., siding instead with the reform-minded mayor, Joseph S. Clark, Jr.|$|E
50|$|Taylor {{was elected}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> the Sixty-third Congress.|$|R
50|$|On November 28, 2010, he {{announced}} his switch from <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> Republican.|$|R
