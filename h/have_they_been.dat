2500|$|Years later, Anthony observed, [...] "No {{advanced}} step {{taken by}} women {{has been so}} bitterly contested as that of speaking in public.

[...] After this period, Anthony focused her energy on abolitionist and women's rights activities.|$|E

2500|$|On April 7, Vatican City warned Israel {{to respect}} {{religious}} sites {{in line with}} its international obligations. Spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said that the Vatican was following events [...] "with extreme apprehension". A spokesman for Catholic monks in the Holy Land accused the Israelis of [...] "indescribable act of barbarity". The Vatican's top foreign policy expert Archbishop Jean-Louis Taura stated that while the Palestinians have joined the Vatican in bilateral agreements where they have undertaken to respect and {{maintain the status quo}} regarding Christian holy places and the rights of Christian communities, [...] "to explain the gravity of the current situation, let me begin {{with the fact that the}} occupation of the holy places by armed men is a violation of a long tradition of law that dates back to the Ottoman era. Never before <b>have</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> occupied – for such a lengthy time – by armed men." [...] Pope John Paul II urged people to pray for peace in the Middle East and described the violence as having reached [...] "unimaginable and intolerable" [...] levels. Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, said the Israeli soldiers would not [...] "defile the holiness of the site as the [...] have". He also said that the troops would remain in place until the militants inside were captured. British Foreign Office Minister, Ben Bradshaw described Israeli actions in the area as [...] "totally unacceptable".|$|E
2500|$|The first {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} the events of October 1, 1965, was that of [...] "a coup which would bring the Communists to power". It was used by the Indonesian military to blame the PKI (and, in some cases, foreign minister Subandrio) for attempting to create a puppet government that would eventually give way to PKI control. However, Anderson and McVey expressed their doubts that the PKI would consider using violence as a course of action as it [...] "would have involved pitting itself against a vastly superior military force and might have thrown the President into alliance with the army". According to Anderson and McVey, they were presented with three possible motivations if this theory were true. The first was that the PKI had received information of Sukarno's failing health and feared that the military would purge the party after his death. However, the authors believed that such a preemptive move must be guaranteed that the information was accurate. If Sukarno did not die immediately following the coup, an alliance between the President and the military would prove disastrous for the party. Secondly, it was suggested that the Communist government of the People's Republic of China had pressured the PKI to undertake the operation after coming in conflict with the PKI's peaceful methods of gaining popular support. Anderson and McVey argued that [...] "the Chinese have not been risk-takers, not <b>have</b> <b>they</b> <b>been</b> inclined to sacrifice promising relations with a non-Communist power in the interest of promoting a local revolution with dubious prospects". The final suggested motivation was that the PKI, in its Communist beliefs, was [...] "driven by an overweening ambition and a congenital need to express itself in violence", which the authors asserted as [...] "mythological" [...] rather than [...] "analytical". Anderson and McVey further disputed these proposals by reasoning that the PKI, which had built a positive image under the leadership of Dipa Nusantara Aidit, would not have gambled its position for the possibility of failure.|$|E
