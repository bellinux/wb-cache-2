5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

The newspaper then transferred the deed back over to the legitimate owners, who at that time were Empire State Land Associates.|$|E

500|$|Along {{with other}} Final Destination characters, Clear was {{conceived}} by series creator Jeffrey Reddick. Ali Larter, who {{starred in the}} 1999 film Varsity Blues, was cast as Clear Rivers. Larter stated that she was thrilled to [...] "be playing a more introverted, darker character than [...] was accustomed to at the time". She thought the script was special and turned down all other scripts where {{she would have been}} cast in roles such as a cheerleader or a victim. Larter liked the themes of both films and thought they were fascinating within their genre. According to her, the film shows <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to turn on someone and to blame someone when you're scared and about trusting your intuitions and yourself.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{critically}} acclaimed, gaining a 93.24% and 94/100 aggregate at ratings websites GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. The review in [...] declared it [...] "the best game ever made. Unputdownable and unforgettable." [...] The review by IGN opined Metal Gear Solid came [...] "closer to perfection {{than any other}} game in PlayStation's action genre" [...] and called it [...] "beautiful, engrossing, and innovative...in every conceivable category." [...] NGamer compared it to [...] "playing a big budget action blockbuster, only better." [...] GamePro called it [...] "this season's top offering [...] and one game no self-respecting gamer should be without," [...] but criticized the frame rate that [...] "occasionally stalls the eye-catching graphics". GameSpot was critical of <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the player to avoid being seen, {{as well as the}} game's short length, calling it [...] "more of a work of art than ... an actual game." [...] Metal Gear Solid received an Excellence Award for Interactive Art at the 1998 Japan Media Arts Festival.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing all the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to convince yourself you know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, {{than it would be}} to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty of room to send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E

500|$|Following Victoria Climbié's death, the {{agencies}} in the case, {{as well as the}} child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, [...] "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to [...] "a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence". Burstow said, [...] "there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, [...] "the Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen", and [...] "the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted <b>how</b> <b>easy</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, [...] "the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society we are still in denial about that hard truth".|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{title of the}} mystery (Ten Little Niggers) has long been abandoned as offensive in English-speaking countries {{and a number of}} others. Some critics have opined that Christie's {{original title}} and the setting on [...] "Nigger Island" [...] (later changed to [...] "Indian Island" [...] and [...] "Soldier Island", variously) may be integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, argues Alison Light, [...] "could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate." [...] Unlike novels such as Heart of Darkness, [...] "Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatised, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery.
