5|$|Cate Blanchett is an Australian {{actress who}} has {{extensively}} appeared in film and stage. She made her stage debut in 1992 by playing Electra in the National Institute of Dramatic Art {{production of the}} same name. She followed it with performances in Timothy Daly's Kafka Dances (1993) and the Sydney Theatre Company stage production of Oleanna (1993) opposite Geoffrey Rush. Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Critics Award for Best Newcomer for the former and Best Actress for the latter, making her {{the first person to}} win both awards at once. She went on to perform several roles on stage, notably Susan Traherne <b>in</b> <b>Plenty</b> (1999), Hedda Gabler in Hedda Gabler (2004), Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire (2009), Yelena in Uncle Vanya (2011) and Claire in The Maids (2013).|$|E

25|$|On the division's return through Richmond, {{many of its}} {{men were}} reissued {{clothing}} and supplies, such as belts, shoes, socks, and coats. Since military woolen blankets were in short supply, many men were issued sections of carpet or rug that the quartermaster had <b>in</b> <b>plenty.</b> Thus Pickett's Division, and the 19th Virginia, marched into Pennsylvania better clothed than many men in Lee's Army.|$|E

De la Cruz set a new record in serving, with 57 aces, topped the scorers with 392 points and won the Most Valuable Player award.

25|$|Samphire {{is usually}} cooked, either steamed or microwaved, and then coated in butter or olive oil. Due to its high salt content, {{it must be}} cooked without any salt added, <b>in</b> <b>plenty</b> of water. It has a hard, stringy core, and after cooking, the edible flesh is pulled off from the core. This flesh, after cooking, resembles seaweed in color, and the flavor and texture are like young spinach stems or asparagus. Samphire is often used as a {{suitably}} maritime accompaniment to fish or seafood.|$|E
25|$|Switching the attack: Using a 'square' or 'cross' pass {{across the}} whole width of the pitch to a player <b>in</b> <b>plenty</b> of space is a very {{effective}} way of both relieving pressure and building a fresh attack. The defending team {{will be required to}} adjust its positions and this usually creates spaces which can be exploited. In this example, the player numbered 1 has moved out of position, allowing more space for the opposing player. By playing the ball to the other side (the curved line represents an aerial pass), the recipient of the pass finds themselves in space which can be exploited.|$|E

Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat <b>in</b> <b>plenty</b> and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E

25|$|It {{may seem}} that the {{erstwhile}} numbers of seabirds may only ever be approached again by the wholesale eradication of the feral cats. While this has been since shown to be feasible, {{it is not clear}} whether even a severe curtailing of the cat population would be desirable. Though it previously was assumed that the small Polynesian rat is of little if any harm for seabirds, even house mice have been shown to eat seabird nestlings. Most nesting birds, in particularly Procellariiformes, are now accepted to be jeopardized by Rattus exulans. The Kiritimati's cats are meanwhile very fond of young seabirds; it even seems that their behavior has shifted accordingly, with cats being less territorial generally and congregating in numbers at active bird colonies, and generally eschewing rats when seabird chicks are <b>in</b> <b>plenty.</b>|$|E
25|$|The borrindo is {{a simple}} hollow clay ball with three to four {{fingering}} holes, one hole slightly larger than the other three, which are smaller and of equal size to one another. The holes are arranged in an isosceles triangular form. The borrindo {{is made out of}} soft alluvial clay available <b>in</b> <b>plenty</b> everywhere in the central Indus Valley. Being of the simplest design, it is made even by children. Some adults make fine borrindos of larger size, put pottery designs on them, and bake them. These baked borrindos, with pottery designs, are the later evolved forms of this musical instrument, which appears to have previously been used in its simple unbaked form for a long time. The sound notes are produced by blowing somewhat horizontally into the larger hole. Finger tips are placed on smaller holes to regulate the notes. Its ease of play makes it popular among children and the youth.|$|E
25|$|Blanchett {{has also}} had an {{extensive}} career on stage and is a four-time Helpmann Award winner for Best Female Actor in a Play. Her earlier roles include the title role in Electra at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (1992), Ophelia in Hamlet at the Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney (1994), Susan <b>in</b> <b>Plenty</b> in the West End (1999), and the title role in Hedda Gabler with the Sydney Theatre Company (2004). From 2008 to 2013, {{she and her husband}} Andrew Upton were co-CEOs and artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company. Her other roles on stage include Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire in Sydney, New York at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Washington D.C. at the Kennedy Center (2009); Yelena in Uncle Vanya in Sydney, Washington D.C. at the Kennedy Center and New York at Lincoln Center (2011); and Claire in The Maids in Sydney (2013) and New York at Lincoln Center (2014). Blanchett made her Broadway debut in 2017 with The Present, and received Tony Award, Drama Desk Award, and Drama League Award nominations for her performance in the play.|$|E

500|$|Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Aagadu a [...] "simple, oft-repeated cop vs. don story", and added, [...] "The {{difference}} {{here is the}} don is reduced to a cardboard. For a mind game to be interesting, both players need to be smart and second guess the opponent’s next move, which doesn’t happen here. If one is looking for gags, Aagadu offers them <b>in</b> <b>plenty.</b> But try an overdose of this formula {{and it could be}} tiring." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Though this film has many similarities of Srinu Vaitla’s earlier films, but it’s Mahesh Babu who has the audience’s attention throughout. Watch it for him and more rely on him".|$|E
500|$|The year 1983 saw Streep play {{her first}} non-fictional character, the nuclear {{whistleblower}} and labor union activist Karen Silkwood {{who died in}} a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols's biographical film Silkwood. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, [...] "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside." [...] Jack Kroll of Newsweek considered Streep's characterization to have been [...] "brilliant", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance Falling in Love (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama Plenty (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed [...] "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms." [...] In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep's performance <b>in</b> <b>Plenty,</b> believing it to be [...] "one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous" [...] films and [...] "most feminist" [...] role.|$|E
500|$|Even the {{truncated}} {{version was}} met with considerable controversy by UK film critics. Dilys Powell in The Sunday Times complained [...] "...17th century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England's prize torture-overseer. Peculiarly nauseating." [...] The Guardian felt the film was filled with [...] "gratuitous sadism." [...] Margaret Hinxman of The Sunday Telegraph dismissed it as a [...] "sadistic extravaganza." [...] Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. John Russell Taylor in the London Times Saturday Review said the film [...] "...is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else... There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject... Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period." [...] Films and Filming noted, [...] "Witchfinder General has no explicit 'message', but it does {{say something about the}} springs of despair and it says it forcefully. It is a very frightening film... Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price's recent performances. Witchfinder General is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one..." [...] Monthly Film Bulletin observed, [...] "Not since Peeping Tom has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one... the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death <b>in</b> <b>plenty,</b> but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress... Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins." ...|$|E
