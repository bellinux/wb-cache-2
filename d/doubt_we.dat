25|$|Gerry Evans: Gerry is {{initially}} portrayed as an intensely negative character, particularly by Kate, for having left Chris after fathering her illegitimate son, Michael. However, upon {{his first appearance}} in the play, Gerry is shown to be charming and genuinely affectionate towards Chris. His current job as a gramophone salesman (like his former job as a ballroom dancing instructor) represents his freedom, {{in sharp contrast to}} the stagnant lives of the Mundy sisters. This is made all the more obvious by the fact that he is leaving Ireland to join the International Brigade and fight in the Spanish Civil War, something that is further disapproved of by Kate. Through Michael's narration, we learn that Gerry is later left with a limp after falling off a motorbike in Barcelona. As well as having romantic feelings for Chris, Gerry seems particularly inclined towards Agnes, although the true state of their relationship remains in <b>doubt.</b> <b>We</b> learn later that he secretly has another family back in Wales, and that all his proposals of marriage to Christina have been false. Adult narrator Michael reveals that, after Gerry's death in the 1950s, he had been contacted by a half brother in South Wales, who revealed that Gerry had had a wife and several sons there at the time depicted in the drama.|$|E

[...] Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no <b>doubt,</b> <b>we</b> could probably extract yet more unique positions – there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.|$|E

Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen wrote positive comments on it, people began to watch the film and appreciate it, leading Aval Appadithan to develop a cult following. In November 2014, Haasan defended the financial failure of the film, [...] "Aval Appadithan was a guerilla attack on the industry by insiders like me. It slipped through their fingers, so to speak.

Fincher said, [...] "Even when we did our own interviews, we would talk to two people. [...] One would confirm some aspects of it and another would deny it. Plus, so much time had passed, memories are affected and the different telling of the stories would change perception. So when there was any <b>doubt</b> <b>we</b> always went with the police reports". During {{the course of their}} research, Fincher and Fischer hired Gerald McMenamin, an internationally known forensic linguistics expert and professor of linguistics at California State University Fresno, to analyze the Zodiac's letters. Unlike document examiners in the 1970s, he focused on the language of the Zodiac and how he formed his sentences in terms of word structure and spelling.|$|E

Love and Rowland would later unveil plans for an urban mix of the song with a slower, smoother sound. American rapper Nelly heard the new version in its early stages and asked if he could be featured on the remix. It was released as part of the UK Remixes EP. as well as the second U.S. remixes EP. The official press from Universal Motown Records on May 19, 2010 confirmed that [...] "Commander" [...] would serve only as the [...] "international lead single", leading to speculation another song would be released domestically.
