40|$|ABSTRACT- Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is an {{advanced}} combustion process that exhibits sensitivity to differing fuel properties. Often research conducted on HCCI uses research grade fuels to study combustion. The {{goal of this}} paper is to investigate the effects of partially refined and transportation fuels on HCCI combustion. Tested fuels include partially refined <b>gasoline</b> and <b>Jet</b> <b>B.</b> An experimental comparison of the fuels is conducted on a single cylinder test engine operating at a compression ratio of 12 : 1. Each fuel is tested in HCCI operation and compared to the same tests done with a primary reference fuel blend of comparable octane number. The resulting data is useful in characterizing the differences between the transportation grade fuels and the primary reference fuels...|$|R

40|$|Renal cell carcinoma, which {{accounts}} for 85 % of all kidney cancers, is among the ten leading malignancies in industrialized countries. To identify occupational risk factors for cancer, a multi-site case-control {{study was conducted in}} Montreal; renal cell carcinoma was one of the sites. A total of 142 cases of renal cell cancer and 2, 433 controls were interviewed in this study. Complete occupation histories were obtained, and a team of industrial hygienists and chemists estimated each subject's exposure to a list of industrial substances. Statistical analyses were carried out to estimate the association between renal cell cancer and each non-occupational and occupational variable. Among non-occupational variables collected and analysed, increased risks were observed for highest level of body mass index (BMI) and a previous history of hypertension. Negative associations were found for tea and coffee consumption. Increased risks were found in the following industries: printing related service, laundries, military, wholesale and retail trade industries. Increased risks were found in the following occupations: managers, plumbers, welders, printers, nursery workers, and aircraft mechanics. Exposure to the following substances significantly increased the risks for renal cell carcinoma: hair dust, felt dust, styrene-butadiene rubber, ozone, hydrogen sulphide, inorganic acid solution, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, <b>jet</b> fuel, aviation <b>gasoline,</b> <b>jet</b> fuel engine emissions, ink, chromium compounds, and ultraviolet radiation. The above findings were not adjusted for mutual confounding. After adjustment for known risk factors using multivariate logistic regression models, one non-occupational and several occupational risk factors were associated with renal cell carcinoma.

40|$|Due to the {{increasingly}} stricter regulations for deep reduction of fuel sulfur content, {{development of new}} deep desulfurization processes for liquid transport fuels {{has become one of}} the major challenges to the refining industry and to the production of hydrocarbon fuels for fuel cell applications. The sulfur compounds in the current transport fuels corresponding to the S level of 350 - 500 ppm account for only about 0. 12 - 0. 25 wt % of the fuel. The conventional hydrotreating approaches will need to increase catalyst bed volume at high-temperature and high-pressure conditions for treating 100 % of the whole fuel in order to convert the fuel mass of less than 0. 25 wt %. In the present study, we are exploring a novel adsorption process for desulfurization at low temperatures, which can effectively reduce the sulfur content in <b>gasoline,</b> <b>jet</b> fuel and diesel fuel at low investment and operating cost to meet the needs for ultra-clean transportation fuels and for fuel cell applications. Some adsorbents were prepared in this study for selective adsorption of sulfur compounds in the fuels. The adsorption experiments were conducted by using a model fuel and real fuels. The results show that the adsorbent (A- 1) with a transition metal compound has a significant selectivity for sulfur compounds with a saturated adsorption capacity of {approx} 0. 12 mol of sulfur compounds per mol of the metal compound. Most sulfur compounds existing in the current commercial <b>gasoline,</b> <b>jet</b> fuel and diesel fuel can be removed by the adsorption using adsorbent A- 1.

50|$|LTTD {{has proven}} very {{effective}} in reducing concentrations of petroleum products including <b>gasoline,</b> <b>jet</b> fuels, kerosene, diesel fuel, heating oils, and lubricating oils. LTTD is applicable to constituents that are volatile at temperatures up to 1,200 Â°F. Most desorbers operate at temperatures between 300 Â°F to 1,000 Â°F. Desorbers constructed of special alloys can operate at temperatures up to 1,200 Â°F. More volatile products (e.g. gasoline) can be desorbed at the lower operating range, while semivolatile products (e.g. kerosene, diesel fuel) generally need temperatures over 700 Â°F, and relatively nonvolatile products (e.g., heating oil, lubricating oils) need even higher temperatures. Essentially all soil types are amenable for treatment by LTTD systems. However, different soils may require varying degrees and types of pretreatment. For example, coarse-grained soils (e.g. gravel and cobbles) may require crushing; fine-grained soils that are excessively cohesive (e.g. clay) may require shredding.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{composition}} of the crude oil and depending on the demands of the market, refineries can produce different shares of petroleum products.

Carbon, in the form of petroleum coke, and hydrogen may also be produced as petroleum products.

The main process involves taking the oxygen molecules out of water and carbon dioxide in a biocatalytic process. The remaining carbon monoxide and hydrogen are then combined to make basic hydrocarbons using the Fischer-Tropsch process. These hydrocarbons are then transformed into a variety of fuels. In {{the early stages of the}} technology the process required pure carbon dioxide and pure water. However, updates to the technology will allow it to be placed at the output of a large emitter, such as a power plant, where many other elements and compounds are present. Their catalyst was developed in partnership with the University of Saskatchewan. If the methane is obtained from a landfill, the process would completely utilize recycled compounds. The end product would be much cleaner than natural fuels because it would not contain smog-causing air pollutants.|$|R
