5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|The wasps {{preferentially}} {{hunt for}} female cicadas {{because they have}} more consumable tissue, but male cicadas are easier to locate, which explains the systemic bias towards male kills. They chiefly hunt for Tibicen duryi, Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen parallela. Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation, which allows them to hunt for cicadas during the day, when the cicadas are most prominent. The species is mostly harmless to humans. Some males when emerging early fly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> to feed on sap, and the species {{has been known to}} feed on nectar.|$|E
5|$|An {{announcement}} was made that Brosnan and director Martin Campbell will team up once again for a film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel, Across the River and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trees,</b> in which Brosnan will {{play the role of}} the protagonist, Colonel Cantwell. However, according to Campbell, the film's production and development fell apart due to financial issues hence its delay, but as of October 2017, it is back in the pipeline for which he's hopeful to begin working on, soon. Brosnan later joined Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy in a film based on the events of The Maze Prison Escape, titled H-Block which is to be directed by Jim Sheridan.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{that their}} forces had failed, Paskevich and Pahlen decided {{to throw in}} even more forces into the fight. Elements of the 9th 'Ingermanland' Infantry Regiment and 10th 'New Ingermanland' Infantry Regiment (890 men and six guns) were ordered to attack {{the eastern side of}} the {{northern}} wing. Simultaneously seven battalions (ca. 4,000 men) were to attack the central and eastern wings from the south. About 70 pieces of artillery were ordered to fire on the second line of Polish defences to prevent Polish reinforcements from breaking through to the fort. This time several thousand Russians entered the northern wing in strict military formations. By then the garrison under Maj. Lipski had 800 men and was not strong enough to withstand the assault. Poles were again pushed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> of the far side of the northern wing, and Maj. Lipski was killed. He was replaced by Maj. Dobrogoyski, who panicked and sounded a retreat, taking with him 500 men. The remaining 300 soldiers under Maj. Świtkowski tried again to force the Russians out, but were by then outnumbered 10 to 1 and around 10:30 had to withdraw towards the central wing. The central wing, by then under the command of Lt. Col. Wodzyński, held out against a large column led by General Lüders, composed of the elite regiments of Prince Wilhelm and Prince Charles.|$|E

25|$|The Montgomery {{cocktail}} is {{a martini}} mixed at {{a ratio of}} 15 parts gin to 1 part vermouth, and popular with Ernest Hemingway at Harry's Bar in Venice. The drink was facetiously named for Montgomery's supposed refusal to go into battle unless his numerical advantage was at least fifteen to one, and it appeared in Hemingway's 1950 novel Across the River and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trees.</b> Ironically, following severe internal injuries received in the First World War, Montgomery himself could neither smoke nor drink.|$|E
25|$|It is {{remarkable}} that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since {{in many cases}} it is hundreds, {{and in a few}} instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.|$|E
25|$|Collishaw's {{next two}} {{victories}} were properly witnessed {{by thousands of}} French troops. He was ferrying a new aircraft from Wing Headquarters when six enemies dived out of the clouds and attacked him. It was six to one, and the Germans {{had the advantage of}} height. Collishaw, like Barker and McKeever, was happiest when close to the ground in such a spot. He went down. At tree-top level the advantage of numbers meant much less. In two quick bursts, he sent two Albatroses crashing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> after which the others flew off. The flight so impressed the French that they awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E

25|$|During {{a trip to}} Italy {{not long}} before writing the novel, Hemingway had met young Adriana Ivancich, with whom he became infatuated, and he used her {{as the model for}} the female {{character}} in the novel. The novel's central theme is death, and, more importantly, how death is faced. One biographer and critic sees a parallel between Hemingway's Across the River and <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trees</b> and Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. The novel is built upon successive layers of symbolism, and as in his other writing, Hemingway employs here his distinctive, spare style (the 'iceberg theory'), where the substance lies {{below the surface of the}} plot.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} both sides had {{received}} reinforcements. On the French side, {{the last two}} units of Saint-Hilaire's division, the 72nd and 105th Line Infantry Regiments deployed near Teugn. For the Austrians, General-Major Alois Liechtenstein brought up the first brigade of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Xaver Saint-Julien's division. Hohenzollern launched a frontal attack on the 57th Line. At {{the same time he}} sent half of Alois Liechtenstein's brigade through the woods to envelop the French left flank. Davout's Chief of staff General of Division Jean Dominique Compans alertly sent the 72nd Line to stop the flanking move. The French caught the Austrians just as they began to deploy from column into line and hustled them back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E

25|$|Their nests may {{be located}} in the trees or on the ground. Ground nests, {{frequently}} located near leaf litter, may be fabricated within sunken areas of the soil or beneath logs. Ground nests have both advantages and disadvantages. Floods or wet soil may force golden mice to leave their ground nests and relocate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> However, if the ground nest is undisturbed, it can lower the risk for predation for the following reasons: the nest is well hidden, a mouse on the ground is more likely to escape a predator, and less energy is required to build a nest on the ground since the mouse doesn't have to keep running up and down a tree with nesting materials.|$|E
25|$|Of all the Australian possums, the rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum {{lives in}} the most tightly knit family groups. Adults and their young will stay within 2–3 metres of each other throughout the night. The family groups are generally made up of about 4 individuals, although group sizes of 2 to 10 individuals have been reported. The possum spends most of its time sheltered within rock piles or crevices. After dark it moves from its rocky home into the nearby trees where it feeds. This possum is secretive, difficult to trap and avoids contact and confrontation as far as possible. It is primarily terrestrial, moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> only to feed. This distinguishes it from its close, mostly arboreal relatives. Its eye-shine is very bright in a spotlight but unlike most possums, it doesn't freeze when caught in a bean of light. Instead, it retreats to its rock shelter or crevices where it hides with its head in the crevice but its body exposed.|$|E
25|$|The two forces {{then began}} an {{intermittent}} fight that began at 9:00a.m. and lasted until 1:30p.m. After the initial artillery shot, Bendix's men began to scatter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> for protection. The 5th New York Infantry under Colonel Duryee charged {{the left of}} the forward Confederate position with the apparent ultimate intent of crossing the stream and turning the Confederate flank but they were quickly discouraged and turned back by heavy Confederate fire. Lieutenant Greble came up the road to place his three guns where he and his small detachment of regulars from the 2nd U.S. Artillery Regiment could return fire, which he did resolutely but with little effect. Peirce then positioned the 5th New York (Duryee), 7th New York (Bendix) and the Massachusetts and Vermont companies (Washburn) {{to the right of the}} Hampton Road and the 3rd New York (Townsend) and 1st New York (Allen) to {{the left of the}} road. He would launch piecemeal attacks from these positions. Greble continued to fire at the Confederate positions while Peirce arranged his force and gave them some time to rest.|$|E
