Founded in 1819, {{it is the}} oldest housewares company in the United States. The company manufactures several historically significant products including the Original Popcorn Popper, Classic Tin Cup, and All-American <b>Flour</b> <b>Sifter.</b> [...] The Original Popcorn Popper {{is one of the}} company’s oldest and best-selling items, and has been made with the original equipment and dies since the late 1800s, when the company acquired the patent from William Wood, its inventor. They were originally sold at a wholesale price of $3.50 for a gross. The All-American <b>Flour</b> <b>Sifter</b> was patented in 1930 by a descendent of Jacob Bromwell's, Thomas G. Melish.|$|E
50|$|A pattern maker, Isaac Straub, {{began working}} on the company that {{is now known as}} ROTEX in 1837 when he had an idea for an {{improved}} grist mill. While working on his idea part-time, he applied for and received a patent for his new grist mill, The Queen of the South. In 1844, Straub created the Straub Mill Company to create the mills, mill supplies, bolting machines, and reels (<b>flour</b> <b>sifter).</b> Sales at this time ranged from Ohio to New Orleans.|$|E
40|$|Dusk was {{enveloping}} {{the city}} {{when the first}} tiny flakes began to fall. I remember looking through my bedroom window and noticing that the naked redbud outside was clothed in a powdery robe of snow that lent it a fragile and ghostly air. Since first snowfalls had always interested me, I curled up in an easy chair and viewed the frosty process from the warmth of my room. Outside, the atmosphere was brittle and clear. The bitter wind of the day had retired for the night, and the snow sifted through the trees in an unbroken pattern, {{as if it had}} been poured from a giant <b>flour</b> <b>sifter</b> in the sky. Serenity was everywhere. No sounds penetrated the still air. The lights in the houses seemed to wink at me and tell me that they were warm and comfortable, too, far away from the cold black and white night. Gradually the rough stones in the driveways became blanketed in soft white, and baby drifts were born in the corners of the 2 ̆ 7 neighbors 2 ̆ 7 house, a house whose lines were becoming indistinct as the flurries increased in speed and intensity. Soon the wind, having become tired of resting, entered in a flurry of snow and leaves and knocked on my window. Then it turned and brushed past the redbud, leaving it bare and shivering again...|$|E

Behind, a row of shops offer their respective goods on the sidewalk. On {{the left side of}} the picture, a grocer in local urban clothes is looking at the photographer, leaning against the timber partition of his shop in a relaxed manner, next to his fruit and vegetables. On the other side of the partition, in the picture’s centre, metal pots, plates and ibriks are set out on a board. In the upper left corner is a sign for Mustafa Nedopek’s workshop, with a pile of <b>flour</b> <b>sifters</b> on display. In front is the blurred silhouette of a barefoot girl or small woman in dimije and mahrama rushing uphill. Analogue photographic process, negative-positive (Agfa Isopan 17 DIN). Original preserved as a positive on silver bromine paper, stored as a print and a digital record...|$|R
40|$|SUBTEXT is a {{collection}} of photographic works by Bridgette McKelvey that reflect the MILL’s heritage as a canvas for contemporary art. This work was exhibited at: Our Voice, Our History, Our Community, Our Mill: Albion Flour Mill Exhibition in 2008. Framed in the MILL’s restored industrial <b>flour</b> <b>sifters,</b> SUBTEXT features the vibrant graffiti gestures of anonymous underground artists created during the MILL’s transition – the space between industry and FKP’s urban renewal redevelopment. The images are sourced from the MILL’s interior and exterior levels, and evoke speculation into the moments of their creation. Graffiti as an engaging and valuable art commodity is evident through the chic popularity of Banksy, world-renowned British graffiti artist whose works sell for over 50, 000 GBP, with purchasers facing the issue of how to remove street walls so as to take their art home! The MILL’s novel sifting frames were originally used {{in the final stages of}} flour processing and are a rare example of depression era industry in Brisbane. As the historical edifices of the MILL are restored, SUBTEXT aspires to document the in-between art, least these anonymous works be lost. ...|$|R

40|$|Baker’s {{cabinets}} {{became popular}} in the late 19 th century. The free-standing cabinet included a table with drawers and an upper section with shelves for storage. The Hoosier cabinet took this design a step further, with increased storage and built-in efficiencies such as <b>flour</b> bins, mechanical <b>sifters,</b> and spice jars. The cabinets included several compartments to store all the various utensils, dishes, and staple items a cook would need – making them all conveniently located within reach.
