5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis prefers lowland {{habitats}} (in Switzerland {{it occurs}} up to 275 m a.s.l.) and calcium-rich waters. This small snail inhabits {{the central and}} lower parts of rivers (up to 13 m deep), including in brackish water in tidal rivers of estuaries. It sometimes lives <b>in</b> <b>lakes</b> on unvegetated bottoms. Rarely, it lives in springs (rheocrenes), in ground water, and in caves. For example, in the Åland Islands, Theodoxus fluviatilis was found living <b>in</b> <b>lakes</b> with a pH of 7.8–8.9. In streams and rivers in Ireland, the species lived in water with a pH of 7.0–8.4.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} at Mentolat has been ongoing since the Pleistocene, with the earliest explosive eruptions occurring over 17,340 years ago.

5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone <b>in</b> <b>lakes.</b> The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea or up to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E

40|$|Growth is the {{ultimate}} response of an organism to its environment. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare growth of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie and Lake Ontario, from 1954 to 2003. Trends <b>in</b> <b>lake</b> whitefish abundance were similar <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie and Lake Ontario from the 1950 s until 1990, when abundance began to decline <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Ontario while remaining relatively stable <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie. Although both lakes have undergone similar environmental changes, from decreasing phosphorous loading to invasion by dreissenid mussels, declining growth and condition were more pronounced <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Ontario. Trends <b>in</b> abundance, growth, and condition of lake whitefish from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario were compared for the period 1990 to 2003. <b>In</b> 2003, <b>lake</b> whitefish were collected from both lakes to describe seasonal diet, energy density, and female GSI. Growth, described as length-at-age, declined significantly <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Ontario but did not change <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie. Lake whitefish energy density (J/g wet mass) was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie than <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Ontario. Biological attributes of lake whitefish from Lake Erie did not change greatly from 1990 to 2003 while fish from Lake Ontario exhibited signs of stress, including decreased size-at-age and condition.

5|$|As bronze working {{developed}} from about 2000 BCE, {{there was a}} decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at Jarlshof and Sumburgh on Shetland. At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.

5|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{techniques for}} growing bacteria use {{high levels of}} nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur <b>in</b> <b>lakes</b> during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy).|$|E
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live <b>in</b> <b>lakes,</b> {{but they are}} among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E

The tunjos were mostly elaborated using tumbaga; an alloy of gold, copper and silver, some with traces of lead or iron. The majority of ceramic or stone tunjos has been described from Mongua, close to Sogamoso. The tunjos served three purposes; as decoration of temples and shrines, for offering rituals in the sacred lakes and rivers in the Muisca religion, and as pieces in funerary practices; to accompany the dead to the afterlife. Ceramic human Tunjos were kept in the houses (bohíos) of the Muisca, together with emeralds.|$|E

Investigations were conducted <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Großer Vätersee, Germany (clear water, mesotrophic, submerged macrophytes present) and <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Vallum, Denmark (turbid, eutrophic, no submerged macrophytes). Fish were sampled regularly by electrofishing. We focused our study on diet patterns. The availability of macrozoobenthos was higher <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Vallum (3, 500 ind. m- 2) than <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Großer Vätersee (1, 500 ind. m- 2), which was due to a high density of insect larvae <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Vallum (2, 700 ind. m- 2) compared to Lake Großer Vätersee (680 ind. m- 2). Both, the abundance of eels and small prey fish (40 - 99 mm TL) were higher <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Vallum. Despite the latter, fish was unimportant as prey for eels <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Vallum which instead fed on macroinvertebrates and in particular chironomid larvae. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Großer Vätersee where availability of insect larvae was low eels used fish as the main food component. Based on these results as well as similar observations for smaller eels, we suggest that piscivory among eels to a wide extent is generally controlled by the availability of insect larvae. Stable isotope analyses confirmed the dietary results. The estimated mean trophic positions of eels <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Großer Vätersee (3. 74 ± 0. 2) was one level higher than those of eels <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Vallum (2. 71 ± 0. 2).

5|$|Groups of {{settlers}} {{began building}} {{the first known}} permanent houses on what is now Scottish soil around 9500 years ago, and the first villages around 6000 years ago. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the}} oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this period and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age we have evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial island, usually <b>in</b> <b>lakes,</b> rivers and estuarine waters. The peoples of early Iron Age Scotland, particularly in the north and west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 BC to AD 300 with the most imposing structures having been created circa 200–100 BC. In the south and east larger earthwork hill forts survive. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line.

40|$|Although {{parental care}} {{increases}} offspring survival, providing care is costly, reducing parental {{growth and survival}} and, thereby, compromising future reproductive success. To determine if an exotic benthic predator might be affecting parental care by nest-guarding smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), we compared nest-guarding behavior and energy expenditures in two systems, one with a hyperabundant recently introduced predator, the round goby (Neogobious melanostomus). <b>In</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie, USA, smallmouth bass vigorously defended their nests from benthic round gobies. <b>In</b> <b>Lake</b> Opeongo, Canada, smallmouth bass were exposed to fewer and predominantly open-water predators and were less active in their nest defense. From scuba and video observations, we documented that nest-guarding smallmouth bass chased predators (99 % of which were round gobies) nine times more frequently <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie than <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Opeongo. This heightened activity resulted in a significant decline in weight and energetic content of guarding males <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie but no change <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Opeongo males. Bioenergetic simulations revealed that parental care increased smallmouth bass standard metabolic rate by 210 % <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie but only by 28 % <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Opeongo. As energy reserves declined and offspring became increasingly independent, males <b>in</b> both <b>lakes</b> consumed more prey and spent more time foraging away from their nests; however, nest-guarding smallmouth bass consumed few prey and, <b>in</b> <b>Lake</b> Erie, rarely consumed round gobies. Therefore, increased parental care costs owing {{to the presence of}} round gobies could affect future growth, reproduction, and survival if smallmouth bass approach critically low energy reserves.
