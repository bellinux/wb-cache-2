5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on <b>depressurisation.</b> DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other <b>depressurisation</b> events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the <b>depressurisation</b> of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive <b>depressurisation</b> in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the <b>depressurisation</b> of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grand Slam commences, and {{it turns}} out that Leiter has indeed found and acted on Bond's message. A battle commences, but Goldfinger escapes. Tilly, a lesbian, hopes that one of the gang leaders, Pussy Galore (leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her, but she is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the mafia bosses all escape in the melee. Bond is drugged before his flight back to England and wakes to find he has been {{captured}} by Goldfinger, who has managed to hijack a BOAC jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a <b>depressurisation</b> that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership.|$|E
25|$|Three {{factors are}} thought to be involved: Voluntary {{suppression}} of breathing and rapid <b>depressurisation</b> are necessarily present, and self-induced hypocapnia by hyperventilation is known to be present in many cases. <b>Depressurisation</b> on ascent is an explanation for the shallow depth of ascent blackouts but does not fully explain all cases unless accompanied by an underlying suppression of the urge to breathe through self-induced hypocapnia via hyperventilation.|$|E
25|$|Freediving {{blackout}} {{can occur}} on any dive profile: at constant depth, on an ascent from depth, {{or at the}} surface following ascent from depth and may be described {{by a number of}} terms depending on the dive profile and depth at which consciousness is lost. Blackout during a shallow dive differs from blackout during ascent from a deep dive in that deep water blackout is precipitated by <b>depressurisation</b> on ascent from depth while shallow water blackout is a consequence of hypocapnia following hyperventilation.|$|E
25|$|In {{this article}} {{constant}} pressure blackout and shallow water blackout refers to blackouts {{in shallow water}} following hyperventilation and ascent blackout and deep water blackout refers to blackout on ascent from depth. Some free divers consider blackout on ascent to be a special condition or subset of shallow water blackout but the primary underlying mechanisms differ. This confusion is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} in the case of blackout on ascent, hyperventilation induced hypocapnia also may be a contributory factor even if <b>depressurisation</b> on ascent is the actual precipitator.|$|E
25|$|Lungs: There {{is a risk}} pneumothorax, {{arterial}} gas embolism, and mediastinal and subcutanous emphysemas during ascent, {{which are}} commonly called burst lung or lung overpressure injury by divers. To equalise the lungs, all that is necessary is not to hold the breath during ascent. This risk does not occur when breath-hold diving from the surface, unless the diver breathes from an ambient pressure gas source underwater; breath-hold divers do suffer squeezed lungs on descent, crushing in the chest cavity, but, while uncomfortable, this rarely causes lung injury and returns to normal at the surface. Some people have pathologies of the lung which prevent rapid flow of excess air through the passages, {{which can lead to}} lung barotrauma even if the breath is not held during rapid <b>depressurisation.</b> These people should not dive as the risk is unacceptably high. Most commercial or military diving medical examinations will look specifically for signs of this pathology.|$|E
500|$|<b>Depressurisation</b> causes inert gases, {{which were}} {{dissolved}} under higher pressure, {{to come out}} of physical solution and form gas bubbles within the body. These bubbles produce the symptoms of decompression sickness. Bubbles may form whenever the body experiences a reduction in pressure, but not all bubbles result in DCS. [...] The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is described by Henry's Law, which indicates that when the pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid is decreased, the amount of that gas dissolved in the liquid will also decrease proportionately.|$|E
500|$|French {{physiologist}} Paul Bert was {{the first}} to understand it as DCS. His work, La Pression barométrique (1878), was a comprehensive investigation into the physiological effects of air pressure, both above and below the normal. He determined that inhaling pressurised air caused nitrogen to dissolve into the bloodstream; rapid <b>depressurisation</b> would then release the nitrogen into its gaseous state, forming bubbles that could block the blood circulation and potentially cause paralysis or death. Central nervous system oxygen toxicity was also first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Paul Bert effect".|$|E
500|$|A sudden {{reduction}} in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew. Above , a sudden cabin <b>depressurisation</b> would leave a [...] "time of useful consciousness" [...] up to 10–15 seconds for a conditioned athlete. At Concorde's altitude, the air density is very low; {{a breach of}} cabin integrity {{would result in a}} loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss {{in the event of a}} breach, a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde's higher operating altitude, concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent. Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.|$|E
500|$|Linenger was {{succeeded by}} Anglo-American {{astronaut}} Michael Foale, carried up by Atlantis on STS-84, alongside Russian mission specialist Elena Kondakova. Foale's increment proceeded fairly normally until 25 June when {{during the second}} test of the Progress manual docking system, TORU, Progress M-34 collided with solar arrays on the Spektr module and crashed into the module's outer shell, puncturing the module and causing <b>depressurisation</b> on the station. Only quick actions {{on the part of}} the crew, cutting cables leading to the module and closing Spektr's hatch, prevented the crews having to abandon the station in Soyuz TM-25. Their efforts stabilised the station's air pressure, whilst the pressure in Spektr, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum. In an effort to restore some of the power and systems lost following the isolation of Spektr and to attempt to locate the leak, EO-24 commander Anatoly Solovyev and flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov carried out a risky salvage operation later in the flight, entering the empty module during a so-called [...] "intra-vehicular activity" [...] or [...] "IVA" [...] spacewalk and inspecting the condition of hardware and running cables through a special hatch from Spektr's systems to the rest of the station. Following these first investigations, Foale and Solovyev conducted a 6-hour EVA outside Spektr to inspect the damage.|$|E

[...] "During an explosive or rapid <b>depressurisation</b> of a pressurised aircraft, however, the noise, pressure changes, temperature changes and draughts within the cabin would have alerted the occupants that a substantial failure had occurred," [...] the report added.

2500|$|Rapid <b>depressurisation.</b> [...] Because ascent {{blackout}} {{occurs as}} the diver approaches the surface {{from a deep}} dive, <b>depressurisation</b> is clearly present. Consciousness depends on a minimum partial pressure of oxygen in the brain not on the absolute quantity of the gas in the system. At the surface, {{the air in the}} lungs is under 1 atmosphere of pressure; at 10 metres, the water pressure doubles the pressure of air in the lungs to 2 atmospheres. [...] Recreational breath-hold dives can often go below 20 metres, competitive divers can go much deeper, and the [...] "No limits"free-dive record exceeds 200 metres since 2007. Ten metres is easily achievable by a reasonably fit and competent swimmer. Most people lose consciousness when the partial pressure of oxygen in their lungs, normally [...] falls below about [...] A ppO2 of [...] at ten metres will be tolerable to the diver while at that depth, but is likely to result in a blackout between four metres and the surface when the ambient pressure reduction brings the partial pressure of oxygen below the limit. [...] S.Miles termed this latent hypoxia. [...] Although quite comfortable at the bottom the diver may actually be trapped by latent hypoxia, and unaware that it is now no longer possible to ascend safely, but is likely to black out without warning just as he or she approaches the surface.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scuba diving}} {{curricula}} may apply the terms shallow-water blackout and deep-water blackout differently; deep-water blackout being {{applied to the}} final stage of nitrogen narcosis while shallow water blackout may be applied to a blackout from a deep free dive. [...] Nitrogen narcosis does not normally apply to freediving as free-divers start and finish the dive with only a single lungful of air and it has long been assumed that free divers are not exposed to the necessary pressure for long enough to absorb sufficient nitrogen. [...] Where these terms are used in this manner there is usually little or no discussion of the phenomenon of blackouts not involving <b>depressurisation</b> and the cause may be variously attributed to either <b>depressurisation</b> or hypocapnia or both. This problem may stem from the origin of the term latent hypoxia {{in the context of a}} string of fatal, shallow water accidents with early military, closed-circuit rebreather apparatus prior to the development of effective oxygen partial pressure measurement. In the very different context of dynamic apnea sports careful consideration of terms is needed to avoid potentially dangerous confusion between two phenomena that actually have different characteristics, mechanisms and prevention measures. The application of the term shallow water blackout to deep dives and its subsequent association with extreme sports has tended to mislead many practitioners of static apnea and dynamic apnea distance diving into thinking that it does not apply to them even though isobaric shallow water blackout kills swimmers every year, often in shallow swimming pools.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Ghost Flight, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued a Discussion Paper and a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), both proposing aural warning in the Beechcraft Super King Air and other pressurised aircraft. The outcome of consultation on the NPRM was that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority did not mandate aural warning of inadequate cabin pressure and this angered the families of some of the victims. [...] Instead, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued a notice to owners of pressurised aircraft registered in Australia recommending installation of an aural warning, but not making it mandatory. The notice said, [...] "The benefit to your pilots and passengers lies in the reduction in risk of an uncommanded <b>depressurisation</b> leading to an incident or fatal accident. The benefit is much greater than the cost of purchase and installation of one of these low-cost systems." ...|$|E
