50|$|<b>Heat-setting</b> of {{synthetic}} fabrics eliminates the internal tensions within the fiber, generated during manufacturing, {{and the new}} state can be fixed by rapid cooling. This heat setting fixes the fabrics in the relaxed state, and thus avoids subsequent shrinkage or creasing of the fabric. Presetting of goods {{makes it possible to}} use higher temperature for setting without considering the sublimation properties of dyes and also has a favorable effect on dyeing behavior and the running properties of the fabric. On the other hand, post-setting can be combined with some other operations such as Thermasol dyeing or optical brightening of polyester. Post-setting as a final finish is useful to achieve high dimensional stability, along with desired handle. <b>Heat-setting</b> is an important part in textile finishing.|$|E
50|$|Orientation on a {{commercial}} scale can be achieved using either of two processes: a tenterframe or a bubble process. Tenterframe technology is used to produce a variety of “heat-set” products, with biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) being the most common (<b>heat-setting</b> is a process whereby a film is reheated in a constrained state such that the shrink properties are destroyed).|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic fibers {{are made}} from {{synthesized}} polymers of small molecules. The compounds {{that are used to}} make these fibers come from raw materials such as petroleum based chemicals or petrochemicals. These materials are polymerized into a long, linear chemical that bond two adjacent carbon atoms. Differing chemical compounds will be used to produce different types of synthetic fibers. Synthetic fibers account for about half of all fiber usage, with applications in every field of fiber and textile technology. Although many classes of fiber based on synthetic polymers have been evaluated as potentially valuable commercial products, four of them - nylon, polyester, acrylic and polyolefin - dominate the market. These four account for approximately 98 percent by volume of synthetic fiber production, with polyester alone accounting for around 60 per cent. There are several methods of manufacturing synthetic fibers but the most common is the Melt-Spinning Process. It involves heating the fiber until it begins to melt, then you must draw out the melt with tweezers as quickly as possible. The next step would be to draw the molecules by aligning them in a parallel arrangement. This brings the fibers closer together and allows them to crystallize and orient. Lastly, is <b>Heat-Setting.</b> This utilizes heat to permeate the shape/dimensions of the fabrics made from heat-sensitive fibers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Heat-setting</b> of {{synthetic}} fabrics is an industrial stabilization {{process that has}} been adapted by designers to create dimensional textures through shaped-resists and non-industrial <b>heat-setting</b> methods. The article overviews <b>heat-setting</b> properties, physical resist techniques, and presents an experiment to determine best practices for <b>heat-setting</b> physically resisted polyester fabric. Two polyester fabrics, organza and lining, were gathered and secured to a wooden dowel and heat-set under four heating conditions: steaming in a pressure cooker, boiling in a pot of water, dry heat in a conventional oven, and radiation waves in a microwave oven. Pre- and post-treatment lengths were analyzed using GLM for two-way ANOVA and post hoc tests. Based on results from the statistical analysis and visual evaluation, steaming in a pressure cooker is recommended for sheer fabrics such as organza and dry heat from a conventional oven for lining weight fabrics...|$|E
40|$|Effects of cold-drawing and <b>heat-setting</b> on {{some aspects}} of {{mechanical}} properties and structural parameters of polypropylene filaments spun at 3500 mlmin are examined. Similar to the yam produced at low speeds, drawing changes the structure and properties of the filaments. <b>Heat-setting</b> increases the compactness and uniformity of micro-fibrilar structure of the filaments. Crystalline fraction {{as determined by the}} change in density and molecular orientation as measured by birefringence increase with the increase in draw ratio. True strength does not change considerably, but nominal strength increases and the breaking-extension decreases with draw ratio and <b>heat-setting</b> treatment. The temperature of the onset of melting as indicated by DSC examination does not effect considerably by drawing and <b>heat-setting.</b> The increase of crystalline fraction as measured by density is not in accordance with the results of the crystalline fraction measurement by X-ray diffraction. The trend in increase of crystallinity determined by DSC agrees with the increase of crystalline fraction determined by density...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The ultra-fine denier PET full drawing yarn (PET-FDY) with {{monofilament}} {{linear density}} equal to 0. 38 dTex was produced. During the practical process of ultrafine denier PET-FDY, the yarn should be heat-set at certain temperature following the drawing process {{in order to}} improve the mechanical properties and reduce the boiling water shrinkage. The influence of <b>heat-setting</b> temperature on the structure and performance of ultra-fine denier PET FDY was studied in this paper. With <b>heat-setting</b> temperature increasing, crystalline in PET FDY became perfect and crystallite size became bigger. According to the density method, crystallinity was augmented. Crystal orientation factor and overall orientation factor were both increased. The tenacity and tensile stress at 10 % strain of PET FDY were increased and the breakage percentage and boiling water shrinkage were reduced with the <b>heat-setting</b> temperature increasing...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The relatively low deformation temperature of biaxially oriented PET excludes its use in many hot fill applications or hot washing {{as part of a}} reuse cycle, due to the shrinkage which generally occurs on reheating towards Tg. Isothermal, isometric annealing processes (referred to as <b>heat-setting)</b> can cause oriented PET to maintain its dimensional stability to higher temperatures. However, to experiment on a commercial stretch blow moulding machine is a very costly and time consuming process, justifying the requirement for an accurate simulation technique. The objective of this project was, therefore, to simulate the stretch blow moulding of PET with a <b>heat-setting</b> phase, by biaxially drawing PET sheets on a TM Long Stretcher, then to heat-set them in a separate phase using a purpose designed jig. A <b>heat-setting</b> rig was designed and constructed at IPTME. Due {{to the size of the}} proposed investigation window, a factorial experimental design (FED) technique was employed to characterise the behaviour of two commercial bottle grades of PET (B 90 N and B 95 A Laser) under a variety of draws and <b>heat-setting</b> conditions. These sheets were then characterised in terms of shrinkage, tensile properties and resistance to creep. This data was regressed to generate predictive model equations for both grades of material and in both major and minor draw axes. Using these equations, it is now possible to define a set of processing parameters which would give a bottle with lower and more uniform shrinkage (less draw dependent) with enhanced creep properties and at least comparable mechanical properties. To develop a more fundamental understanding of the process of <b>heat-setting</b> in biaxially drawn PET, as well as to prove the validity of the model equations, a separate series of conventional experiments was devised to investigate the two most significant predictor variables from the FED analysis; biaxial draw ratio and <b>heat-setting</b> temperature (for Laser only). This material was characterised by TMA, DSC and birefringence measurements. The DSC and birefringence measurements allow the effect of <b>heat-setting</b> and draw on crystallinity levels and orientation to be monitored. Orientation of both phases was studied in heat-set bottles using micro polarised FTIR...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} <b>heat-setting</b> treatment on tubular polydioxanone stents {{which can be used}} as intestinal implants. Two PDO monofilaments with linear densities of 100 ± 2 and 150 ± 2 tex respectively were used for producing a set of weft-knitted tubular stents using a small-diameter, circular weft knitting machine. The <b>heat-setting</b> treatment was used for the stents to restore a tubular shape. The physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the stents were examined before and after the <b>heat-setting</b> treatment. The results of mechanical testing illustrated that the prototype stents in this work could achieve higher radial forces than Wall stents and Z stents on the market. The heat setting with temperature of 80 ℃ and time of 5 min were found to be more appropriate for the stents. In conclusion, the stents were successfully developed and have potential application for the treatment of intestinal stenosis or obstruction. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the influence of the yarn processing on the migration of additives molecules, especially insecticide, within polyethylene (PE) yarns. Yarns were manufactured in the laboratory focusing on three key-steps (spinning, post-stretching and <b>heat-setting).</b> Influence of each step on yarn properties was investigated using tensile tests, differential scanning calorimetry and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The post-stretching step was proved to be critical in defining yarn mechanical and structural properties. Although a first orientation of polyethylene crystals was induced during spinning, the optimal orientation was only reached by post-stretching. The results also showed that the <b>heat-setting</b> did not significantly change these properties. The presence of additives crystals at the yarn surface was evidenced by scanning-electron microscopy. These studies performed at each yarn production step allowed a detailed analysis of the additives’ ability to migrate. It is concluded that while post-stretching decreased the migration rate, <b>heat-setting</b> seems to boost this migration...|$|E
40|$|Textile dyeing and {{finishing}} industry uses dryers/tenters for drying and <b>heat-setting</b> fabrics. A very large {{fraction of the}} heating value of the fuel consumed in the burner ends up as waste in the dryer exhaust. An initial calculation showed that up to 90 % of the energy consumed in the tenter is wasted. Therefore, quantifying the energy waste and determining drying characteristics are vitally important to optimizing the tenter and dryer operations. This research developed a portable off-line gas chromatography-based characterization system to assess the excess energy consumption. For low-demanding <b>heat-setting</b> situations, energy savings can be realized quickly. On the other hand, there are demanding situations where fabric drying represents the production bottleneck. The drying rate may be governed either by {{the rate of heat}} transport or by the rate of moisture transport. A mathematical model is being developed that incorporates both these processes. The model parameters are being obtained from bench-scale dryer studies in the laboratories. The model will be validated using production scale data. This will enable one to predict optimization dryer operation strategies. M. S. Committee Chair: Dr. Pradeep Agrawal; Committee Member: Dr. Larry Forney; Committee Member: Dr. Wallace Car...|$|E
40|$|The textile {{industry}} applies numerous <b>heat-setting</b> solutions to improve properties of textile materials. To obtain a crimped effect, these techniques {{take advantage of}} the thermoplastic properties of the material. The industrial partner required an energy efficient process which produces geometrically determined crimping effects. During the experimental phase it was possible to achieve a very short heat treatment time on moving filaments. A laser beam, rapidly moved along a predetermined path, a fast temperature measurement and a rapid control of laser power enabled the short time heat treatment phase. Filament forming and heat treatment were simultaniously carried out at 8 filaments and at a speed of up to 60 m/min. Within the investigations it was possible to show that specific textile p hysical values like shrinkage, crimp and tensile strength can reproducibly be affected. The objective {{of this study was to}} perform a <b>heat-setting</b> process with a newly developed treatment system, wh ich allows creating geometrically determined crimping effects on filaments within a continous process. The technology works with different filament cross sections and types of materials, such as polyethylene, polyurethane and polypropylene.

40|$|During <b>heat-setting</b> of {{textiles}} in stenting frames the emission of vaporable substances from fibre accompanying agents {{and parts of}} the liquor composition can occur. Organic emissions have been detected by a flame-ionisation-detector (FID) and by the adsorption of the substances on silicagel (Coulometrie). An indication to the composition of the emissions can be derived from non-constant proportionalities of the results from FID and Coulometrie. During the project not only the emissions of stenter-frame processes were detected, but also from drying-, thermosol- and singeing machine processes. Vaporable substances on textiles can in principle be detected by head-space-gaschromatographie or thermogravimetry. But it is impossible to give a forecast on the effective emissions from this knowledge.

40|$|Suwari (set) and kamaboko (set and cooked) gels {{made with}} sardine surimi were {{prepared}} at normal <b>heat-setting</b> (35 or 40 °C) and modori (60 °C) temperatures and treated with solutions breaking ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges. The lower gel {{strength of the}} gels obtained at modori temperature corresponded to a higher solubility of these gels in solutions breaking hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bridges. For suwari gels set at 35 and 40 °C more protein was solubilized when electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds were ruptured. SDS-PAGE showed a higher amount of actin in these two fractions. No myosin heavy chain (MHC) bands were observed {{in any of the}} fractions obtained from suwari gels heat-set at 35 and 40 °C. However, MHC bands were visible when disulfide bridges were disrupted in gels set at 60 °C and in kamaboko gels set at 35 °C.

40|$|Currently, most {{district}} heating networks are {{running in a}} <b>heat-setting</b> mode, limiting the adjustment of the electrical power of {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) units. By considering the electrical power system (EPS) and {{district heating}} system (DHS) together, the peak regulatory capability of CHP units can be improved and renewable energy accommodation can be promoted. In this paper, a tractable integrated heat and electricity dispatch (IHED) model is described that addresses the thermal dynamic characteristics of pipelines and buildings to increase flexibility. To deal with the complexity of the optimization model, a water mass method (WMM) for pipeline thermal dynamics is proposed. Benefiting from the WMM, the proposed IHED model is an ordinary, non-linear model. An iterative algorithm based on the generalized Benders decomposition, and a sequential approach combined with the iterative algorithm and IPOPT, are proposed to solve the IHED model. Compared with a steady state model without thermal dynamics, considering the thermal dynamic characteristics in the DHS can further expand the peak regulatory capabilities of CHP units. The WMM is tested in the thermal dynamic simulations compared to an existing node method and a commercial simulation software. And the proposed solution strategy is verified in a small-scale system and a practical system. The simulation results of case studies are discussed to demonstrate the feasibility and economy of the dispatch model proposed here...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Enzymatic hydrolysis of fish waste has been examined using proteolytic enzymes under different conditions of pH, enzyme to substrate ratio, and substrate concentration. Proteolytic enzymes have then been used to synthesise a protein-like product (plastein). The particular enzymes used in both parts {{of this study were}} bromelein, a-chymotrypsin, pepsin and papain. Reasonable yield was obtained. The yield of plastein was found as a function of substrate concentration. enzyme to substrate ratio, degree of hydrolysis and enzyme used. Generally, the plastein appeared to be odourless, yellowish to creamy in colour. tasteless and rich nutritionally. The insoluble plastein formed was washed, dried and then tested for its functional properties, particularly with respect to water absorption capacity, swelling capacity, oil absorption capacity. foam and foam stability, emulsion stability, gelatination, viscosity, and <b>heat-setting</b> properties. The functional properties of the plastein precursor (fw*hydrolysate) and of commercial proteins have also been examined. The dried plastein which was tested under different conditions was found not only to possess functional properties such as fat/water absorption, swelling and emulsion stability. but also excellent foaming properties were observed. Although plastein appeared to be gel-like before drying, it was, however. not able to retain its gelatinity after drying. Therefore, {{it would be possible to}} use it in a food system as an alternative to the material substituted without changing the texture (e. g. in cereal products). The viscosity of the plastein was varied under the conditions used. It was found to be mainly a function of the temperature and the concentration. Finally. it was noted that plastein shows heatsetting properties when prepared under certain conditions...|$|E
40|$|Bra cup {{moulding}} {{is currently}} a remarkable process {{in the production of}} seamless intimate apparel. The process is highly complex, time-consuming and error-prone due to the large variations of foam and lamination properties, cup styles and sizes, and geometric features of graduated padding. In particular, the three-dimensional (3 D) geometric shape of foam cups is difficult to assess accurately because they are very soft and readily deform. In cases that involve fitting problems, shape modifications of the mould head and determination of the optimal moulding conditions have undergone repeated trials and errors. There is limited knowledge about the effects of foam properties and cup parameters in the controlling of moulding conditions. This study adopts a parameterization-based remesh algorithm method to evaluate the 3 D shapes of the convex surface of scanned cup samples. The shape conformity of the cup is quantified in accordance to the corresponding mould head. In this respect, the moulding conditions that would achieve the most desirable geometric shapes of bra cups can be accurately and objectively demonstrated. Based on moulding experiments with 6 types of polyurethane (PU) foam materials, empirical equations that associate the cup shape conformity and the shape deviations from selected cup sectional curves are established. Through the use of non-linear regression models, the shape conformity of the moulded cups can be predicted by moulding conditions with reasonable accuracy. The shape conformity provides effective guidelines for quality assurance and improves production efficiency of bra cup moulding. Moreover, thermal-mechanical properties, such as compressive strain and softening temperature obtained from thermomechanical analysis (TMA) scans, provide a good understanding of cup shape conformity and determine the lowest moulding temperature at initial trails of the bra cup moulding process. Surprisingly, in pliable foams, the cup size does not have an apparent effect on the moulding conditions to achieve optimal cup shape conformity. The results reveal that the moulding conditions for sizes 34 B and 34 D could remain the same for pliable foam materials. Nevertheless, in the case of more rigid foams, a higher moulding temperature is required to achieve a desirable cup shape for size 34 D as more energy is required for the <b>heat-setting</b> of foam materials with higher proportions of hard segments at the moulding of a larger cup size in anticipation of larger deformations.
