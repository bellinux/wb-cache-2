40|$|Separation of {{ownership}} from management, multidivisional firm organizations, delegation of production decisions to worker teams, delegation of pricing and advertising decisions to retail franchisers, reliance on intermediaries in trade or finance, {{and distribution of}} regulatory authority across different agencies represent examples of organizations that delegate and distribute decision-making authority instead of centralizing it. This paper reviews literature on {{costs and benefits of}} <b>delegated</b> <b>decision</b> making in hierarchical organizations or contracting networks with regard to problems of incentives and coordination. It starts by describing incentive and coordination costs of delegation in simple canonical examples of hierarchies where both information and incentives of different decisionmakers differ. One class of models pertain to contexts where the classical Revelation Principle applies, i. e., where costs of contractual complexity, information processing, or communication are absent, agents do not collude, and the mechanism designer can commit to the mechanism. Delegation may conceivably entail a loss of control and coordination arising from the divergence of information and incentives. Sufficient and necessary conditions for this loss to be mitigated entirely include risk neutrality, top-down contracting, and monitoring of transfers or production assignments between subordinates. The next class of models introduces communication costs that restrict the performance of centralized arrangements relative to delegation owing to a resulting loss of flexibility, which has to be traded off against possible control losses of delegation. Finally, consequences of collusion among agents is discussed, which typically enlarge the range of circumstances under which delegation can attain optimal second-best outcomes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of this theoretical literature to recently emerging empirical studies of industrial organizations where <b>delegated</b> <b>decision</b> making plays an important role: adoption of innovative human resource management practices, new information technologies and retail franchising. ...|$|E

Making {{delegation of}} discretion credible becomes a crucial issue when firms want to sustain the advantages that may flow from delegation: Such advantages are dependent on motivated employees, and managerial overruling or reneging is harmful to motivation. However, rather little work exists on how organizations and managers can make delegation credible. We add to the literature by arguing that key elements of organizations- notably organizational structure, coordination mechanisms, reward structures, and interdependencies between activities- influence the credibility of delegation. In particular, we argue that the fit between these influence the credibility of delegation. This is because more fit configurations will reduce the probability of managerial intervention that may harm employee motivation. Refutable propositions ar...|$|E

The problem may be intrapersonal, as occurs when there are endogenously changing tastes, or interpersonal where delegation is intuitionally necessary or where decision making is ‘as if’there is delegation. This is possible if decision making is through voting- an existence theorem is given. Decisions lead to shifts in control involving option losses and forward-looking recognition of {{this leads to the}} endogenous creation of hysteresis. The fact that the behaviour of other agents leads to hysteresis makes it optimal for any single agent to introduce more hysteresis. Organisations or bodies with many possible decision makers operate in one of two regimes, one where hysteresis is small and the other where hysteresis is large.

40|$|Infusing {{hierarchies}} {{with elements}} of market control {{has become a}} much-used way of simultaneously increasing entrepreneurialism and motivation in firms. However, this paper argues that such “internal hybrids, ” particularly in their radical forms, are inherently hard to successfully design and implement because of a fundamental incentive problem of establishing credible managerial commitments to not intervene in <b>delegated</b> <b>decision</b> making. This theme is developed and illustrated, using {{the case of the}} world-leading hearing aids producer, Oticon. In the beginning of the 1990 s, Oticon became famous for its radical internal hybrid, the “spaghetti organization. ” Recent work has interpreted the spaghetti organization as a radical attempt to foster dynamic capabilities by organizational means, neglecting, however, that about a decade later the spaghetti organization has given way to a more traditional matrix organization. In contrast, an organizational economics interpretation of Oticon organizational changes is developed. This lens suggests that a strong liability of the spaghetti organization was the above incentive problem: Frequent managerial meddling with delegated rights led to a severe loss of motivation, and arguably caused the change to a more structured organization. Refutable implications are developed, and the discussion is broadened to more general issues of economic organization...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{constructs}} on principal-agent {{theory and}} its extensions to production theory to propose an incentive {{system for the}} agent. The incentive scheme suggested here rewards the agent (hospital manager) {{on the basis of}} the distance that separates observed output, the result of past decisions, and the potential output that would maximise principal’s welfare (health authority). But setting up such a scheme is challenging, since we have to estimate potential output and to do this we need to know the production function faced by each hospital, something we ignore. To overcome this difficulty we resort to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). This way of using DEA identifies a frontier that sets first-best effort levels; i. e., the level of effort attributed to those hospitals that are successful at delivering the greatest level of outputs for a given consumption of resources. A very delicate issue in this context is the selection of the hospitals that define the frontier. If the frontier contains hospitals whose performance cannot be matched (i. e., outliers), efficiency targets will be distorted for the remaining hospitals, and this may create disincentives rather than incentives. We propose an iterative procedure which allows us to identify a “reasonable frontier ” that should set the objectives to be met by agents. The empirical part of the paper is based on data from Spanish public hospitals. From a theoretically point of view, this paper addresses the problem of performance assessment and incentives management in <b>delegated</b> <b>decision</b> making. From an applied point of view, our paper contributes to understand how opportunistic agents will strategically respond to productivity studies, and to know how desired responses can be motivated most efficiently...|$|E

40|$|Individuals' {{concerns}} for {{others have been}} the focus of many experimental investigations since the first appearance of the dictator game, which pointed out that, when people have to allocate resources and determine their own and others' payoffs, they decide accordingly to some well-defined distributional preferences. These, depending on the decisional setting and on individuals, are able to generate discrepancies between decisions that only affect the decision maker and choices that have consequences on others' payoffs. Starting from these considerations, the three studies presented in this thesis have the aim to picture {{the state of the art}} in the literature related to decision making and responsibility for others. Specifically, Chapter 2 presents an overview of past contributions, providing an analysis of three different experimental literatures: dictator games, <b>delegated</b> <b>decision</b> making under risk, and leadership in cooperation; the last two are then experimentally investigated more in details in the following chapters. Specifically, Chapter 3 focuses on investment in risk protection when risk is borne either by the decision maker or by another individual. In addition to this, the analysis manipulates who is the subject providing the resources to buy risk protection. Laboratory observations are assessed against behavioral predictions obtained from a linear model for social preferences to test its predictive power in this domain. Chapter 4 drives the attention to the effect of leadership in a public good experiment. Leaders take part to a public good game, aware of the fact that every decision they make directly affects their followers, who can be either passive players or have the opportunity to send short messages to their leader. This experimental setting allows to observe how people decide for themselves and others when involved in strategic interaction...|$|E

With these simple contracts, we show that delegation is an alternative to contracting to elicit agent's information. We can show that <b>delegated</b> <b>decisions</b> completely reveal the state of the world to the principal. Therefore the principal can extract agent's information by giving up the control right over some decisions. As the organisation takes a sequence of decisions, the information learned by the principal can be used for the other decisions. So delegation is only partial: the principal <b>delegates</b> some <b>decisions</b> and keeps control over others...|$|R
