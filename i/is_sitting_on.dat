5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the bench, {{starts to}} rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki {{looking at the}} now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall {{on the ground and}} its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{reveals that}} the {{procession}} {{was connected to the}} marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen’s six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen’s Horse in 1601.|$|E

5|$|Before commencing laying, {{the female}} spends much time near the nest and is entirely {{provisioned}} by the male. Meanwhile, the male roosts nearby and may cache any prey that is surplus to their requirements. When the female has reached peak weight, the male provides a ritual presentation {{of food and}} copulation occurs at the nest. The female lays eggs on alternate days and the clutch size averages about five eggs (range two to nine). The eggs are chalky white, somewhat elliptical and {{about the size of}} bantam's eggs, and incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid. While she <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the nest, the male is constantly bringing more provisions and they may pile up beside the female. The incubation period is about thirty days, hatching takes place over a prolonged period and the youngest chick may be several weeks younger than its oldest sibling. In years with plentiful supplies of food, there may be a hatching success rate of about 75%. The male continues to copulate with the female when he brings food which makes the newly hatched chicks vulnerable to injury.|$|E
5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a withered stoop.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, {{and looking at the}} mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E

Pannychis is also represented.|$|E

The woman sits {{in his chair and}} rests by the fire. The beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and contemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is seen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead officer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen trying to sleep while being seduced by 3 vampy women while the Beast sits in a chair (a reference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing his reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise, comes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes her from above and levitates the chaise she <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{starship}} flying towards an island after being summoned by its local tribesmen. The island locals slowly awake as the craft passes overhead. The starship then beams a pink bikini-clad electric green-haired Minaj down onto the beach and she begins to sing. She is presumably being worshipped as a goddess as she is carried away through the jungle by the island locals wearing a pale pink bikini with strands hanging off the bottom and short green hair, which is also worn during some kaleidoscope effects and in one scene of her on the beach singing. Minaj is then seen dancing in the mountains wearing a white, pink and black bodysuit behind a glass box {{while some of the}} male islanders run up to her. The scene then shifts towards the volcano top at nighttime where Minaj <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> top of the box with some of the locals dancing around her. In the final scene, a blonde-haired Minaj, wearing a white fringed strapless bikini splattered with paint, is partying with the islanders. Intercut scenes show Minaj singing with kaleidoscope effects on her in the second outfit and some more kaleidoscope effects in the same outfit but under blacklights. It ends with her singing the last line while looking directly into the camera.|$|E

Five women are later shown dancing simultaneously by the pool. The video cuts to Buchanan sitting in the middle of a support group in a room in a university, with a blackboard behind her reading [...] "Heartbroken" [...] and [...] "Anonymous". She later leaves the room, and the video then shows the Sugababes sitting on a bench near the pool. Range is shown on the stage in a nightclub disco as a stripper. Like Mutya Buena, she acts up the courage and leaves her profession, then she throws the microphone into the water in the nightclub [...] Meanwhile, all three Sugababes appear under the running water of a shower tap, and are shown dancing with the group of women from the previous scenes. The final scenes of the video show three children swimming underwater in the pool, resembling the members of the Sugababes.|$|E
