500|$|Starting in 1967 and {{continuing}} until 1986, the Albanian government {{carried out a}} policy of [...] "bunkerisation" [...] that saw the construction {{of hundreds of thousands}} of bunkers across the country. They were built in every possible location, ranging from [...] "beaches and mountains, in vineyards and pastures, in villages and towns, even on the manicured lawns of Albania's best hotel". Hoxha envisaged Albania fighting a two-front war against an attack mounted by Yugoslavia, NATO or the Warsaw Pact involving a simultaneous incursion by up to eleven enemy airborne divisions. As he put it, [...] "If we slackened our vigilance even <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> toned down our struggle against our enemies in the least, they would strike immediately like the snake that bites you and injects its poison before you are aware of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Clayson approves of {{the more}} [...] "understated {{production}} aesthetic" [...] next to what he views as an at-times [...] "bloated" [...] sound found elsewhere on All Things Must Pass. Simon Leng also acknowledges Harrison's success in [...] "temper Phil Spector's taste for the extreme" [...] and describes [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] {{as one of its}} composer's [...] "more attractive" [...] songs, with a fine lead vocal. [...] " [...] is refreshing to hear Harrison singing about another's pain," [...] Leng adds, [...] "suggesting that, unlike some of his contemporaries, he was able to displace himself as the center of his universe <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two at least." [...] In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams identifies [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] as an example of [...] "how sympathetic to the performer" [...] Spector could be as a producer, in this case, by giving the recording a [...] "mellow, autumnal mix" [...] that [...] "beautifully display" [...] Drake's pedal steel.|$|E

5000|$|After the war, Godfrey enlisted as <b>a</b> scout <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{government}} expedition into Sioux country, {{under the}} command of James A. Sawyers. It was written that Godfrey, pursued by Indians and in search of help for besieged companions, once [...] "walked 150 miles in three days and three nights, never halting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> rest <b>or</b> sleep," [...] subsisting [...] "on a chunk of raw bacon" [...] and [...] "never halting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> rest <b>or</b> sleep." ...|$|R
60|$|Arnold {{was silent}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Somehow <b>or</b> other, he had {{accepted}} the fact of her being Mrs. Weatherley without thinking much as to its significance.|$|R

60|$|Dalton {{looked up}} sharply, but was silent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two Tommy's indignation got {{the better}} of him.|$|E

5000|$|... "Tick, tick, tick, tick tick tick tick..." [...] during <b>a</b> post-game recap, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> play <b>or</b> <b>moment</b> {{in which}} the clock is a factor.|$|R
6000|$|The girl's color {{came and}} went under my gaze; then {{she lifted her head}} and met it directly. [...] "I--I was afraid you might be suspected, and <b>for</b> just <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two, when you first came in looking like a ghost, I {{did not know what to}} think," [...] she said. [...] "But it was only because you startled me so." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before leaving <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long journey, {{travelers}} {{and all those}} who are seeing them off, must sit <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in silence before leaving the house. It is often conveniently written off as a time to sit and think of anything one may have forgotten. Another version of the superstition states that the traveler must sit <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> on <b>or</b> beside their suitcase.|$|R
60|$|Big Otter {{looked after}} them <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two in grave silence.|$|E

60|$|Captain Francis lit a {{cigarette}} and smoked thoughtfully <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two.|$|E
60|$|The major groaned {{inwardly}} {{when she}} stopped, {{and there was}} a sudden slight but perceptible change in his companion. Her face lost its usual gentleness, and became <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> not hard <b>or</b> vindictive, but impressively grave.|$|R
50|$|Changing modes {{while the}} game is ongoing {{can be used as}} a means to {{increase}} difficulty and provide additional challenge, or as <b>a</b> reward <b>for</b> player success. Power-ups are modes that last <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>or</b> that change only one or a few game rules; for example power pellets in Pac-Man give the temporary ability to eat the enemies <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> mean <b>or</b> {{think that}} {{religion}} is to be taught by mere prudence and common sense. But a spiritual religion is imperilled the moment that you insist upon an unspiritual people observing outward forms which are to them {{the essence of the}} new teaching. Anything better than turning heathens into Pharisees! What did our Lord call the proselytes of the Pharisee and the Scribe? ...|$|R
60|$|Dan {{regarded}} them steadfastly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two without winking or flinching.|$|E

6000|$|... "There's {{nothing wrong}} with Ledsam," [...] {{declared}} a gruff voice from the corner. [...] "And don't gossip, you fellows, {{at the top of}} your voices like a lot of old women. He'll be calling here <b>for</b> me in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two." ...|$|R
40|$|Sylvester {{scowled at}} the traffic light {{because it was}} detaining him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{valuable}} <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two; {{even though he could}} have crossed safely, he waited because that is the law. When the light changed, he hurried 2 ̆ 7 across the street with others who had eight o 2 ̆ 7 clock appointments with destiny, and, just as he did every morning, looked in all the smart shop windows...|$|R
60|$|The dagger {{which was}} {{to act as a}} {{passport}} was sticking in Omar's girdle. Labakan drew it gently out, and hesitated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> whether <b>or</b> not to plunge it {{into the heart of the}} sleeping prince. However, he shrank from the idea of murder, so he contented himself with placing the dagger in his own belt, and, saddling Omar's swift horse for himself, was many miles away before the prince woke up to realise his losses.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard started, but {{he stood}} very still again <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{character}} {{has its own}} unique 'special attack' giving the player more chance of scoring <b>a</b> point. <b>For</b> example: Gilius throws a magic bottle {{in the air and}} covers the opponent's side with thunderbolts, if they touch one the character will be stunned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>moment,</b> <b>or</b> Sonic's signature [...] "Super Sonic" [...] attack, which causes the tennis ball to zig-zag in various directions around the court when he hits the ball.|$|R
60|$|The Battle lasted seven hours; {{the last}} four of it very hot, till Lobositz was won and lost. It was about 5 P.M. when Browne fired his retreat-cannon:--cannon {{happened}} to be loaded (say the Anecdote-Books, mythically given now and then); Friedrich, wearied enough, had flung himself into his carriage <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> rest, <b>or</b> thankful reflection; and of all places, the ball of the retreat-cannon lighted THERE. Between Friedrich's feet, as he lay reclining,--say the Anecdote-Books, whom nobody is bound to believe.|$|R
6000|$|Presently, as she {{lay still}} on her bed all dressed, and with {{her face in her}} hands, {{trembling}} <b>for</b> very shame, <b>a</b> little knock sounded tentatively at the door of her bedroom. It was a timid, small knock, very low and soft, and, as it were, inquiring. It seemed to say in an apologetic sort of undertone, [...] "I don't know whether you're awake or not just yet; and if you're still asleep, pray don't let me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> disturb <b>or</b> arouse you." ...|$|R
60|$|Sally {{considered}} this statement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two before {{she looked up}} again.|$|E

60|$|They {{left the}} house, entered the waiting automobile, and drove rapidly towards the {{confines}} of the city. Quest was unusually thoughtful. Lenora, on the other hand, seemed to have lost a great deal of her usual self composure. She seldom sat still <b>for</b> more than <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two together. She was obviously nervous and excited.|$|R
5000|$|In her {{review for}} Variety, film critic Deborah Young called the film [...] "the Italian debut of the year, {{at least as}} for critics" [...] and {{referred}} to it as a film which [...] "hits fever pitch early and never pauses <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of softness <b>or</b> to let the story breathe".|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>or</b> <b>an</b> hour--no {{one will}} ever know how long--we ran round him, raising the dust, {{scattering}} the stones, breaking the branches, dodging his onslaughts. He leaped at us to {{the full length of}} his tether, sailing right into our faces, a fierce, uncowed, tigerish beast. If it had not been for the collar and swivel he would have choked himself a hundred times. Quick as a cat, supple, powerful, tireless, he kept on the go, whirling, bounding, leaping, rolling, till it seemed we would never catch him.|$|R
