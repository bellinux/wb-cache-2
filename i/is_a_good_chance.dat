5|$|As of 2013, Schafer {{is still}} {{interested}} in a sequel to Brütal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources {{to make it happen}} as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that a sequel to Brütal Legend would be possible. Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.|$|E
5|$|While there, Nico {{settles into}} camp life; Percy and Blackjack save a sea monster Percy nicknames Bessie; and Artemis's {{lieutenant}} Zoë Nightshade has mysterious dreams about the goddess being in grave danger. Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and holding it up for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees {{to let him go}} because there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that Percy will get killed while on the quest.|$|E
25|$|In most {{children}} with postdiarrheal HUS, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of spontaneous resolution, so observation {{in a hospital}} is often all that is necessary, with supportive care such as hemodialysis where indicated. If a diagnosis of STEC-HUS is confirmed, plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is contraindicated. However, plasmapheresis may be indicated when there is diagnostic uncertainty between HUS and TTP.|$|E

500|$|He just {{knows how}} to play, and that's a {{basketball}} skill. He's got such a nice feel for the game, and works so hard. There's not much maintenance with him. He doesn't {{make a lot of}} mistakes. [...] This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to take a long look, and see what he can do here.|$|E
2500|$|... 5s. Even though 5s {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{held in the}} hand (because players know {{the extent to which}} a 5 matches their other cards), they are also good in the crib. Four out of every thirteen cards (10–K) are worth ten, so there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that 5s in the hand or crib will form fifteen-twos.|$|E
2500|$|Examples {{of other}} changes are [...] "truly I tell you" [...] becomes [...] "I {{tell you the}} truth;" [...] "fellow workers" [...] becomes [...] "coworkers;" [...] "the Jews," [...] {{particularly}} in John's Gospel, often becomes [...] "Jewish leaders" [...] when the context makes the statement's real meaning apparent; and [...] "miracles," [...] especially in John, become the more literal [...] "signs," [...] "miraculous signs," [...] or [...] "works." [...] The word for [...] "Spirit," [...] where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> it means the Holy Spirit, is now capitalized. [...] "Peter" [...] is now rendered [...] "Cephas" [...] when the Greek merely transliterates the Hebrew name.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe it's {{right to}} talk of God {{as if you were}} well acquainted with Him," [...] said Felicity, who felt that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to snub Dan.|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't eat {{a single}} thing for a whole day," [...] said Jerry. [...] "I'm kind of curious to see what fasting is like, anyhow. This will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to find out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bill {{strongly}} criticized Charmanine for {{not having}} any efficient marketing and spending time setting up the store, saying that if they focused more on bringing in more customers there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> they could've won.|$|R
2500|$|Significantly, {{the search}} {{revealed}} {{no trace of}} {{either of the two}} Vest Pocket Kodak (VPK) cameras that the pair were known to be carrying from Irvine's diaries, leading to speculation {{that at least one of}} the cameras must have been in Irvine's possession. Experts from Kodak have stated that if one of the cameras is found, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that the film could be developed to produce [...] "printable images", due to the nature of the black and white film that was used and the fact that it has, in effect, been in [...] "deep freeze" [...] for over three-quarters of a century. Such images would potentially illuminate the fate of Mallory and Irvine more clearly than any other evidence.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{development}} is the mask with two windows, one for each eye. It can have the windows closer to the face than the one-window type, and therefore contain even less internal volume for the diver to clear or equalise. These types are often called a [...] "low-volume mask". [...] Participants in the sport of underwater hockey are required to use twin-lens masks of this type for their own safety - the sport uses a heavy lead puck similar to an ice hockey puck, nan but skilful players can flick the puck considerable height off the bottom when making passes {{which leads to the}} possibility of accidental puck contact with other players. [...] Should a puck hit the lens of a single-lens mask there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> it will break the glass and pass through the aperture to hit the face and eyes, but with a twin-lens mask though the glass may break the frame will prevent the passage of the puck any further.|$|E
2500|$|More importantly, the {{involvement}} of Lauper, a celebrity completely unrelated to wrestling, in the pro wrestling world was unprecedented. MTV's decision to broadcast the Brawl to End it All tremendously increased the WWF's public profile, especially in the coveted young adult demographic. This led directly to the 1980s professional wrestling boom. Wrestling Observer's Dave Meltzer wrote, [...] "Without Albano, wrestling history would have been monumentally different because if you take Lauper's involvement out of the equation, the early losses on expanding nationally and buying so much television time {{were on the verge}} of putting the company under... Without her, there would have been no MTV special, no national media publicity, and it's highly unlikely without it that the first WrestleMania would have been a success. If you take Albano's participation out of the equation, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> the McMahon expansion would have hit an iceberg and died in early 1985... the attention garnered by the Rock & Wrestling Connection, stemming from that chance meeting on an airplane between Lauper and Albano less than two years earlier, led NBC to make the decision to air pro wrestling several times per year in the Saturday Night Live time slot." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{might take}} you in as an office assistant," [...] he replied. [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to learn medicine. But {{there would not be}} much to do, and the pay would be {{necessarily}} small." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, [...] "aware of {{his status}} {{as one of the}} few leaders revered across Japan's {{suddenly}} fractured political landscape" [...] and the country's [...] "most revered elder statesman", Nakasone launched a series of interviews to address the direction of prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's government. In a profile at that time, he saw Hatoyama's [...] "inexperienced left-leaning" [...] government as [...] "challenging Japan's postwar political order and its close relationship with the United States". As well, the LDP was [...] "crumbling into disarray" [...] in the wake of Hatoyama's victory. In the profile, Nakasone described the moment [...] "as a national opening on par with the wrenching social and political changes that followed defeat in the [...] war [...] praised the appearance of a strong second political party as a step toward true democracy". [...] "Being knocked out of power <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to study in the cram school of public opinion", he was quoted as saying of the LDP. He [...] "faulted Mr. Hatoyama for giving Washington the impression that [...] valued ties with China more than he did those with the United States. 'Because of the prime minister’s imprudent remarks, the current situation calls for Japan to make efforts to improve things,' he said. The [...] relationship with the United States is different from that with China, he said, because 'it is built on a security alliance, and not just on the alliance, but on the shared values of liberal democracy, and on its shared ideals.'" [...] And relative to another high-profile current source of friction between Japan and the United States, Nakasone said [...] "Problems like Okinawa [...] can be solved by talking together." ...|$|E

3000|$|If the {{principle}} nomen est omen is true, {{there would have}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that among the companies investigated, {{a high percentage of}} family businesses would have been identified.

5000|$|... “We {{will need}} to look to get a {{testimonial}} committee together and fingers crossed {{we can get a}} game and a few events arranged... It will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to get the players and the fans together for a day that everyone can enjoy.” ...|$|R
60|$|Davis {{offered to}} go up the hills {{to look for the}} missing men. He had lived for some years in the bush in Australia, and he thought that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of his {{discovering}} their tracks. But the captain shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is too young, O'Connor; besides, the boy {{is enough}} to corrupt a whole {{regiment}}; he has made half the lads as wild as he is himself.

6000|$|The {{gentleman in}} whom we are {{interested}} understood no French, but I have said he was intelligent, and here <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to prove it.

[...] "But you must finish it," [...] he said. [...] "FINISH, you know;" [...] and he pointed to the unpainted hand of the figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is really}} fine!" [...] {{declared}} Santa Claus, who loved toys and pretty things. [...] "I think, Mr. Wizard, I shall have you blow a bubble around me; then I can float away home {{and see the}} country spread out beneath me as I travel. There isn't a spot on earth that I haven't visited, but I usually go in the night-time, riding behind my swift reindeer. Here <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> to observe the country by daylight, while I am riding slowly and at my ease." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, this {{afternoon}} the captain may set {{the men at}} work; but I don't think they would do much good, and there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of getting <b>a</b> limb broken. As long as this calm holds there is no hurry, {{one way or the}} other." ...|$|R
60|$|Leslie took Dick to Montreal {{early in}} May. Gilbert went with her, to help her, {{and make the}} {{necessary}} arrangements for her.

50|$|The Torrigiani Palace bordered Boboli Gardens—and this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> {{to create}} <b>a</b> botanical garden, whose {{direction}} was entrusted to Attilio Zuccagni.

6000|$|... "Yes, certainly," [...] said Mr. Tolman. [...] "I have eyes, and I {{know all}} about it. Now {{let me tell you}} what I think. When a thing is to be done, it ought to be done the first time there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance.</b> That's the way I do business. Now you might as well come around here to-morrow {{afternoon}} prepared to propose to Miss Edwards. She is due to-morrow, for she has been two days away. If she doesn't come, we will postpone the matter until the next day. But you should be ready to-morrow. I don't believe you can see her much when you don't meet her here, for that family is expected back very soon, and from what I infer from her account of her employers, you won't care to visit her at their house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Olaf Red-Sword, we love you, {{who have}} always loved us, your comrades, {{as we have}} shown you to-night. You have led us well, Olaf, and, {{considering}} our small numbers, we have just won a victory {{of which we are}} proud. But our necks are in the noose, as yours is, and we think that in this case our best course is to be bold. Therefore, we name you Cæsar. Having defeated the Greeks, we propose now to take the palace and to talk with the regiments without, many of whom are disloyal and shout for Constantine, whom after all they hate only a little less than they do Irene yonder. We know not what will {{be the end of the}} matter and do not greatly care, who set our fortunes upon a throw of the dice, but we think there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of victory. Do you accept, and will you throw in your sword with ours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{plan which}} I {{arranged}} for discovering her abode, {{in accordance with}} your brother's suggestion, proved useless. The young woman never came to the hospital a second time. Her address {{was given to me}} this morning, by Turner himself; who begged that I would visit her professionally, as he had no confidence in the medical man who was then in attendance on her. Many circumstances combined to make my compliance with his request anything but easy or desirable; but knowing that you--or your brother I ought, perhaps, rather to say--were interested in the young woman, I determined to take the very earliest opportunity of seeing her, and consulting with her medical attendant. I could not get to her till late in the afternoon. When I arrived, I found her suffering from one of the worst attacks of Typhus I ever remember to have seen; and I think it my duty to state candidly, that I believe her life to be in imminent danger. At the same time, it is right to inform you that the gentleman in attendance on her does not share my opinion: he still thinks there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of saving her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jerry was {{speaking}} of you," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "This will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> {{for you to}} show him that he is mistaken.

60|$|Having {{realised}} this, {{she became}} calmer and went about her preparations for departure with an easier mind.

She wound up her affairs in New York and, on the following Wednesday, boarded the Nuronia bound for Southampton.|$|R
60|$|All this {{showed that}} these Americans were fools, {{who did not}} {{understand}} their best interests.
