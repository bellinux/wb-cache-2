5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E

5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>function,</b> most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E
5|$|From 1870 to 1880 {{it became}} clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the {{substance}} of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century {{it was found that the}} number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles – what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established.|$|E

Exploratory analyses revealed that several communicative <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>functions</b> were related to living environment, presence/absence of epilepsy, and age.

The IPCA aims to provide a systematic inventory and objective description of the communication <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>functions</b> present in the child's repertoire. Seventy-nine surveys were returned and analyzed to determine differences in the number and types of communicative <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>functions</b> in relation to the child's setting, genetic subtype, presence of epilepsy, age, and level of intellectual disability.
