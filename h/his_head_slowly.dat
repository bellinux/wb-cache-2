60|$|Boulte raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and said}} <b>slowly,</b> 'Oh, you liar!' Kurrell's face changed. 'What's that?' he asked quickly.|$|R
60|$|A sigh {{must have}} escaped her lips, or merely just the indrawing of her breath; certain {{it is that}} {{something}} caused the kneeling man to stir. He raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slowly,</b> and then looked up straight across the light--to her.|$|R

60|$|Going out, {{he raised}} his eyes to Redlaw for the first time. Redlaw, whose steadfast gaze was fixed upon him, dreamily held out his hand. He {{returned}} and touched it--little more--with both his own; and bending down <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> went <b>slowly</b> out.|$|R

The gilt hands had taken the opportunity to steal through no less than five and twenty minutes behind his back.|$|R
60|$|No sign of {{recognition}} was made: {{and in a}} moment he moved <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again <b>slowly</b> toward the vale, and began to sing, using his own language, in those low, guttural tones, that have been so often mentioned, his notes rising with his theme, till they swelled so loud as to be distinct.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look to yourself, my dear friend!" [...] {{he said in}} a thick voice, {{groping for}} the wall. Planting his hat askew on <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> he began <b>slowly</b> to descend the stairs.|$|R

6000|$|... "Jobs? You looking for----Say, {{you beat}} it. Gwan. Chase yourself. Gwan now; don't stand there. You ain't no decent 'bo.

6000|$|He frowned; <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sank <b>slowly</b> in thought. Observing the {{advantage}} gained she thrust it home.

60|$|Lucy Bostil {{did indeed}} have {{an eye for}} a horse.

[...] And he laid his {{withered}} hand on the arm of his chair, so that the woman whose presence gratified him might take it within hers and comfort him.|$|R
60|$|The {{two reports}} came so nearly {{together}} that the candles flickered but once. The marquis stood, smiling, {{the fingers of}} his left hand resting, outspread, upon the end of the table. David remained erect, and turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slowly,</b> searching for his wife with his eyes. Then, as a garment falls from where it is hung, he sank, crumpled, upon the floor.|$|R
