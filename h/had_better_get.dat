500|$|On 29 April 2015, Boyd {{was married}} {{for the third}} time at the Chelsea Register Office at Chelsea Old Town Hall in London. Her husband, {{property}} developer Rod Weston, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's almost our silver anniversary so we thought we <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> on with it".|$|E
500|$|Raymond Benson {{considered}} the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil. This crystallised in Goldfinger with the Saint George motif, which is stated explicitly in the book: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St George <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> a move on and do something"; Black notes {{that the image of}} St. George is an English, rather than British personification.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the least," [...] Roger agreed. [...] "We <b>had</b> both <b>better</b> <b>get</b> what sleep we can. We {{shall have}} a long tramp before us, tonight." ...|$|R

500|$|As with Ladenson's {{observation}} that Bond was being depicted as [...] "the worthy knight", Raymond Benson also identifies the Saint George theme in Goldfinger, {{which he says}} has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond's thoughts after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St. George <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> a move on and do something". Jeremy Black notes {{that the image of}} the [...] "latter-day St. George [...] again an English, rather than British image." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-June Rockwell sketched in {{charcoal}} the Four Freedoms {{and sought}} commission from the Office of War Information (OWI). He was rebuffed by an official who said, [...] "The last war, you illustrators did the posters. This war, we're {{going to use}} fine arts men, real artists." [...] However, Saturday Evening Post editor, Ben Hibbs, recognized {{the potential of the}} set and encouraged Rockwell to produce them right away. By early fall, the authors for the Four Freedoms had submitted their essays. Rockwell was concerned that Freedom from Want [...] did not match Bulosan's text. [...] In mid-November, Hibbs wrote Rockwell pleading that he not scrap his third work to start over. Hibbs alleviated Rockwell's thematic concern; he explained that the illustrations only needed to address the same topic rather than be in unison. Hibbs pressured Rockwell into completing his work by warning him that the magazine {{was on the verge of}} being compelled by the government to place restrictions on four-color printing, so Rockwell <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> the work published before relegation to halftone printing.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Goldsmith, who had in February 1762 {{published}} The Mystery Revealed, {{may also}} have been responsible for the satirical illustration, English Credulity or the Invisible Ghost (1762). [...] It shows a séance as envisioned by the artist, with the ghost hovering above the heads of the two children in the bed. [...] To the right of the bed a woman deep in prayer exclaims [...] "O! [...] that they would lay it in the Red Sea!" [...] Another cries [...] "I shall never have any rest again". [...] The English magistrate and social reformer John Fielding, who was blind, is pictured entering from the left saying [...] "I should be glad to see this spirit", while his companion says [...] "Your W——r's <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> your Warrant back'd by his L—rds—p", referring to a Middlesex magistrate's warrant which required an endorsement from the Lord Mayor, Samuel Fludyer. [...] A man in tall boots, whip in hand, says: [...] "Ay Tom I'll lay 6to1 it runs more nights than the Coronation" [...] and his companion remarks [...] "How they swallow the hum". [...] A clergymen says [...] "I saw the light on the Clock" [...] while another asks [...] "Now thou Infidel does thou not believe?", prompting his neighbour to reply [...] "Yes if it had happen'd sooner 't would have serv'd me for a new Character in the Lyar the Story would tell better than the Cat & Kittens". [...] Another clergyman exclaims [...] "If a Gold Watch knock 3times", and a Parson asks him [...] "Brother don't disturb it". [...] On the wall, an image of The Bottle Conjuror is alongside an image of Elizabeth Canning, whose fraud had so worried Samuel Fludyer that he had refused to arrest either Parsons or Kent.|$|E

2500|$|Although Kennedy was {{pronounced}} dead at 1:00p.m. CST, the official announcement would not come until {{more than half an}} hour later. [...] After receiving word of the president's death, acting White House press secretary Malcolm Kilduff entered the hospital room where Vice President Johnson—who would be sworn in as the new President on Air Force one later that day—and his wife were sitting. Kilduff approached them and said to Johnson, [...] "Mr. President, I have to announce the death of President Kennedy. Is it OK with you that the announcement be made now?" [...] Johnson ordered that the announcement be made only after he left the hospital. When asking that the announcement be delayed, Johnson told Kilduff: [...] "I think I <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out of here.[...]before you announce it. We don't know whether this is a worldwide conspiracy, whether they are after me as well as they were after President Kennedy, or whether they are after Speaker (John W.) McCormack, or Senator (Carl) Hayden. We just don't know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'That'll be {{a double}} ENCORE {{if you take}} care, boys,' said Mr Crummles. 'You <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> your wind now and change your clothes.' ...|$|E
