25|$|The <b>D</b> <b>Ring</b> is the {{innermost}} ring, {{and is very}} faint. In 1980, Voyager 1 detected within this ring three ringlets designated D73, D72 and D68, with D68 being the discrete ringlet nearest to Saturn. Some 25 years later, Cassini images showed that D72 had become significantly broader and more diffuse, and had moved planetward by 200km.|$|E
25|$|Present in the <b>D</b> <b>Ring</b> is a finescale {{structure}} with waves 30km apart. First {{seen in the}} gap between the C Ring and D73, the structure was found during Saturn's 2009 equinox to extend a radial distance of 19,000km from the <b>D</b> <b>Ring</b> to the inner edge of the B Ring. The waves are interpreted as a spiral pattern of vertical corrugations of 2 to 20 m amplitude; the fact that the period of the waves is decreasing over time (from 60km in 1995 to 30km by 2006) allows a deduction that the pattern may have originated in late 1983 with the impact of a cloud of debris (with a mass of ~1012 kg) from a disrupted comet that tilted the rings out of the equatorial plane. A similar spiral pattern in Jupiter's main ring has been attributed to a perturbation caused by impact of material from Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{innermost}} {{region of}} the magnetosphere near the rings is generally devoid of energetic ions and electrons because they are absorbed by ring particles. Saturn, however, has the second radiation belt discovered by Cassini in 2004 and located just inside the innermost <b>D</b> <b>Ring.</b> This belt probably consists of energetic charged particles formed via the CRAND process or of ionized energetic neutral atoms coming from the main radiation belt.|$|E

40|$|Yard-Sale (YS) is a {{stochastic}} multiplicative wealth-exchange {{model with}} two phases: a stable one where wealth is shared, and an unstable one where wealth condenses onto one agent. YS is here studied numerically on 1 <b>d</b> <b>rings,</b> 2 <b>d</b> square lattices, and random graphs with variable average coordination, comparing its properties {{with those in}} mean field (MF). Equilibrium properties in the stable phase are almost unaffected {{by the introduction of}} a network. Measurement of decorrelation times in the stable phase allow us to determine the critical interface with very good precision, and {{it turns out to be}} the same, for all networks analyzed, as the one that can be analytically derived in MF. In the unstable phase, on the other hand, dynamical as well as asymptotic properties are strongly network-dependent. Wealth no longer condenses on a single agent, as in MF, but onto an extensive set of agents, the properties of which depend on the network. Connections with previous studies of coalescence of immobile reactants are discussed, and their analytic predictions are successfully compared with our numerical results.

2500|$|The densest {{parts of}} the Saturnian ring system are the A and B Rings, which are {{separated}} by the Cassini Division (discovered in 1675 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini). Along with the C Ring, which was discovered in 1850 and is similar in character to the Cassini Division, these regions constitute the main rings. The main rings are denser and contain larger particles than the tenuous dusty rings. The latter include the <b>D</b> <b>Ring,</b> extending inward to Saturn's cloud tops, the G and E Rings and others beyond the main ring system. These diffuse rings are characterised as [...] "dusty" [...] {{because of the small}} size of their particles (often about a μm); their chemical composition is, like the main rings, almost entirely water ice.

40|$|A {{lattice network}} {{is a special}} type of network in which all nodes have {{the same number of}} links, and its {{boundary}} conditions are periodic. The most basic lattice network is the ring, a one-dimensional network with periodic border conditions. In contrast, the Cartesian product of <b>d</b> <b>rings</b> forms a d-dimensional lattice network. An analytical expression currently exists for the clustering coefficient in this type of network, but the theoretical value is valid only up to certain connectivity value; in other words, the analytical expression is incomplete. Here we obtain analytically the clustering coefficient expression in d-dimensional lattice networks for any link density. Our analytical results show that the clustering coefficient for a lattice network with density of links that tend to 1, leads to the value of the clustering coefficient of a fully connected network. We developed a model on criminology in which the generalized clustering coefficient expression is applied. The model states that delinquents learn the know-how of crime business by sharing knowledge, directly or indirectly, with their friends of the gang. This generalization shed light on the network properties, which is important to develop new models in different fields where network structure {{plays an important role in}} the system dynamic, such as criminology, evolutionary game theory, econophysics, among others...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} {{to determine whether a}} heterogeneity of endothelium-dependent relaxations in arteries from different vascular beds exists in experimental congestive heart failure (CHF) and to determine the mediators of those responses. CHF was produced in dogs by rapid ventricular pacing for 15 <b>d.</b> <b>Rings</b> of coronary, femoral, and renal arteries with and without endothelium from control and CHF dogs were suspended in organ chambers for measurement of isometric force. In arteries contracted with prostaglandin F 2 alpha, endothelium-dependent relaxations to BHT 920 (an alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist) were increased in coronary arteries from dogs with CHF (maximal relaxation: control - 15 +/- 9 % vs CHF - 92 +/- 5 %; n = 5 - 6; P < 0. 05), with a modest enhancement in renal arteries. Relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and the calcium ionophore were unchanged. Relaxations to BHT 920 in CHF were reduced by NG monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and pertussis toxin but not by indomethacin. These data suggest that endothelium-dependent relaxations are affected heterogeneously in CHF. The enhanced response to alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists in the coronary artery is mediated by nitric oxide through a mechanism sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin. This selective increase in endothelium-dependent relaxations in the coronary artery may contribute to preserving coronary blood flow during CHF...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the basic}} {{building}} units found on many zeolites, as well as larger fragments found in specific cases, were imaged within the structure of an aluminosilicate ultra-thin film synthesized on a Ru(0001) substrate. These units have been suggested as possible precursors for {{the wide variety of}} zeolites reported to date. The reported structure consists of a planar sheet of double N-membered rings (polygonal prisms) sharing four-membered ring faces in the planes normal to the surface. The units are mostly double six-membered <b>rings</b> (<b>d</b> 6 r), with a significant population of pairs of double four- and eight-membered <b>rings</b> (<b>d</b> 4 r and d 8 r) and pairs of double five- and seven-membered <b>rings</b> (<b>d</b> 5 r and d 7 r), among other minority species. In particular, there is significant increase of the d 4 r and d 8 r units in this aluminum-containing film, when compared to pure-silica ones prepared in the same manner. These building blocks appear 25 (d 6 r), 17 (d 4 r) and 5 (d 8 r) times, in the set of 176 unique zeolite frameworks reported up to 2007. In addition, larger ensembles of rings observed in this system can be related to more complex ensembles in zeolites, such the α-cage in zeolite A.

40|$|In {{the studies}} of {{conductance}} of closed mesoscopic systems, semi-linear response the-ory (SLRT) offers a novel unified framework {{that goes beyond the}} traditional Kubo formulation. In this Thesis we apply SLRT to two types of mesoscopic systems. The first is disordered quasi- 1 <b>d</b> <b>rings,</b> where we build an analytical model to understand the departure of SLRT results from Kubo results. Guided by the numerical analysis on the statistical properties of the current operator matrix elements, we introduce a random matrix theory (RMT) model which leads to a generalized variable range hopping (VRH) picture of the conductance. Both of these models capture the essential aspects of the mesoscopic conductance for this system. The second system is the Harper model, which is a one-dimensional model that exhibits a Metal-Insulator transition—at the critical point, it possesses fractal structures in both the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues. We are interested in studying how the fractal structures might {{have an effect on the}} mesoscopic conductance calculations.
