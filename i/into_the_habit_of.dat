25|$|When first discovered, Iapetus {{was among}} four Saturnian moons {{labelled}} the Sidera Lodoicea by their discoverer Giovanni Cassini after King Louis XIV (the other three were Tethys, Dione and Rhea). However, astronomers fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> referring to them using Roman numerals, with Iapetus being Saturn V. Once Mimas and Enceladus {{were discovered in}} 1789, the numbering scheme was extended and Iapetus became SaturnVII. And {{with the discovery of}} Hyperion in 1848, Iapetus became Saturn VIII, which it is still known by today (see naming of natural satellites).|$|E
25|$|Cassini {{named the}} four new moons as Sidera Lodoicea ("the stars of Louis") to honour king Louis XIV of France. By {{the end of}} the seventeenth century, astronomers fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> {{referring}} to them and Titan as SaturnI through SaturnV (Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Iapetus). Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended to SaturnVII by bumping the older five moons up two slots. The discovery of Hyperion in 1848 changed the numbers one last time, bumping Iapetus up to SaturnVIII. Henceforth, the numbering scheme would remain fixed.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{multiple}} sources of income, {{the community was}} in constant debt almost immediately after it began. The community, including Ripley, had difficulty with the farming aspects of the community, in particular because of poor soil and not enough labor. The major crop was hay, though it was sold at low grade prices; vegetables, milk, and fruit were not produced in high enough numbers to be profitable. The property was mortgaged four times between 1841 and 1845. Brook Farm got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> spending money before they had raised it.

500|$|One of Delius's major wartime works was his Requiem, {{dedicated}} [...] "to {{the memory}} of all young Artists fallen in the war". The work owes nothing to the traditional Christian liturgy, eschewing notions of an afterlife and celebrating instead a pantheistic renewal of Nature. When Albert Coates presented the work in London in 1922, its atheism offended some believers. [...] This attitude persisted long after Delius's death, as the Requiem did not receive another performance in the UK until 1965, and by 1980 had still had only seven performances world-wide. In Germany, the regular presentation of Delius's works ceased at {{the outbreak of the}} war, and never resumed. Nevertheless, his standing with some continental musicians was unaffected; Beecham records that Bartók and Kodály were admirers of Delius, and the former grew <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> sending his compositions to Delius for comment and tried to interest him in both Hungarian and Romanian popular music.|$|E

Upon his death, senior figures from Yorkshire County Cricket Club paid tribute to his influence, and his dignity and zealousness were praised by the Leeds branch of the National Union of Journalists.

500|$|The Beatles {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of musical styles, which the authors Barry Miles and Gillian Gaar each view as the most diverse of any of the group's albums. These styles include rock and roll, blues, folk, country, reggae, avant-garde, hard rock and music hall. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation, relative to all the Beatles' releases since Revolver. The author Nicholas Schaffner viewed this as reflective of a widespread departure from the LSD-inspired psychedelia of 1967, an approach that was initiated by Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys and similarly adopted in 1968 by artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Byrds. Edwin Faust of Stylus Magazine described The Beatles as [...] "foremost an album about musical purity (as the album cover and title suggest). Whereas on prior Beatles albums, the band was getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mixing several musical genres into a single song, on The White Album every song is faithful to its selected genre. The rock n' roll tracks are purely rock n' roll; the folk songs are purely folk; the surreal pop numbers are purely surreal pop; and the experimental piece is purely experimental." ...|$|E

Flandez opined of [...] "Ice Ice Baby": [...] "Will, kicking it old school, doesn't cut it with his '80s-flashback moves because a.) he takes himself too seriously and b.) he looks like he's in a J.Crew mag, not part of 2 Live Crew." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] his favorite song, but noting that that was [...] "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: [...] "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been. I love Newton-John’s walk-on cameo, but I don’t want them to fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> re-creating music videos frame by frame: It was cute - once.

5000|$|As a codebreaker {{concerned}} with Cryptanalysis of the Enigma, Herivel is remembered chiefly for {{the discovery of}} what was soon dubbed the Herivel tip or Herivelismus.

2500|$|Paul Feyerabend {{was born}} in 1924 in Vienna, where he {{attended}} primary and high school. In this period he got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> frequent reading, developed an interest in theatre, and started singing lessons. After {{graduating from high school}} in April 1942 he was drafted into the German Arbeitsdienst. After basic training in Pirmasens, Germany, he was assigned to a unit in Quelern en Bas, near Brest (France). Feyerabend described the work he did during that period as monotonous: [...] "we moved around in the countryside, dug ditches, and filled them up again." [...] After a short leave he joined the army and volunteered for officer school. In his autobiography he writes that he hoped the war would be over {{by the time he had}} finished his education as an officer. This turned out not to be the case. From December 1943 on, he served as an officer on the northern part of the Eastern Front, was decorated with an Iron cross, and attained the rank of lieutenant. When the German army started its retreat from the advancing Red Army, Feyerabend was hit by three bullets while directing traffic. One bullet hit him in the spine. As a consequence he needed to walk with a stick for the rest of his life and frequently experienced severe pain. He spent the rest of the war recovering from his wounds.|$|E
2500|$|One {{feature of}} Curll's career, {{and the one}} that most {{cemented}} his reputation through the ages, was the unauthorized publication of works originally produced by another house, often against the author's wishes. [...] Usually, Curll stayed just across the legal line from piracy, but not always. [...] In 1707, Curll announced in the newspapers {{that he was going to}} publish Poems on Several Occasions by Matthew Prior. [...] Jacob Tonson had the sole rights to Prior's works, but Curll published anyway. [...] In 1716, Curll again announced his intent to publish Matthew Prior's works, and Prior himself wrote letters of protest to the newspapers. [...] The quarrel with Tonson, and Prior's objections, only served as publicity, however, and Curll published the book anyway. [...] In 1710, he printed up Jonathan Swift's Meditation Upon a Broomstick. [...] He also that year wrote a [...] "key" [...] to other Swift works, and in 1713 he produced a key to A Tale of a Tub. [...] Swift was angry at Curll for revealing his authorship of the works (as Swift was ascending in the Church of England), but he was also amused at the dullness of Curll's explication of his works. [...] He wrote to Alexander Pope that dunces like Curll were tools for a satirist, that they were valuable in their way. [...] Having gotten <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> sapping Swift, Curll did not relent, especially after Swift incorporated Curll's notes (without permission) into the apparatus of A Tale of a Tub. [...] In 1726, Curll produced a wildly inaccurate [...] "key" [...] to Swift's Gulliver's Travels. [...] Another alleged case of unauthorized publication came with the poet Edward Young, who sent a poem to Curll for publication, with a letter of solicitation. [...] When the poem was published in 1717, Young took out an ad claiming that the poem and letter were forgeries. [...] In fact, the poem was in praise of a politician who had lost place, and Young's letter was authentic.|$|E
