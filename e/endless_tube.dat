40|$|Assembly devices {{fitted with}} {{industrial}} robots for assembling tubes are known. The robots handle individual tube parts; in a further work step, fittings are mounted onto the assembled tube parts and secured. With the new tube assembly device, the tube will be automatically assembled in one work step and secured in its position. Since a magazine for fittings is integrated {{in the assembly}} device, and the tube {{in the form of}} an <b>endless</b> <b>tube</b> is fed to the gripper jaws of the assembly device and can be separated at the required length by means of a separating device, the tube can be fully assembled in one work step by one single tool. As a result, the tube connection can be simply positioned and secured in its position without difficulty. This step is performed fully automatically by one single tool after the tube jointing process. The tube assembly device is used for automatic assembly of unshaped, endless tubes without a branch...|$|E
60|$|Rising up in {{the center}} of the chamber was a squat metal cylinder, a great ugly cone of dark gray. Technicians circled around it, wiring up the exposed relay banks. Reinhart caught a glimpse of <b>endless</b> <b>tubes</b> and filaments, a maze of wires and {{terminals}} and parts criss-crossing each other, layer on layer.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} cyclic {{peptides}} self assembling as <b>endless</b> supramolecular <b>tubes</b> through H bonds and Van der Waals contacts will be described. We will then discuss their synthesis {{that require the}} preparation of new insaturated amino-acids. We will finally describe the resulting amazing supramolecular objects obtained through isotropic and anisotropic crystallization conditions. Molecular modeling calculations will be also presented to hel...|$|R
