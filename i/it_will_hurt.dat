500|$|Levinson {{proposes that}} {{citizenship}} education {{can provide the}} [...] "cultural coherence" [...] that may be missing from a [...] "detached" [...] schoolâ€”which would be a diverse community that prioritizes [...] "critical thinking, tolerance, and reflectiveness". She argues for a constitutional mandate to establish the [...] "autonomy-promoting aim of education" [...] regardless of public support, and asks for a [...] "culture change". Levinson distinguishes between parental and child rights, as laws exist for parents who do not act in their children's best interests. She adds that children are limited by the restricted scope of their parents' knowledge, and that the state should intervene to combat this small-mindedness {{in the interests of}} children. Specifically, she cites Christian criticism of curricular neutrality as a tactic to justify the imposition of their own [...] "limited and restrictive" [...] worldview, and that external knowledge increases the odds of their children not adopting their worldview. Her argument is that the limited worldviews resulting from [...] "excessive paternalism" [...] consequently stunt children's ability to develop adult autonomy or make rational decisions. Thus, state and parental paternalism should be limited where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>hurt</b> individual [...] "capacity for autonomy".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, a {{few months}} after the couple's second wedding, the writers {{complicated}} JR and Babe's relationship by having JR try to kill Babe due to a mental breakdown and the belief that he would be saving their son. Not wanting Babe to unjustly die later in life and cause their son the same pain that he went through by losing mother Dixie, or the pain caused by lies, JR reasons that if their son were to lose Babe at an earlier age as opposed to later in life, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>hurt</b> less due to significantly faded memories. In addition, JR was written to fear Babe targeting their son by running away with him and leaving JR without a wife and a child. JR's murder attempt on Babe was a controversial story arc by the writers (see below), further agitated by Babe's willingness to stand by JR even after the murder attempt, later welcome him into her bed, and stand up for him at his attempted murder trial. JR having accidentally harmed best friend Kendall Hart Slater, who subsequently became comatose as a result of the murder attempt, was also ill-received as viewers felt the character should receive jail time. The writers saw the story arc as an opportunity to further the theme of JR and Babe being true loves. To assist this, ABC ran promotional commercials to the original version of the song [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] of Babe voicing heartbreak at knowing JR tried to kill her interspersed with the couple enduring it all.|$|E
