40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between momentum profitability and the stock <b>market</b> <b>trading</b> <b>mechanism</b> and is motivated by recent changes to the trading systems that have taken place on the London Stock Exchange. Since 1975 the London stock market has employed three different trading systems: a floor based system, a computerized dealer system called SEAQ and the automated auction system SETS. Since each new trading system has reduced the level of execution costs, one might expect, a priori, the magnitude of momentum profits to decline with each amendment to the trading system. However, the opposite empirical result is found showing that shares trading on the automated system generate higher momentum profits than those trading on the floor system and companies trading on the SETS system display greater momentum profitability than those trading on SEAQ.

40|$|In {{traditional}} growth theory, {{the terms}} of trade are important growth factors. However, the new exported growth hypothesis suggests that shifting from resource to innovation rents via the free <b>market</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mechanism</b> accelerates growth. Given its revealed comparative advantages in natural resources, Namibia is attempting to apply World Bank, and UNIDO new growth criteria to stimulate economic growth. This research analyzes Namibia's data from 1968 - 1992, estimates the impacts and tests the significance of resources, technology, and mineral exports in economic growth. It assumes variable elasticity of substitution (VES) production technologies in which capital, labor, and land inputs can be disaggregated and hypotheses concerning scale, complementary and substitute inputs can be examined. A disaggregated examination of traded and nontraded sectors is employed over two sub-periods: 1968 - 1980, and 1981 - 1992. The analysis confirms the importance of mineral exports to the economy but finds no discernible sign of accelerated growth {{as a function of}} the shifting structure and the new growth criteria. The attempt to shift from resource rents in the early period to an industrial emphasis in the later period fails to accelerate Namibia's growth. Global constant returns to scale pre- 1980, and diminishing returns to scale post- 1980 obtain. The switch from complementary and flexible substitute inputs pre- 1980 to rigid substitutes post- 1980 suggests technical inefficiencies. The vent-for-surplus nature of the mineral subsector is supported; but attempts to industrialize via manufacturing are not vindicated, and the surplus arising pre- 1980 dissapates post- 1980, as evidenced by the low or negative factor productivities and technical change. The result is that neither the expected growth nor acceleration in technical change patterns are observed. Policies seem to have discouraged investment in the traded resource sectors such that structural changes expanded the low productivity nontraded service sectors. Namibia is a vent-for-surplus example in which resource rents do not sustain early economic growth, and attempts to shift to innovation rents fail to stimulate growth. Given the paucity of data, Namibia's case confirms that export surpluses from resources may be a necessary element, but not a sufficient condition, for sustainable growth...|$|R

40|$|In empirically {{deriving}} risk-neutral densities (RNDs) from option prices, {{one of the}} {{key assumptions}} that the strike prices should be continuous over the entire spectrum of nonnegative real numbers, is not met due to <b>market</b> <b>trading</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This study looks at how this failure affects the empirical RND. It also tests the possible impact that bid-ask spread has on the empirical RNDs. With Heston (1993) option pricing model of stochastic volatility as a mapping tool between option prices and risk-neutral price distributions and realistic assumptions of option specifications, simulation results show that RNDs are less stable and reliable when there are a limited number of different strike prices, even less so when bid-ask spread is incorporated into option prices. Nontechnical Summary Future risk-neutral asset price distributions can be derived from traded options that are written on the asset. In the empirical derivation of these risk-neutral densities (RNDs), some microstructure issues have to be considered. This study looks into the effect of two such issues on the empirical RNDs, the discrete and limited range of exercise prices and the existence of bid-ask spread. The study adopts a simulation-and-testing approach. It assumes that the underlying price distribution follows stochastic volatility and uses Heston's stochastic volatility model for European options as the pricing framework. With specified structural parameters for the Heston model and option specifications, including the current underlying asset price, the time to maturity, the interest rate, it simulates option prices first and tries to infer the assumed asset distribution with different subset of the option prices corresponding to varying number and level of exercise prices. When comparing the original assume RNDs with the empirical RNDs from a subset, we {{are in a position to}} detect the influence that discrete and limited range of exercise prices have on the empirical RNDs. Test statistics suggest that RNDs from the lower end of exercise prices deviate most from the original price distribution, especially in the tails. We then perturb the option prices with bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread is estimated from a model, in which the spread is explained by option characteristics and underlying asset market activities. Statistical tests show that when the bid-ask spread is incorporated into option prices, the derived risk-neutral densities are even less accurate and stable. Therefore, great caution is needed when the empirical densities are used for pricing derivatives, asset market sentiments and so on. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{competition}} between Island and Nasdaq {{at the beginning}} of the century offers a natural laboratory to study {{competition between}} and within trading platforms and its consequences for liquidity supply. Our empirical strategy takes advantage of the difference between the pricing grids used on Island and Nasdaq, as well as of the decline in the Nasdaq tick. Using the finer grid prevailing on their market, Island limit order traders undercut Nasdaq quotes, much more than they undercut one another. The drop in the Nasdaq tick size triggered a drop in Island spreads, despite the Island tick already being very thin before Nasdaq decimalization. We also estimate a structural model of liquidity supply and find that Island limit order traders earned rents before Nasdaq decimalization. Our results suggest that perfect competition cannot be taken for granted, even on transparent open limit order books with a very thin pricing grid. competition in financial <b>markets,</b> liquidity supply, <b>trading</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> different tick sizes...|$|R

Customers are satisfied with {{the current state of the}} LSE market, but member firms are pricing institutional brokerage and market making services below economic cost. The LSE's position will be significantly damaged when the effective subsidy ends, and commissions and dealing spreads reflect the costs incurred by members firms.

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely held view of the Crash of 1987 is the Cascade Theory: the Crash emerged from the {{interaction}} of stock prices with new financial strategies such as program trading and portfolio insurance, which use new financial instruments including stock index options and futures. According to this view, a decline in stock prices initiated by fundamental factors led to an overreaction in stock index futures prices, due largely to portfolio insurance. This, in turn, created a negative spread between stock prices and futures prices, hence encouraging a further decline in stock prices through index arbitrage. In short, a moderate decline exploded into a severe Crash because {{of the existence of}} new financial instruments.; This article concludes that while the reasons for the Crash are complex and cannot be disentangled, the markets for new financial instruments performed correctly during the Crash. The market that failed was the stock <b>market</b> itself. <b>Trading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were not able to deal with the flood of selling orders, and the long delays in information about the actual prices at which stocks were trading created "stale prices," which were the primary reason for the large discount that emerged in stock index futures. These discounts acted as a signal for further sales, thereby creating pressures for further stock price declines.

It is argued that these are not likely to {{have a significant effect on}} the potential for crashes, and that they have the potential to exacerbate the problem. Stock market...|$|R
40|$|This study {{intends to}} {{investigate}} the momentum effect, which states that shares which performed the best (worst) over the previous three to twelve months continue to perform well (poorly) over the subsequent three to twelve months. Evidence suggests that a strategy that buys previous winner shares and sells short past loser stocks can generate abnormal profitability of about 1 per cent per month (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993). Although momentum payoffs tend to persist when share returns in international markets are employed (e. g., Griffin et al., 2003, Rouwenhorst, 1998), {{a significant number of}} studies have debated the potential explanation of the momentum effect without reaching a consensus. Using data from the London Stock Exchange from January 1975 to October 2001, this thesis investigates some factors that influence the magnitude of continuation gains that have not been previously identified. I examine the relationship between momentum profitability and the stock <b>market</b> <b>trading</b> <b>mechanism</b> and is motivated by recent changes to the trading systems that have taken place on the London Stock Exchange. Since 1975 the London stock market has employed three different trading systems: a floor based system, a computerised dealer system called SEAQ and the automated auction system SETS. I find that after the introduction of the computerised dealer system SEAQ momentum profits are higher than when the floor based system operated. I also document that companies trading on the SETS auction system display greater momentum profitability than shares trading on SEAQ. Results are robust to the use of different samples and alternative risk adjustments. I investigate the role of volatility in influencing momentum profits. Shares with high volatility display wide spread out returns and therefore, potential higher magnitude momentum profitability. Given that shares displayed higher volatility traded on the post-Big Bang period (Tonks and Webb, 1991) and on the SETS system (Chelley-Steeley, 2003), I examine whether the different levels of momentum profitability achieved in alternative stock market structures arises from volatility. I find that momentum profits are strongly influenced by volatility, but the finding that the organisation of a stock market influences the momentum profits holds even after considering differences in volatility. I examine whether the magnitude of momentum profitability varies following bull and bear markets. Momentum profits stem from the winner shares in bull markets and from the loser stocks in bear markets. I report that momentum profits are stronger following bear markets, showing a sign of mean reversion in the UK stock market. Overall, this study contradicts the model of Hong and Stein (1999) that the momentum effect arises from the gradual expansion of information among investors and the model of Daniel et al, (1998) that the momentum effect stems from the investors' overconfidence that increases following the arrival of confirming news. This study also indicates that a significant portion of momentum profits stem from the magnitude of volatility. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the short-run return and volatility spill-overs across three major international copper futures markets: London Metal Exchange (LME), New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE). Design/methodology/approach – The analysis utilizes a dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model to explore the return and volatility relationships. Findings – The return and volatility spill-overs between the two developed markets, LME and NYMEX, are bi-directional and significantly stronger when the NYMEX operates an electronic trading system. In addition, significant bi-directional return spill-over between the LME (developed market) and the SHFE (emerging market) and significant uni-directional volatility spill-over from the LME to the SHFE are documented. Research limitations/implications – The evidence suggests that degree of <b>market</b> integration and <b>trading</b> <b>mechanism</b> play crucial roles in the return and volatility transmission across the three major copper futures markets. Higher level of market integration and easy access to trading information lead to faster information dissemination and help to establish stronger relationships of returns and volatility across the markets.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results from an Investigation, using Organisational Ecology based techniques, into the impact of public energy policy and renewables technologies on the Electricity Generators since the industry’s privatisation in 1991. At the outset, the research goal was to understand how successive UK Governments’ energy policies could use an inferential data based approach, to enable a long-range evaluation {{of the factors that}} define energy policy and the results arising from energy policy interventions. Research and detailed investigation covered the following topics. Firstly, policy instruments, policy definition, policy formulation, policy modelling and evaluation, and the associated competition and regulatory frameworks. Secondly, the electricity sector in the UK over the period from {{the development and implementation of}} the first systems and networks in the late 1800 s, to the business and technical frameworks currently used for UK electricity generation, transmission, distribution and supply. Then, the technological context of the study required an in-depth understanding of energy basics, traditional and renewable electricity generation techniques, emissions control, <b>market</b> <b>trading</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> environmental-based climate change, emissions trading systems and standards. Finally, understanding the academic research methods and techniques, making the selection of the most appropriate investigative theories, techniques and methods that underpinned the execution of a long-range population based study covering twenty years. Once the above had been understood, the research concentrated upon the collection, of: circa 8, 000 generator company vital events, 2, 000 vital events for circa 570 power plants, electricity generation cost data, EU and UK government policy and legislation, policy, macro and micro financial subsidies and incentives, macroeconomic data, UK emissions data, fuel costs, and fuel usage by the UK’s Generators. The choice of the most appropriate methods and techniques utilised for the data analysis was one of the most difficult aspects of the study, but given the nature of the data, the use of organisational ecology-based theory fragments and the field’s core methods and techniques were utilised. What sets organisational ecology apart from many social science approaches, and the reason for it becoming one of the central fields in organizational studies, is the empirical quantitative approach, which uses large-scale, longitudinal focused data collections that record the vital events surrounding corporate demography. This coupled with primary data analysis based upon the use of survival statistics differentiates the technique from most others in the social sciences. Once the theoretical baseline had been determined, it was necessary to prepare the research questions, develop the proposed theories, and develop the hypotheses to conduct the detailed research. The core research constructs adopted were: energy policy objectives and policy instrument evaluation, assessment of how market competition has been impacted by energy policy and renewables technologies and lastly determining how market competition in the electricity industry was impacted by energy policy and renewables technology. The thesis concludes with a discussion of how the research: makes a contribution to theory, makes a contribution to academic practice, makes a contribution to business practice, makes a contribution to my own work, identifies areas for further research, discusses my reflective thoughts on the doctoral journey, and finally presents my own thoughts and evaluation of the work. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of market {{microstructure}} analysis are processes through which investor activities are transferred to quantities and prices. This direction indicates the fact that has been unjustifiably neglected in fundamental theories – foreign exchange rate results from the interactions between market participants. Spot foreign exchange market {{can best be described}} as a decentralised market with a number of dealers. There is no organised physical place (stock exchange) where dealers meet their clients nor is there an electronic system which enables quotations of all dealers in a currency market to be simultaneously shown on the screen. The theory of order flows has resulted from the answer to the essential question of <b>market</b> microstructure: do <b>trading</b> <b>mechanisms</b> affect the price formation process of the trading subject, and how do they affect it. Information is scattered and not available to all subjects in an aggregate form, which is the consequence of a decentralised structure, lack of regulations and nontransparent trading on the foreign exchange market. In such a setting, market participants are incessantly aggregating signals based on scattered information, and no sooner than collective orders for foreign currency sales and purchases are formed do they build into the foreign exchange rate in the process of new information trading. are a good explanation for changes in the foreign exchange rate. Several studies have shown that order flows...|$|R
