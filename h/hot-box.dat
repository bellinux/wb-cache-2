40|$|Abstract — Delayed coke drums are {{operated}} under severe conditions of cyclic heating and forced cooling that apply repetitive thermal stresses to the drum {{walls and the}} skirt. Since thermal cycling is most severe {{near the bottom of}} the coke drum, where temperatures can reach up to 1000 °F, the skirt and other attachment welds are just as prone to cracking and premature structural failure as the vessel wall. The purpose is to determine a skirt / “Hot-box ” junction geometry which will minimize thermal gradient stresses and improve fatigue life. The process flow of coke drum along with the temperature gradient due to coking process and the effect of thermal stresses on the skirt shell junction / <b>hot-box</b> using finite element model. In present project work comparative analysis of hot box is done by analytical, FEA using ANSYS 13. Study demonstrates that by modifying the dimensions of the hot box such as length, will affects the fatigue life of coke drum. This appears to be due to the longer <b>hot-box</b> length, which results in a more gradual thermal gradient and also moves the gradient lower on the skirt away from the welded connection...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the additional mechanical reclamation applied after the heat processing of the waste core mass obtained from the cores produced in <b>hot-box</b> technology. It was important to undertake the research because the process of purifying the resins off the grains of the matrix by burning had proved to be unsatisfactory. That is why, after a particular number of cycles of thermal reclamation, a mechanical reclamation was additionally applied. The aim of the action was to remove the potential impurities and the remains of the combustion products {{from the surface of the}} grains and restoring the parameters of the matrix close to the initial ones. The strength of the cores obtained from the reclaimed material after thermal reclamation was compared to that after the additional mechanical reclamation. It was found that mechanical reclamation applied additionally after the thermal one proved to be fully justified. In all analysed cases the application of the combined reclamation of core masses in <b>hot-box</b> technology led to receiving better strength qualities. It was observed that the intensity of the use of mechanical reclamation should depend on the kind of a resin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project was {{to get more information}} about the influence of wind pressure on the heat transmission through timber frame con-structions and to establish a recommended limit for air permeance of wind barriers. * The project was divided into three parts: wind pressure measurements on a rotatable test house, <b>hot-box</b> measurements on a wall, and calculations. The theoretical studies as well as the experimental investigations in the <b>hot-box,</b> have been restricted to one specific type of forced convection in the thermal insulation, the interchange of air be-tween the insulation and the air gap between the wind barrier and the outer cladding. The results of the project show the importance of protecting the insulation layer with a wind barrier to achieve full effect of the insulation in wind exposed constructions. The measurements indicate that heat loss caused by this type of forced convection can be three to ten times higher than calculated for ideal constructions. Based on the measurements carried out in this project, Norwegian Building Research Institute, NBI, is recommending an upper limit for the air permeance of wind barriers, includ-ing joints, of 0. 05 m 3 /m 2 h Pa (1. 4 E- 5 m 3 /m 2 s Pa). 1...|$|E

No significant difference in the yield between tall stills with light-absorptive versus light reflective interior siding was found.

40|$|Summary A rig {{has been}} {{designed}} and constructed to measure the thermal transmittance (U-value) and conductance of test walls 2 m by 2 m in area. The rig is of the guarded <b>hot-box</b> type and is based in principle on details given in the ASTM C 236 - 66 standard.

The guard system is automatic and controlled from the output of a thermopile on the metering box walls. Fans are used to circulate the air in the metering box and the heat contribution from the fan blades is taken into account in the measurement. Validation tests have been made using a glass fibre panel and the results agree very closely with the calculated thermal transmittance and conductance.

40|$|Abstract. Draft CEN (and ISO) {{standards}} for <b>hot-box</b> U value measurements of windows and insulated glazing units require calibration measurements {{to be carried}} out with glazed calibration panels of known thermal conductance. This panel design has been validated by five European partner laboratories (under the leadership of theNational Physical Laboratory,Middlesex,UK) which each made panels to an agreed specification and carried out the calibration procedures specified in prEN 12412 - 1. The panels were then circulated to the other partner laboratories who measured their thermal transmittance, U, values using the CEN procedure. The work demonstrated that the uncertainty of the subsequent U value measurements made by the calibration data were within 7 %. The sensitivity of the CEN measurement procedures to the calculated conductance and temperature measurement accuracy is discussed and some improvements are suggested for the draft standards. The experience gained from the comparison on the calibration panels provides the chance to establish improved measurement as well as calibration procedures. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{concrete}} wall externally insulated with six expanded polystyrene boards, each containing three vacuum insulation panels, was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The main {{goal of this}} study was to determine the thermal performance of vacuum-insulation panels applied to walls in building constructions. Comparisons were made with conventional insulation and also with systems including damaged, i. e., vented vacuum panels. Since the vacuum insulation panels are encased in a metallized laminates as barriers against permeation of moisture and gas, special attention was given to the edge effects. Stepwise adjustment of the measured and calculated results reported here provide a general assessment of the efficacy of this insulation system applied on different wall materials. A functional representation of the measured data, for steady-state conditions, is introduced. Moreover, infrared thermography was used to confirm the three dimensionally calculated temperature distributions on the surface. The present investigation was part of the research programme "High Performance Thermal Insulation in Buildings and Building Systems" of the international energy agency (IEA).

In this view, the paper presents the multipurpose experimental thermo-acoustic characterization of common reed-based building panels. Different geometries, densities, humidity rates and stalk shapes were considered and tested {{by means of}} hot-plate, <b>hot-box</b> and impedance tube in-lab experimental benches. The thermal analysis showed that the geometry scarcely affects the thermal conductivity, which is around 0. 05 W/mK and, therefore, comparable to other materials already commercialized for the same scope. On the other hand, the acoustic behavior is strongly affected by the stalk configuration, e. g. perpendicular, parallel or combined orientation {{with respect to the}} incident wave. In particular, the longitudinal stalk layout showed a significant sound ​absorption performance. The exhaustive experimental original characterization of such by-product, therefore, showed a very promising overall thermo-acoustic behavior.

Amount of binder, curing time and shooting pressure also play an important role. Superplasticizer and / or release agents were used to facilitate the shooting process and the core / part removal. Not all recipes appeared to produce aerogel parts successfully. Only through the adjustments of the experimental conditions stable cores and parts of aerogel could be produced.
