5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same point in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|Despite all the improvements, serious {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} 1999 when {{the bank of}} the drain was breached near Pinchbeck. Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded, and a review of the flood defences was then carried out. The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding for the work was not available, and so no work was <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

5|$|A quintuple-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in all five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—-in a single game. There are only two known quintuple-doubles, both only <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> high-school level. The first was recorded by Tamika Catchings of Duncanville High School (Duncanville, Texas) with 25points, 18rebounds, 11assists, 10steals and 10blocks in 1997. The second was by Aimee Oertner of Northern Lehigh High School (Slatington, Pennsylvania), who had 26 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and 11 blocks on January 7, 2012.|$|E

5|$|After a {{difficult}} start, Leech improved in her second year. At the Victorian Championships, she showed her potential by setting a state record of 17.4 seconds (s) for the 25-yard freestyle in the under-8 division. The following year, she covered 25 yards in 15.7 seconds, three seconds faster than Davies had <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same age. She progressed steadily, sweeping the state age titles from nine to 13, setting records that were often faster than those by boys {{of the same}} age.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E
5|$|During their {{fighting}} retreat up the Rhône, the Germans also withdrew {{their remaining}} forces from their garrisons in south-western France. These divisions raced {{north along the}} Atlantic coast and then swung towards the east at the Loire to link up {{with the rest of}} Army GroupG at Burgundy. While {{they did not have to}} fight the Western Allies as much as the Germans had <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Rhône, they still had to advance through French partisan-dominated terrain. About 88,000 men moved north, leaving 20,000 in south-western France behind. During the retreat, about 19,000 men were captured by the Allies and 60,000 men reached Army GroupG's line, where they were integrated into the defense of the Vosges mountains.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces invaded neutral Belgium {{without a}} formal {{declaration}} of war. Leopold headed immediately to Fort Breendonk, {{the headquarters of}} the Belgian army near Mechelen, {{to take control of the}} army. He refused to address the Belgian parliament beforehand, as Albert I had famously <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of World War I. The speed of the German advance, using the new Blitzkrieg approach, soon pushed the Belgian army westwards despite British and French support. On 16 May, the Belgian government left Brussels.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1909, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{decommissioned}} {{and assigned}} to the Reserve Division in the Baltic Sea. By that time, the new dreadnought battleships, which rendered Kaiser Barbarossa and her sister ships thoroughly obsolete, were beginning to come into service with the fleet. In early 1910, Kaiser Barbarossa was {{assigned to the}} Training Squadron, which operated in the Baltic in April. She was reactivated to participate in the autumn maneuvers that year in the provisional III Squadron; after the conclusion of the exercises on 10 September, she was placed back in reserve. More modernization work was <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel. From 31 July to 15 September, she was reactivated again {{to take part in the}} autumn maneuvers in the III Squadron. She thereafter returned to the Reserve Division in early 1912.|$|E
5|$|Telephone {{services}} reached Whitemore in 1918, initially {{with only}} three subscribers. Telephone switching was <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> post office. Whitemore {{was connected to the}} State's electricity system in 1929. The electricity was fed from the Hydro-Electric scheme and was connected to twelve buildings, in Whitemore and several nearby farms, by August of the same year. There may have been blacksmiths in Whitemore from the mid-19th century. A blacksmith established a shop on the main road in 1895 that was, by 1900, the only blacksmith in the area. Shaw Contracting's office is on the site of this former blacksmith's shop.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if that could be <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so much the better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E
5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
