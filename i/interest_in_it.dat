5|$|Before {{researchers}} took active <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> {{the field}} of 17th-century British song had not been investigated. Music historian Charles Burney had a negative opinion towards British vocal music in this period. That attitude was carried through {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, where in the first edition of the Oxford History of Music, Hubert Parry stated that English composers' sense of musical line was deficient.|$|E
5|$|John Muir wrote {{articles}} popularizing {{the area}} and increasing scientific <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Muir {{was one of the}} first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite Valley were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur. Muir wrote scientific papers on the area's biology. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted emphasized the importance of conservation of Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky {{graduated}} from The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School in 1987 {{with a degree}} in mathematical engineering and computer technology. His <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>IT</b> security began when his work computer was infected with the Cascade virus in 1989 and he developed a program to remove it. Kaspersky helped grow Kaspersky Lab through security research and salesmanship. He became the CEO in 2007 and remains so as of 2017.|$|E

5|$|Kaspersky's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>IT</b> {{security}} {{began in}} 1989, when his PC was infected by the Cascade virus, {{while working for}} the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E
5|$|After George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller raised $1million {{dollars to}} buy the Times, along with other fellow editors at the newspaper, {{printing}} it under the New York Times Publishing Company. However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the Panic of 1893. By 1896, The New York Times had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day when controlling <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> was gained by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the Chattanooga Times for $75,000.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. Her work was all but forgotten {{for a long period}} of time, but <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E

30|$|Well, I {{became aware}} and {{concerned}} about environmental issues fifteen years ago (…) I was working in a bank that the current financial economic system, if you like, is clearly incompatible with environmental protection or, you know, preventing environmental harm and, so I became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> And I did it for the Master’s degree in the balances of economics on the environmental policy in the economics (…) So I just, you know, got more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> (Interviewee 6).|$|R
5|$|From 1898, the {{newspapers}} that had encouraged so many {{to travel to}} the Klondike lost <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> In the summer of 1899, gold was discovered around Nome in west Alaska, and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of the rush. The boom towns declined and the population of Dawson City fell. Gold mining activity lasted until 1903 when production peaked after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{his arrival in}} California in March 1868, naturalist John Muir {{set out for the}} Yosemite area, where he found work tending to the sheep owned by a local rancher, Pat Delaney. Muir's employment provided him with the opportunity to study the area's plants, rocks, and animals; the articles and scientific papers he wrote describing his observations helped to popularize the area and to increase scientific <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Muir {{was one of the first}} to suggest that Yosemite Valley's major landforms were created by large alpine glaciers, contradicting the view of established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur.|$|E
5|$|In September 1958, Tintin {{magazine}} {{moved its}} headquarters to a newly constructed building near the Gare du Midi. Hergé continued to feud with Leblanc over {{the direction of}} the magazine; his constant absences had led to him being replaced as artistic director, and he demanded that he be reinstated. Leblanc relented in early 1965, although Hergé soon departed to Sardinia for six weeks. In October 1965 Leblanc appointed the cartoonist Greg to be editor-in-chief of the magazine, believing him capable of reforming the paper to remain relevant to the youth of the day. By this point, Tintin magazine was at its commercial peak, with sales of 600,000 a week, although Hergé had lost much of his <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Jo Elizabeth Stafford {{was born}} in Coalinga, California, in 1917, to Grover Cleveland Stafford and Anna Stafford (née York)a second cousin of World War I hero Sergeant Alvin York. She was the third of four children. Both her parents enjoyed singing and sharing music with their family. Stafford's father hoped {{for success in the}} California oil fields when he moved his family from Gainesboro, Tennessee, but worked in a {{succession}} of unrelated jobs. Her mother was an accomplished banjo player, playing and singing many of the folk songs which influenced Stafford's later career. Anna insisted that her children should take piano lessons, but Jo was the only one among her sisters who took a keen <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> and through this she learned to read music.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon III, {{who had a}} great {{admiration for}} all things Roman, visited the Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> He {{approved}} plans by the architect Charles Laisné to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855–58, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct. Stairs were installed {{at one end and}} the conduit walls were repaired, allowing visitors to walk along the conduit itself in reasonable safety.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E

5|$|Set reports dated April 2012 {{recorded}} that scenes {{would be}} set on Hashima Island, an abandoned {{island off the coast}} of Nagasaki, Japan. In actuality, the scene was set on an unnamed island off the coast of Macau, though based on the real-life Hashima. Sam Mendes explained that the location was a hybrid of a set and computer-generated images. Production chose to include the Hashima model after Daniel Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad whilst shooting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Stockholm. Nordanstad, who produced a short documentary on Hashima Island in 2002 entitled Hashima, recalled Craig taking extensive notes on the island {{at the time of the}} meeting, but was unaware of his <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> until Skyfall was released.|$|E
5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is {{a notorious}} antisemitic {{literary}} forgery, probably written {{under the direction}} of the Russian secret police in Paris, that purported to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination. It was exposed as a work of fiction in 1920 by Lucien Wolf and the following year by Philip Graves in The Times. Once exposed, it disappeared from mainstream discourse, Barkun writes, until <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s. Its use was spread further by conspiracy groups on the internet.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Belgrano was {{appointed}} as {{captain of the}} urban militias in 1797 by viceroy Pedro de Melo, who was instructed by Spain to prepare defences against a possible British or Portuguese attack. Belgrano by then worked in the Consulate, and was no longer interested in pursuing a military career. Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte requested that he create a militia to counter a possible British attack, {{but he did not}} take <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> His first intervention in a military conflict took place when the British, under William Carr Beresford, arrived with 1,600 men and took Buenos Aires, starting the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. Belgrano moved to the fortress as soon as he heard the warning, and gathered many men to launch resistance. But without the required knowledge, his men marched in disorder and Belgrano was ordered to disband after a single British cannon shot. Belgrano would write later in his autobiography that he regretted not having by then even the most basic knowledge of militia work.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of {{the writing}} system was lost, {{probably}} {{by the end of}} the 16th century. Renewed <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> was sparked by published accounts of ruined Maya sites in the 19th century.|$|E
