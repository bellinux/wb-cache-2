50|$|Draught for <b>firetube</b> <b>boilers,</b> {{particularly}} in marine applications, is usually {{provided by a}} tall smokestack. In all steam locomotives since Stephenson's Rocket, additional draught is supplied by directing exhaust steam from the cylinders into the smokestack through a blastpipe, to provide a partial vacuum. Modern industrial boilers use fans to provide forced or induced draughting of the boiler.|$|E
50|$|In a Stephensonian {{firetube}} locomotive boiler, this entails routing the {{saturated steam}} through small diameter pipes suspended inside large diameter firetubes {{putting them in}} contact with the hot gases exiting the firebox; the saturated steam flows backwards from the wet header towards the firebox, then forwards again to the dry header. Superheating only began to be generally adopted for locomotives around the year 1900 due to problems of overheating of and lubrication of the moving parts in the cylinders and steam chests.Many <b>firetube</b> <b>boilers</b> heat water until it boils, and then the steam is used at saturation temperature in other words the temperature of the boiling point of water at a given pressure (saturated steam); this still contains a large proportion of water in suspension. Saturated steam can and has been directly used by an engine, but as the suspended water cannot expand and do work and work implies temperature drop, much of the working fluid is wasted along with the fuel expended to produce it.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the best-known}} names in model {{engineering}} are of those who wrote prolifically in the model engineering press. Henry Greenly {{may be the first}} notable model engineer, being founding editor of Model Railways and Locomotives Magazine in 1902 and author of Model Engineering and related books. Greenly produced a number of designs for spirit-fuelled model locomotives, which however could not haul passengers. Arguably the most notable model engineer of all was the obscure 'LBSC' (Lillian [...] "Curly" [...] Lawrence). His most significant contribution was to overturn Greenly's prevailing orthodoxy and demonstrate that model locomotives of even small gauge (2½") could be powerful enough to haul passengers, by using miniature coal-fired <b>firetube</b> <b>boilers,</b> as were used in full-size locomotives. From 1923 until his death in 1967 he popularized passenger-hauling miniature live steam locomotives that could be built with minimal equipment, by publishing over 50 locomotive designs in various gauges, serialized mostly in Model Engineer magazine.|$|E

40|$|A steam energy {{tip sheet}} for the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO). The {{prevention}} of scale formation in <b>firetube</b> <b>boilers</b> {{can result in}} substantial energy savings. Scale deposits occur when calcium, magnesium, and silica, commonly found in most water supplies, react to form a continuous layer of material on the waterside of the boiler heat exchange tubes. Scale creates a problem because it typically possesses a thermal conductivity, {{an order of magnitude}} less than the corresponding value for bare steel. Even thin layers of scale serve as an effective insulator and retard heat transfer. The result is overheating of boiler tube metal, tube failures, and loss of energy efficiency. Fuel consumption may increase by up to 5 % in <b>firetube</b> <b>boilers</b> because of scale. The boilers steam production may be reduced if the firing rate cannot be increased to compensate for the decrease in combustion efficiency. Energy losses as a function of scale thickness and composition are given. Any scale in a boiler is undesirable. The {{best way to deal with}} scale is not to let it form in the first place. Prevent scale formation by: (1) Pretreating of boiler makeup water (using water softeners, demineralizers, and reverse osmosis to remove scale-forming minerals); (2) Injecting chemicals into the boiler feedwater; and (3) Adopting proper boiler blowdown practices...|$|E
40|$|Gas Technology Institute (GTI) and Cleaver-Brooks {{developed}} a new gas-fired steam generation systemÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe Super BoilerÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂfor increased energy efficiency, reduced equipment size, and reduced emissions. The system consists of a firetube boiler with a unique staged furnace design, a two-stage burner system with engineered internal recirculation and inter-stage cooling integral to the boiler, unique convective pass design with extended internal surfaces for enhanced heat transfer, and a novel integrated heat recovery system to extract maximum energy from the flue gas. With these combined innovations, the Super Boiler technical goals were set at 94 % HHV fuel efficiency, operation on natural gas with < 5 ppmv NOx (referenced to 3 %O 2), and 50 % smaller than conventional boilers of similar steam output. To demonstrate these technical goals, the project culminated in the industrial demonstration of this new high-efficiency technology on a 300 HP boiler at Clement Pappas, a juice bottler located in Ontario, California. The Super Boiler combustion system is based on two stage combustion which combines air staging, internal flue gas recirculation, inter-stage cooling, and unique fuel-air mixing technology to achieve low emissions rather than external flue gas recirculation which is most commonly used today. The two-stage combustion provides lower emissions because of the integrated design of the boiler and combustion system which permit precise control of peak flame temperatures in both primary and secondary stages of combustion. To reduce equipment size, the Super Boiler's dual furnace design increases radiant heat transfer to the furnace walls, allowing shorter overall furnace length, and also employs convective tubes with extended surfaces that increase heat transfer by up to 18 -fold compared to conventional bare tubes. In this way, a two-pass boiler can achieve the same efficiency as a traditional three or four-pass firetube boiler design. The Super Boiler is consequently up to 50 % smaller in footprint, has a smaller diameter, and is up to 50 % lower in weight, resulting in very compact design with reduced material cost and labor costs, while requiring less boiler room floor space. For enhanced energy efficiency, the heat recovery system uses a transport membrane condenser (TMC), a humidifying air heater (HAH), and a split-stage economizer to extract maximum energy from the flue gas. The TMC is a new innovation that pulls {{a major portion of}} water vapor produced by the combustion process from the flue gases along with its sensible and latent heat. This results in nearly 100 % transfer of heat to the boiler feed water. The HAH improves the effectiveness of the TMC, particularly in steam systems that do not have a large amount of cold makeup water. In addition, the HAH humidifies the combustion air to reduce NOx formation. The split-stage economizer preheats boiler feed water {{in the same way as}} a conventional economizer, but extracts more heat by working in tandem with the TMC and HAH to reduce flue gas temperature. These components are designed to work synergistically to achieve energy efficiencies of 92 - 94 % which is 10 - 15 % higher than todayÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs typical <b>firetube</b> <b>boilers...</b>|$|E

50|$|In September 1831, Cooper {{proposed}} building six locomotives {{based upon}} his own {{design for the}} B&O. The railroad agreed to his proposal, but when he failed to deliver on schedule, Cooper sold his patent to the B&O. Davis soon incorporated some of Cooper’s ideas into an improvement on his York design. Aided by Ross Winans, Davis in 1832 constructed a second locomotive {{that proved to be}} far more commercially successful than his first. This was the Atlantic, which employed Cooper's vertical <b>firetube</b> <b>boiler.</b> Built at a cost of $4,500, Atlantic weighed 6.5 ST and had two vertical cylinders. Ox teams were used to convey the engine to Baltimore, where it made a successful inaugural trip to Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, a distance of thirteen miles. Nicknamed Grasshopper for its distinctive vertical pushrods, the locomotive carried 50 pounds of steam (3.45 bar) and burned a ton of anthracite coal on a 40 mi trip from Baltimore. Davis’s 0-4-0 design proved reasonably successful, and 20 such locomotives were constructed at the B&O's Mount Clare Shops. Some operated for more than 60 years, and were finally retired in the 1890s. One was prominently exhibited at the New York World’s Fair in 1939.|$|R
40|$|Emissions {{from two}} biofuels, a soy-based {{biodiesel}} and an animal-based biodiesel, were measured and compared to emissions from a distillate petroleum fuel oil. The three fuels were burned {{in a small}} (3. 5 x 10 6 Btu/hr) <b>firetube</b> <b>boiler</b> designed for use in institutional, commercial, and light industrial applications. Emissions were measured for carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) using continuous emission monitors. Concentrations and size distributions of particulate matter (PM) were also measured. Flue gas samples were collected and analyzed to determine concentrations of aldehydes and other volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The boiler efficiency was also determined for operation using {{each of the three}} fuels. The most significant difference was for PM, where the distillate fuel oil had emissions roughly ten times higher than for either of the two biodiesel fuels. The particle size distributions (measuring particle volume) showed a mode near 1 µm for the two biodiesels and near 2. 5 µm for the distillate fuel oil. All three fuels also had a mode near 20 nm.

50|$|Another major {{advance in}} the Rocket was large numbers of small-diameter <b>firetubes</b> (a multi-tubular <b>boiler)</b> instead of a single large flue.

40|$|For {{a number}} of years, {{especially}} {{since the end of}} World War II, the engineering literature has contained an increasing number of references to forced circulation boilers. Most of these articles extol the virtues of some one kind of boiler or tend to justify the conventional natural circulation principles. The range of boiler types covered by the term "forced circulation" is much broader than usually realized, and since some of these types are basically quite different the existing confusion on this subject is understandable. We comaonly think of the United States as a leader in technological progress and development, and in many fields that is true. There are other fields, however, where from time to time we t^nd to lag. This has been especially so with regards to the application of forced circulation in boilers even though some of the working principles were originally discovered in this country. It is gratifying to note the rapid and accelerating interest which is now being shown towards making up the lost time. In this paper an attempt is made to classify and describe the common types of forced circulation boilers. By comparison with natural circulation principles, advantages and disadvantages are brought out.

50|$|In 1968, renewed {{interest}} was shown, sometimes prompted by newly available techniques. An older idea that was resurrected {{is to use}} a water-tube generator with fire around it, as opposed to using <b>firetubes</b> heating a <b>boiler</b> of water. A prototype car was built by Charles J. & Calvin E. Williams of Ambler, Pennsylvania. Other high-performance steam cars were built by Richard J.Smith of Midway City, California, and A.M. and E. Pritchard of Caulfeld, Australia. Companies/organisations as Controlled Steam Dynamics of Mesa, Arizona, General Motors, Thermo-Electron Corp. of Waltham, Massachusetts, and Kinetics Inc, of Sarasota, Florida all built high-performance steam engines in the same period. Bill Lear also started work on a closed circuit steam turbine to power cars and buses, and built a transit bus and converted a Chevrolet Monte Carlo sedan to use this turbine system. It used a proprietary working fluid dubbed Learium, possibly a chlorofluorocarbon similar to DuPont Freon.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{standard}} steam locomotive <b>firetube</b> type <b>boiler,</b> the firebox {{is surrounded by}} water space on five sides. The bottom of the firebox is open to atmospheric pressure, but covered by fire grates (solid fuel) or a firing pan (liquid fuel). If the engine burns solid fuel, like wood or coal, there is a grate covering most of {{the bottom of the}} firebox to hold the fire. An ashpan, mounted underneath the firebox and below the grates, catches and collects hot embers, ashes, and other solid combustion waste as it falls through the grates. In a coal-burning locomotive, the grates may be shaken to clean dead ash {{from the bottom of the}} fire. They are shaken either manually or (in larger locomotives) by a powered grate shaker. Wood-burning locomotives have fixed grates that can't be shaken. Wood ash is generally powder which will fall through the grates with no more agitation required than the vibrations of the locomotive rolling down the track. The fire grates must be replaced periodically due to the extreme heat they must endure. Combustion air enters through the bottom of the firebox and airflow is usually controlled by damper doors above the ash collection pocket of the ash pan. A locomotive that burns liquid fuel - usually [...] "Bunker C" [...] fuel oil or similar heavy oil - does not have grates. Instead, they have a heavy metal gauge firing pan bolted tight against the bottom of the firebox. The firing pan is covered with firebrick and the firebox has a firebrick lining, usually up to the level of the firebox door, all the way around the firebox. The oil burner is a nozzle containing a slot for the oil to flow out onto a steam jet which atomizes the oil into a fine mist which ignites in the firebox. The oil burner nozzle is usually mounted in the front of the firebox, protected by a hood of firebrick, and aimed at the firebrick wall below the firebox door. Dampers control air flow to the oil fire.|$|R
40|$|Gas Technology Institute (GTI), {{together}} with Hamworthy Peabody Combustion Incorporated (formerly Peabody Engineering Corporation), the University of Utah, and Far West Electrochemical have developed and demonstrated an innovative combustion system suitable {{for natural gas}} and coke-oven gas firing within the steel industry. The combustion system is a simple, low-cost, energy-efficient burner that can reduce NOx by more than 75 %. The U. S. steel industry needs to address NOx control at its steelmaking facilities. A significant part of NOx emissions comes from gas-fired boilers. In steel plants, byproduct gases – blast furnace gas (BFG) and coke-oven gas (COG) – are widely used {{together with}} natural gas to fire furnaces and boilers. In steel plants, natural gas can be fired together with BFG and COG, but, typically, the addition of natural gas raises NOx emissions, which can already be high because of residual fuel-bound nitrogen in COG. The Project Team has applied its expertise in low-NOx burners to lower NOx levels for these applications by combining advanced burner geometry and combustion staging with control strategies tailored to mixtures of natural gas and byproduct fuel gases. These methods reduce all varieties of NOx – thermal NOx produced by high flame temperatures, prompt NOx produced by complex chain reactions involving radical hydrocarbon species and NOx from fuel-bound nitrogen compounds such as ammonia found in COG. The Project Team has expanded GTI’s highly successful low-NOx forced internal recirculation (FIR) burner, previously developed for natural gas-fired boilers, into facilities that utilize BFG and COG. For natural gas firing, these burners {{have been shown to}} reduce NOx emissions from typical uncontrolled levels of 80 - 100 vppm to single-digit levels (9 vppm). This is done without the energy efficiency penalties incurred by alternative NOx control methods, such as external flue gas recirculation (FGR), water injection, and selective non-catalytic reduction. The FIR burner was previously demonstrated on <b>firetube</b> and watertube <b>boilers,</b> and these units are still operating at several industrial and commercial boiler sites in sizes ranging from 2. 5 to 60 million Btu/h. This report covers the development of an innovative combustion system suitable for natural gas or coke-oven gas firing within the steel industry. The prototype FIR burner was evaluated on a 20 million Btu/h watertube boiler. Acceptable burner performance was obtained when firing natural gas and simulated coke-oven gas doped with ammonia. The laboratory data reveals a direct relationship between NOx formation and the ammonia concentration in the fuel. In addition, NOx formation increases as the primary stoichiometric ratio (PSR) increases. Representative ammonia concentrations, as documented in the steel industry, ranged from 200 to 500 vppm. When the laboratory burner/boiler was operated with 500 vppm ammonia in the fuel, NOx emissions ranged from 50 to 75 vppm. This, conservatively, is 75 % less than state-of-the-art burner performance. When the burner is operated with 200 vppm ammonia in the fuel, the corresponding NOx emissions would range from 30 to 45 vppm, 84 % less than present burner technology. During field evaluation on a 174 million Btu/h industrial prototype burner both natural gas and actual COG from on-site generation were tested. Despite the elevated hydrogen cyanide and ammonia content in the COG throughout the test program, the FIR burner showed an improvement over baseline emissions. At full load; 167 million Btu/h, NOx emissions were relatively low at 169 vppm. This represents a 30 % reduction compared to baseline emissions not accounting for the higher hydrogen cyanide content in the COG. CO emissions remained below 20 vppm and were stable across the firing range. This represents a 68 % reduction compared to baseline CO emissions. When firing natural gas, emissions were stable as firing rate increased over the range. At low fire; 45 million Btu/h, NOx emissions where 33 vppm and increased at full load; 144 million Btu/h, to 49 vppm. CO emissions fluctuated with the oxygen content and remained below 135 vppm during all tests. The boiler’s maximum output was not achieved due to a limitation dictated by the host site natural gas supply. The FIR burner benefits the public by simultaneously addressing the problems of air pollution and energy conservation through a low-NOx combustion technology that does not increase energy consumption. Continuing activities include the negotiation of a license with Hamworthy Peabody Combustion, Incorporated (Hamworthy Peabody) to commercialize the FIR burner for steel industry applications. Hamworthy Peabody {{is one of the largest}} U. S. manufacturers of combustion equipment for boilers in the Steel Industry, and has stated their intention to commercialize the FIR burner...|$|R
