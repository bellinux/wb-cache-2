25|$|When {{you take}} a tree that {{is rooted in the}} ground, and {{transfer}} it from one place to another, the tree will no longer bear fruit. And if it does, the fruit will not be as good as it was in its original place. This is a rule of nature. I think if I had left my country, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same as the tree.|$|E
25|$|A common {{identifier}} {{naming convention}} {{is for the}} loop counter to use the variable names i, j, and k (and so on if needed), where <b>i</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most outer loop, j the next inner loop, etc. The reverse order is also used by some programmers. This style is generally agreed to have originated from the early programming of FORTRAN, where these variable names beginning with these letters were implicitly declared as having an integer type, and so were obvious choices for loop counters that were only temporarily required. The practice dates back further to mathematical notation where indices for sums and multiplications are often i, j, etc. A variant convention {{is the use of}} reduplicated letters for the index, ii, jj, and kk, as this allows easier searching and search-replacing than using a single letter.|$|E

His French connections meant that he was vulnerable to deportation or imprisonment {{under the terms of}} the Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson was concerned that the U.S. and France were verging on the brink of war after the XYZ Affair and regarded him as an informal envoy. Kościuszko later wrote, [...] "Jefferson considered that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most effective intermediary in bringing an accord with France, so I accepted the mission even if without any official authorization." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{late as the}} Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists {{could still}} believe in their {{eventual}} victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised {{the independence of the}} American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783. When John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, [...] "I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power." ...|$|E
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E

2500|$|Bannon {{was charged}} with {{misdemeanor}} domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness in early January 1996 after Piccard accused Bannon of domestic abuse. The charges were later dropped when his now ex-wife did not appear in court. In an article in The New York Times Piccard stated her absence was due to threats made to her by Bannon and his lawyer: Mr. Bannon, she said, told her that [...] "if I went to court he and his attorney would make sure that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one who was guilty" ...

She commented about the filming on her Twitter, saying, [...] "That's a wrap for Teenage Dream! So gorgeous [...] In my hometown. I got to cast all my friends in the new music vid for Teenage Dream = amazing insanity." [...] The video features images of Perry {{in a car with}} a boyfriend, then, Perry is shown in a Party with her friends, and the closing scene shows Perry kissing her boyfriend under the water. Perry was interviewed online via YouTube, where she talked about the music video. She said: [...] "It is gonna be completely different from 'California Gurls.'
