5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan <b>interrogator</b> for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} <b>interrogator</b> and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E

40|$|The current thesis {{aimed to}} improve the {{ecological}} validity of human intelligence interrogation research. Although field practitioners and researchers have worked together {{to improve the}} scientific validity and practical execution of interrogation techniques, research has yet to understand how, when and why <b>interrogators</b> implement such techniques. This thesis investigated the active decision making processes of <b>interrogators</b> that occur during high value interrogations. The theory of Naturalistic Decision Making was used to capture the naturalistic characteristics of high value interrogations—ambiguity, time pressure and high stakes. To capture the decision-making processes {{that are associated with}} skilled performance, this research conducted in-depth interviews with seventeen <b>interrogators,</b> and compared experienced (n = 9) to inexperienced <b>interrogators</b> (n = 8). Methods of cognitive task analysis and protocol analysis were used to enhance participants 2 ̆ 7 verbalizations. Finally, the criteria used to determine participants 2 ̆ 7 experience level (i. e. experienced or inexperienced) was validated using the five-stage theory of skill acquisition. It was found that experienced <b>interrogators</b> had a more flexible interrogation approach compared to inexperienced <b>interrogators.</b> This flexibility allowed experienced <b>interrogators</b> to better handle the naturalistic elements of the interrogation environment. All <b>interrogators</b> were found to have adequate skills pertaining to rapport building; however experienced <b>interrogators</b> further developed rapport in line with anecdotal evidence from past <b>interrogators</b> and investigators. Future field research should replicate these findings with additional interrogation simulations. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{policies}} and procedures within the United States military have also been found to produce {{an environment in which}} torture and enhanced interrogation techniques were used. Although the military has an excellent process for recruiting and training <b>interrogators</b> who use non abusive techniques successfully, changes in funding resulted in fewer highly trained <b>interrogators</b> being available. As more <b>interrogators</b> were recruited after 9/11, they were not as rigorously assessed, trained, or mentored and did not demonstrate the same abilities as the previous generation of military <b>interrogators.</b> In addition, the military rank of <b>interrogators</b> is not sufficient to control the decisions made when interrogation is needed. Military <b>interrogators</b> may be ordered to perform techniques they know to be inappropriate and ineffective by higher ranking officers who have not been adequately educated about effective interrogation procedures. The combination of a change in recruitment, reduced education and mentorship, and relatively low rank result in opportunities for torture and abuse to be used during interrogations.|$|R

The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. {{considered}} Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB <b>interrogator,</b> has speculated that the more powerful of the family may {{have chosen not to}} use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, and they may have considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that Chicago police had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an <b>interrogator</b> at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom the Secretary of Defense had authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E
40|$|Post-modern feminist {{security}} studies {{explore how}} our discourse about gender and war affects {{the construction of}} security as a concept. Military narratives valorizing the masculine over the feminine have long marginalized women warriors. In recent years, images of the torture and abuse of detainees have appropriated the representation of women <b>interrogators</b> during the Global War on Terrorism in particular. This research applied interpretative phenomenological analysis to the narratives of women <b>interrogators</b> in order to challenge the silence concerning their lived experiences by addressing how women <b>interrogators</b> understand their experiences both as woman and as <b>interrogators,</b> and how they negotiated socially constructed contradictions between these identities. Based on an analysis of semi-structured interviews with eight participants, the findings produced seven, interrelated themes. First, the findings explored the integration of gender with other markers of identity. Next, the findings demonstrated women <b>interrogators</b> recognize gender as a context-dependent role negotiated within the military institution through the development and demonstration of technical prowess. Then, the findings described interrogation as a complex adaptive system in which women <b>interrogators</b> harnessed to achieve their goals. Finally, the findings determined that the intersection of women interrogators’ identities and their interactions {{in the context of}} interrogation operations generated the perception of women <b>interrogators</b> as non-threatening. Women <b>interrogators</b> learned to exploit the meaning of this emergent phenomenon through introspection and the development of self-awareness...|$|R

Dr. Fatima Haji alleged that she was blindfolded and beaten {{in an effort to make}} her confess to faking the injuries to protesters during her Al Jazeera interview; she later identified her <b>interrogator</b> as a distant relative of the king. Ibrahim al-Demastani, head of the Bahrain Nurse's Society, alleged that he was deliberately kicked and kneed by guards in his back at a spot where he had told them he had a prolapsed disc; he was then denied medical care until he happened to meet a police officer to whom he had once taught first aid.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} was to choose a single frequency {{for all of the}} IFF transponders to operate on, no matter what the radar system's natural frequency might be. The selected frequency was 180MHz, a little under the lowest of the existing 1.5m radars. The transponder radio was tuned only to this frequency, not the radar itself. The radar system also added a separate radio system for transmitting and receiving these pulses, the <b>interrogator.</b> When the radar operator pressed a button on their console, the <b>interrogator</b> began sending out pulses synchronised with those of the radar unit. The IFF unit in the target aircraft then responded with pulses with the same timing. The output of the interrogator's receiver was mixed with the radar's, causing the blip to extend as before. When this was added to the spiral scan display, instead of stretching the blip, the IFF signal appeared as a series of short line segments extending outward {{from the middle of the}} display, the sunrise pattern.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{interrogation}} transcripts of interviews with girls between the age of 11 and 16 who are alleged victims of sexual crimes. The examination is done from a gender perspective, by comparing six interrogations by male <b>interrogators</b> and eight interrogations by female <b>interrogators.</b> The study has used linguistic indicators relating to the interrogation methodological guidelines, in order to highlight how the <b>interrogators</b> give girls the opportunity and space to share their experience of the alleged sexual offense. Text material is categorized based on themes and analyzed in detail to find any gender-specific patterns of hearing leaders and if the girls are given space and opportunity for a free storytelling. The results show that in several themes, differences between the male and the female <b>interrogators</b> can be discerned. It has emerged that male <b>interrogators</b> in this study have a greater use of social support, that there are various techniques used by men and women between how the names of sexual words are created and that the female interrogation leaders questioning on average are longer and have a higher frequency of issues. In other dimensions, that has been investigated the differences are not significant...|$|R
