500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And {{we had a lot}} of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They <b>just</b> <b>figured,</b> 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky—let them do whatever they want.' ...|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit {{and the next thing you}} knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea for the first time on any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E

500|$|The album's {{title track}} was said by band members {{to be the}} {{continuation}} of [...] "Final Six", which was an outtake from their previous album. [...] "Final Six" [...] origins deal with the apocalypse. [...] "Human Strain" [...] deals with apocalyptic origins as well. The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease. The title of [...] "Public Display of Dismemberment" [...] refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes. Tom Araya said that [...] "Unit 731" [...] is [...] "very similar to Josef Mengele {{in the sense that}} it was a medical unit in the military, which was a Japanese military unit, actually. They did kind of the same thing; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes." [...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is about a child witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've been meaning to write a song about that for a long time. I couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I <b>just</b> <b>figured,</b> 'Well, she's evil; she has lots of power and killed people.' So I just started writing and the lyrics and they came out." [...] Slayer revealed to Revolver that the track [...] "Snuff" [...] has no lyrical concept. [...] "Psychopathy Red" [...] was inspired by the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.|$|E

The artist recalled in 1985, [...] "They didn't have any work for me, but that didn't bother me. I <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> that if comics didn't work out I'd have done advertising or illustration. Vinnie called [...] Neal Adams, who put me in touch with [...] Jim Shooter. Soon after that I was drawing Moon Knight, in The Hulk [...] magazine". His art style was heavily influenced by Neal Adams.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the pieces}} {{to appear on the}} album was Leonard Bernstein's [...] "Some Other Time". Evans started to play an {{introduction}} using an ostinato figure. However, according to Keepnews, who was present, the pianist spontaneously started to improvise over that harmonic frame, creating the recording that would be named [...] "Peace Piece". According to Evans: [...] "What happened was that I started to play the introduction, and it started to get so much of its own feeling and identity that I <b>just</b> <b>figured,</b> well, I'll keep going." [...] However, Gretchen Magee claims that the piece had been penned as an exercise during his college years, while Peri Cousins says that he would often play the piece at home.|$|E

2500|$|The Academic Building {{stands at}} the {{crossroads}} of the campus. Completed in 1914, it stands on the site of Old Main, the first campus building, which burned to the ground in 1912. Its most prominent feature is its copper dome, which is green with oxidation, much like the Statue of Liberty. When the building was constructed, {{it was one of the}} first on campus to use rebar. Its architect, A Professor F. E. Giesecke knew little about reinforced concrete, [...] "so [...] <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> out the amount of steel...necessary and doubled it". The result was an extremely durable building so filled with steel that blowtorches had to be used when piping for water fountains was added. In front of the Academic Building is the Academic Plaza, which is the site of a wide range of campus events, most notably Silver Taps.|$|E
2500|$|After Michael had {{sketched out}} his {{ideas for the}} shoot at {{a meeting with the}} {{production}} company and his brothers, Stein and producer John Diaz had a feeling he would skip the actual shoot, so they rented a wax dummy of Michael from Madame Tussaud's museum in Nashville. [...] " [...] was put through the wringer," [...] Stein says. [...] "Its head ended up in the salad bowl at lunch one day." [...] The dummy was ultimately used in three separate sequences, including the ending sequence that shows {{the rest of the group}} standing in a shot similar to the album cover. The television show PM Magazine later discovered the dummy had been used through a close analysis of the video. [...] "I was so young and naïve, I <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> this is what they normally do in music videos," [...] recalls Paula Abdul, who eventually became the choreographer.|$|E

On her 18th birthday in 2013, she committed to play at Mount St. Joseph. However, as she was preparing for her senior season at Lawrenceburg High, she was noticing problems with her game. As she would tell a reporter from WKRC-TV in Cincinnati in late 2014, [...] "I wasn't {{keeping up with the}} other girls. My ball handling was sloppy so I <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> I was out of shape." [...] After further problems in the following weeks, she thought that she had suffered a concussion, and her family took her to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. On November 20, 2013, less than two months after committing to MSJ, she was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a rare type of brain cancer that normally affects children age 5 to 7.

2500|$|Navarro's joining and Kiedis's {{continued}} {{drug addiction}} {{had a profound}} effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, One Hot Minute (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, [...] "Pea".|$|E
2500|$|... 2Pacalypse Now {{generated}} significant controversy {{for numerous}} reasons. The songs [...] "Trapped" [...] and [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney {{claimed he was}} influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, [...] "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It {{has no place in}} our society." [...] Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, [...] "I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang," [...] Shakur said. [...] "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that." [...] The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, 2Pacalypse Now was listed as one of Shakur's [...] "certified classic" [...] albums, along with Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me and [...] 2Pacalypse Now went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA.

2500|$|Guitarist Brad Delson {{experimented with}} an EBow when {{the band was}} piecing {{together}} [...] "The Little Things Give You Away". The band decided {{not to use the}} effect for the solo in that song and instead ended up creating [...] "No More Sorrow" [...] out of the effect. In [...] "Given Up", he jingles the keys that are heard while several clap sounds are overlaid in the intro of the song (as mentioned in the lyric book: Brad added the sounds on the intro song: multiple tracks of claps - and keys jingling.). Shinoda and Delson teamed up with David Campbell to add string elements to six songs; [...] "Leave Out All the Rest", [...] "Shadow of the Day", [...] "Hands Held High", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", as well as the two b-sides [...] "No Roads Left" [...] and [...] "Blackbirds" [...] (which was instead later used in the iPhone game 8-Bit Rebellion! as well as being included as a bonus track for A Thousand Suns), respectively. All scratching elements by Joe Hahn that existed in the previous two studio albums are largely absent because of the low mixing, except on the songs [...] "What I've Done", [...] "Wake", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] and [...] "In Pieces". Hahn contributes more with programming, electronics, and other elements to many of the songs. The church organ and military drumbeat on [...] "Hands Held High" [...] were originally to be used as the backdrop to melodic vocals, but Rubin recommended that the band try the opposite approach according to the album booklet. For the album, the band recorded fifty to sixty songs in August 2006. Their previous albums took only about three to six months to complete, while this one took 14 months. They spent over six months writing the songs. In previous albums, they composed an average of 40 songs, but they made over 100 this time. [...] "Shadow of the Day" [...] is one of two songs (the other being [...] "No Roads Left") to have Bennington playing the guitar. During live performances, Shinoda is generally playing the keyboard for [...] "Shadow of the Day", while Bennington plays rhythm guitar. Shinoda stated in an interview: [...] "We were looking back at the things that we had done in the past... and I think we <b>just</b> <b>figured</b> that we had exhausted that sound.
