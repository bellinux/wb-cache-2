40|$|When a high {{symmetry}} facet {{joins the}} rounded {{part of a}} crystal, the step line density vanishes as sqrt(r) with r denoting {{the distance from the}} facet edge. This means that the <b>ledge</b> <b>bordering</b> the facet has a lot of space to meander as caused by thermal activation. We investigate the statistical properties of the <b>border</b> <b>ledge</b> fluctuations. In the scaling regime they turn out to be non-Gaussian and related to the edge statistics of GUE multi-matrix models. Comment: Version with major revisions [...] RevTeX, 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

The gills {{are carried}} {{right behind the}} <b>head,</b> <b>bordering</b> the posterior margins {{of a series of}} openings from the esophagus to the exterior. Each gill is supported by a cartilagenous or bony gill arch. Bony fish have three pairs of arches, cartilaginous fish have five to seven pairs, and primitive jawless fish have seven. The vertebrate ancestor no doubt had more arches, as some of their chordate relatives have more than 50 pairs of gills.|$|R

50|$|Western black-headed snake (Tantilla planiceps), {{also known}} as the California black-headed snake, is a snake species endemic to the Californias (the U.S. State of California and the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico), as north as the San Francisco Bay and as far east as western Utah. It lives in mostly moist pockets in mostly arid or {{semiarid}} environments, and spends much of its life underground. It has a flattened head as most crevice-dwellers, and is seven to fifteen inches in size. It is brown, slender, olive-gray, with a black <b>head</b> <b>bordered</b> by a white collar. Its habitat is often in woodland, desert areas, grassland and along arroyos in areas that are wet in a usually dry region.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine whether}} the scleral cross {{sectional}} area and estimated scleral volume {{are associated with a}} longer axial length in human eyes. METHODS: Histologic anterior-posterior sections running through the pupil and the optic nerve head were examined. Using a light microscope, we measured the thickness of the sclera at the limbus, ora serrata, equator, midpoint between equator and posterior pole (MPEPP), peripapillary region and posterior pole. Additionally we determined the length and the cross section area of the sclera. RESULTS: The histomorphometric study included 214 human globes of 214 subjects (mean age: 62. 5 Â± 13. 9 years) (147 eyes enucleated due to malignant choroidal melanoma or due to other non-glaucomatous reasons; 67 eyes enucleated due to secondary angle-closure glaucoma). Mean axial length was 25. 1 Â± 1. 8 mm (median: 24. 0 mm; range: 20 - 35 mm). Scleral thickness measurements decreased with increasing axial length for values taken at the equator (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 008; correlation coefficient râ€Š=â€Š- 0. 18), MPEPP (P< 0. 001;r:- 0. 47), optic nerve <b>head</b> <b>border</b> (P< 0. 001;râ€Š=â€Š- 0. 47) and posterior pole (P< 0. 001;râ€Š=â€Š- 0. 54). Scleral cross section area decreased significantly with increasing axial lengths for the regions at or behind the equator (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 002;râ€Š=â€Š- 0. 21), at or behind the MPEPP (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 001;râ€Š=â€Š- 0. 25), and at or behind the optic nerve <b>head</b> <b>border</b> (Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 001;râ€Š=â€Š- 0. 24). Scleral volume measurements were not significantly associated with axial length. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an associated increase in surface area, eyes with longer axial length do not have an increase in scleral volume. It may point against a scleral volume enlargement {{to play a role in}} the process of axial elongation...|$|R

50|$|The vulturine parrot has a {{total length}} of c. 24 cm. It has a rather short, squarish tail, and a mainly green plumage, which {{typically}} is tinged blue, especially below. The chest is olive-brown. The underwing coverts are bright red, and when perched {{this can be}} hinted as an orange-red shoulder-patch. The under-tail is yellowish with a bluish tip (appears dark against light). The outer webs and tips of the remiges are bluish-black, making the outer sections of the upperwing appear quite uniformly dark in flight. The arguably most conspicuous feature, however, is its un-feathered blackish and orange-pinkish <b>head,</b> <b>bordered</b> by a broad yellow collar of feathers, followed by a second blackish collar. This bare, vaguely vulture-like head is the reason behind its common name. Juveniles have a feathered greenish head.|$|R
