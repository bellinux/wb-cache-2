40|$|Because of {{the lack}} of {{competition}} regulation, certain contract provisions attempt to substitute for such vacuum. In an era when private ownership of infrastructure projects is gaining grounds, the need for elaborated competition regulation is more pressing than ever.

The involved interests, while diversified, are not always conflicting. For instance, the continuity of public service is a major concern of all contracting parties, but for different reasons. This unity of goals justifies a unity of solutions in form of uniform legal reforms...|$|R
