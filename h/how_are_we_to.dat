Taken all together, the genuine material on Inguar in contemporary English sources is slight". He also states [...] "there is nothing new in the suggestion that Ímar of Dublin and Igwar/Ingwar/Iuuar of English history are identical. It has frequently been put forward....and has equally frequently been rejected or treated as a mere possibility". Downham concludes [...] "while medieval writers {{seem to have been}} as interested as modern historians about Ívarr’s origins, it is perhaps wiser to accept that {{we do not know what}} these really were".|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in The Guardian, Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, gave his perspective on the Kaycee Nicole case. Jones credits the anonymity of the Internet for impeding people's abilities to realize when someone is lying: [...] "Given the mutability of identity, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>to</b> negotiate social relations that, at least in the realm of face-to-face communication, were fixed by recognition of identity?" [...] Online interaction has only been possible since the 1980s, steadily growing over the years. After analyzing several cases of online deception and interaction, social theorists Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler write in a 2002 Social Science Computer Review article that deception on the Internet is a paradox: the faceless nature of online communications not only gives opportunity to the unscrupulous and attention-seekers, but also allows earnest users to express themselves more freely, representing a truer version of themselves. Typically, Internet deception takes the form of changing one's sex or presenting one's own idealized image of oneself. Joinson and Dietz-Uhler cite a chapter in Network and Netplay, in which researchers note the purpose of some forums is to allow their members to participate in a kind of online party, affording chances to pretend and perform: [...] "the type of play on the Internet is usually allowed only in children or adults during masked balls or carnivals". More practical issues such as age, location, marital status, and occupation are also frequently changed online, or left ambiguous to preserve users' privacy or continue identity play.|$|E

2500|$|In short, {{he shifted}} {{attention}} to the perception of different sounds. Boas begins by raising an empirical question: when people describe one sound in different ways, is it because they cannot perceive the difference, or might there be another reason? He immediately establishes {{that he is not}} concerned with cases involving perceptual deficit—the aural equivalent of color-blindness. He points out that the question of people who describe one sound in different ways is comparable to that of people who describe different sounds in one way. This is crucial for research in descriptive linguistics: when studying a new language, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>to</b> note the pronunciation of different words? (in this point, Boas anticipates and lays the groundwork for the distinction between phonemics and phonetics.) People may pronounce a word {{in a variety of ways}} and still recognize that they are using the same word. The issue, then, is not [...] "that such sensations are not recognized in their individuality" [...] (in other words, people recognize differences in pronunciations); rather, it is that sounds [...] "are classified according to their similarity" [...] (in other words, that people classify a variety of perceived sounds into one category). A comparable visual example would involve words for colors. The English word [...] "green" [...] can be used to refer to a variety of shades, hues, and tints. But there are some languages that have no word for [...] "green". In such cases, people might classify what we would call [...] "green" [...] as either [...] "yellow" [...] or [...] "blue". This is not an example of color-blindness—people can perceive differences in color, but they categorize similar colors in a different way than English speakers.|$|E
