40|$|Long-term {{survivorship}} {{of a total}} knee replacement (TKR) {{relies on}} the strength of bone around the implant and its initial stability. Aseptic component loosening caused by mechanical factors is a recognised failure mode for knee prostheses. Bone resorption due to “stress-shielding” of the stiff stemmed implants will potentially lead to weakened bone strength, and presents a challenge for revision TKR surgery. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop analytical methodologies for the investigation <b>of</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> TKR, and to gain a better understanding of the prosthetic design requirements, addressing two major mechanical problems of bone remodelling and aseptic loosening. Patient-specific finite element (FE) modelling incorporated with a strain-adaptive bone remodelling theory was used to simulate bone remodelling responses of the postoperative tibial <b>fixation.</b> The choice <b>of</b> cementing technique was found to influence the remodelling behaviour; cemented fixationmodelled as a firm anchorage of the prosthesis onto the bone, was predicted to induce greater stress-shielding effect consequently leading to severe proximal bone resorption; for a fixation relying on biological attachment of bony ingrowthmodelled as a less firmly anchored boneprosthesis interface, lesser proximal bone resorption was predicted. The consideration of bone remodelling in FE simulations for fixation analyses is paramount as it influenced the risk prediction of aseptic loosening between prosthesis designs. The cement tensile stresses and bone-prosthesis interface micromotions predicted were different prior to and after bone adaptation. FE predictions of the MIS mini-keel and standard stemmed prosthesis fixations after simulating six months of bone adaptation correlated well with the RSA measurements at a similar period. A modified in-vitro technique of measuring bone-prosthesis relative micromotion was developed for relating initial stability of the cemented and cementless (press-fit) tibial prostheses fixations to late aseptic loosening. The developed computational and invitro methods should be applicable to other joint replacements.

40|$|Background: Surgical {{trainees}} develop surgical skills using various techniques, with simulators {{providing a}} safe learning environment. Fracture fixation {{is the most}} common procedure in orthopaedic surgery, and residents may benefit from simulated fracture <b>fixation.</b> The <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> residents on a virtual simulator that allows them to practice the surgical <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> fractures by providing a sense of touch (haptics) has not yet been compared with their performance using other methods <b>of</b> practicing fracture <b>fixation,</b> such as a Sawbones simulator model. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess whether residents performed similarly on a newly developed virtual simulator compared with a Sawbones simulator fracture fixation model. Methods: A stratified, randomized controlled study involving twenty-two orthopaedic surgery residents was performed. The residents were randomized to first perform surgical <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the ulna on either the virtual or the Sawbones simulator, after which they performed the same procedure on the other simulator. Their performance was evaluated by examiners experienced in fracture fixation who completed a task-specific checklist, global rating scale (GRS) form, and time-to-completion record for each participant on each simulator. Results: Both simulators distinguished between differing experience levels, demonstrating construct validity; for the Sawbones simulator, the Cohen d value (effect size) was> 0. 90, and for the virtual simulator, d was> 1. 10 (p < 0. 05 for both).

40|$|Much {{of current}} visual {{neuroscience}} {{is performed using}} standardized procedures. Most notably, these generally include stimulus delivery using computer displays, the requirement <b>of</b> <b>fixation,</b> repeated <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> experimental conditions and lengthy conditioning of animals on tasks to allow for behavioral reports. Correlating neural responses with stimulus characteristics and behavior {{lies at the heart}} of systems neuroscience. These controlled conditions have many advantages, but at the same time can only represent an approximation of the processes that occur during real world vision. But how much are we missing under these constraints? Real world vision is characterized by eye movements in three dimensions as observers fixate and track objects in the environment. What are the characteristics of spike trains collected under such conditions and how do they differ from those collected during task performance. How much can be said about neural activity by applying the correlational approach to data acquired under these conditions? Does what we learn about neural activity and selectivity during task performance generalize to real world vision? To begin to address these questions, we have recorded extracellular activity of several inferior temporal cortex neurons simultaneously while monkeys viewed face and object stimuli presented on a computer monitor at the center <b>of</b> gaze during <b>fixation.</b> Then we record activity of the same neurons during interaction with a human experimenter, while measuring the monkeys’ eye position and recording the visual input using a camera. We compare about 5 minutes of activity collected during these two conditions. Preliminary results suggest many IT neurons were dynamically modulated during real world vision. Peak firing rates (eg at 200 ms binwidth) tended to be greater during real world vision than during task performance. Some IT neurons showed markedly different interspike interval distributions in the two conditions. Our findings suggest that a dynamic three dimensional visual environment may be a useful tool for elucidating the function of visual neurons...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we ask two questions: (1) Is {{reproductive}} success independent of parental genetic distance in predominately selfing plants? (2) In {{the absence of}} early inbreeding depression, is there substantial maternal and/or paternal variation in {{reproductive success}} in natural populations? Seed yield in single pollinations and proportion of seeds sired in mixed pollinations were studied in genetically defined accessions of the predominately selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana by conducting two diallel crosses. The first diallel was a standard, single pollination design {{that we used to}} examine variance in seed yield. The second diallel was a mixed pollination design that utilized a standard pollen competitor to examine variance in proportion of seeds sired. We found no correlation between reproductive success and parental genetic distance, and self-pollen does not systematically differ in reproductive success compared to outcross pollen, suggesting that Arabidopsis populations do not experience embryo lethality due to early-acting inbreeding or outbreeding depression. We used these data to partition the contributions to total phenotypic variation from six sources, including maternal contributions, paternal contributions and parental interactions. For seed yield in single pollinations, maternal effects accounted for the most significant source of variance (16. 6 %). For proportion of seeds sired in mixed pollinations, the most significant source of variance was paternal effects (17. 9 %). Thus, we show that population-level genetic similarities, including selfing, do not correlate with reproductive success, yet there is still significant paternal variance under competition. This suggests two things. First, since these differences are unlikely due to early-acting inbreeding depression or differential pollen viability, this implicates natural variation in pollen germination and tube growth dynamics. Second, this strongly supports a model <b>of</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> pollen <b>performance</b> genes in populations, offering a focus for future genetic studies in differential reproductive success...|$|R

However, how the brain achieves this is still poorly understood. Here we explore interactions of local context and global structure in the long-term learning and retrieval of invariant display properties. Participants searched for a target among distractors, without knowing that some “old” configurations were presented repeatedly (randomly inserted among “new” configurations). We simulated tunnel vision, limiting the visible region around <b>fixation.</b> Robust facilitation <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> for old versus new contexts was observed when the visible region was large but not when it was small. However, once the display was made fully visible during the subsequent transfer phase, facilitation did become manifest. Furthermore, when participants were given a brief preview of the total display layout prior to tunnel view search with 2 items visible, facilitation was already obtained during the learning phase. The eye movement results revealed contextual facilitation to be coupled with changes of saccadic planning, characterized by slightly extended gaze durations but a reduced number <b>of</b> <b>fixations</b> and shortened scan paths for old displays. Taken together, our findings show that invariant spatial display properties can be acquired based on scarce, para-/foveal information, while their effective retrieval for search guidance requires the availability (even if brief) of a certain extent of peripheral information...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{create a}} {{simulation}} model for endoscopically assisted <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the intraoral vertical subsigmoid ramus osteotomy for training purposes. Materials and Methods: A polyurethane {{model of the}} upper and lower jaws in prognathism with or without mandibular asymmetry was created and covered by stretchable rubber material to simulate the cheeks.

40|$|UNLABELLED: Fat-embolism {{syndrome}} and pulmonary dysfunction may develop in multiply injured {{patients who have}} a fracture of a long bone. Although early <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a fracture is beneficial, intramedullary nailing may exacerbate pulmonary dysfunction by causing additional embolization of marrow fat. We examined the pulmonary effects of the timing and method <b>of</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a fracture in a canine fat-embolism model. Fat embolism was induced in forty-one adult dogs by reaming the ipsilateral femur and tibia followed by pressurization of the intramedullary canal. The animals were divided into a control group of eight dogs that had induction of fat embolism alone and an experimental group of thirty-three dogs that had induction of fat embolism and internal <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a transverse fracture of {{the middle of the}} contralateral femoral shaft. In the control group, four dogs each were killed four hours and twenty-four hours after induction of fat embolism. In the experimental group, a femoral fracture was created and fixation was performed four hours after embolic showering in fifteen animals and twenty-four hours after embolization in eighteen animals. The two experimental groups were subdivided according to the method <b>of</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture: eleven dogs each had application of a plate, nailing without reaming, and nailing with reaming. The pulmonary arterial pressure and the alveolar-arterial gradient were measured preoperatively, during induction of fat embolism, and as long as one hour after <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture but before the animal was killed. The lungs, brain, and kidneys were examined for pathological and physiological evidence of intravascular fat. The intravascular fat persisted for twenty-four hours after induction of pulmonary fat embolism. Pulmonary arterial pressure remained elevated at four hours after the embolic showering, before creation and <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture. By twenty-four hours after the induction of fat embolism, pulmonary arterial pressure had returned to the baseline level. Neither the creation nor the <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture affected pulmonary arterial pressure. In the animals that had <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> a fracture four hours after embolization, both nailing with reaming and nailing without reaming produced alveolar-arterial gradients that were higher than the baseline values, whereas fixation with a plate did not change the alveolar-arterial gradient significantly from the baseline value. In addition, the alveolar-arterial gradients in the animals that had nailing with reaming and nailing without reaming four hours after embolization were, respectively, four and 3. 5 times higher than that in the animals that had <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the femur with a plate. In the animals that had fixation twenty-four hours after embolization, none of the methods for fixation affected the alveolar-arterial gradient. The amount of embolic fat in the lungs, brain, and kidneys was not affected by <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture when it was performed at either the four-hour or the twenty-four-hour time-interval. Scores for pulmonary edema were increased by <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture, but there was no difference among the scores associated with the three methods <b>of</b> <b>fixation.</b> CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings of the present study indicated that the amount of intravascular fat persisting in the lungs, kidneys, and brain twenty-four hours after pressurization of the intramedullary canal is not affected by the method <b>of</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> the fracture. <b>Fixation</b> <b>of</b> a fracture is associated with minimum evidence of acute inflammation and has no effect on pulmonary artery pressure. The development of pulmonary dysfunction from fat emboli depends on other factors, not just on the presence of fat in pulmonary vessels.
