40|$|This article, {{prepared}} for the symposium on ‘The Future of Restrictivist Scholarship on the Use of Force’, examines the current trajectory of restrictivist scholarship in the United States.

40|$|As {{communication}} {{using the}} Internet and electronic media becomes more prevalent, incidents of online harassment have likewise increased. In recent years, the U. S. Congress and state legislatures have enacted new legislation and amended existing criminal statutes to target cyberharassment, also called cyberstalking or cyberbullying. The definition of cyberharassment consequently varies between jurisdictions, {{particularly with regard}} to statutory emphasis on the mental state of the accused and the reaction of the victim. This Note argues that the reasonableness and specific intent standards employed by most cyberharassment laws are inadequate to balance the safety interests of victims and the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of electronic speakers. The Note proposes that cyberharassment statutes be supplemented with burden-shifting devices such as affirmative defenses and nonmandatory presumptions, which have historically been employed in other contexts where the prosecution is procedurally disadvantaged and the details of the crime are peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused. After surveying statutes that have successfully incorporated burden-shifting elements, the Note concludes that real-locating <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burdens</b> increases the efficiency and fairness of cyberharassment law while reconciling the interests of both the victim and the accused...|$|R
5000|$|Changes {{to state}} laws {{began when the}} bill that would remove the {{requirement}} of corroboration was repealed in Congress unanimously. Following a national conference in 1973, changes began to take place more rapidly beginning {{with the creation of}} the National Rape Task Force (NOWRTF) which was a subgroup of the National Organization for Women (NOW). The next step for activists was to create a sample of how they thought rape laws should be written. One of the most successful repeal attempts took place in Michigan in 1974. Michigan created the Criminal Sexual Conduct Law bill which removed spousal exception, lowered <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burdens,</b> redefined rape, and other reforms. [...] On the other hand, Georgia had not repealed its law of spousal exemption until 1996, although most states had repealed theirs earlier in the 1990s. By 1980, all of the states had made, or at least considered making some changes. The example set by Michigan highly encouraged all other states to take action against rape. By 1980, there were over 400 rape crisis centers in the United States and laws had been changed to give the victim more leverage and voice during trials. As rape crisis center reforms increased and picked up supporters, as did the rape law reform groups.|$|R
50|$|In {{holding that}} {{the circuit court}} misconstrued the defendant's <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burden,</b> the Supreme Court {{attempted}} to set out the proper approach. The Court concluded that the ultimate burden of persuasion remained with the plaintiff throughout the trial. The Court explained that the defendant's burden was merely an intermediate <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burden</b> requiring the defendant to sustain only the burden of production, never the burden of persuasion. The burden of proof, therefore, never actually shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant but remained with the plaintiff. Furthermore, the Court specified that to rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case, the defendant must simply set forth {{the reasons for the}} plaintiff's rejection. Specifically, the employer must create a genuine issue as to whether he intended to discriminate.|$|E

50|$|Another {{issue with}} {{automatism}} {{is that when}} the issue is raised by the defence as a realistic defence (an evidentiary basis), the prosecution then has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was acting voluntarily. This is the case for several other defences e.g. duress. The justification for this is that voluntary action is part of the definition of the offence, and therefore something under the presumption of innocence the prosecution has to prove. The <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burden</b> was laid down in Hill v Baxter where the defence of automatism failed because there was no good evidence for the alleged blackout. <b>Evidentiary</b> <b>burden</b> means that the defendant needs to provide evidence to satisfy the judge that the issue should be put to the jury, which normally requires medical evidence (although R v Woolley, in which an HGV driver crashed after sneezing, proved an exception).|$|E

40|$|In In re: Nextel Sprint Corporation, the Seventh Circuit {{addressed}} {{the requirement that}} plaintiffs show that two-thirds of class members are citizens of the state under the CAFA home-state and local controversy exceptions {{in order to avoid}} removal to federal court. A plaintiff class, composed of Kansas residents subscribing to the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s cell phone service under Kansas cell phone numbers and receiving their bills at Kansas mailing addresses, sought remand to state court. Though the court found common sense intuitions implicated that the class likely satisfied the two-thirds citizenship requirement of the home-state exception, the court refused to remand the action to state court. Instead, the court forewent use of common sense intuitions and required the plaintiffs to submit evidence of domiciliary intent, or to limit the size of class members by tailoring the class definition to include only citizens of the state. In so holding, the court adopted an unduly high standard, which not only makes maintaining class actions in state court more difficult and expensive for plaintiffs, but also fails to achieve a substantially improved level of objectivity and reliability in the citizenship determination. This Note reviews the treatment of tailoring class definitions to avoid federal jurisdiction under CAFA in other circuits, the treatment of evidence of domiciliary intent in other circuits, and the application of statistical figures to <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burdens.</b> This Note will argue that the potential for confusion and bias in such evidence and for misinterpretation of statistical figures undermines the merits of the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s stringent standards.

40|$|This article proposes an {{integrative}} {{solution to}} the modern debate on corporate purpose, {{the question of whether}} directors and officers must solely maximize profits or whether they may consider the effects on employees, the environment or the community. Many find pure profit maximization unseemly and suggest alternative theories, typically arguing that corporations owe a duty to a broader range of stakeholders. This position is inconsistent with the case law and unnecessary to allow conscience in the board room. We resolve the issue more simply by acknowledging that the purpose of a corporation is to promote the shareholders’ interests, which includes the shareholders’ financial and nonfinancial interests. These nonfinancial interests could encompass product safety, the treatment of employees or environmental concerns. We refer to this focus as broad shareholder value. In this article we show that a broader view of shareholder value is superior to competing models in theory, in case law, and in explaining the empirical evidence. First, our theories of what a corporation is (corporate identity) imply that the proper corporate purpose is promotion of broad shareholder value, not mere profit maximization or duties to other stakeholders. Second, the case law does not require pure profit maximization, as has been claimed, but instead allows consideration of other shareholder interests. For support, we provide a new understanding of the case law using principles of game theory and applying <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burdens.</b> And third, a theory of broad shareholder value best explains the empirical evidence of what directors and officers actually do and what shareholders actually want. In short, real world evidence shows that pure wealth maximization theories lack both explanatory power and a normative mandate in the real world. A broad shareholder value norm provides a stronger explanation and mandate than pure wealth maximization, without contradicting case law requirements that boards consider only the interests of shareholders, rather than other stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Children {{rights advocates}} and {{scholars}} alike continue {{to call for}} the development of innovative and alternative rights models, which specifically provide for an expansive conceptualization of children’s rights. Central to their calls for reform is a simultaneous recognition that children’s rights must embody agency – a child’s voice (a proxy for autonomy) – free from governmental interference, as well as the establishment of certain fundamental “needs” that place an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure the child has, and affirmatively provide, when necessary. Reimagining children’s rights also requires reforming our laws {{in such a way that}} reflects children as inimitable rights holders possessing unique positive rights. Yet, in U. S. immigration law, children are still most often seen as illegal migrants and their status as alien is continually prioritized over their status as children. With a few notable exceptions, immigration law has been stagnant to adopt dynamic models that incorporate rights models that are informed by the developmental needs of children. This Article contributes to the much-needed discourse about how children’s rights should be understood and realized in immigration law. Unlike other areas of the law, U. S. immigration law still affords no legal distinction between children and adults when adjudicating potential forms of relief. Procedurally there are no compulsory child specific accommodations for immigrant children, as there are in family or juvenile court. Moreover, children are held to the same credibility and <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burdens</b> as adults. This Article concludes that international human rights law, specifically the Convention on the Rights of the Child, articulates a workable, comprehensive, framework of children’s positive (or welfare) and liberal rights that can and should be implemented in U. S. immigration law. Specifically, immigration law must at a minimum prohibit the return of a child to a country where the child would face irreparable harm; permit children when appropriate to petition for immigration relief on their own behalf; provide experts trained in child welfare and immigration law to assess the best interests of the child; and provide free legal counsel to children facing deportation...|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} discuss the {{historical}} development of the diminished capacity defense and analyze its current conceptual structure and use in Washington. It will then analyze the most recently proposed bill attacking the diminished capacity defense in this state, Substitute House Bill No. 1179. Should this legislation (or some variation thereof) be enacted in future sessions, the Washington Supreme Court will undoubtedly be forced to review powerful constitutional challenges to the validity of convictions obtained under the new law. At the very least, the court will have to determine whether the diminished capacity defense is constitutionally required. The court will also have to decide whether it should be characterized as a means of negating the mental state of the crime charged or as an affirmative defense. This decision will determine whether the <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burdens</b> of production and persuasion should rest with the defendant or with the State. Finally, the court will have to ascertain whether compulsory commitment of an acquitted defendant following use of a special verdict is constitutional. This article will analyze the fundamental alterations which S. H. B. 1179 proposes in light of Washington case law, federal constitutional requirements, and emerging trends in legislative reform. Finally, we will suggest the probable response of the Washington Supreme Court should the proposed legislation (or some variation thereof) be enacted. In so doing, we hope both to clarify the diminished capacity defense in Washington and to demarcate the permissible boundaries of legislative reform. In our view, many aspects of the legislative proposals to modify the diminished capacity defense are unconstitutional. If any or all of these anticipated constitutional challenges prove successful, a number of criminals convicted after enactment of this bill would be entitled to a new trial. Such result would impose significant burdens on the administration of justice as well as increase the prospect that a number of dangerous criminals would be released from prison or from psychiatric facilities...|$|R
40|$|When {{transferee}} judges {{receive a}} multidistrict proceeding, they select a few lead plaintiffs’ lawyers to efficiently manage litigation and settlement negotiations. That decision gives those attorneys total control over all consolidated plaintiffs’ claims and rewards them richly in common-benefit fees. It’s no surprise then {{that these are}} coveted positions, yet empirical evidence confirms that the same attorneys occupy them time and again. Anytime repeat players exist and exercise both oligopolistic leadership control across multidistrict proceedings and monopolistic power within a single proceeding, there is concern that they will use their dominance to enshrine practices and norms that benefit themselves at consumers’ (or here, clients’) expense. Apprehensiveness should increase when defense lawyers are repeat players too, {{as they are in}} multidistrict litigation. And anxiety may peak when the circumstances exhibit these anti-competitive characteristics, but lack regulation as they do here. Without the safeguards built into class certification, judicial monitoring and appellate checks disappear. What remains is a system that may permit lead lawyers to act, at times, like a cartel. Basic economic principles demonstrate that noncompetitive markets can result in higher prices and lower outputs, and agency costs chronicle ways in which unmonitored agents’ self-interest can lead them astray. By analyzing lead lawyers’ common-benefit fees, the non-class deals that they design, and the results they generate for their clients, this Article introduces new empirical evidence that multidistrict litigation is not immune to market or agency principles. It demonstrates that repeat players on both sides continually achieve their goals in tandem — defendants end massive suits and lead plaintiffs’ lawyers increase their common-benefit fees. But this exchange may result in lower payouts to plaintiffs, stricter <b>evidentiary</b> <b>burdens</b> in claims processing, or more coercive plaintiff-participation measures in master settlements. These circumstances warrant regulation. Even though judges entrench and enable repeat players, they are integral to the solution. By tinkering with selection and compensation methods and instilling automatic remands after leaders negotiate master settlements, judges can capitalize on competitive forces already in play. Tapping into the vibrant rivalries within the plaintiffs’ bar allows judges to use dynamic market solutions to remap the existing regulatory landscape by invigorating competition and playing to attorneys’ adversarial strengths...|$|R

Because this burden is so easily met, the plaintiff will almost always be forced to persuade a court that the defendant's reasons are pretexts and not the true reasons for the employment decision. The plaintiff's burden, therefore, is magnified because he will have to proffer convincing evidence analyzing the employer's intent.
