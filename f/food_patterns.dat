40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} the ethnic differences in dietary patterns and its association with socio-economic, dietary and lifestyle practices among adolescents in Kelantan, Malaysia. Methods: A population-based study of 454 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years was included. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary patterns and three dietary patterns were identified based on the principal component analysis method. Results: Malay adolescents had significantly higher scores for the Western-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> and local-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> whereas Chinese adolescents showed higher scores for the healthy-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> Multivariate analyses show that age and physical activity (PA) levels were positively associated with healthy-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> in Malay (All, p < 0. 001), whereas higher consumption of eating-out from home (EatOut) (p = 0. 014) and fast food (p = 0. 041) were negatively associated. High weekly breakfast skipping (p < 0. 001) and EatOut (p = 0. 003) were positively associated with a Western-based pattern, whereas age (p < 0. 001) and household income (p = 0. 005) were negatively associated. Higher frequency of daily snacking (p = 0. 013) was positively associated with local-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> For Chinese adolescents, age (p < 0. 001), PA levels (p < 0. 001) and maternal education level (p = 0. 035) showed positive associations with the healthy-based pattern, whereas high EatOut (p = 0. 001) and fast food intakes (p = 0. 001) were negatively associated. Higher weekly consumption of EatOut (p = 0. 007), fast food (p = 0. 023) and carbonated beverages (p = 0. 023), and daily snacking practice (p = 0. 004) were positively associated with higher Western-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> whereas age (p = 0. 004) was inversely associated. Conclusion: This study showed that there were significant differences in dietary patterns and its association factors between Malay and Chinese adolescents. More importantly, these findings suggest that unhealthy dietary and lifestyle practices could increase the risk of adherence to unhealthy Western-based <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> that is high in fat, sugar and salt contents, and, consequently, increase the risk of developing obesity and metabolic-related disorders during these critical years of growth...|$|R

Subjects and methods: The study was performed in northern Benin in eighty randomly selected children aged 6 ¿ 8 years. Dietary intake was assessed using observed weighed records. Food, energy and nutrient intakes were measured in post- and pre-harvest seasons. Complete food consumption data sets were available for seventy-five children. Results: <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> showed seasonal variations. Cereals, roots and tubers were the main staple foods. Contributions of animal products to the diet were very small. The <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> was not different for either boys v. girls or for children attending v. not attending school. Median daily energy intakes were 5 ? 0 and 5 ? 3 MJ in the post- and pre-harvest season, respectively. Only fat and vitamin C showed seasonal differences (P, 0 ? 05). Energy and nutrient intakes were different for boys and girls but, unexpectedly, not for children attending v. not attending school. Conclusions: Seasonal variations in <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> did not result in seasonality in energy and nutrient intakes.

40|$|Knowledge of {{specific}} <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> {{of elderly people}} is important for relating diet to nutritional status and disease and for the identification of groups at risk of under- or over-consumption {{of specific}} nutrients. The standardised methodology employed in the SENECA surveys (Survey in Europe on Nutrition and the Elderly a Concerted Action) provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study cross-cultural differences in nutritional issues and lifestyle factors affecting health and performance of elderly people in Europe. This thesis explores <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> in elderly Europeans and their impact on health. For the evaluation of the nutrient quality and the healthfulness of <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> in elderly Europeans two approaches were applied: The Nutrient Adequacy Ratio, and a diet score, based on eight dietary components with a likely protective function for a number of chronic diseases. For a better insight in <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> in addition to a conventional description, cluster analysis was employed. Food intake data from 1221 dietary histories recoded by the Eurocode system was used to identify specific <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> within each of the SENECA towns. On the pooled level <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> across centres emerged. <b>Food</b> <b>patterns</b> varied between and within European settings and the two types of variation appeared to be of the same magnitude. <b>Food</b> <b>patterns</b> were stable with age in 245 women from the Danish, Dutch, Swiss and Spanish SENECA towns. Minor changes attributable to period were, however, found. Also, foods contributing to the intake of specific nutrients were found to vary between SENECA towns. In addition to food choice, food handling affected the actual nutrient intake, and should, therefore, be considered in the nutritional evaluation of elderly people. Weight loss showed to be an indicator of poor health in Danish (n = 115) and Dutch (n = 12 1) elderly people, but energy intake as an intermediary factor could not be proven in this study. Nevertheless, a further analysis of the Danish data showed that, both quantity and quality of food intake matter in the prevention of disability in 115 elderly Danes. In conclusion, this thesis underlines the importance of <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> of elderly people today for their ability to perform activities of daily living tomorrow. Inadequate nutrient intake appeared to result from a combination of low energy intake and unfavourable <b>food</b> <b>patterns.</b> Vulnerable groups of elderly people may gain from stimulation of physical activity and recommendations on nutritious foods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Resource {{distribution}} {{can vary}} greatly {{in space and}} time. Consequently, ani-mals should adjust their searching tactics to such spatio–temporal patterns {{in accordance with their}} innate capabilities, or alternatively, they should use a genetically fixed searching tactic that has been evolved in response to the specific <b>pattern</b> of the <b>food</b> they experience. Using a simulation model and a genetic algorithm, we show how optimal searching tactics change as a function of <b>food</b> spatial <b>pattern.</b> Searching tactics for hidden prey can be approximated using the following three components: (1) Extensive search mode (ESM), the type of movement before encountering a food item; (2) Intensive search mode (ISM), the type of movement after encountering a food item; and (3) ISM duration. Both ESM and ISM are characterized by movement tortuosity. We show that searching behavior adap-tively changes as a function of <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> When <b>food</b> is distributed in a regular pattern, ISM is more directional than ESM, but under a clumped <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> ISM is much more tortuous than ESM.

However, dietary intake is diverse across country contexts. This study aimed to compare the dietary intake, <b>food</b> <b>patterns,</b> and blood glucose among middle-aged adults living in urban and suburban areas in Mandalay city, Myanmar, and explore their relationships. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted during June–November 2014. Adults aged 35 – 64 were randomly selected and requested to record all food they ate in a 4 -day diary. Fasting and 2 -hour postprandial blood glucose values were measured over two consecutive days. Dietary intakes were calculated in terms of energy, macronutrients, glycemic index, and glycemic load, and <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified by factor analysis. The relationships between food pattern, dietary intake, and blood glucose were assessed. Results: Of 440 participants, dietary intake between urban and suburban residents was significantly different. Six <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> were identified. There {{was no difference in}} fasting and 2 -hour postprandial blood glucose between urban and suburban residents, but a strong correlation between fasting blood glucose and 2 -hour postprandial blood glucose was found (correlation coefficient= 0. 8).

Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between a wide range of possible family and child indicators and adherence to dietary patterns for infants aged 9 months. Design: The two dietary patterns ‘Family Food’ and ‘Health-Conscious Food’ were displayed by principal component analysis, and associations with possible indicators were analysed by multiple linear regressions in a pooled sample (n= 374) of two comparable observational cohorts, SKOT I and SKOT II. These cohorts comprised infants with mainly non-obese mothers versus infants with obese mothers, respectively. Results: A lower Family Food score indicates a higher intake of liquid baby <b>food,</b> as this <b>pattern</b> shows transition from baby food towards the family's food. Infants, who were younger at diet registration and had higher body mass index (BMI) z-scores at 9 months, had lower Family <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> scores. A lower Family <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> score was also observed for infants with immigrant/descendant parents, parents who shared cooking responsibilities and fathers in the labour market compared to being a student, A lower Health-Conscious <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> score indicates a less healthy diet. A lower infant Health-Conscious <b>Food</b> <b>pattern</b> score was associated with a higher maternal BMI, a greater number of children in the household, a higher BMI z-score at 9 months, and a higher infant age at diet registration.

40|$|Background: As in most {{countries}} around the globe, overweight and obesity are {{a major threat to}} public health on the Caribbean island of Aruba. Increasing evidence confirms that breastfeeding protects against overweight and obesity. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanism underlying the association between breastfeeding and obesity. One possibility is that breastfed infants are better able to control their meal size and intervals than formula-fed infants. This might lead to a healthier diet in later life and protect against overweight and obesity. Objective: To determine the relationship between breastfeeding, <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> and being overweight in the Caribbean. Methods: In a cross-sectional school-based study in 2004 - 2005, weight and height were measured by two research assistants in 1776 children aged 6 - 11 years on Aruba, an island in the Caribbean. BMI was defined according to guidelines by the International Obesity Task Force. Parents completed a questionnaire pertaining to breastfeeding and dietary <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> Results: 1451 / 1776 (81. 7 %) children were breastfed; 851 / 1766 (47. 9 %) children were breastfed for < 4 months, 227 / 1776 (12. 8 %) for 4 - 6 months and 373 / 1776 (21. 0 %) for ≧ 6 months. Children who were breastfed for ≥ 4 months had lower odds (OR 0. 32, 95 %CI 0. 25 - 0. 40) of being overweight including obesity than those who either were not breastfed or who were breastfed for < 4 months. Children who were breastfed for ≥ 4 months were more likely to have a structured <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> of six eating moments a day (OR 7. 43, 95 % CI 5. 87 - 9. 39, P< 0. 001) and to have breakfast every day (OR 2. 86, 95 % CI 2. 17 - 3. 78, P< 0. 001) than those who were not or who were breastfed for < 4 months. Conclusions: Breastfeeding for ≥ 4 months is associated with a structured <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> (six eating moments a day including a daily breakfast) and carries a strikingly lower risk of overweight in children. Promoting prolonged breastfeeding together with a focus on a subsequent structured <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> could be a cheap method of preventing overweight. © W. S. Maney & Son Ltd 2013...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A food-frequency {{questionnaire}} (FFQ) {{was designed}} to assess the average consumption frequency of food items and to characterize the <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> among workers. A list of consumed food and usual serving sizes was compiled from previous local survey, using single 24 hours dietary recalls and frequency questionnaires. The list was composed of 127 items and the nutrient composition was calculated by the computer program DietPro version 3. 0. The FFQ was administered to each subject twice {{in a period of}} six months. To characterize <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> consumption, the most frequently mentioned foods were identified. One hundred and four (104) workers were studied, randomly selected. Items consumed {{at least once a day}} by 50 % of the workers were: white bread, margarine, black coffee, white sugar, red beans and white rice. Variety of daily consumed foods was small.

40|$|The 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has {{recommended}} {{that no more}} than 5 – 15 % of total dietary energy should be derived from solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS). The guideline was based on USDA food pattern modeling analyses that met the Dietary Reference Intake recommendations and Dietary Guidelines and followed typical American eating habits. This study recreated food intake patterns for 6 of the same gender-age groups by using USDA data sources and a mathematical optimization technique known as linear programming. The analytic process identified food consumption patterns based on 128 food categories that met the nutritional goals for 9 vitamins, 9 minerals, 8 macronutrients, and dietary fiber and minimized deviation from typical American eating habits. Linear programming Model 1 created gender- and age-specific <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> that corresponded to energy needs for each group. Model 2 created <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> that were iso-caloric with diets observed for that group in the 2001 – 2002 NHANES.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the reproducibility and validity of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was developed to assess the overall dietary consumption via dietary pattern method in a rural population in southwest China. A total of 179 participants aged between 40 and 70 years old were included in this study. Participants administered FFQ at baseline (FFQ 1) and one year later (FFQ 2) to assess the reproducibility. Six 3 -day 24 -hour recalls (24 HRs) were completed between the administrations of two FFQs to determine the validity. Dietary patterns from three separate dietary sources were derived by using principle component factor analysis. Comparisons between dietary pattern scores were made by using Pearson or intraclass correlation coefficient, cross-classification analysis, weighted kappa (κ) statistic and Bland-Altman analysis. The de-attenuated method was adopted to correct the monthly and seasonally variation and the partial correlation analysis was used correct the influence by total energy intake. Two major dietary factors, labeled as prudent <b>pattern</b> and processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> were identified. The prudent pattern was characterized by higher factor loadings of wheat, rice, fresh vegetables, bean products, nuts, red meat, white meat and fresh eggs; and the processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> was characterized by higher factor loadings of pickled vegetables, preserved vegetables and salted meat. Between Two FFQs, intraclass correlation coefficients were 0. 57 for prudent pattern and 0. 55 for processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern,</b> partial Pearson correlation coefficients were 0. 51 for the prudent pattern and 0. 56 for the processed food pattern; weighted κ statistic ranged from 0. 45 (for the prudent pattern) to 0. 56 (for the processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern).</b> Between FFQs and 24 HRs, de-attenuated correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 54 to 0. 78 for the prudent pattern and from 0. 55 to 0. 61 for the processed food pattern; partial Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 41 to 0. 56 for the prudent pattern and from 0. 42 to 0. 44 for the processed food pattern; weighted κ statistic ranged from 0. 42 to 0. 46 for prudent pattern and from 0. 43 to 0. 60 for processed <b>food</b> <b>pattern.</b> The Bland-Altman plots and limits of agreement indicated that the deviation/divergence was not obvious for both of the patterns between FFQ 1 and FFQ 2 and between FFQs and 24 HRs. The study suggests that the FFQ is reasonably reproducible and valid to assess the overall dietary consumption via dietary pattern methods in the Chinese rural population...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the association between <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> and anaemia among Chinese adults. It was a cross-sectional household survey undertaken in 2002. The sample contained 2849 men and women aged 20 years and above, and had a response rate of 89 · 0 %. Factor analysis was used to identify <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> based on a food-frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to relate <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> to anaemia. A four-factor solution explained 30 · 5 % of the total variance. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and four distinct <b>food</b> <b>patterns,</b> the 'traditional' (rice, vegetable, wheat flour), 'sweet tooth' (drinks, cake) and 'healthy' (whole grains, fruits, vegetables) patterns were independently associated with anaemia. 'Traditional' and 'sweet tooth' patterns were positively associated with anaemia, whereas the association with 'healthy' food pattern was negative. No association was observed between the 'macho' pattern (meat and alcohol) and anaemia. Compared with the lowest quartile (Q 1) of the 'traditional' pattern, the highest quartile (Q 4) had a higher risk of anaemia (men: odds ratio (OR) 2 · 60, 95 % CI 1 · 38, 4 · 88; women: OR 3 · 40, 95 % CI 2 · 14, 5 · 39). For the 'sweet tooth' pattern, compared with the lowest quartile (Q 1), the OR of the highest quartile was 2 · 34 (95 % CI 1 · 47, 3 · 73) for men and 2 · 02 (95 %'CI 1 · 31, 3 · 13) for women. The fourth quartile of healthy food was associated with a lower risk of anaemia (men: OR 0 · 50, 95 % CI 0 · 31, 0 · 79; women: OR 0 · 51, 95 % CI 0 · 34, 0 · 75). Women in the north had a higher risk of anaemia (OR 2 · 49, 95 % CI 1 · 80, 3 · 43). <b>Food</b> <b>patterns</b> were associated with anaemia in this area with a high prevalence of anaemia.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> of Australian {{children}} ages 9 to 13 y in relation to ω- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (ω- 3 LCPUFA) intake. Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted on nationally representative food data of 1110 Australian children ages 9 to 13 y (525 boys and 585 girls) that was obtained using two 24 -h recalls. Principle component factor analysis was used to identify <b>food</b> <b>patterns.</b> Discriminant function analysis was used to identify the relationship between the <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> and total ω- 3 LCPUFA intake. Results: Four major <b>food</b> <b>patterns</b> emerged for each sex. For boys these were labeled: “snack foods,” “soft drinks,” “vegetables,” and “pork and meat chops, steak, and mince. ” For girls they were labeled: “vegetables,” “take-away,” “tea, coffee, iced coffee drinks” and “canned meals and soup. ” Fish consumption bought from take-away outlets was more frequently consumed in the “soft drink” (r = 0. 577) and take-away (r = 0. 485) food pattern in boys and girls, respectively. In contrast, fish prepared at home was more often consumed in “vegetables” in both boys (r = 0. 018) and girls (r = 0. 106), as well as in the “pork and meat chops, steak and mince” food pattern in boys (r = 0. 060). There was a trend that in boys, the “vegetables” group discriminated children who consumed ω- 3 LCPUFA levels similar to adequate intakes (AI) (P = 0. 067), whereas in girls, the take-away food pattern discriminated for being a fish consumer (P = 0. 060). Conclusions: Dietary patterns associated with a high consumption of vegetables and “take-aways” food that include meat and fish are likely to positively influence dietary ω- 3 LCPUFA intake in Australian children...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Studies of {{diet and}} {{depression}} have {{focused primarily on}} individual nutrients. AIMS: To examine the association between dietary patterns and depression using an overall diet approach. METHOD: Analyses were carried on data from 3486 participants (26. 2 % women, mean age 55. 6 years) from the Whitehall II prospective cohort, in which two dietary patterns were identified: 'whole food' (heavily loaded by vegetables, fruits and fish) and 'processed food' (heavily loaded by sweetened desserts, fried food, processed meat, refined grains and high-fat dairy products). Self-reported depression was assessed 5 years later using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the highest tertile of the whole <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> had lower odds of CES-D depression (OR = 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 56 - 0. 99) {{than those in the}} lowest tertile.

40|$|Abstract — Food {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{ingredients}} for survival of any culture or race. It provides the essentials as well as supporting nutrients for growth, maintenance, protection and cure against disease and deficiency conditions. The <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> and nutrient intake reflect the nutritional status. There is variation in the dietary pattern of the tribes living in different isolated regions. The tribal people generally consume foodstuff available in and around their habitat. A large number of tribes depend on their own pattern of agriculture for producing rice or other cereals and some green leafy vegetables. People of different tribes constitute a distinct category with their ethnicity and culture differences. Nutritional status largely depends on the <b>food</b> <b>pattern</b> of the community which are influenced by social customs, beliefs, superstition, religion, cultural behavior, changes in living environment, Mass communication and Socio-economic status of the family...|$|R
