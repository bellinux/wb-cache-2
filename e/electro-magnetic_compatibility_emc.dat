The intent of the paper is not to show how to build a ’perfect’ filter, since this is known.

It was shown in earlier work that the filter, due to mechanical constraints (size, mounting bracket), had an improper grounding scheme for attenuating high frequency components of common mode currents. A solution for improving the total system is diverting the high frequency components of the common mode current before reaching the filter by applying a CB. In implementation this is achieved by creating a short circuit for high frequency common mode currents, which is the concept of interest in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Randomized Pulse Width Modulation (RPWM) {{has become}} a viable {{alternative}} to Deterministic PWM (DPWM). Indeed by spreading the power spectrum as a continuous noise, this new technique complies better with <b>Electro-Magnetic</b> <b>Compatibility</b> (<b>EMC)</b> standards for conducted Electro-Magnetic Interferences (EMI) and allows reducing the emitted acoustic noise in Variable Speed Drives (VSDs). The most popular RPWM schemes are Randomized Pulse Position Modulation (RPPM) and Randomized Carrier Frequency Modulation (RCFM).

New semiconductors allow the increase of the switching frequency fact that brings a whole new prospective improvement in converter's operation. Many other possible nonlinear operation regimes, including period doubling and chaotic oscillations, appear besides the conventional steady state operation. In this work, a nonlinear discrete-time model of an AC/AC buck type converter is proposed. A discrete time iterative map is derived to highlight the sensitive switching dynamics. The model is able to observe fast scale phenomena and short transient effects. It offers more information compared to other methods such as the averaging ones. According to <b>Electro-Magnetic</b> <b>Compatibility</b> (<b>EMC)</b> regulations, low wide-band noise is more acceptable than the high narrow-band, therefore the goal of this work is to spread the harmonic noise into a wide frequency spectrum which has lower amplitudes compared to the conventional comb-like spectrum with distinctive amplitudes at switching frequency multiples.

40|$|In the {{vicinity}} of the electric power network and near to the power electrical equipments the electromagnetic environment includes electric and magnetic fields, mainly at the spectral area of Extreme Low Frequencies (ELF). In some cases, very close to the working or areas of habitants, it is important to observe the values of the electric and magnetic fields and to compare those values with the appropriate biological limits and/or to the <b>Electro-Magnetic</b> <b>Compatibility</b> (<b>EMC)</b> limits. In these special cases the fields must be measured successfully and carefully. Therefore, the measurement equipment must have high accuracy and be as small as possible, in order to avoid any impact to the measured field values from the physical presence of the unit or of the observer. For application in these cases we develop an optoelectronic telemetry system, for measurements, of the ELF electric and magnetic fields, with small sensors in the measurement point and all the rest equipment in small distance. The system includes two electro-magnetic optoelectronic sensors, an optical transceiver and all the measurement electronic circuits. By that method we applied the two appropriate optoelectronic sensors at the measured point and in some distance (up to 100 m) an optical (laser) transceiver followed by the measurement circuits. If the outcome laser beam from the transceiver strikes the optoelectronic part of these sensors. Then, that part is triggered to modulate the reflected and returned laser beam. The modulation value depends on the field value. At the receiver part of the optical transceiver, a special optical demodulator extracts the modulation signal from the incoming laser beam and the following measurement electronic circuits extracts the information with the measurement values of the electric and magnetic fields. We must point out that the few mW red beam from a diode laser, has very low power to be an injury problem to the observer or to any other person, except the case when someone stares at the laser beam (intrabeam view).

In-vehicle network technologies such as the Controller Area Network (CAN) and Local Interconnect Network (LIN) are used to connect Electronic Control Units (ECU) together, mainly {{to reduce the amount}} of wiring that would be required if hardwired integration were used. Modern passenger cars contain many networks, which means that for the architecture designer, there is an almost overwhelming number of choices on how to design/partition the system depending on factors such as cost, weight, availability of ECUs, safety, <b>Electro-Magnetic</b> <b>Compatibility</b> (<b>EMC)</b> etc. Despite the increasing role played by in-vehicle networks in automotive electrical architectures, its design could currently be described as a “black art”. Not only is there an almost overwhelming number of choices facing the designer, but there is currently a lack of a quantifiable process to aid decision making and there is a dearth of published literature available. NetGen is a software tool used to design CAN/J 1939, LIN and FlexRay networks. For the product to remain competitive, it is desirable to have novel features over the competition. This report describes a body of work, the aim of which was to research in-vehicle network design processes, and to provide an improvement to such processes. The opportunities of customer projects and availability of customer information resulted in the scope of the research focusing on the adoption of LIN technology and whether the adoption of it could reduce the cost and weight of the target architecture. The research can therefore be seen to address two issues: firstly the general problem of network designers needing to design in-vehicle network based architectures balancing the needs of many design targets such as cost, weight etc, and secondly the commercial motivation to find novel features for the design tool, NetGen. The outcome of the research described in this report was the development of design processes that can be used for the selection of low cost and weight automotive electrical architectures using coarse information, such as that which would be easily available at the very beginning of a vehicle design programme. The key benefit of this is that a number of candidate networked architectures can be easily assessed for their ability to reduce cost and weight of the electrical architecture...|$|E
