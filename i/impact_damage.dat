25|$|The 737 {{had broken}} into several large pieces upon impact. These were the nose and cockpit section, the cabin up to the wing {{attachment}} point, the cabin from behind the wings to the rear airstairs, and the empennage. Although actual impact speeds were low and well within survivability limits, the structural breakup of the fuselage and exposure to freezing water nonetheless proved fatal for all persons aboard the plane except those seated in the tail section.

25|$|On August 26, 2003, the CAIB {{issued its}} {{report on the}} accident. The report {{confirmed}} the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in {{the leading edge of}} the left wing, caused by insulating foam shed during launch. The report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk-assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and acceptable costs, which are often conflicting goals. The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences. One of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of <b>impact</b> <b>damage</b> to it during flight. The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture.|$|E

2500|$|All {{wreckage}} {{was found}} along a 209 metre long, 50 metre wide {{section of the}} seabed {{at a depth of}} 78 metres. Investigators found no evidence of structural failure inflight. The damage to the aircraft was roughly symmetrical left-to-right, indicating the aircraft was close to wings-level flight on impact. The separation of the left landing gear leg compared to the bending of the right leg suggested to investigators that impact with the water happened with the left wing slightly lower than the right, as the left gear was the more damaged, and therefore subject to more force against the water. When the left wingtip contacted the water, investigators conclude that the aircraft cartwheeled, bringing the right wing down into the water with great force, which they report as being consistent with the nose gear being bent to the right as well as aft. The pattern of damage to the nose and the underside of the fuselage suggests the aircraft was in a slightly nose-down attitude, as if in a normal descent. Nearly neutral trim settings indicated the pilot was not trying to compensate for some abnormal flying condition, such as an engine failure or flight control problems. The pitch trim was set to a slight nose-down attitude, which the aircraft manufacturer calculated to indicate stable flight at 110–120 kts. This is consistent with investigators' calculations based on the damage to the aircraft that it had been moving at 90–130 kts at <b>impact.</b> <b>Damage</b> to the propeller blades is consistent with both of them turning and similar engine power being delivered to them.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{two methods}} for predicting the in-plane compression strength of <b>impact</b> <b>damaged</b> sandwich structures. For developing these methods uniaxial in-plane compression tests of <b>impact</b> <b>damaged</b> unsymmetrical sandwich coupons are conducted. The specimens {{were made of}} two CFRP face sheets of different thickness and an embedded honeycomb core. Low velocity impacts from 1 J up to 15 J caused varying amounts of core and face sheet damage and {{a dent in the}} impacted face sheet. While increasing the in-plane compression in the residual strength tests, the dent grew in depth and transverse to the loading direction until final failure of the impacted face sheet occurred. This phenomenological observation is reproduced in computational simulations. The simulations use either an efficient finite element model or a semi-analytical Ritz approach including non-linear displacement-strain relations and progressive damage growth in the core. For the latter stress-based failure criteria and stiffness degradation models are applied. Residual strength criteria are developed depending on the numerical solver. The comparison of simulation and test results demonstrates that the presented methods are able to predict the damage tolerance of unsymmetrical sandwich structures. For damages due a high-energy impact the simulations show that the face sheet damage has {{to be included in the}} model. Including the face sheet damage into the semi-analytical model increases the computational time tremendously. Therefore, the semi-analytical model should be used only for <b>impact</b> <b>damages</b> with negligible face sheet damage. ...|$|R
