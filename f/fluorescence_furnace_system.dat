40|$|The {{state space}} {{modeling}} approach {{was developed to}} cope with the demand and performance due to the increase in system complexity, which may have multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO). This approach is based on timedomain analysis and synthesis using state variables. This paper describes the development of a state space representation of a <b>furnace</b> <b>system</b> of a combined cycle power plant. Power plants will need to operate optimally so as to stay competitive, as even a small improvement in energy efficiency would involve substantial cost savings. Both the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the state space representation of the <b>furnace</b> <b>system</b> are discussed. These include the responses of systems excited by certain inputs and the structural properties of the system. The analysis on the <b>furnace</b> <b>system</b> showed that the system is bounded input and bounded output stable, controllable and observable. In practice, the state space formulation is very important for numerical computation and controller design, and can be extended for time-varying systems...|$|R

50|$|Both Mercoid cases {{involved}} a single patent that claimed {{a combination of}} elements for a <b>furnace</b> heating <b>system.</b> Mid-Continent {{was the owner of}} the patent, and Honeywell was its only licensee.

The right to build and use the patented <b>furnace</b> <b>system</b> was granted to purchasers of the stoker switches, and royalties owed the patentee were calculated on the number of stoker switches sold. Mercoid manufactured and marketed a competing stoker switch that was designed to be used only in the patented combination. Mercoid had been offered a sublicense but had refused to take one.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{primarily}} concerned with an analysis of advanced wind driven energy systems. Three such systems, the Improved Wind <b>Furnace</b> <b>System</b> and the Wind Driven Total Energy Systems, Types I and II, for the supply of energy to electrical, space heating and domestic hot water loads are considered for New England residential and farm applications. These systems are studied {{with the aid of}} an interactive digital computer simulation (WDTEST) and an economics program (WSDECO). Although the programs incorporate some idealizations, they represent a necessary preliminary investigation of the total system and its components. The computer models are designed to be general enough to allow for wide variations of loads, component sizes, working fluids and energy costs, but specific enough to approach an optimum design point based on maximum energy efficiency or minimum total system costs. 	Results indicate that the Wind Driven Total Energy System, Type II model requires the least amount of auxiliary energy input to the system for all three residential and farm settings considered. However, {{it was found that the}} higher capital costs of the Wind Driven Total Energy System, Type II, did not justify its use when compared to the less energy efficient but also less expensive Improved Wind <b>Furnace</b> <b>System.</b> All Systems studied though, if mass produced, were found to be less expensive annually than the conventional electric, oil and gas energy supply systems, provided that the capital costs are amortized over a twenty year period...|$|R
