5|$|The Mazurka was {{composed}} in the mid-1870s but not published until 1883. It {{is a tribute}} to Chopin, and contains <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier composer's music. Chopin, however, composed more than 60 mazurkas, and Fauré wrote only this one. Morrison regards it as an experiment on Fauré's part. The piece owes little to Polish folk-dance rhythms, and may have had a Russian influence through Fauré's friendship with Sergei Taneyev at around the time of its composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultrasound}} equipment must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to provide both color and Doppler imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of ultrasound. The use of Doppler measurements which trace the <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The overlay of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly.|$|E
5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

Creangă's work in general and his memoirs in particular have influenced Moldovan Postmodernist novelist Leo Butnaru in writing Copil la ruși ("A Child to the Russians"), which is set to the backdrop of 1950s' Russification in the Moldavian SSR.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{of the city in}} the 1960s saw the demolition of part of Grainger Town as a prelude to the modernist rebuilding initiatives of T. Dan Smith, the leader of Newcastle City Council. A corruption scandal was uncovered involving Smith and John Poulson, a property developer from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and both were imprisoned. <b>Echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scandal were revisited in the late 1990s in the BBC TV mini-series, Our Friends in the North.|$|E
25|$|When {{it came to}} the Ford Motor Company's hapless Edsel, Brooks {{revealed}} in his two-part series in The New Yorker that the Dearborn-based eponymous auto company had introduced the new model without much research. The only research done on the brand before its splashy introduction, Brooks noted, was simply on its name—which the Ford Executive Committee then proceeded to ignore. The naming of the brand, in Brooks's trademark trenchant style, carried <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patent medicine salesmen of the nineteenth century.|$|E
40|$|The term Catechesis {{is derived}} from the Greek word which means to sound over or through and {{therefore}} to make echo, hence, in its figurative sense, to teach in such. a way that <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> <b>the</b> master are an <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students' questions and <b>the</b> replies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students are so to say <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacher's questions.

25|$|During {{the first}} {{performance}} of the symphony, people {{were reported to have}} wept during the Largo movement. The music, steeped in an atmosphere of mourning, contained <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panikhida, the Russian Orthodox requiem. It also recalled a genre of Russian symphonic works written in memory of the dead, including pieces by Glazunov, Steinberg, Rimsky-Korsakov and Stravinsky. Typical of these works is the use of the tremolo in the strings as a reference to the hallowed ambience of the requiem.|$|E
25|$|He showed himself {{unable to}} accept the {{academic}} guidelines imposed by the Bavarian and Romanian schools. The following year, he left for Paris, where he studied at the Académie Julian, and, although taught by the academic artist William-Adolphe Bouguereau, became acquainted with impressionist works of art. Luchian's painting Ultima cursă de toamnă shows the influence of Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas, but also <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Société des Artistes Indépendants, Modernism, and Post-impressionism (also obvious in works created after his return to Bucharest).|$|E

25|$|In 1920, Jakac {{returned}} to Novo Mesto {{and became the}} bearer of The Spring of Novo Mesto, an avant-garde movement in literature and fine arts, which included also the poets Miran Jarc and Anton Podbevšek, the painter Ivan Čargo and the composer Marij Kogoj. In 1924, he settled in Ljubljana. At first, he earned his money as a woodcut illustrator at the liberal newspaper Jutro {{and a professor of}} drawing at the Second State Gymnasium in Ljubljana. Three years later he gave up his work and became an independent artist. At that time he also travelled extensively, for example to Paris, Tunisia, the Americas and Norway, and married Tatjana Gudrunova, who profoundly influenced his work. In 1932, he published his memoirs and letters from America in the book Odmevi rdeče zemlje ("The <b>Echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Earth"), in cooperation with his friend Jarc.|$|E

25|$|The {{first line}} of the prologue {{recalled}} Laius' hubristic action of conceiving a son against Apollo's command. At {{some point in the}} action of the play, a character engaged in a lengthy and detailed description of the Sphinx and her riddle – preserved in five fragments from Oxyrhynchus, P.Oxy. 2459 (published by Eric Gardner Turner in 1962). The tragedy featured also many moral maxims on the theme of marriage, preserved in the Anthologion of Stobaeus. The most striking lines, however, state that in this play Oedipus was blinded by Laius' attendants, and that this happened before his identity as Laius' son had been discovered, therefore marking important differences with the Sophoclean treatment of the myth, which is now regarded as the 'standard' version. Many {{attempts have been made to}} reconstruct the plot of the play, but none of them is more than hypothetical, because of the scanty remains that survive from its text and of the total absence of ancient descriptions or résumés – though it has been suggested that a part of Hyginus' narration of the Oedipus myth might in fact derive from Euripides' play. Some <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euripidean Oedipus have been traced also in a scene of Seneca's Oedipus (see below), in which Oedipus himself describes to Jocasta his adventure with the Sphinx.|$|E

500|$|After the war, {{there were}} joint Covent Garden {{seasons with the}} Grand Opera Syndicate in 1919 and 1920, but these were, {{according}} to a biographer, pale confused <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> years before 1914.

500|$|Composer David Bell created {{music for}} the episode that had <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operas of 19th-century German {{composer}} Richard Wagner. He explained that he used [...] "Wagner opera vocabulary in the orchestrations, and... actually used Wagner tubas in the score". He used religious tones to accompany appearances of the sword itself, specifically when it is first found by Worf, and said, [...] "If the audience isn't made to understand the spiritual importance of that weapon, then we have no episode".|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, Messager {{kept pace}} with the change in fashion in musical theatre, {{consciously}} adopting the styles of musical comedy, lightening his orchestration, but maintaining a Gallic flavour, mostly avoiding American dance-rhythm influences. [...] He collaborated with Yvonne Printemps and Sacha Guitry on the musical comedies Deburau (which he dedicated {{to the memory of}} Fauré), and L'amour masqué. [...] In his late operettas, his lighter touch was balanced by <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century, with hints of Fauré and, particularly, Chabrier's L'Etoile.|$|E
500|$|Dylan has {{cited the}} {{influence}} of Federico Fellini's movie La Strada on the song, while other commentators have found <b>echoes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poetry of Arthur Rimbaud.

Bruce Langhorne, who performs guitar on the track, has been cited by Dylan as {{the inspiration for the}} tambourine man image in the song.
