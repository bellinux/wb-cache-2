I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I feel you, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way, and it's OK.' I {{hope and pray that}} I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out. But the songs are not about freedom, they're about [...] I get it. I feel the way you feel.|$|E
2500|$|While Thomas is not {{directly}} aligned with a specific German or American movement of art, he {{is considered to be}} an Expressionist. [...] However, he was influenced by art from many periods dating back to antiquity. [...] He was not characteristically German Expressionist, although, the genre greatly influenced his creations. [...] Aiches writes the following: “When viewing and contemplating the works of the early twentieth century German Expressionists, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> intense and simultaneous infusion of philosophy and craft that is so apparent in Thomas’ sculpture and painting.” ...|$|E

Whether {{any of the other}} members of my class vibrated with similar emotion or not I cannot say, but I do recall that some of the girls annoyed me by their excessive attentions to unimportant ribbons, flounces, and laces. [...] "How do I look?" [...] seemed their principal concern. Only Alice expressed anything of the prophetic sadness which mingled with her exultation.|$|E

60|$|I {{hope the}} bill will pass without any {{deleterious}} amendments. I {{do seem to be}} extraordinarily interested in a whole lot of arts and things that I have got nothing to do with. It is a part of my generous, liberal nature; I can't help it. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sort of charity to everybody that was manifested by a gentleman who arrived at home at two o'clock in the morning from the club and was feeling so perfectly satisfied with life, so happy, and so comfortable, and there was his house weaving, weaving, weaving around. He watched his chance, and by and by when the steps got in his neighborhood he made a jump and climbed up and got on the portico.|$|E

[...] "It's no use meeting to say more hard words, and it's no use meeting to shake hands and say we're friends again. We're not friends, an' it's better not to pretend it.

He's not the same man to me, and I can't feel the same towards him. God help me!

60|$|To {{this day}} a dewy morning in late August brings back {{the thought of}} Mary and those stolen meetings. I have the minutest {{recollection}} of the misty bloom upon the turf, and the ragged, filmy carpet of gossamer on either hand, of the warm wetness of every little blade and blossom and of the little scraps and seeds of grass upon my soaking and discolored boots. Our footsteps were dark green upon the dew-grey grass. And <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> hungry freshness again {{at the thought of}} those stolen meetings. Presently came the sunrise, blinding, warming, dew-dispelling arrows of gold smiting through the tree stems, a flood of light foaming over the bracken and gilding the under sides of the branches. Everything is different and distinctive in those opening hours; everything has a different value from what it has by day. All the little things upon the ground, fallen branches, tussocks, wood-piles, have a peculiar intensity and importance, seem magnified, because of the length of their shadows in the slanting rays, and all the great trees seem lifted above the light and merged with the sky. And at last, a cool grey outline against the blaze and with a glancing iridescent halo about her, comes Mary, flitting, adventurous, friendly, wonderful.|$|E

I'll sure find them, and tell them we're packing to leave pronto..... Now, Dad, buy three wagons and teams, grain, grub, and whatever else we need for two weeks or more on the road. Soon as I find Lucy and Mother I'll meet you and help you with the buying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{everything}} {{comes back to}} this war," [...] cried Gertrude Oliver. [...] "We can't get away from it--not even when we talk of the weather. I never go out these dark cold nights myself without thinking {{of the men in}} the trenches--not only our men but everybody's men. <b>I</b> would <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> if there were nobody I knew at the front. When I snuggle down in my comfortable bed I am ashamed of being comfortable. It seems as if it were wicked of me to be so when many are not." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{was just}} reading {{a review of}} a movie called Watchmen that uses it and the {{reviewer}} said – [...] "Can we please have a moratorium on 'Hallelujah' in movies and television shows?"

6000|$|... § II. The {{principal}} {{difficulty in}} doing this arises {{from the fact that}} every building of the Gothic period differs in some important respect from every other; and many include features which, if they occurred in other buildings, would not be considered Gothic at all; so that all we have to reason upon is merely, if I may be allowed so to express it, a greater or less degree of Gothicness in each building we examine. And it is this Gothicness,--the character which, according as it is found more or less in a building, makes it more or less Gothic,--of which I want to define the nature; and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> kind of difficulty in doing so which would be encountered by any one who undertook to explain, for instance, the nature of Redness, without any actual red thing to point to, but only orange and purple things. Suppose he had only a piece of heather and a dead oak-leaf to do it with. He might say, the color which is mixed with the yellow in this oak-leaf, and with the blue in this heather, would be red, if you had it separate; but it would be difficult, nevertheless, to make the abstraction perfectly intelligible: and it is so in a far greater degree to make the abstraction of the Gothic character intelligible, because that character itself is made up of many mingled ideas, and can consist only in their union. That is to say, pointed arches do not constitute Gothic, nor vaulted roofs, nor flying buttresses, nor grotesque sculptures; but all or some of these things, and many other things with them, when they come together so as to have life.|$|E
60|$|One mode of {{the divine}} {{teaching}} is the incarnation {{of the spirit in}} a form,--in forms, like my own. I live in society, with persons who answer to thoughts in my own mind, or express a certain obedience to the great instincts to which I live. I see its presence to them. I am certified of a common nature; and these other souls, these separated selves, draw me as nothing else can. They stir in me the new emotions we call passion; of love, hatred, fear, admiration, pity; thence come conversation, competition, persuasion, cities and war. Persons are supplementary to the primary teaching of the soul. In youth we are mad for persons. Childhood and youth see all the world in them. But the larger experience of man discovers the identical nature appearing through them all. Persons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal. In all conversation between two persons tacit reference is made, as to a third party, to a common nature. That third party or common nature is not social; it is impersonal; is God. And so in groups where debate is earnest, and especially on high questions, the company become aware that the thought rises to an equal level in all bosoms, that all have a spiritual property in what was said, as well as the sayer. They all become wiser than they were. It arches over them like a temple, this unity of thought in which every heart beats with nobler sense of power and duty, and thinks and acts with unusual solemnity. All are conscious of attaining to a higher self-possession. It shines for all. There is a certain wisdom of humanity which is common to the greatest men with the lowest, and which our ordinary education often labors to silence and obstruct. The mind is one, and the best minds, who love truth for its own sake, think much less of property in truth. They accept it thankfully everywhere, and do not label or stamp it with any man's name, for it is theirs long beforehand, and from eternity. The learned and the studious of thought have no monopoly of wisdom. Their violence of direction in some degree disqualifies them to think truly. We owe many valuable observations to people who are not very acute or profound, and who say the thing without effort which we want and have long been hunting in vain. The action of the soul is oftener in that which is felt and left unsaid than in that which is said in any conversation. It broods over every society, and they unconsciously seek for it in each other. We know better than we do. We do not yet possess ourselves, and we know {{at the same time that}} we are much more. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> truth how often in my trivial conversation with my neighbors, that somewhat higher in each of us overlooks this by-play, and Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us.|$|E
