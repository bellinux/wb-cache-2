5|$|A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a {{radius of}} one astronomical unit, {{so that the}} {{interior}} surface would receive {{the same amount of}} sunlight as Earth does per unit solid angle, would have a surface area of approximately , or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would <b>intercept</b> the full 384.6 yottawatts (3.846 × 1026 watts) of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would <b>intercept</b> less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E

At about this time 12 Fw190s arrived at Førde Fjord and flew through German flak to <b>intercept</b> the Beaufighters that were waiting their turn to attack. The British Mustangs were taken by surprise, but dived to <b>intercept</b> the German fighters. This led to an intense air battle, with over 50 aircraft either engaged in dogfights or diving to attack the German ships; it was the largest aerial conflict ever fought over Norway.|$|E

5|$|Nike Zeus was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{developed}} by the US Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s, designed to destroy Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit targets in the United States. It was designed by Bell's Nike team, and was initially based on the earlier Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile. The original Zeus A, given the tri-service identifier XLIM-49, was designed to <b>intercept</b> warheads in the upper atmosphere, mounting a 25 kiloton W31 nuclear warhead. During development, the concept changed to protect a much larger area and <b>intercept</b> the warheads at higher altitudes. This required the missile to be greatly enlarged into the totally new design, Zeus B, mounting a 400 kiloton W50 warhead. In several successful tests, the B model proved itself able to <b>intercept</b> warheads, and even satellites.|$|E
5|$|Sailing more {{directly}} than de Grasse, Hood's fleet arrived off {{the entrance to}} the Chesapeake on 25 August. Finding no French ships there, he then sailed for New York. Meanwhile, his colleague and commander of the New York fleet, Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, had spent several weeks trying to <b>intercept</b> a convoy organized by John Laurens to bring much-needed supplies and hard currency from France to Boston. When Hood arrived at New York, he found that Graves was in port (having failed to <b>intercept</b> the convoy), but had only five ships of the line that were ready for battle.|$|E

Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807, which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade, and the Royal Navy enforced the Blockade of Africa.

5|$|Airborne radar for {{detecting}} ships at sea {{came to be}} known as Air-to-Surface-Vessel (ASV) radar. Its successes led to continued demands for additional tests.

40|$|This {{analysis}} considers outputs {{produced by}} Title III electronic wiretaps. Based on 1987 - 2005 data, wiretap productivity is assessed {{by examining the}} number of wiretaps, places wiretaps are installed, numbers of people whose communications are <b>intercepted,</b> the number of <b>intercepted</b> communications, the number of communications labeled incriminating, the arrests and convictions linked to wiretaps, and the relationships among arrests and convictions. Wiretapping is focused mostly on narcotics violations. The numbers of people, interceptions, and incriminating interceptions increased. One-fifth of <b>intercepted</b> communications were classified as incriminating. Incriminating information is linked to arrests and convictions that unfold over time. The more people <b>intercepted,</b> the more arrests result, but convictions decline over time. Arrests are driven {{by the number of}} <b>intercepted</b> persons. Convictions are driven by the number of incriminating interceptions. Two simultaneous but opposing operations were in place by 2005 : big increases in the number of <b>intercepted</b> communications in 2003 through 2005; and by 2005, overall declines in the measured productivity of wiretaps. ...|$|R

Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss, this causes storms and subsequent flood rains and flooding.|$|E

40|$|The crop <b>intercepted</b> photosynthetically active {{radiation}} (PAR) {{and radiation}} use efficiency (RUE) vary markedly in different intercropping systems. The HHLA (horizontally homogeneous leaf area) and ERCRT (extended row crop radiation transmission) models have been established to calculate the <b>intercepted</b> PAR for intercrops. However, {{there is still a}} lack of study on the <b>intercepted</b> PAR and RUE under different intercropping configurations using different models. To evaluate the <b>intercepted</b> PAR and RUE in maize and soybean under different intercropping systems, we tested different strip intercropping configurations (SI 1, SI 2, and SI 3 based on ERCRT model) and a row intercropping configurations (RI based on HHLA model) in comparison to monoculture. Our results showed that the <b>intercepted</b> PAR and RUE of intercropping systems were all higher than those of monoculture. The soybean <b>intercepted</b> PAR in strip intercropping was 1. 35 times greater than that in row intercropping. In row intercropping (RI), the lack of soybean <b>intercepted</b> PAR resulted in a significant reduction of soybean dry matter. Therefore, it is not the recommended configuration for soybean. In strip intercropping patterns, with the distance between maize strip increased by 0. 2 m, the <b>intercepted</b> PAR of soybean increased by 20 %. The SI 2 (maize row spacing at 0. 4 m and the distance between maize strip at 1. 6 m) was the recommended configuration to achieve the highest value of <b>intercepted</b> PAR and RUE among tested strip intercropping configurations. The method of dry matter estimation using <b>intercepted</b> PAR and RUE is useful in simulated experiments. The simulated value was verified in comparison with experimental data, which confirmed the credibility of the simulation model. Moreover, it also provides help in the development of functional-structural plant model (FSPM) ...|$|R

5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an <b>intercept</b> point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the <b>intercept</b> point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E
