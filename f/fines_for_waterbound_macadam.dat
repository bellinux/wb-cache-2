40|$|<b>Waterbound</b> <b>Macadam</b> (WM) layers {{were used}} {{extensively}} {{during the first}} half of the previous century and have been reintroduced in the 1980 ’s, focusing on re-engineering labour-intensive construction techniques during the 1990 ’s. In 1994 and 1995 the former Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council (TMC) in consultation with AFRICON and the University of the Witwatersrand constructed two pilot projects in Johannesburg with a labour-based method utilising WM base courses. The design and construction of various WM roads in Soweto followed in 1996. The construction processes were monitored throughout and data collected to investigate certain technical issues; among them the in-situ WM properties, the construction tolerances and expected performance. Since that time, a number of WM projects followed towards the development of sound guidelines for the design and construction of these pavements. A case study was conducted in 2001 on eight of these <b>waterbound</b> <b>macadam</b> pavements to assess the in-service short-term performance, and re-visiting the expected structural capacity by applying state of the art techniques in the analysis of these layers. The investigation involved...|$|R
40|$|The present chapter {{focuses on}} locks {{and their impact}} on (inland) waterbound logistics. Examples of lock systems are given, and the main {{characteristics}} of the serial lock scheduling problem discussed. Locks are often scheduled manually and, despite constituting a complex combinatorial problem, academia has given little attention to optimizing lock operations. Two measures can be suggested to considerably improve the competitiveness of inland waterway transportation within the supply chain: increasing the scheduling horizon of locks and treating series of locks as a single system, instead of operating them individually. A decision support system for the ship placement problem is introduced. The system is analysed both from the algorithmic and operational side, and some implementation difficulties are highlighted. Transferring ships through a series of locks based on their requested time of arrival at a destination, has potential to generate a green wave <b>for</b> <b>waterbound</b> logistics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This article studies optimal fines when an offender's {{wealth is}} private {{information}} that can be obtained by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit. I derive the optimal <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the underlying offense, the optimal <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> misrepresenting one's wealth level, and the optimal audit probability. I demonstrate that the optimal <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> misrepresenting wealth equals the <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore generally exceeds the <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the offense. The optimal audit probability is positive, increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the cost is sufficiently low. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals who are capable of paying the <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. I also show that the optimal <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing wealth levels. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{proposed}} framework, larger <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> evasion will increase tax compliance with ambiguous effects on corruption. Complete dissipation of rents {{in the public}} sector implies that the bribe and the level of corruption move in opposite directions following an increase in the <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> evasion. A larger <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> corruption will reduce corruption at the cost of reducing tax compliance. Albeit surprising, this result suggests that setting harsh <b>fines</b> <b>for</b> corruption is not necessarily an effective instrument for reducing the underlying offence...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen {{penalties}} for first-time offenders are restricted, it is typically optimal for the lawmaker to overdeter repeat offenders. First-time offenders are then deterred {{not only by}} the (restricted) <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> a first offense, but also by the prospect of a large <b>fine</b> <b>for</b> a subsequent offense. Now suppose the restriction on {{penalties for}} first-time offenders is relaxed; i. e., larger <b>fines</b> <b>for</b> a first offense become enforceable. Should overdeterrence of repeat offenders now be reduced? We show that this is the case only if the original restriction was not very strong. Otherwise, overdeterrence of repeat offenders should actually be further amplified...|$|R
