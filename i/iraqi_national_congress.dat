25|$|Mithal al-Alusi, {{a secular}} Muslim Iraqi lawmaker, who is openly pro-Israel, paid {{a heavy price}} for visiting Israel in September 2004, criticizing Hamas and Hezbollah as {{terrorist}} organizations, and advocating peace with the Jewish state. Upon his return to Iraq, the Sunni politician was immediately removed from Ahmed Chalabi's <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> Party (INC). In 2005, apparently as payback, a gunmen opened fire on Alusi's car just after it left his house, killing two of his sons, Ayman, 21, and Jamal, 30, while he escaped unharmed. According to Alusi, there is no Iraqi-Israeli problem, {{and the interests of}} the two countries are parallel; thus, he advocates strategic relations between Iraq and Israel against terrorism. Alusi returned to Israel for a second visit in September 2008. Upon his return to Iraq, he was stripped of parliamentary immunity so that he could face charges of traveling illicitly to Israel. Later that year, Iraq's Federal Supreme Court ruled in his favor, maintaining it was no longer a crime for Iraqis to travel to Israel.|$|E

[...] Hersh explains that the OSP [...] "relied on data gathered by other intelligence agencies and also on information provided by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> or I.N.C., the exile group headed by Ahmad Chalabi." [...] According to Kampfner, the CIA had ended its funding of the INC [...] "in the mid-1990s when doubts were cast about Chalabi’s reliability." [...] Nevertheless, [...] "as the administration geared up for conflict with Saddam, Chalabi was welcomed in the inner sanctum of the Pentagon" [...] under the auspices of the OSP, and [...] "Wolfowitz did not see fit to challenge any of Chalabi’s information." [...] The actions of the OSP have led to accusation of the Bush administration [...] "fixing intelligence to support policy" [...] with the aim of influencing Congress in its use of the War Powers Act.|$|E
