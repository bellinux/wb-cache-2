The objective {{of this article is}} to identify existing and emerging supply sources for UK fresh produce importers and examine the extent to which they could provide invasion pathways. We tested the hypothesis that increased imports of fresh produce from new sources outside the European Union could increase the risks of non-indigenous insect pests. We use a bio-economic model approach in which the number of species arrivals is a function of the <b>volume</b> of <b>imports,</b> whereas the <b>volume</b> of <b>imports</b> itself is a function of gross domestic product, relative import prices and seasonality. The study has identified clear trends, which show <b>import</b> <b>volumes</b> of fresh produce and species detections increasing from new supply sources. If this trend continues in the future, then the UK inspection agency should expect to confront species from new suppliers in much greater numbers, given that <b>import</b> <b>volumes</b> of fresh produce are income elastic.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade Russia has imposed import {{restrictions}} on different types of food and plant products from {{a vast number of}} countries, claiming to be acting on food safety scandals as the primary reason. However, most observers interpret these measures as acts of protectionism. In this article the Russian import restrictions on Norwegian fish products are presented as the main case in a discussion of the rationale behind the measures. Our main finding is that, although the measures are trade barriers that lack transparency and documentation related to the alleged food safety risks, the traditional protectionist rationale, i. e. restricting <b>imported</b> <b>volumes</b> to prevent competition, {{does not seem to be}} the driving force behind the restrictions. Instead, we argue that food trade is regulated in order to regain governmental control over economic transactions and economic actors. Russian authorities have been very careful not to disturb the overall supply of seafood to Russia when implementing new import regulations. Also, <b>import</b> <b>volumes</b> of food to the Russian market in general have been increasing. This is linked to the fact that Russia is highly import-dependent and unable to replace imports. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings with regard to future market access to the Russian food market, including the potential for Russia's adaptation to relevant World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Big {{swings in}} {{international}} iron ore market {{have been paid}} widespread attention in recent years. To study its fluctuation characteristics, the seasonality of China's imported iron ore throughput (IIOT) are investigated. First, the status quo of Chinaâs IIOT in coastal ports is analyzed.

The empirical results indicate that there exists obvious seasonality for China's IIOT. Averagely, the <b>imported</b> <b>volumes</b> are higher in March and April, but lower in August and October.

5000|$|The Special Agricultural Safeguard (SSG) is {{provision}} in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. The SSG allows Member countries to impose additional tariffs on agricultural products if their <b>import</b> <b>volume</b> exceeds defined trigger levels, or if prices fall below specified trigger levels. Its purpose is to prevent disruption of domestic markets due to import surges or abnormally low import prices. The SSG applies only to products that are (1) subject to tarrification and (2) {{in cases where the}} country has designated a productas eligible for the SSG in its Schedule of Commitments. It can apply only to imports that exceed tariff-rate quota volumes. The SSG is an alternative to the general safeguard provision of the GATT and is easier to invoke because it does not require a test of injury or threat of injury. In the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, the United States, the Cairns Group, and many developing countries have proposed elimination of the SSG.|$|E
