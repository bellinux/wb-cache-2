5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E
5|$|Although motte-and-bailey castles are {{the best}} known castle design, they were not always the most {{numerous}} in any given area. A popular alternative was the ringwork castle, involving a palisade being built {{on top of a}} raised earth rampart, protected by a ditch. The choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain, as mottes were typically built on low ground, and on deeper clay and alluvial soils. Another factor may have been speed, as ringworks were faster to build than mottes. Some ringwork castles were later converted into motte-and-bailey designs, by filling in the centre of the ringwork to produce a flat-topped motte. The reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear; motte-and-bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious, or easier to defend; another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>like</b> the terpen in Netherlands, or Vorburg and Hauptburg in Lower Rhineland, raising the height of the castle was done to create a drier site.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possibility}} <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> {{the buildings}} of the Columbian Exposition, the statue {{is covered with a}} thin layer of plaster, cement, and jute fibers, which create a light but relatively durable surface.|$|E

25|$|Distributed {{hash tables}} use a more {{structured}} key-based routing {{in order to}} attain both the decentralization of Freenet and gnutella, and the efficiency and guaranteed results of Napster. One drawback <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> Freenet, DHTs only directly support exact-match search, rather than keyword search, although Freenet's routing algorithm can be generalized to any key type where a closeness operation can be defined.|$|E
25|$|Another {{causality}} characteristic, {{shared by}} Karmic theories, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>like</b> deeds lead to like effects. Thus good karma produces good {{effect on the}} actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral or emotional — that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness. The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.|$|E
25|$|LTC Caslon is a {{digitisation}} of the Lanston Type Company's 14 {{point size}} Caslon 337 of 1915 (itself {{a revival of}} the original Caslon types). This family include fonts in regular and bold weights, with fractions, ligatures, small caps (regular and regular italic only), swashes (regular italic weight only), and Central European characters. An notable feature <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>like</b> some hot metal releases of Caslon, two separate options for descenders are provided for all styles: long descenders (creating a more elegant designs) or short (allowing tighter linespacing).|$|E

25|$|Ultraviolet light (UV) is very {{effective}} at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light's disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, {{a result of}} the absorption, scattering, and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> ozone treatment, it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.|$|E
25|$|The Aboriginal {{history from}} this area is not {{especially}} well recorded. There was a mountain clan, the Ja-itma-thang, centred on the Omeo area, but this clan would have interacted regularly with nearby tribes, including the Gunai or Kurnai of Gippsland proper. Population levels are uncertain, but were likely highly underestimated by European settlers, especially with consideration given {{to the fact that}} observation in the mountains and forests of Gippsland is far more difficult than in the more open parts of Australia. What is clear <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>like</b> elsewhere, population levels quickly declined following European occupation due to both disease and conflict, and people from this clan are no longer found in the area.|$|E
25|$|Anti-aircraft {{artillery}} remains {{important to}} PLAN combatants, but its concept has been radically changed recently. All new combatants {{and those that}} have been upgraded now possess a fully automatic variant of the 37mm cannon. This system is known as the Type 76A dual anti-aircraft artillery system (180 rounds per minute engaging at 4,500 meters). The Type 76A is a direct descendant of the Type 76 twin 37mm gun, which in turn, is the successor of Type 61 manual twin 37mm gun. Although the Type 76 twin 37mm gun is fully automatic, it has an open turret and thus is subject to harsh environment, which causes reliability problems. Another shortcoming of the Type 76 twin 37mm gun <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>like</b> its manually operated predecessor, it lacks fire control systems.|$|E

500|$|Hana (花, flower): In the Kadensho (Instructions on the Posture of the Flower), Zeami {{describes}} hana saying [...] "after you {{master the}} secrets of all things and exhaust the possibilities of every device, the hana that never vanishes still remains." [...] The true Noh performer seeks to cultivate a rarefied relationship with his audience {{similar to the way}} that one cultivates flowers. [...] What is notable about hana <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> a flower, it is meant to be appreciated by any audience, no matter how lofty or how coarse his upbringing. [...] Hana comes in two forms. [...] Individual hana is the beauty of the flower of youth, which passes with time, while [...] "true hana" [...] is the flower of creating and sharing perfect beauty through performance.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} acclaim surrounding the album also helped to shift {{attention away from}} the melodious, synth-driven, and funk-induced G-funk subgenre, which dominated the charts for some time after Dr. Dre's The Chronic (1992). Citing the example of Snoop Dogg's wildly popular Doggystyle (released six months prior to Nas' debut) author Matthew Gasteier writes, [...] "The first thing immediately noticeable about the [...] review, <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> essentially every other review about Illmatic in publications like Vibe, Spin, Rolling Stones, and The New York Times, it mentions Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle in the first paragraph." [...] That nearly every reviewer felt the need to contextualize their response to Illmatic within the frame of West Coast G-Funk [...] "is a reminder of just how pervasive the style was within the hip hop world and the music community as a whole." ...|$|E
500|$|Its {{association}} with storms makes the storm petrel a bird of bad omen to mariners; they {{are said to}} either foretell or cause bad weather. A more prosaic explanation of their appearance in rough weather <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> most oceanic seabirds, they rely on the winds to support them in flight and just sit on the water surface when becalmed. The birds were sometimes thought to be the souls of perished sailors, and killing a petrel was believed to bring bad luck. The petrel's reputation led to the old name of witch, although the commonest of the folk names is Mother Carey's Chicken, a name also used for storm petrels in general in the UK and USA from at least 1767. This is believed to be a corruption of mater cara (dear mother, the Virgin Mary), a reference to the supernatural Mother Carey, or a superstitious modification of an earlier Mother Mary's Chicken to reduce the potency of the religious name. The Mother Carey character appears a number of times in literature. In the Cicely Fox Smith poem [...] "Mother Carey", she calls old sailors to return to the sea, but in John Masefield's poem of the same name she is seen as a wrecker of ships. She appears as a fairy in Charles Kingsley's The Water Babies and is depicted in one of Jessie Willcox Smith's illustrations for the book.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{constraint}} <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> all sailing vessels, sailing warships {{could not}} sail {{directly into the}} wind.

Holding the weather gage, i.e. being upwind of one's opponent, conferred considerable tactical advantages.|$|R

500|$|Wrapped in Red {{was first}} {{released}} internationally on October 25, 2013 by RCA Records through Sony Music Entertainment. It then received a North American release on October 29, 2013 by RCA {{as part of}} its holiday promotional campaign with the soundtracks to the feature films Black Nativity and The Best Man Holiday, with Wrapped in Red being promulgated as the one that will transcend formats and become a new holiday classic. In an interview with Billboard, RCA marketing executive Aaron Borns remarked that the album was their main release of the holidays, quoting: [...] "The angle on this album <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> all great Christmas records, it's about amazing vocal performances. That's what this is intended to be - an album launched this year but timeless and genre-defying." [...] In preparation for its release in the United States, RCA shipped a half-million units on Amazon.com and Target, which exclusively released a deluxe edition. A red LP pressing of Wrapped in Red by United Record Pressing followed the CD release on November 25, 2013, marking the first time an album by Clarkson was released on a vinyl record. A deluxe LP and CD edition was also released on the Sony Music store, which included a scarf, a holiday ornament and a snow globe, all of which were decorated in red as inspired from the album. An international promotion campaign was also planned for Clarkson, but was later halted due to her pregnancy. On October 21, 2014, Wrapped in Red was reissued by RCA with a special edition CD+DVD release exclusive to Walmart stores in the United States. A green LP pressing of the album would also be issued with a limited 500-copy release on December 9, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{point of}} {{similarity}} <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> Wright, many of Lautner's houses were sited in elevated locations or [...] "difficult" [...] sites— hillsides or seashores— and were expressly {{designed to take}} full advantage of the vistas these sites offered; he also followed Wright's dictum of building on a slope rather than on the very top of a hill.|$|E

2500|$|The {{functional}} drawback of a thyristor <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> a diode, it only conducts in one direction. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, {{called a}} TRIAC, {{is able to}} work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the TRIAC can conduct in both directions, reactive loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the AC power cycle. Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily inductive motor loads usually {{requires the use of}} a [...] "snubber" [...] circuit around the TRIAC to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power. Inverse parallel SCRs can also be used in place of the triac; because each SCR in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it, the SCRs, unlike TRIACs, are sure to turn off. The [...] "price" [...] to be paid for this arrangement, however, is the added complexity of two separate, but essentially identical gating circuits.|$|E
