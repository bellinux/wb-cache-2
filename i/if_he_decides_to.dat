2500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] ""Objects in the Mirror" [...] and [...] "Aquarium" [...] are {{surprisingly}} self-reflective, but the dumb-fun party jams are half as infectious as before, {{and twice as}} misogynistic." [...] Chayne Japal of Exclaim! stated, [...] "Mac Miller emphatically joins a higher tier of rap artists with Watching Movies, an effort that at once silences his detractors and rewards his faithful following."

Sonnet Four follows these very themes with the speaker praising his friend, the young man, for his beauty, he moves on to say that his friend not having children would be inexcusable, when he says [...] "Then how when nature calls thee to be gone: What acceptable audit canst though leave?" [...] (lines 11–12) Here the speaker is using the unpredictability of nature to try to convince his friend to hurry up and have children. He also tries to appeal to his friend's emotions by saying, [...] "For having traffic with thyself alone, / Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive" [...] (lines 9-10). The speaker is saying that is wrong and deceives the friend's own self <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> remain single and childless. Line 11 also contains a sexually suggestive play on words when the speaker says [...] "having traffic with thyself alone". The idea of being alone is used by the speaker as being the pathetic alternative to marrying and having a family.|$|E
