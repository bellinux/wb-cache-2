25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
2500|$|India {{entered the}} final day with ten wickets in hand and a further 193 runs to get. Should they win the match, it would be their first in Australian soil in 23 years, {{moreover}} such a result {{would mean that the}} Australians would have lost their first home test match in five years. As the openers walked out on a bright and sunny morning. The morning sessions was intense and tension-filled, as the Australian bowlers, led by Gillespie, did not let the opening pair to settle down as they did the previous morning. The opening pair only added 11 runs to the score in five overs, before Gillespie nailed Chopra when the score was 48. Dravid, the next man in, was welcomed with a tremendous round of applause from the Australian crowd. However, the welcome he received from the Australian bowlers was less than warm. When he was batting on 9, Dravid edged a delivery in the offstump line from the injured Brad Williams to Gilchrist, who could not take a low and difficult chance. However, Dravid was once again given a thorough working over from Williams. The reprieve would ultimately prove to be costly. Had the wicket fallen, it would have been 73/2, but the second wicket did not get delayed much after that drop. Virender Sehwag had smashed a four off Stuart MacGill, but almost immediately, a couple of balls later, he got out MacGill, who dropped in a well-flighted delivery, luring Sehwag to step put of the crease and have a go at it, which resulted in his stumping. Then the score was 79/2. Sachin Tendulkar, coming at the fall of the second wicket was under immense pressure as he had only scored a meagre 171 runs at an average of 19 in five tests that he played since December 2002. His sequence of scores in those tests were:8, 51, 9, 32, 8, 7, 55, 1, 0 and 1. However, in this innings, Tendulkar started well, starting with a paddle-sweep for four of MacGill, and then he played some handsome cover-drives and unleashed his pulls whenever the bowlers seemed to have erred in line and length. He played patiently as well, not allowing the momentum to drop, but also not allowing aggression to get the better of him. His running was also prolific, as he ran three runs and on one occasion, he even ran four runs. Dravid, on the other end, played slowly and assuredly, with his runs coming mainly from solid batting rather than aggressive or flamboyant strokeplay. The duo added 50 runs within a span of 14.2 overs, when Dravid scored two runs off a delivery from Steve Waugh. Brad Williams came back for a second spell and tested the two batsmen severely with his reverse swing and limited pace. The partnership blossomed to 70, and just when it seemed that the two would bat Australia out of the game, Stuart MacGill struck with Tendulkar's wicket in the 47th over. MacGill, who had been until then, bowling from round the wicket, changed the angle and Tendulkar, failing to read a straighter one which pitched on middle-and-leg, offered no stroke and was given out lbw for a 59-ball 37, and the score was 149/3. Sourav Ganguly joined Dravid in the middle. The two added 21 runs from 9 overs before Ganguly was dismissed by Andy Bichel for 12, scooping a drive straight to Simon Katich. At 170/4, India required 60 runs more and Australia were smelling blood, and were back into the contest. Laxman walked out once again, to join Dravid, and he swung back the momentum of the match promptly. After scoring his first run off his first ball, Laxman was back on strike in the 57th over. He dead-batted the first two balls, but he caressed the third ball through covers, a full toss (by MacGill) to the boundary. When MacGill repeated that the next ball, Laxman sent it back to the midwicket boundary. Then he cut the last ball to the point boundary, taking 12 runs from the over. The next over, Dravid reached a well-deserved fifty from 129 balls, with a four off Andy Bichel. Thus, he completed the distinction of being the only man to reach two fifty-plus scores in the match. Dravid too, grew in confidence, and began to repeat his partner's exploits. Soon after the two had added 51 from 11 overs, Laxman was dismissed playing a rash stroke, mistiming a hoick off Katich to Bichel, but the match was already lost by then and at 221/4, India needed only 9 runs to clinch the match. Parthiv Patel delayed the moment, getting bowled around the legs by Katich, but it brought together India's two heroes with the bat an ball, Rahul Dravid and Ajit Agarkar to the crease. In the fourth ball of the 72nd over and with the score on 229/6, Dravid played a square cut, which went away to the boundary, and as he ran, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> roar and pumped his fist. Then he took off his cap and kissed the India crest on it. Steve Waugh, in a brave act of sportsmanship, gave Dravid the ball which he had cut for four, saying [...] "Well Played." ...|$|E

60|$|I could readily believe it. This Tom has a {{peculiarity}} I've {{noticed in}} other very oofy men. Nick {{him for the}} paltriest sum, and <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> squawk you can hear at Land's End. He has the stuff in gobs, but he hates giving up.|$|R
60|$|A {{second later}} <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell which was heard {{down to the}} landing.|$|E

5000|$|At {{this stage}} of proceedings, once the accused has been sentenced to death by a {{majority}} vote, the [...] "Goliat-one" [...] (man of light) attempts to save the accused's life.

While doing so, <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> scream in the most haunting voice he can, pleading for mercy.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Vizzini starts {{trying to}} rape the actress, but she fights back. She pushes {{him into the}} shower stall and <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> scream. A moment later, he falls forward with a knife wound from an assailant hiding in the shower. The assailant picks up the knife and {{approaches}} the actress. Just before he can stab her, the cops show up and shoot him. As he falls, he is revealed to be Adam Claiborne.|$|R
6000|$|As we {{drew near}} the {{topgallant}} poop there sounded {{in my ears}} a noise like a tempest, which I soon became aware was a man swearing with a prodigious vehemence in a fog-horn of a voice. [...] "Sdeath and wounds! Where is that dog-fish of a Cockle? Damn his entrails, {{and he is not}} come soon, I'll mast-head him naked, by the seven holy spritsails!" [...] And much more and worse to the same tune until we passed the door and stood before him, when <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> oath like the death-cry of a monster.|$|R
6000|$|Nobody had any {{heart to}} talk, and each watched eagerly for {{some sign of}} a sail. Tom had a spyglass, and just before sunset <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> shout: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, we {{must get}} our hosses!" [...] sang out Tom Dillon, and started forward on the run. Then <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> shrill whistle, one he knew was used for calling the animal he had been riding.|$|E
60|$|Again {{the bear}} {{came out as}} far as {{possible}} on a limb, and again <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> growl of rage and disappointment. In one way the situation was comical, and Joe might have laughed had he not felt so serious.|$|E
50|$|Mbói Tu'i has {{the form}} of an {{enormous}} serpent with a huge parrot head and a huge beak. He also has a red, forked tongue the color of blood. His skin is scaly and streaked. Feathers cover his head. He has a harmful look that frightens everyone who has the bad luck to be found with him. He patrols the swamps and protects amphibian life. He enjoys the humidity and flowers. <b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> incredible powerful and terrible squawk which can be heard from very far off and which instills terror in all who hear it. He is considered the protector of aquatic animals and the wetlands.|$|R
5000|$|On Sundays and {{holidays}} one sees couples dancing to music on larger town squares everywhere — preferably the Ländler, a leisurely waltz popular among {{girls and boys}} [...] The biggest attraction, however, even for the local farmers, is always the Schuhplatter. It ... begins with forming a circle. Then, while the girl is briefly separated from her partner and continues to follow waltz steps, the boy must perform a number of difficult movements {{to the beat of}} the music. He turns around on his axis, slaps his thighs and legs, falls to his knees, jumps in the air and throws his hat as <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> joyful whoop... Those who master the dance are cheered with vigorous applause.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ghost of}} acrobat Louis Borsalino {{is said to}} haunt the theatre. According to various {{versions}} of the story Borsalino [...] "fell to his death in the 1950s" [...] and that [...] "Stagehands say that when the theater is empty, the ghost of Borsalino can be seen swinging from the rafters. <b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> blood-curdling scream, then re-enacts his nose dive." [...] However, in reality Borsalino, {{who was a member}} of the Four Casting Pearls, was only injured when he fell 18 feet during a performance on August 28, 1935, before 800 theatregoers. Borsalino's act was not a trapeze but rather fixed towers in which the acrobats are [...] "cast from one to the other." [...] Comedian Pat Henning started his act after the accident before the curtain was pulled.|$|R
60|$|Dan {{had always}} been good at that sort of thing, and the stone landed, as intended, on the Mexican's back. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> howl of pain, so loud that several Texans at once rode up to the {{vicinity}} to learn what was the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "That for abducting Dora Stanhope and her mother!" [...] he exclaimed, and {{his fist}} landed on Crabtree's nose {{with such force}} that the former teacher was sent {{spinning}} across the room. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell of agony, and another yell when Dick hit him in the left eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you don't!" [...] cried Sam, {{and knocked}} the weapon {{from his hand}} with the brush. This action caused the hot tar to leave a heavy streak over Baxter's face and neck, and <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell that would have done credit to an Indian on the warpath.|$|E
60|$|Every {{few minutes}} he would {{remember}} {{that he was a}} pesky redskin, and pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface.

5000|$|Tom, now {{deciding}} to meet force head-on, grabs a shotgun and chases Jerry, while Jumbo hides. Jumbo's mother then pokes her {{head through the}} window and hugs him before scooping him up as Tom continues to shoot at Jerry. Jerry runs outside as Jumbo calls to him from the garage with a paintbrush, with Tom following. Jerry jumps out, followed by Jumbo and his mother, decked out in mouse colors too. The sight of this utterly terrifying display finally seems to break the poor cat completely. Tom leaps a foot back, and as his gun droops down like limp spaghetti, <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> nervous chuckle. Turning to face the camera, Tom grins insanely while mimicking the sizes of the [...] "mice" [...] before he runs off cackling maniacally (having gone insane) while breaking through a wall and a fence.|$|R
60|$|As the lad {{gained a}} safe {{spot on the}} tree limb, the bear, coming to a halt on the branch opposite, set up a growl of rage and disappointment. For a minute he {{surveyed}} the situation, then {{came out on the}} branch slowly, testing it inch by inch. As it bent down <b>he</b> retreated, <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> second growl, louder than the other.|$|R
60|$|His toes {{were just}} going down {{into one of the}} shoes when <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell which would have done credit to a wild Indian. One of the mice had found refuge in the footwear, and now it gave a bound and {{scrambled}} up inside the leg of Stowell's pajamas.|$|E
60|$|As {{they moved}} along Dick {{presently}} {{saw what he}} thought was a rock or mound of dirt in front of him, covered with snow. He was about to step over it, when something prompted him to scrape at the object with his foot. The next instant <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just it!" [...] {{broke in}} Dunston Porter. [...] "We couldn't tell who he was, either.

5000|$|In 2007 Willamette Week stated [...] " [...] Once they've {{been given}} the green light, the band hustles into the venue like a group of thirsty claim-jumpers, untangling cords and hollering impenetrable teen-speak. Each stylistically {{disparate}} member looks vaguely like daytime television's idea of a rock-'n'-roll persona: the well-groomed twee kid, the smoking psychedelic kid, the Converse-clad [...] "alternative" [...] kid. Frontman Danny Delegato is the Guns N' Roses-era caricature, his oversized sleeveless shirt and cowboy hat dwarfing his boyish frame. When asked to check his mic, <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> howl that dovetails into a squeal. The Hugs' onstage theatrics prove the band has chops to match its natural talent (it's hard to believe these are teenagers), but the members still show their age {{when it comes to}} songwriting. I leave the club without remembering any specific song—and hoping The Hugs development doesn't suffer as the band rushes forth to become the next big thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{told you}} about the fat yellow dog that {{permeated}} the Tuxton's house, didn't I? The family thought a lot of that dog, though of all the ugly brutes I ever met he was the worst. Sniffing round and growling all the time. Well, this evening he comes up to Jerry just as he's going to sit down, and starts to growl. Old Pa Tuxton looks over his glasses and licks his tongue. [...] "Rover! Rover!" [...] he says, kind of mild. [...] "Naughty Rover; he don't like strangers, I'm afraid." [...] Jerry looks at Pa Tuxton, and he looks at the dog, and I'm just expecting him to say [...] "No" [...] or [...] "Yes", same as the other night, when <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> nasty laugh--one of them bitter laughs. [...] "Ho!" [...] he says. [...] "Ho! don't he? Then perhaps he'd better get further away from them." [...] And he ups with his boot and--well, the dog hit the far wall.|$|R
5000|$|Upon collision, {{the crane}} {{operator}} passes out. Crumpling forward onto the crane's control panel, the operator unwittingly causes two levers {{to be pushed}} - these cause the crane to rotate. A giant magnet hanging from a wire is suspended from the crane and attaches itself to the parked bus. As the bus driver stands outside in the road with his back turned, his vehicle is carried away. The Russian man, still singing, notices the bus hurtling towards his window. <b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> startled scream. The old woman, still pounding against the wall, hears a loud crash. She mutters something irritably, and with a [...] "hmph", walks back to her chair. Outside, the bus continues circling through the air, the screaming Russian man plastered against its window. The building has almost entirely been destroyed. A single beam holds up the old woman's room - she presumably remains oblivious to the catastrophe outside.|$|R
6000|$|... "You rascals, I'll {{teach you}} to play tricks on me!" [...] he began, as in the {{somewhat}} dim light he made out what he thought were the forms of two crouching boys.

60|$|I {{waited for}} nothing. Gaining the Grand Walk, I saw Mr. Marmaduke's {{insignificant}} figure dodging fearfully among the roughs, whose hour it was. He traversed the Cross Walk, and twenty yards farther on dived into {{an opening in}} the high hedge bounding the Wilderness. Before he had made six paces I had him by the shoulder, and <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> shriek of fright like a woman's.|$|E
6000|$|... "That shelter is a {{long way}} off, but it won't do any harm to try it," [...] Chet reasoned, and {{expanding}} his chest, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell {{at the top of his}} lung power. He repeated the cry several times, and then listened with strained ears. No answer came back but the gentle sighing of the rising wind, as it swept through the woods.|$|E
5000|$|Tom {{lifts the}} head and whacks himself {{in an effort to}} flatten Jerry, but causes a bump on his head. Tom can no longer hide himself when Spike comes around, and finally sees through Tom's disguise, with Jerry {{clearing}} it up by holding up a sign with the words [...] "Yes, stupid, its a cat!" [...] and the jig is up. When Spike see through the truth, <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> roar like a buffalo roar and leaps into the air for the sake of revenge. Tom panics and tunnels into the ground in an attempt to escape, but Spike digs him up with his large jaws. The chase wakes up all the other dogs, who join the chase. Tom is chased {{to the top of a}} pole and Jerry with dog head starts barking at Tom. The others stop barking as they now hear Jerry. He loses the head, but retrieves it, and continues barking at Tom.|$|R
60|$|It {{was while}} he was thus engaged that Bukawai {{came out of his}} trance, his curiosity finally having gotten the better of him. No one was paying him the {{slightest}} attention.

60|$|Thinking the {{youngest}} Rover might be fooling, the first assistant teacher {{opened the door}} cautiously and peered into the dormitory. Then <b>he,</b> too, <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> cry of alarm, for the snake darted forward and made as if to bite him in the foot. Not to be caught he fell back, leaving the door open about a foot. Through this opening the snake glided and disappeared in the semi-dark hallway.|$|R
