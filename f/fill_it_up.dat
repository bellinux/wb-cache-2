25|$|Some sources {{indicate}} that the architects would first construct the storage space and then <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with hay and straw {{all the way up}} to where they could start constructing the dome. After finishing the dome, the straw would be set on fire, hence clearing the space inside. However holes can be seen in the walls of many storage spaces where scaffolding perhaps may have been used.|$|E
25|$|Four {{accounts}} of Berti's experiment exist, but a simple model of his experiment consisted of filling with water a long tube that had both ends plugged, then standing the tube in a basin already full of water. The bottom {{end of the}} tube was opened, and water that had been inside of it poured out into the basin. However, {{only part of the}} water in the tube flowed out, and the level of the water inside the tube stayed at an exact level, which happened to be 10.3m, the same height Baliani and Galileo had observed that was limited by the siphon. What was most important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> This seemed to suggest the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water.|$|E
2500|$|Included in {{the series}} were the [...] "R1" [...] through [...] "R5" [...] albums (R for Réédition, French for republication). The R5 album was not {{published}} until 1986; its non-existence until then had been a mystery. This {{was due to the}} republication of the real first five books: they were published on a smaller format and from this small ones they couldn't make five big ones. After several years it was decided to <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with early unpublished material and some advertising gags for PiedBœuf.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{southern}} breakwater, barge construction was used. [...] The southern side of Sebastos {{was much more}} exposed than the northern side, requiring sturdier breakwaters. [...] Instead of using the double planked method filled with rubble, the architects sank barges filled with layers of pozzolana concrete and lime sand mortar. [...] The barges were similar to boxes without lids, and were constructed using mortise and tenon joints, the same technique used in ancient boats, to ensure they remained watertight. [...] The barges were ballasted with 0.5 meters of pozzolana concrete and floated out to their position. [...] With alternating layers, pozzolana based and lime based concretes were hand placed inside the barge to sink it and <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the surface.|$|E

60|$|Rollo {{sat down}} on the chips, and began picking them up, all around him, and {{throwing}} them into his basket. He soon <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and then lugged it in, emptied it into the chip-bin, and then returned, and began to <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|R

50|$|The ancient breech-loading {{guns were}} not so {{difficult}} to load, as the powder chamber of the gun was removable and was charged by simply <b>filling</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with powder and ramming a wad on top to prevent the escape of the powder.|$|R

60|$|Not {{long after}} there yawned a terrible chasm in the Forum, most likely from an earthquake, but {{nothing seemed to}} <b>fill</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and the priests and augurs {{consulted}} their oracles about it. These made answer that it would only close on receiving of what was most precious. Gold and jewels were thrown in, but it still seemed bottomless, and at last the augurs declared that it was courage {{that was the most}} precious thing in Rome. Thereupon a patrician youth named Marcus Curtius decked himself in his choicest robes, put on his armor, took his shield, sword, and spear, mounted his horse, and leapt headlong into the gulf, thus giving it the most precious of all things, courage and self-devotion.

60|$|The oxen {{drew the}} sleigh along very easily. The snow was quite deep {{for a little}} distance, and then it became less so; {{but it was very}} dark, and it was {{difficult}} for Jonas to follow his track.
