25|$|Actual {{position}} of Don Javier versus changes being introduced {{by his son}} remains highly unclear and subject to conflicting accounts, most pursued by highly partisan historians. Some claim that from the onset he nurtured democratic sentiments and was uneasy about ultra-reactionary deviation of Carlism. They maintain that Don Javier was fully aware and entirely supportive of transformation triggered by Carlos Hugo, intended as renovation of genuine Carlist thought and as shaking the Traditionalist distortions off. Another group of students claims that aging Don Javier, {{at that time in}} his late 70s, was increasingly detached from Spanish issues; reportedly unaware of political course sponsored by Carlos Hugo, he was perhaps manipulated – and at later stages incapacitated - by his son and three daughters, who intercepted all incoming correspondence and re-edited the outgoing one. Finally, one more group of scholars refrains from conclusions and limit themselves to referring letters, <b>declarations</b> <b>and</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|E

The literature show that mercury released from dental amalgam restorations does not contribute to systemic disease or systemic toxicological effects. No significant effects on the immune system have been demonstrated with the amounts of mercury released from dental amalgam restorations. Only very rarely have there been reported allergic reactions to mercury from amalgam restorations. No evidence supports a relationship between mercury released from dental amalgam and neurological diseases. Almost all of the declarations accessed by the internet stated by official organizations concluded that current data are not sufficient to relate various complaints and mercury release from dental amalgam. Conclusions. Available scientific data do not justify the discontinuation of amalgam use from dental practice or replacement with alternative restorative dental materials...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis called "Danish and Swedish {{reactions to}} the Brexit referendum outcome" deals with the immediate reactions of two member countries {{on the outcome of}} British referendum and reflections on initial negotiations. The decision of British voters did not only cause a political earthquake on British side, the departure of Great Britain has no parallel in sixty year history of European communities. It is clear, that this decision will have major implications on both the internal cohesion of the European Union and the position of each member state towards European integration. The aim of this thesis is to analyse <b>declarations</b> <b>and</b> <b>statements</b> of Danish and Swedish government officials and observe, whether these participants mention these particular factors, that being the economic interconnection, similar perception of European integration and certain closeness in EU decision-making as their reasons. Both Denmark and Sweden had always been considered Great Britain's closest allies, they share significant economic bonds between each other and have always been considered as countries with the highest inclination towards Euroscepticism, for this reason I expect these factors to be discussed.

40|$|Abstract The {{knowledge}} that {{the environment in which}} we live, grow and play, can have negative or positive impacts on our health and development is not new. However the recognition that adverse environments can significantly and specifically affect the growth and development of a child from early intrauterine life through to adolescence, as well as impact their health later in adulthood, is relatively recent and has not fully reached health care providers involved in paediatric care. Over the past 15 years, world <b>declarations</b> <b>and</b> <b>statements</b> on children's rights, sustainable development, chemical safety and most recently climate change, have succeeded in cultivating a global focus on children's health and their right to a healthy environment. Many international calls for research in the area, have also been able to identify patterns of environmental diseases in children, assess children's exposures to many environmental toxicants, identify developmental periods of vulnerability, and quantify the cost benefits to public health systems and beyond, of addressing environmentally related diseases in children. Transferring this information to front-line health care providers and increasing their awareness about the global burden of disease attributed to the environment and children's especial vulnerability to environmental threats is the salient aim of this commentary. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Esterel is an {{imperative}} synchronous {{language for}} control-dominant reactive systems. The combination of imper-ative structures and the perfect synchrony hypothesis often result in schizophrenic statements. Previous studies explain {{the characteristics of}} schizophrenia as the instantaneous reentrance to block statements: local signal <b>declarations</b> <b>and</b> parallel <b>statements.</b> In practice, however, most instantly-reentered block statements do not cause any problems in Esterel compilation. In this paper, we refine schizophrenic problems in terms of signal emissions, and suggest an algorithm to detect harmful schizophrenia using reachability on control flow graphs (CFGs) in Esterel. Our algorithm performs well in analyzing practical programs. Moreover, it can be easily applied to existing compilers. I...|$|R

40|$|Medical ethics {{education}} in residency training {{is one of}} the hot topics of continuous medical education debates. Its importance and necessity is constantly stressed in <b>declarations</b> <b>and</b> <b>statements</b> on national and international level. Parallel to the major structural changes in the organization and the finance model of health care system, patient-physician relationship, identity of physicianship, social perception and status of profession are changing. Besides, scientific developments and technological advancements create possibilities that never exists before, and bring new ethical dilemmas along with. To be able to transplant human organs has created two major problems for instance; procurement of organs in sufficient numbers, and allocating them to the patients in need by using some prioritizing criteria. All those new and challenging questions force the health care workers to find authentic and justifiable solutions while keeping the basic professional values. In that sense, proper medical ethics {{education in}} undergraduate and postgraduate term that would make physician-to-be’s and student-physicians acquire the core professional values and skill to notice, analyze and develop justifiable solutions to ethical problems is paramount. This article aims to express the importance of medical ethics education in residency training, and to propose major topics and educational methods to be implemented into. To this aim, first, undergraduate medical education, physician’s working conditions, the exam of selection for residency training, and educational environment were revised, and then, some topics and educational methods, which are oriented to educate physicians regarding the professional values that they should have, were proposed...|$|E

Scholars across the world are now better equipped with services offered by open access knowledge repositories for self-archiving their intellectual outcomes of scholarly research, i. e., research publications and research reports. Global open access statements enlighten academic researchers to make use of Green open access channels for harnessing global visibility, readability and cross-border knowledge transfer. Open access (OA) institutional repositories, national repositories or disciplinary knowledge repositories are considered as Green open access channels, where researchers have their freedom to share and distribute their research publications in digital formats. Besides, major OA <b>declarations</b> <b>and</b> <b>statements,</b> endorsed by the scientific institutions and communities, have identified Gold OA as major channel for scholarly communications.

Thus, every academic researcher, after completing a research study, tries to identify possible publishing avenues for communicating research results. In this Unit, various authors’ tools for identifying different self-archiving avenues and their credentials are briefly discussed.
