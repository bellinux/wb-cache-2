5|$|Lucy only {{appears in}} the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it seems as if nature joins with the narrator in {{mourning}} for her, and the reader <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> into this mutual sorrow.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} stage, the 16 {{teams from the}} South Zone <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into eight ties, and the 16 teams from the North Zone <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into the other eight ties.

5|$|According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano {{borrowed}} {{heavily from}} the commedia dell'arte tradition in Gianni Schicchi. Schicchi himself recalls the roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> from Pantaloon, while the poverty-stricken Betto recalls the buffoonish valet Zany. Doctor Spinelloccio recalls the classic doctor from the commedia dell'arte, Balanzone even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death momentarily scares the relatives, and his captain, are stock characters from commedia dell'arte.|$|E
5|$|Also, third eyelid. A {{transparent}} or translucent third eyelid that <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> {{across the}} eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E

50|$|Each group {{contained}} {{one team}} from Pot 1, one team from Pot 2, and one team from Pot 3. For political reasons, Russia and Ukraine could not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> {{in the same}} group or in groups scheduled to be played {{on the same day}} (due to a potential clash of teams and clash of fans). Therefore, if Russia <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group B, Ukraine had to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group C or D, and if Russia <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group C or D, Ukraine had to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group A or B.|$|R
50|$|Teams {{from the}} same {{confederation}} <b>were</b> not <b>drawn</b> into the same group, therefore Egypt <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> into Group B. Also as result, Italy and Spain <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into different groups.|$|R
5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|As I {{made clear}} in my {{telegram}} to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs {{me that the}} rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.|$|E
5|$|By {{including}} celestial motifs in clothing {{it becomes}} {{possible for the}} wearer to make claims the power on Earth <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> from above.

In North America shields depicted in Comanche petroglyphs appear to include Venus symbolism.|$|E
5000|$|Clip {{regions are}} {{commonly}} specified to improve render performance. A well-chosen clip allows the renderer {{to save time}} and energy by skipping calculations related to pixels that the user cannot see. Pixels that will <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> said to be within the clip region. Pixels that will not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> outside the clip region. More informally, pixels that will not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> said to be [...] "clipped." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{opening and}} ending scenes <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> by Mizushima; the scene {{involving}} {{the debut of}} the film's villain <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Soichi Masui; the middle section of the film <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Shingo Kaneko; Edward Elric's return to his homeworld <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Masahiro Ando; action scenes <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> by Shinji Aramaki; and the battle between Wrath and Gluttony <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Yutaka Nakamura.

Seven hundred of the film's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film's release.|$|R

5|$|Given {{that the}} {{matching}} vocabulary and astronomical content <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> from throughout Polynesia, far afield from Easter Island, this supports {{the argument that}} rongorongo was not a recent, localized development; rather it {{was a product of}} thriving Polynesian trade and cultural interaction throughout the Pacific. There is additional evidence in favor of this theory, such as the identification of Polaris among the glyphs, which is only visible from the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Raoul Silva's attack on MI6, a cryptic message sets in motion events that will see James Bond come face-to-face with the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. As Gareth Mallory, the newly appointed M, continues fighting political pressures that threaten the future of MI6, Bond follows a trail from Mexico to Austria and Morocco as he <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> into a confrontation with an enemy from his past; one who holds a dangerous secret that will force him to question the value of everything he has fought to protect.|$|E
5|$|In the epilogue, as September (Michael Cerveris) the Observer, watches, a {{blood sample}} from the child <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> discreetly by one of Fauxlivia's captors posing as an orderly, who {{transfers}} it to Brandon (Ryan McDonald), who is revealed to have developed the accelerated pregnancy procedure under Walternate's orders. Meanwhile, Lincoln and Charlie become somewhat distrustful of Walternate after learning what he hid from them. They consider that Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) disappeared {{around the same time}} that Fauxlivia returned, and wonder what else Walternate is hiding from them.|$|E

5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is sent {{to evaluate}} a prospective member of the group, who perform private investigative work and liaise with law enforcement.

5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often seems to indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E
25|$|France and the Republic of Ireland did {{not meet}} in the {{qualifying}} matches for the 2012 European Championships.
