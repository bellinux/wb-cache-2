The cylinder is loaded with three thin (2 mm) lead plates weighing 2 kg each. The plates with dimensional 370 x 240 x 2 mm are mounted with one strip of double sided foam tape inside the cylinder. To estimate the behavior of the cylinder the strains are measured when the cylinder is rotating at 1620 and 2200 revolution per minute (rpm).

40|$|Enzyme {{technology}} is explored on wool fibers to prevent shrinkage and consolidation behavior during washing of woolen bed coverings using normal household machine conditions. Enzyme modification of wool fibers after two different pretreatments has been realized on industrial scale. Enlarged proteolytic enzyme by chemical modification was applied successfully to prevent substantial fiber strength loss. Felt-ball {{analysis of the}} fibers as obtained from this industrial process showed substantial improvement in felting resistance. Further processing of these enzyme-modified fibers and finally integration in bed covering quilts have been executed successfully on industrial production lines. The observed fiber losses during processing were {{in the range of}} 4. 5 - 6 % which is comparable with that of nonmodified fibers. The machine-washability of these produced bed covering quilts was tested in a <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> using both wool and normal wash programs applied at different temperatures. It appeared that, contrary to the good washing results in terms of shrinkage and consolidation resistance using the wool program at moderate temperatures, this resistance is marginal when washed with the normal washing program with higher mechanical agitation level or with the wool program at elevated temperature. This result was different from that obtained with woolen fabrics and explained by the less-structured organisation of fibers within a fleece. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} huge future {{potential}} in identification, monitoring, and sensor applications, textile-integrated radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags {{have been an}} active topic of research during the recent years. A passive, battery-free RFID tag is composed of an antenna and an integrated circuit (IC) and, when integrated into a textile material, offers a cheap, unobtrusive, and completely maintenance-free wireless platform for versatile body-centric systems. One of the key challenges to be addressed, before the large-scale deployment of these textile RFID components, is their ability to withstand continuous washing, which {{has been found to}} be a major reliability issue and is currently actively studied. This thesis presents a washing reliability study of passive UHF RFID textile tags with three different coating materials. The tag antennas were fabricated by brush-painting silver ink on a 100 % cotton fabric. After attaching the ICs, the ready RFID tags were fully coated with three different protective coating materials: regular textile glue, white epoxy coating, and silicone rubber. The coated tags were washed 15 times in a <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and tested wirelessly after each washing cycle for the total of 15 washing cycles. Before washing, all tags exhibited good performance and attainable read ranges of about 10 meters, under the European RFID emission regulation. Based on the reliability test and the done measurements, all three protective coating materials can successfully protect the RFID tags from the effects of washing and especially the textile glue was found to be suitable coating for the brush-painted tags. Silicon rubber also can be said as a suitable coating. White epoxy glue coating does make the tags water resistant but it is constantly losing its ability of protection after each washing cycle and, in the long run, it can be said that it does not make the tags washable...|$|E

40|$|<b>Household</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> (WMs) launder soiled {{clothes and}} textiles, {{but do not}} {{sterilize}} them. We investigated the microbial exchange occurring in five household WMs. Samples from a new cotton T-shirt were laundered together with a normal laundry load.

The number of living bacteria was generally not lower in the WM effluent water as compared to the influent water. The laundering process caused a microbial exchange of influent water bacteria, skin-, and clothes related bacteria and biofilm-related bacteria in the WM. A variety of biofilm-producing bacteria were enriched in the effluent after laundering, although their presence in the cotton sample was low. Nearly all bacterial genera detected on the initial cotton sample were still present in the washed cotton samples. A selection for typical skin- and clothes related microbial species occurred in the cotton samples after laundering. Accordingly, malodour-causing microbial species might be further distributed to other clothes. The bacteria on the ingoing textiles contributed for a large part to the microbiome found in the textiles after laundering...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{sustainability}} challenges our society currently face have arisen as unanticipated {{side effects of}} our own modern developments. This thesis investigates if unintended consequences and perspectives are fully addressed by traditional methods for providing decision-making support within {{the sustainability}} domain. For that purpose, Systems Thinking is utilised in three cases: in the first, Systems Thinking is used to analyse sustainability issues relating to the current product design paradigm. In the second case, Systems Thinking is applied to two product systems – <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and conventional passenger vehicles. The third case discusses different stakeholder perspectives in environmental decision-making and proposes a way to combine the ESA tools LCA, LCC and CBA in order to consider the different stakeholder perspectives. Results of the first case {{point out that the}} practices within the current design paradigm are focused on innovations and improvements in material and energy efficiency. These practices have led to the following unintended consequences: consumption rebound effects, increased waste, pollution, negative externalities, economic inequalities and other environmental and social negative impacts. These unintended consequences are represented in a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD). The diagram graphically illustrates how these unintended consequences influence one another and interact by means of cause-effect linkages and reinforcing feedback loops. A novel conceptual framework named Sustainability-Driven Systems-Oriented Design is proposed to work within broader system boundaries in order to address possible negative side effects that micro-level gains could have on macro-level losses. In the case of the two product systems, a CLD for <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and conventional passenger vehicles is developed. The CLDs represent how selected variables interact by means of cause-effect associations to affect environmental impacts of the products. The CLD technique appears to be a useful way to connect quantitative assessment (from Life Cycle Assessment) with qualitative analysis (from Systems Thinking). In the third case it is argued that stakeholders tend to adopt different system boundaries and make assumptions according to their perspective when they use ESA tools in environmental decision-making. A way to combine ESA tools is suggested to facilitate the observation of the environmental decision from different viewpoints. It concludes, to some extent, that traditional methods for providing decision-making support can handle certain parameters that may result in unintended consequences. Systems Thinking may assist in the process of performing qualitative analyses of what is important to consider in order to strengthen the robustness of, and improve on the recommended actions from, quantitative detailed analyses.

40|$|In the future, global {{energy balance}} of a smart grid {{system can be}} {{achieved}} by its agents deciding on their own power demand locally and the exchange of these decisions. In this paper, we model a network of <b>households</b> with <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> programs that can be shifted in time so that the overall power demand is flattened. The network model describes how the information of power imbalance of individual agents can be exchanged in the system. Additionally, dynamics, <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> constraints and power demand forecasts of each agent are included. Compared to existing smart grid models with hierarchical structures, our model, together with a market mechanism, achieves the power balance in the system in a completely distributed way.

40|$|Specific methodologies that {{consider}} a more comprehensive/diverse {{set of parameters}} must be explored by the LCA community. This study utilises the Group Model-Building (GMB) method to identify, and Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) technique to make explicit, variables which are not typically considered in LCA studies, but may have significant influence upon environmental impacts through cause-effect links and feedback loops in product systems. A literature review on LCAs concerning <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and conventional passenger cars product systems is performed to investigate what are the commonly used functional unit, life cycle stages and system boundaries. Two parallel GMB sessions were organised to elicit relevant variables and relations in the product systems and build in a first version of CLDs. Individual interviews with the participants were undertaken to refine and validate the system models. Final versions of the system models were built. GMB and CLD {{can serve as a}} basis for (i) delimitating appropriated system boundaries for LCA and (ii) identifying variables/areas to be included in sensitivity and scenario analysis. Sensitivity and scenario analysis examine the influence that those variables/areas have on the environmental impacts of the product and describe both different contexts and profiles of users.

40|$|On {{background}} of the framework of Sustianability, this thesis aims at understanding Energy consumption in households, and uses the example of Norway as having three times higher electricity consumption per capita than the OECD average. The work is inspired by interdisciplinarity and thus makes use of several approaches. The main methodological tool is in-depth interviews, conducted with 19 households. Two main analytical windows is chosen to understand the field, hereunder everyday life and <b>household</b> technologies (<b>washing</b> <b>machines,</b> tumble dryers and dishwashers). Theoretically, the thesis makes use of Pierre Bourdieu {{and the concept of}} habitus, Marianne Gullestads sociological writings on everyday life, as well as applying Actor-Network theory (Bruno Latour) and Domestication (Roger Silverstone) to looking at the processes of interaction between users and household technologies. However, the various approaches are fused by a focus on practice. The work argues that in the everyday life practices that together form the amount of energy use in households, people are not guided by the directly reflexive processes of thinking about rationality, economy and sustainability but rather by routines and habits within the semi-conscious domain of habitus. Moreover, an important finding is the aspect that we cannot predict the cosnequences of a technology. When working with the notion that for example installing a more energy efficient <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> will lead to an decrease in energy consumption, we need to also pay attention to the concrete practices of use...|$|R
40|$|Washing laundry {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} housework tasks in the world. <b>Washing</b> <b>machines,</b> performing this task already in many private households, are now responsible for about 2 % of the global electricity consumption. Worldwide, more than 840 million domestic <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> are in use, with an annual consumption exceeding 92 TWh of electricity and 19 billion m 3 of water as well as causing emissions of more than 62 megatons CO 2 eq. In North America, Western Europe and Pacific OECD countries, most <b>households</b> own a <b>washing</b> <b>machine.</b> In these economies standard and label policy programs already addressed and reduced the specific electricity and water consumption of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> per <b>wash</b> cycle. Nevertheless, in other world regions, the level of ownership for <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> is still well below saturation and high growth rates can be observed in developing and newly industrialising countries. As <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> use water, electricity, chemical substances and process time as resources, also the absolute worldwide resource consumption and emissions of these appliances are still on the rise. Due to different washing habits and practices as well as types of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> in different world regions, the specific consumption of resources for doing the laundry is varying to a large extent.

40|$|Purpose – The {{effects of}} social {{learning}} and network externalities in {{the diffusion of}} a new product imply {{that there should be}} local spillovers from existing owners to new adopters in a closely-related community. Using the 1999 durable consumption survey data in rural China, this paper examines the importance of local spillovers in the diffusion of two major durable goods, <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and refrigerator. Design/methodology/approach – Based on an October 1999 survey of rural durable goods consumption conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the authors examine the likelihood of rural <b>households</b> adopting a <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and a refrigerator during 1998 - 1999, respectively. Findings – The estimation results indicate that a household is more likely to buy its first durable good in villages where a large share of households already own one. Further evidence suggests that these patterns are unlikely to be explained by unobserved local characteristics. When examined in more detail, the extent of local spillovers appears to be positively related to household education level. Originality/value – Our study reveals the importance of local spillovers in the diffusion of these two durables. Specifically, 64 % of <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> adoptions starting at 1998 are due to the spillovers. For refrigerator adoptions, this percentage is 55 %. Furthermore, as far as we know, our study is among the first to test and provide evidence on the interaction between education level and local spillovers based on the learning hypothesis. ...|$|R

40|$|Determining the {{end uses}} {{of water in}} {{residential}} (and other sector) properties can facilitate a more proactive approach to water demand management. The analysis of end use data can reveal the predictors of water demand for different end uses (for example, <b>household</b> demographics, <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> efficiency), thus enabling the government and water businesses to implement targeted communication strategies and rebate programs. This paper represents the first research outputs of the South East Queensland Residential End Use Study (SEQREUS), including a winter 2010 end use breakdown, assessment {{of the influence of}} different demographic and appliance/fixture efficiency categories, and winter average day diurnal patterns of end uses. End Use Analysis Approach Smart metering has enhanced the capture, transfer, storage and analysis of high-resolution water consumption data (Stewart et al. 2010). However, an accurate end use study goes beyond smart metering, requiring the triangulation of data from diverse data sets (Willis et al. 2009 a). Information on the descriptive, social and behavioural aspects of metered properties, stock inventory audit of water appliances/fixtures, and water use diaries are essential for accurate flow trace analysis (Athuraliya et al. 2008; White et al. 2004). Software such as Trace Wizard ® has provided a key link between measured data and end use disaggregation (DeOreo et al. 1999).
