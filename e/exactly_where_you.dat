Also, Punch, get into a habit of taking notes, and learn to write a good hand, for editors and publishers won't care to be bothered with you if you don't, and maybe the time will come when you won't be able to make out your own writing.

5000|$|Chop Chop Tennis is an iOS game {{developed}} by Gamerizon and released on May 5, 2010.

[...] CommonSenseMedia gave the game 5/5, writing [...] "CHOP CHOP TENNIS has a look that screams [...] "kid game." [...] It's characters resemble extras from The PowerPuff Girls. And while there's nothing here that wouldn't be appropriate for kids, this is actually a sophisticated tennis game {{with one of the most}} satisfying control schemes around. As long as you swipe your finger after the ball's first bounce, you'll hit it. But <b>exactly</b> how and <b>where</b> <b>you</b> hit it is dependent on the angle, curve, and speed of your swipe. It's an incredibly intuitive and visceral way to play. Add that to its funky art style and you've got one of the best tennis game around." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You see, {{the trouble}} is,' resumed the young man, 'my governor, who's {{the head of}} the firm, is all for doing things {{according}} to precedent.

I told our friends here all about it, and as he went back to the boat again one of them pitched into him, and gave him such a {{tremendous}} licking that I hear he had to be carried on board. As soon as he got on board the Northampton sailed, so you see here we both are. I have written off to your father and mine, giving them a full account of the whole affair, and saying what a brute Collet had been on the whole voyage.

[...] The prospect of action and the exercise of his habitual skill seemed to brace him at once; he seemed a different man as he set about his work. I asked Mrs. Grant to hold the tourniquet, and went and stood where he had stood and looked where, in the darkness, he had pointed. I could not but notice the mechanical exactness of his mind, as when he showed me where he had stood, or drew, as a matter of course, the revolver from his pistol pocket, and pointed with it. The chair from which I had risen still stood in its place. Then I asked him to point with his hand only, as I wished to move in the track of his shot.|$|E

Over 150 radio stations participated in broadcasting the band's new daily material, along with MTV, VH1, and digital music retailers like iTunes, as well as Cell phone companies. AOL featured the Chili Peppers as their [...] "Artist of the Month" [...] in June, streaming interviews and live performances of the band free of charge; they also sold an MP3 of [...] "By the Way", the record's first single, for ninety-nine cents and raffled off tickets that gave fans a chance to see the band in Japan in November.|$|R
60|$|The most {{favourite}} form of thunderbolt is {{the polished}} stone hatchet or 'celt' {{of the newer}} stone age men. I have never heard the very rude chipped and unpolished axes of the older drift men or cave men described as thunderbolts: they are too rough and shapeless ever to attract attention from any except professed archæologists. Indeed, the wicked {{have been known to}} scoff at them freely as mere accidental lumps of broken flint, and to deride the notion of their being due in any way to deliberate human handicraft. These are the sort of people who would regard a grand piano as a fortuitous concourse of atoms. But the shapely stone hatchet of the later neolithic farmer and herdsman is usually a beautifully polished wedge-shaped piece of solid greenstone; and its edge has been ground to such a delicate smoothness that it seems rather like a bit of nature's exquisite workmanship than a simple relic of prehistoric man. There is something very fascinating about the naïf belief that the neolithic axe is a genuine unadulterated thunderbolt. You dig it up in the ground <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> would expect a thunderbolt (if there were such things) to be. It is heavy, smooth, well shaped, and neatly pointed at one end. If it could really descend in a red-hot state from the depths of the sky, launched forth like a cannon-ball by some fierce discharge of heavenly artillery, it would certainly prove a very formidable weapon indeed; and one could easily imagine it scoring the bark of some aged oak, or tearing off the tiles from a projecting turret, exactly as the lightning is so well known to do in this prosaic workaday world of ours. In short, there is really nothing on earth against the theory of the stone axe being a true thunderbolt, except the fact that it unfortunately happens to be a neolithic hatchet.|$|E
6000|$|Thus the Cæsars {{and their}} {{fortunes}} put {{out to sea}} with their subs and their sad-eyed engineers, and their long-suffering signallers--I do not even know the technical name of the sin which causes {{a man to be}} born a destroyer-signaller in this life--and the little yellow shells stuck all about where they can be easiest reached. The rest of their acts is written for the information of the proper authorities. It reads like a page of Todhunter. But the masters of merchant-ships could tell more of eyeless shapes, barely outlined on the foam of their own arrest, who shout orders through the thick gloom alongside. The strayed and anxious neutral knows them when their searchlights pin him across the deep, or their syrens answer the last yelp of his as steam goes out of his torpedoed boilers. They stand by to catch and soothe him in his pyjamas at the gangway, collect his scattered lifeboats, and see a warm drink into him before they turn to hunt the slayer. The drifters, punching and reeling up and down their ten-mile line of traps; the outer trawlers, drawing the very teeth of Death with water-sodden fingers, are grateful for their low, guarded signals; and when the Zeppelin's revealing star-shell cracks darkness open above him, the answering crack of the invisible destroyers' guns comforts the busy mine-layers. Big cruisers talk to them, too; and, what is more, they talk back to the cruisers. Sometimes they draw fire--pinkish spurts of light--a long way off, where Fritz is trying to coax them over a mine-field he has just laid; or they steal on Fritz {{in the midst of his}} job, and the horizon rings with barking, which the inevitable neutral who saw it all reports as [...] "a heavy fleet action in the North Sea." [...] The sea after dark can be as alive as the woods of summer nights. Everything is <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> don't expect it, and the shyest creatures are the farthest away from their holes. Things boom overhead like bitterns, or scutter alongside like hares, or arise dripping and hissing from below like otters. It is the destroyer's business to find out what their business may be through all the long night, and to help or hinder accordingly. Dawn sees them pitch-poling insanely between head-seas, or hanging on to bridges that sweep like scythes from one forlorn horizon to the other. A homeward-bound submarine chooses this hour to rise, very ostentatiously, and signals by hand to a lieutenant in command. (They were the same term at Dartmouth, and same first ship.) ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the evening}} of a certain November day, {{two years after the}} events {{heretofore}} chronicled, Francesca Bassington steered her way through the crowd that filled the rooms of her friend Serena Golackly, bestowing nods of vague recognition as she went, but with eyes that were obviously intent on focussing one particular figure. Parliament had pulled its energies together for an Autumn Session, and both political Parties were fairly well represented in the throng. Serena had a harmless way of inviting a number of more or less public men and women to her house, and hoping that if you left them together long enough they would constitute a salon. In pursuance of the same instinct she planted the flower borders at her week-end cottage retreat in Surrey with a large mixture of bulbs, and called the result a Dutch garden. Unfortunately, though you may bring brilliant talkers into your home, you cannot always make them talk brilliantly, or even talk at all; what is worse you cannot restrict the output of those starling-voiced dullards who seem to have, on all subjects, so much to say that was well worth leaving unsaid. One group that Francesca passed was discussing a Spanish painter, who was forty-three, and had painted thousands of square yards of canvas in his time, but of whom no one in London had heard till a few months ago; now the starling-voices seemed determined that one should hear of very little else. Three women knew how his name was pronounced, another always felt that she must go into a forest and pray whenever she saw his pictures, another had noticed that there were always pomegranates in his later compositions, and a man with an indefensible collar knew what the pomegranates [...] "meant." [...] "What I think so splendid about him," [...] said a stout lady in a loud challenging voice, [...] "is the way he defies all the conventions of art while retaining all that the conventions stand for." [...] "Ah, but have you noticed--" [...] put in the man with the atrocious collar, and Francesca pushed desperately on, wondering dimly as she went, what people found so unsupportable in the affliction of deafness. Her progress was impeded for a moment by a couple engaged in earnest and voluble discussion of some smouldering question of the day; a thin spectacled young man with the receding forehead that so often denotes advanced opinions, was talking to a spectacled young woman with a similar type of forehead, and exceedingly untidy hair. It was her ambition in life to be taken for a Russian girl-student, and she had spent weeks of patient research in trying to find out <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> put the tea-leaves in a samovar. She had once been introduced to a young Jewess from Odessa, who had died of pneumonia the following week; the experience, slight as it was, constituted the spectacled young lady an authority on all things Russian in the eyes of her immediate set.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} how small service firms can improve profitability and if growth is a solution or not. Problems discussed and solutions provided will hopefully serve well to highlight points of improvement for small service firms, especially where the owners are inexperienced in business, marketing and entrepreneurship. The study is conducted {{with the aim of}} providing realistic solutions for The Norwegian Imago Institute. In the process, eight people with great insight and experience were interviewed in Norway, Sweden and Denmark and a survey sent to 250 people with 11 respondents. The paper concludes that previous experience with employment is often necessary to succeed with employment growth. However, other forms of growth proved to have great potential. In order to become more profitable, there is no magic pill. What increases the odds of success is writing a business and liquidity plan, knowing <b>exactly</b> what and <b>where</b> <b>you</b> want to go, innovative thinking about marketing, PR and standardization of services. The implication for small service firms that lack experience in business, marketing and entrepreneurship is mostly a realization that they have to change their view on profitability from thinking it’s a evil phenomenon of the information age to the fact that having healthy profitability might actually improve the service and experience. It is possible to deliver a personalized, intimate and great product, and still make great profits...|$|R
