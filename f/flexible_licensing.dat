A software-based protection key is ideal for software publishers who require <b>flexible</b> <b>license</b> delivery. The virtual nature of software keys eliminates the need to ship a physical product, thus enabling end users to quickly install and use an application with minimal fuss. Cloud-based licensing, on the other hand, provides automatic and immediate license enablement, so users can access software from any device including virtual machines and mobile devices.|$|R

40|$|Digital music players protect {{songs by}} {{enforcing}} licenses that convey specific rights for individual songs {{or groups of}} songs. For licenses specified in industry, we show that deciding whether a license authorizes a sequence of actions is NP-complete, with a restricted version of the problem solvable efficiently using a reduction to maximum network flow. The authorization algorithm used in industry is online, deciding which rights to exercise as actions occur, but we show that all online algorithms are necessarily non-monotonic: each allows actions under one license {{that it does not}} allow under a more <b>flexible</b> <b>license.</b> In one approach to achieving monotonicity, we exhibit the unique maximal set of licenses on which there exists a monotonic online algorithm. This set of well-behaved licenses induces an approximation algorithm by replacing each license with a well-behaved license. In a second approach, we consider allowing the player to revise its past decisions about which rights to exercise while still ensuring compliance with the license. We propose an efficient algorithm based on Linear Logic, with linear negation used to revise past decisions. We prove our algorithm monotonic, live, and sound with respect to the semantics of licenses. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{right to}} use US radio {{frequency}} spectrum is extremely valuable. Unlike most property rights, licenses to use radio spectrum are granted for limited terms and carry significant restrictions on how the radio spectrum is used. Economic efficiency suggests that existing license rights should be expanded to give users the flexibility to redeploy spectrum to its most valuable use and to trade licenses or unused capacity on secondary markets. Distributing these expanded rights to use radio spectrum raises questions of both efficiency and equity. This paper proposes an auction mechanism for distributing additional usage rights: interlicense competition. Derived from an auction procedure used by the Interior Department for the auction of mining leases, this mechanism grants license relaxation rights using competition, while ensuring that the government still obtains the fair value of the licenses it is granting. Interlicense competition overcomes {{the fact that the}} holders of existing usage rights have a strong competitive advantage over any challengers. This auction mechanism could be a useful addition to the arsenal of tools available to the FCC.

This must not happen; licence-exemption supports innovation and entrepreneurship and is an important second leg of a market-based spectrum management regime. A current case in point is the transition in UHF frequency bands from analogue to digital TV, where licence exempt use of resulting gaps in the spectrum could yield enormous benefits for citizens and consumers.

The software licenses are implemented as Grid services, providing platform-independent access just like other Grid resources and being accessible from resources outside organizational boundaries. The License Service {{is responsible for}} creating licenses based on the user requirements. These licenses are governed as Service Level Agreements based on evolving standards, and describes all specific conditions of the application usage like license owner, issuer, validity period, usage records, pricing, features, wall time, etc. The Orchestration Service co-allocates licenses and computing resources both in time and space, assuring that these resources {{are available at the}} same time for the execution of application. The Orchestrator retrieves license token from the License Service and transport it to selected computational resources while bei ng sure that the license required is available to the application upon start-up and during execution. Secure agreements are used to transport license tokens through the Grid to computing resources. The license and compute agreements and conditions of use for an application are reached through negotiation between service providers and service customers. The Orchestrator integration with UNICORE is realized through UNICORE Integration Service that provides WS-Agreement based interface to interact with UNICORE servers.

Through comparison with prior year’s data, we contemplate changes in how specific use cases fit with specific devices, the effect of multiple screens on usage behavior, and how users value different content types in the mobile environment. With responses from over 12, 000 users (approximately 4, 000 physicians, 3, 400 nurses, and the remainder medical students, faculty, and other provider groups), we identified a drastic 20 % year‐over‐year {{increase in the number of}} professionals that routinely access “three screens” (tablet, smartphone, and desktop) for professional purposes. Significantly, the findings strongly support the notion that “more screens = more access,” as both smartphones and tablets are becoming increasingly embedded, for a wider range of activities, in the clinical workflow. Concurrently, increased demand for mobile access to healthcare information is creating new challenges for medical librarians. Faced with budget constraints and intensified scrutiny over spending decisions, librarians must balance demands for electronic and print resources while collaborating with IT departments to ensure mobile device access, support, and privacy adherence.

However, material to orient Information Technology (IT) personnel on essential accessibility functionality is sparse. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a web- based instructional module intended to orient IT personnel in higher education in the configuration and facilitation of the use of accessibility features of the Ubuntu Linux operating system. The module featured uniformity in visual design across sections, a combination of static and dynamic multi-modal presentation of information, and an innovative multi-survey response collection linking method, among others. The learning effect of the module was evaluated based on participants’ pre- and post self-confidence ratings on their ability to facilitate and administer specific accessibility features of Ubuntu. Twenty-four IT professionals in higher education reviewed the module by going through each section in the module in a self-paced manner. Results showed, using 17 usable data points, that on average participants rated themselves lower than 2 on a 5 -point scale on all pre-survey target confidence items, but rated themselves above 4 on each of the corresponding post-survey items, indicating the module was successful in promoting learners’ confidence utilizing Ubuntu accessibility features...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} group was to allow the authors to choose free and easy-to-use licenses, keeping the commercial use to themselves, and relying on SIAE only for distribution and collection of revenues, but nothing came of it. The first example of Creative Commons license integrated with a copyright collecting agency {{was born in the}} Netherlands and paved the way to more <b>flexible</b> <b>licenses,</b> leaving authors free to use and advertise their works. This choice depended on the new frontiers of computer science, that allowed the authors to publish their works online, which would have been a sort of theft according to previous rules. The only solution for those who wanted to distribute their works online for free, was Creative Commons licence that was able to protect them from plagiarism for commercial purposes, thanks to its “non commercial” clause. Thus the artist was {{able to take advantage of}} Internet speed to advertise his work, making profit from merchandising and live performances. Therefore, the artists are now able to release a work under a “non commercial” Creative Commons licence in order to protect and distribute it and have the chance to make commercial use of it while Buma/Stemra, the Netherland equivalent of SIAE, is responsible for collecting and distributing the revenues.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the developments that led to the establishment of an idea of accessibility of electronic information for people with disabilities. The development of legal and technological standards influenced economic, social, legal and technological aspects of accessibility of the Internet sites. A lack of accessibility and usability of electronic resources for people with disability is a practice of discrimination of people with disabilities. However, accessibility itself is not solely based on aspects of functionality. Accessibility assumes aspects of situational, cultural and social aspects of accessibility. Those aspects do not exclude functionality as an important criteria. Indeed, they include cultural, social, gender, situational aspects {{due to the fact that}} person with disability should not be treated soley on his/her disability.

Conventional ERP system, {{an important component}} of enterprises, is impacted by on-demand cloud services also. Integrating conventional ERP system with cloud services becomes a trend because it brings new processing capabilities without introducing significant changes to existing system. But previous studies about integrating ERP and cloud usually focused on SaaS (Software as a Service). PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) are not discussed much. People sometimes even confuse cloud service with SaaS. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} present a framework that can describe respective implications of integrating ERP with three types of cloud services: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. Qualitative methods such as systematic literature review and interviews are adopted to execute the research, so data collected through different sources can complement each other in order to support presenting the framework of integrating conventional ERP system and cloud services. The integration at SaaS level is for achieving immediate business value and productivity enhancement. At PaaS level the objective of integration is to enhance software development life cycle management. And the main integrating intent at IaaS level is to enable scalability and reliability of hardware resources without changing existing IT infrastructure. Furthermore, challenges and opportunities for integrating ERP with different cloud services are studied and motivation is derived from analyzing.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the effectiveness of 3. 5 GHz Licensing Framework - based on census tracts as area units, areas whose main characteristic is population. As such, the boundary of census tract does not follow the edge of wireless network coverage. We demonstrate why census tracts are not suitable for small cell networks licensing, by (1) gathering and analysing the official census data, (2) exploring the boundaries of census tracts which are in the shape of nonconvex polygons and (3) giving a measure of effectiveness of the licensing scheme through metrics of area loss and the number of people per census tract with access to spectrum. Results show that census tracts severely impact the effectiveness of the licensing framework since almost entire strategically important cities in the U. S. will not avail from spectrum use in 3. 5 GHz band. Our paper does not seek to challenge the core notion of geographic licensing concept, but seeks a corrective that addresses the way the license is issued for a certain area of operation. The effects that inappropriate size of the license has on spectrum assignments lead to spectrum being simply wasted in geography, time and frequency or not being assigned in a fair manner. The corrective is necessary since the main goal of promoting innovative sharing in 3. 5 GHz band is to put spectrum to more efficient use. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, conferenc...|$|E
