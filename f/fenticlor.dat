40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} (ACD) and photo-ACD are cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity {{reactions of the}} skin caused by {{a wide range of}} substances. Topical ketoprofen (KP), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can induce ACD and photo-ACD. Patients with ACD and/or photo-ACD to KP frequently show concomitant sensitization to other substances. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the substances most frequently associated with sensitization to KP, and to evaluate, by means of computerized conformational analysis, whether this association could be due to cross-allergy. 15 subjects with ACD and photo-ACD to KP were tested with the SIDAPA (Società Italiana di Dermatologia Allergologica Professionale ed Ambientale) patch test standard series, including fragrance mix and its components (eugenol, isoeugenol, oak moss, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, amylcinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol and cinnamaldehyde) and with the SIDAPA photopatch test series. Allergic reactions to cinnamyl alcohol were noted in all patients, whereas some patients also showed positive reactions to <b>fenticlor,</b> octocrylene and benzophenone- 10. Computerized conformational analysis demonstrated that the structure of cinnamyl alcohol is similar to that of KP, whereas the structures of benzophenone- 10, octocrylene and <b>fenticlor</b> are completely different. These results suggest that in patients with contact allergy to KP, concomitant positive reactions to cinnamyl alcohol are due to cross-sensitization, whereas simultaneous allergic reactions to <b>fenticlor,</b> octocrylene and benzophenone- 10 should be regarded as co-sensitizations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Photopatch testing (PPT) is a {{standard}} tool to help making and confirming diagnosis of photoallergic contact dermatitis (PACD) that should correlate to patients ’ history and clinical manifestation. This retro-spective study reports the significance of PPT and PACD, conducted for 10 years between 2000 and 2009 at the Institute of Dermatology. Among 270 patients who completed PPT, 72 patients (26. 67 %) had PPT positive, but only 14 / 72 (19. 4 %) had relevant to the patients ’ history and skin lesions which could make definite diagnosis as PACD. Among them, oxybenzone, a sunscreen substance {{was the most common}} caus-ative agent (35. 7 %) which was corresponded with other reports, followed by promethazine hydrochloride, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, fragrance mix, triclocarban and <b>fenticlor.</b> Oxybenzone also caused allergic reaction in 6 cases. Data from this study would be useful for providing information relevant to the improve-ment of the use of PPT in the diagnosis and management of PACD and other related skin diseases, as well as the future use of data for the development of commercial products that are less harmful to the people...|$|E
