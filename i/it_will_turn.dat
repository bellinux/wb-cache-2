5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E

25|$|Common intuition {{suggests}} that if a fair coin is tossed many times, then roughly half of the time <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> up heads, {{and the other half}} <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> up tails. Furthermore, the more often the coin is tossed, the more likely it should be that the ratio of the number of heads to the number of tails will approach unity. Modern probability theory provides a formal version of this intuitive idea, known as the law of large numbers. This law is remarkable because it is not assumed in the foundations of probability theory, but instead emerges from these foundations as a theorem. Since it links theoretically derived probabilities to their actual frequency of occurrence in the real world, the law of large numbers is considered as a pillar in the history of statistical theory and has had widespread influence.|$|E

500|$|Viewed in deposit, {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} appear white. Microscopically, the spores are roughly elliptical, {{sometimes}} appearing bean-shaped, with dimensions of 5.5–7.0 by 3.0–3.5µm. They are thin-walled and smooth, and bear an indistinct hilar appendage. The spores are amyloid, meaning they will absorb iodine and turn black to blue-black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), which are scattered and interspersed with basidia, are roughly cylindric to fusoid (spindle-shaped), smooth, hyaline (translucent), and [...] measure 45–65 by 2–5.5µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are uncommon, and similar in appearance to the cheilocystidia.

It also seen a number of piano driven tracks, with [...] "Frequency" [...] being an example.

Grant later added [...] "Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches on what has happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future.

District Attorney Osborne, believes that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> out poorly for the town and tries to persuade the reforms {{that it would be}} like scattering smallpox. He fails to persuade them and the law is passed. The film focuses on one of the prostitutes, Hattie Fenshaw, who is forced out from her place of vice. According to H. D. Fretz's review, Fenshaw is determined to let those at a prominent hotel know that [...] "women such as she had better be left alone", but is quickly recognized and evicted. At the hotel, Fenshaw makes an acquaintance of Bryant Harding who decides to keep her as his mistress and pays Fenshaw's rent in an apartment next door to one of the reformers, Mrs. Osborne. Fenshaw also charms Dudley Carleton, who breaks off his engagement to Betty Hamlin, the daughter of Harding, who uses her divorced mother's maiden name. Hamlin and Fenshaw meet through an introduction with Mrs. Bowers, and Hamlin, unaware of Fenshaw's character is telephoned by Fenshaw to come and sew for her to earn some money. Hal Harding, a college student with a desire to see the city, is introduced to Fenshaw during his father's absence. The cast assembles at Fenshaw's apartment when Hamlin arrives and interrupts Fenshaw's party with her ex-fiance and her brother, Hal. She is then introduced to her brother under and assumed name and is in the apartment when Bryant Harding returns. A fight breaks out and Harding nearly kills Carleton and knocks Fenshaw unconscious and shoots at his daughter, but misses. Alerted by the shot, the District Attorney, Mrs. Bowers and her reformer friends arrive and learn of Hattie Fenshaw's vice. Shorey's film review concludes with the presumption that Fenshaw returns to a place of [...] "legalized vice" [...] with Mrs. Bowers' permission.|$|E
