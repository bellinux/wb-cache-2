60|$|He {{advanced}} then towards Miss Moorsom. Posed on {{the seat}} on which they had first spoken to each other, {{it was her turn}} to watch him coming on. But many of the windows were not lighted that evening. It was dark over there. She appeared to him luminous in her clear dress, a figure without shape, a face without features, awaiting his approach, till he got quite near to her, sat down, and they had exchanged a few insignificant words. Gradually she came out like a magic painting of charm, fascination, and desire, glowing mysteriously on the dark background. Something imperceptible in the lines of her attitude, in the modulations of her voice, seemed to soften that suggestion of calm unconscious pride which enveloped her always like a mantle. He, sensitive like a bond slave to the moods of the master, was moved by the subtle relenting of her grace to an infinite tenderness. He fought down the impulse to seize her by the <b>hand,</b> <b>lead</b> her down into the garden away under the big trees, and throw himself at her feet uttering words of love. His emotion was so strong that he had to cough slightly, and not knowing what {{to talk to her about}} he began to tell her of his mother and sisters.

6000|$|Secondly, What is {{the breadth}} and LENGTH. As there is a breadth in this mercy and grace of God by Christ, {{so there is a}} LENGTH therein, and this length is as large as the breadth, and as much suiting the {{condition}} of the child of God, as the other is. For, though sin sometimes is most afflicting to the conscience, while the soul beholdeth the overspreading nature of it, yet here it stoppeth not, but oft-times through the power and prevalency of it, the soul is driven with it, as a ship by a mighty tempest, or as a rolling thing before the whirlwind: driven, I say, from God, and from all hopes of his mercy, as far as the east is from the west, or as the ends of the world are asunder. Hence it is supposed by the prophet, that for and by sin they may be driven from God to the utmost part of heaven (Deu 30:4); and that is a sad thing, a sad thing, I say, to a gracious man. [...] "Why," [...] saith the prophet to God, [...] "Art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?" [...] (Psa 22:1). Sometimes a man, yea, a man of God, is, as he apprehends, so far off from God, that he can neither help him, nor hear him, and this is a dismal state. [...] "And thou hast removed my soul," [...] said the church, [...] "far off from peace: I forgat prosperity" [...] (Lam 3:17). This is the state sometimes of the godly, and that not only with reference to their being removed by persecutors, from the appointments and gospel-seasons, which are their delight, and the desire of their eyes; but also with reverence to their faith and hope in their God. They think themselves beyond the reach of his mercy. Wherefore in answer to this conceit it is, that the Lord asketh, saying, [...] "Is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem?" [...] (Isa 50:2). And again, [...] "Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear" [...] (Isa 59:1). Wherefore he saith again, [...] "If any of them be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee" [...] (Deu 30:4). God has a long arm, and he can reach a great way further than we can conceive he can (Neh 1:9): When we think his mercy is clean gone, and that ourselves are free among the dead, and of the number that he remembereth no more, then he can reach us, and cause that again we stand before him. He could reach Jonah, tho' in the belly of hell (Jonah 2); and reach thee, even then, when thou thinkest thy way is hid from the Lord, and thy judgment passed over from thy God. There is length to admiration, beyond apprehension or belief, in the arm of the strength of the Lord; and this is that which the Apostle intended by this word, Length; namely, To insinuate what a reach there is in the mercy of God, how far it can extend itself. [...] "If I take the wings of the morning," [...] said David, [...] "and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy <b>hand</b> <b>lead</b> me, and thy right hand shall hold me" [...] (Psa 139:9,10). I will gather them from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, saith he: That is, from the utmost corners.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the drug}} is transported in aqueous media like blood and {{intracellular}} fluid, {{it has to be}} sufficiently water-soluble in the absolute sense (i.e. must have a minimum chemical solubility in order to be effective). Solubility in water can be estimated from the number of hydrogen bond donors vs. alkyl sidechains in the molecule. Low water solubility translates to slow absorption and action. Too many hydrogen bond donors, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>lead</b> to low fat solubility, so that the drug cannot penetrate the cell membrane to reach the inside of the cell.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} 25 laps of the race, {{a number of}} lead changes occurred. Kevin Harvick made his final stop with 24 laps to go and <b>handed</b> the <b>lead</b> to Jeff Gordon. Gordon made his final stop with 23 laps to go and <b>handed</b> the <b>lead</b> to Kurt Busch, who in turn made his final stop with 22 laps to go, <b>handing</b> the <b>lead</b> to Austin Dillon. Dillon made his final stop with 21 laps to go, with Ryan Newman {{assuming}} the lead. Newman made his final stop with 20 laps to go and Carl Edwards took the lead. Edwards made his final stop with 19 laps to go and <b>handed</b> the <b>lead</b> to Justin Allgaier. Allgaier made his final stop with 18 laps to go and the lead cycled back to Kevin Harvick.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 98. The field {{settled into}} a green flag run until lap 123 when Joey Logano surrendered the lead to pit. This <b>handed</b> the <b>lead</b> to Denny Hamlin. He pitted the next lap and <b>handed</b> the <b>lead</b> to David Ragan. He ducked onto pit road with 35 laps to go and <b>handed</b> the <b>lead</b> to Greg Biffle. Brett Moffitt was tagged for speeding on pit road {{and was forced to}} serve a drive-through penalty. Biffle hit pit road with 34 laps to go and <b>handed</b> the <b>lead</b> to Jeff Gordon. Casey Mears was tagged for having too many men over the wall and was forced to serve a drive-through penalty. Gordon surrendered the lead to pit with 33 laps to go and the lead cycled back to Joey Logano.|$|R

50|$|Survey {{response}} {{effects are}} variations in survey responses {{that result from}} seemingly inconsequential aspects of survey design and administration. Susceptibility to these effects varies depending on the stability of one’s beliefs. Those without a strong attitude on an issue, for instance, would more be more prone to survey response effects than those strongly for or against the issue. These effects can be broadly grouped as consistency or contrast effects. Consistency effects are effects that lead to survey responses that agree, {{not to be confused}} with the identically-named term used to refer to the phenomenon in which respondents intentionally try to get their survey responses to agree one another. Contrast effects on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>lead</b> to opposing responses.|$|E

Elias visits him and he concludes him being Mariams brother and Johannes her father and his belief in enforced by Elias' reluctant answers. He seeks out a doctor with the cover-story of investigating for a book. The doctor explains to him from a book all the signs of lepra, which convinces and horrifies him even more. Upon the doctor insisting on examining his hand he gives the doctor a false name and even shoots at him, going to the ship going to Italy.|$|E
50|$|One {{outgrowth}} of small scale industry in Thiaroye {{has been a}} high rate of pollution and pollution-related diseases. One recent form of income, the salvaging of automobile batteries for products including lead, has created a highly publicised wave of childhood illnesses. In the past, local blacksmiths of the Thiaroye Sur Mer area had salvaged lead from car batteries to fashion into net weights for the nearby fishing industry. In the mid-2000s, as the world price of lead increased, purchasing agents from India offered large payments for lead, leading locals to sift tailings from smithyies' and breakers' yards for lead pellets, usually by <b>hand.</b> <b>Lead</b> poisoning of children born to workers, or those who were exposed to the lead dust created by sifting, climbed. As of the end of 2008m, this pollution has been blamed for at least 18 deaths and hundreds of poisoning related illnesses, along with uncounted deaths of animals and human miscarriages. A much publicised government cleanup campaign has, according to the World Health Organization, been ineffective, and plans are under study to move entire neighbourhoods in the town.|$|E
