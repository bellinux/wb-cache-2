5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

The princess is raised by Maleficent after first being cursed by the fairy in an act of revenge against her father King Stefan, only for a strong mother-daughter bond to develop between the characters; Aurora affectionately refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. When her curse is finally fulfilled, Aurora is awoken by Maleficent's remorseful kiss to her forehead as opposed to a prince's. Aurora defends Maleficent from her father, and eventually returns her wings to her when she is crowned queen of both the human kingdom and the fairy kingdom known as the Moors.|$|E
5|$|Lost Coast {{uses the}} same first-person shooter {{gameplay}} mechanics as Half-Life 2. The game is viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player character, and plot information is imparted through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes. A heads-up display {{at the bottom of}} the screen shows the player's health, energy gauge, and ammunition status, while available weapons are shown at the top. Health and armor energy can be replenished by picking up medical supplies and energy cells respectively, or by using wall-mounted charging devices. The player character is equipped with a small armory of weapons from Half-Life 2 at the beginning of the level, including a pistol, shotgun, crossbow, and gravity gun. The gravity gun allows the player to manipulate physical objects in the world; it can be used to pick up nearby objects and throw them at enemies or create cover from enemy fire. The gravity gun can also be used to perform several non-combat functions, such as grabbing out-of-reach supply crates.|$|E
5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driver {{seat of the}} car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower {{that can not be}} damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E

5|$|Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz is a Broadway musical {{with music}} and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman. It {{is based on the}} 1995 Gregory Maguire novel , an {{alternative}} telling of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The musical is told <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins before and continues after Dorothy's arrival in Oz from Kansas, and it includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. Wicked tells the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (whose name later changes to Glinda the Good Witch), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard's corrupt government and, ultimately, Elphaba's public fall from grace.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1900 for the German Far East mail routes, SS Kiautschou {{traveled}} between Hamburg and Far East ports {{for most}} of her Hamburg America Line career. In 1904, she was traded to competitor North German Lloyd for five freighters, and renamed SS Princess Alice. She sailed both transatlantic and Far East mail routes until the outbreak of World War I, when she was interned in the neutral port of Cebu in the Philippines. Seized by the U.S. in 1917, the newly renamed USS Princess Matoika carried over 50,000U.S. troops to and from France in U.S. Navy service from 1918 to 1919. As an Army transport after that, she continued to return troops and repatriated the remains of Americans killed overseas in the war. In July 1920, she was a last-minute substitute to carry {{a large portion of the}} United States team to the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympic team, the trip was disastrous and a majority of the team members published a list of grievances and demands of the American Olympic Committee in an action known today as the Mutiny of the Matoika.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for {{the number}} of {{soldiers}} and casualties at the battle vary widely. A Song source reports that there were 18,000 Song soldiers stationed in Caishi, a number that historian Herbert Franke considers plausible. However, Song estimates {{for the number}} of Jin troops are likely inflated. One document claims that 400,000 Jin soldiers were present at the battle. This number is doubtful, bearing in mind that the Song had only 120,000 soldiers fighting on the entire front. Song historians may have confused the total number of Jin personnel deployed on the front with the number of Jin combatants at Caishi. The inflated figure could have referred to the number of soldiers that the Jin army had before crossing the Huai River toward the Yangtze. The desertions and casualties from suppressing revolts while advancing southward would have shrunk that number by the time the Jin reached the Yangtze. The History of Jin, a document written <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jin, reports Jin casualties between one meng'an (a Jurchen unit of a thousand soldiers) and a hundred men, and two meng'an and two hundred men. The History of Song reports Jin casualties numbering four thousand soldiers and two commanders of wanhu (ten thousand men) rank. An account of the battle by a different Song source holds that 24,000 Jin soldiers died and that 500 combatants and five meng-an were taken as prisoners. A more conservative Song source estimates that the Jin only had 500 soldiers and 20 ships at Caishi. It is not certain which of these figures is more accurate; Franke believes that the safest conclusion that can be drawn is that the number of Jin casualties was not greater than four thousand.|$|E

5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E
