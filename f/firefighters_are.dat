25|$|In the United States, 25% of {{fatalities}} of <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> {{caused by}} vehicle accidents while responding to or returning from an incident. Many <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> also injured or killed by vehicles {{while working at}} an incident (Paulison 2005). Recently (November 24, 2008) a new measure was established by many departments that requires firefighters to wear a bright yellow reflective vest over their turnout coats while working on the scene of vehicle accidents. The advent of this measure was implemented so <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> more visible to the other drivers on the road. In addition to the direct dangers of firefighting, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 45% of on duty firefighter deaths.|$|E

50|$|Another {{crew from}} River Oaks arrived on scene {{and began a}} new search for the missing <b>firefighters.</b> One <b>firefighter</b> <b>was</b> found in the {{entrance}} to the offices {{at the rear of the}} sanctuary and after making their way further into the office a second <b>firefighter</b> <b>was</b> found. Accountability reports on scene indicated that two <b>firefighters</b> <b>were</b> missing and both were from River Oaks, Brian Collins and Phillip Dean. It was believed at this time that all missing <b>firefighters</b> has <b>been</b> found and that they were Collins and Dean.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of firefighter: wholetime and retained. Wholetime firefighters work {{full-time}} in the fire service. Retained <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> on call for long periods (at least 70 hours a week) to respond to incidents. They are paid a salary for the time they spend on call and a greater amount for each incident they respond to, on average 2 or 3 per week. Many have jobs outside of the fire service. Large town fire stations have wholetime crews, while small rural ones are usually staffed only by retained firefighters. Voluntary <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> now rare: the only voluntary units now in operation are the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Borth Voluntary Fire Unit (near Aberystwyth, Wales).|$|E
25|$|Many <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> sworn {{officers}} with command structures {{similar to the}} military and police. They do not have general police powers (some firefighters in the United States have limited police powers, like fire police departments, while certain fire marshals have full police powers, i.e. {{the ability to make}} warantless arrests, and authority to carry a firearm on and off-duty), but have specific powers of enforcement and control in fire and emergency situations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Firefighters</b> <b>are</b> {{trained to}} use {{communications}} equipment to receive alarms, give and receive commands, request assistance, and report on conditions. Since firefighters from different agencies routinely provide mutual aid to each other, and routinely operate at incidents where other emergency services are present, {{it is essential}} to have structures in place to establish a unified chain of command, and share information between agencies. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has established a National Incident Management System. One component of this system is the Incident Command System.|$|E

25|$|Analysis of {{photographs}} and video also {{raised concerns about}} firefighters, including chief officers, who were not utilizing personal protective equipment appropriately. Some <b>firefighters</b> <b>were</b> wearing street clothes, while others had open coats or were missing helmets. Some <b>firefighters</b> could <b>be</b> seen walking through toxic smoke without air packs. Fire Chief Rusty Thomas has indicated that everyone inside the structure, including the nine fallen <b>firefighters,</b> <b>were</b> wearing the appropriate protective equipment.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, {{a retired}} Chief Thompson {{declared}} {{the merger of}} the EMS and firefighting departments a failure. He blamed racial issues in part, noting that <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> primarily white and EMS personnel mostly African American and that white firefighters have little respect for the mostly black and poor people they provide emergency care to. Kenneth Lyons, president of the paramedics' union, agreed with Thompson's assessment but also emphasized that management failures and budgetary problems played a role. Retired Fire Chief Dennis L. Rubin (Thompson's successor) dismissed this analysis.|$|E
25|$|In popular {{literature}} <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> sometimes depicted with Dalmatian dogs. This breed {{originated in}} southern Europe and was {{primarily responsible for}} herding livestock and running alongside carriages drawn by horses. In the days of horse-drawn fire vehicles, the horses were usually released on arrival at the fire and the Dalmatians would lead the horses through traffic and to {{a safe place to}} wait until the fire was out. Dalmatians also filled the role of protecting the horses' feet from other dogs as equipment was being transported to the fire scene.|$|E
25|$|A fire burns {{due to the}} {{presence}} of three elements, often referred to as being the fire triangle. These are: fuel, oxygen and heat. The aim of firefighting is to deprive the fire of {{at least one of these}} elements. Sometimes this is referred to as a fire tetrahedron if a fourth element is added: a chemical chain reaction that can sustain or re-kindle a fire. <b>Firefighters</b> <b>are</b> equipped with a wide variety of equipment to accomplish this task. Some of their tools include ladder trucks, pumper trucks, tanker trucks, fire hose, and fire extinguishers. Very frequent training and refresher training is required.|$|E
50|$|Both {{before and}} after the second collapse, only <b>firefighters</b> <b>were</b> allowed to enter the building, and anyone inside was pulled out and brought to the {{ambulances}} parked just outside the store. After the second collapse, it was reported that only five <b>firefighters</b> <b>were</b> allowed to enter the building at a time, and that the rest were forced to wait outside because of the danger of further collapse. Each <b>firefighter</b> <b>was</b> allowed to spend only half an hour working. Bulldozers were used to clear the rubble. Mobile cranes were deployed at 21:27 to lift concrete slabs.|$|R

25|$|Firefighters in the United States are {{frequently}} the first responders to hazmat incidents. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 1910.120 defines four standards of training first responder awareness level, first responder operations level, hazardous materials technician, and Hazardous materials specialist. EMS-based paramedics are typically trained to the awareness level, whereas career and volunteer <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> often trained to the operations level or better. Other nations have trained only elite firefighters and rescuers to do hazmat so that funding and equipment {{could go to}} fewer stations. This gives departments elite hazmat personnel and high-grade equipment for an incident. Departments place these companies in stations {{where they can be}} very mobile.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{retrospective}} {{longitudinal study}} showed that <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> at higher risk for certain types of cancer. Firefighters had mesothelioma, which is caused by asbestos exposure, at {{twice the rate of}} the non-firefighting working population. Younger firefighters (under age 65) also developed bladder cancer and prostate cancer at higher rates than the general population. The risk of bladder cancer may be present in female firefighters, but research is inconclusive as of 2014. Preliminary research from 2015 on a large cohort of US firefighters showed a direct relationship between the number of hours spent fighting fires and lung cancer and leukemia mortality in firefighters. This link is a topic of continuing research in the medical community, as is cancer mortality in general among firefighters.|$|E

2500|$|Ambulance {{services}} can be stand alone organisations, {{but in some}} cases, the emergency medical service is operated by the local fire or police service. This is particularly common in rural areas, where maintaining a separate service is not necessarily cost effective. This can lead, in some instances, to an illness or injury being attended by a vehicle other than an ambulance, such as fire truck. [...] In some locales, <b>firefighters</b> <b>are</b> the first responders to calls for emergency medical aid, with separate ambulance services providing transportation to hospitals when necessary.|$|E

Ground-based fire crews had to retreat from the fire front as the escalating conditions made firefighting in the bushland terrain impossible. The fire broke out of the park around 4:00pm, and by 6:00pm had burnt out [...] of forest and farmland, threatening the towns of Labertouche, Tonimbuk, Jindivick, Drouin, and Longwarry, and embers were starting spot fires up to [...] to the south.|$|E
