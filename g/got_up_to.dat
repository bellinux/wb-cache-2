5|$|As Jim Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism {{came to a head}} in a game against the Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.|$|E
25|$|In the quarter-finals, France faced three-time world {{champion}} Brazil in Guadalajara. Brazil were well on top {{in the early}} stages, and Careca put them one up after 18 minutes. Five minutes before half-time, France drew level when Michel Platini scored his 41st goal after converting a cross from Dominique Rocheteau. Brazil {{had a chance to}} regain the lead in the second half when Branco was fouled by French keeper Joël Bats in the penalty area. Zico <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> take the kick, but Bats saved Zico's penalty.|$|E
25|$|Beethoven is {{reported}} to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a rage at the interruption of his work—having fallen over, he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find himself deaf. His hearing only ever partially recovered and, during its gradual decline, was impeded by a severe form of tinnitus. As early as 1801, he wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in 1870, bound peasants, {{including}} slaves, were liberated in Abkhazia {{as a part}} of the Russian serfdom reforms. The peasants got between 3 and 8 ha and had to pay huge redemption payments (the landowners <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 275 ha); furthermore, {{according to}} a contemporary Russian official, peasants were mostly left with rocky mountain slopes and low-lying bogs. The liberation in Abkhazia was more problematic than elsewhere as it failed to take into account fully the distinction between free, partly free and unfree peasants in the Abkhazian society.|$|E
25|$|A rematch between Vic Darchinyan and Nonito Donaire {{took place}} on 9 November 2013. The 37-year-old Darchinyan gave the 30-year-old Donaire a lot more trouble than was expected, as this was {{intended}} to be an easy bounce-back fight for Donaire who was coming off his first loss in over a decade. Darchinyan fought a smarter fight and confused a sluggish Donaire for much of the first 8 rounds, but in the 9th round round was dropped and <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be finished by TKO. At the time of the stoppage, Darchinyan was leading on the scorecards: 78-74, 78-74, and 76-76.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013, a {{male and}} female agent pretended to have a lovers' quarrel near where he {{was working at the}} Glen Park branch. According to Business Insider Ulbricht was distracted and <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> see what the problem was, whereupon the female agent grabbed his laptop while the male agent {{restrained}} Ulbricht. The female agent was then able to insert a flash drive in one of the laptop's USB ports, with software that copied key files. According to Joshuah Bearman of Wired, a third agent grabbed the laptop while Ulbricht was distracted by the apparent lovers' fight and handed it to agent Tom Kiernan.|$|E

25|$|In {{his third}} race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, he {{qualified}} in fourth place. He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{second on the}} first lap {{and there was a}} safety car due to an incident in the first corner. On the restart, which was on the third lap, Montoya passed World Champion Michael Schumacher into the first corner. He held off Schumacher, who was on a two-stop strategy compared to Montoya's one stop strategy until Schumacher's first stop. Montoya now seemed to have the race in his pocket as he had a five-second advantage over eventual winner David Coulthard. However, while he was lapping Jos Verstappen, the Dutchman accidentally rammed into the back of him, taking Montoya out.|$|E
25|$|Her {{first period}} of {{education}} was at Liqing primary school. This school {{was one of}} several schools which accepted female students in Putian. Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required to do all the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six in the morning, she <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> cook and then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E
25|$|It {{was then}} that he joined the All-England Eleven, playing his first game for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him more anxious about his place, and he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> some strange antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that there was a fire and rang the alarm bell, causing minor panic amongst the other guests.|$|E

The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E
25|$|At the , Räikkönen {{qualified}} 9th. However, {{he managed}} to get up to 5th place on the first lap of the race. He retained this position for most of the race, finishing in 5th place. A few days after the Spanish Grand Prix, he admitted that he had no chance of winning the 2006 Championship. In Monaco, Räikkönen qualified third. During the race he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2nd and kept pace with Alonso, however he retired during a safety car period after a failed heat shield led to a wiring loom inside the car catching fire. After the retirement he was seen on live TV walking along the Monaco sidewalks with his helmet still on to the harbour and climbing aboard a yacht.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, Genoa came to Parma led by ex-Parma manager Alberto Malesani as Parma {{looked to}} put an end to their indifferent early season form and Genoa went in search of a second win at the Tardini on their twentieth visit. They were able to make their good start to the first half pay with a goal from a delightful Giovinco lob on the half-hour mark after a neat Sergio Floccari assist. As the first half drew to a close, Giovinco's mazy dribble was then illegally halted in the penalty area by Juraj Kucka and Parma were awarded a penalty; Giovinco himself converted the resultant spot kick. As Genoa threw more men forward, the chances continued to come for Parma and a fine counter-attack ended with a Stefano Morrone finish from inches out after he had somehow conspired to hit the bar from 6 yards out. The gloss of a fine victory was taken off when Genoa themselves were awarded a penalty for a Gabriel Paletta tug on Rodrigo Palacio in the last minute and the Argentine <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> score the penalty and round off the scoring at 3–1. This lifted Parma out of the relegation zone and Giovinco to the top of the scoring charts, alongside fellow 5-goal frontman Rodrigo Palacio.|$|E

25|$|For {{the making}} of the pyramid itself there passed a period of 20years; and the pyramid is square, each side {{measuring}} 800feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than 30feet in length. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call 'rows' and others 'bases': When they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with devices made of short pieces of timber, lifting them first from the ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However, that may be, the highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges.|$|E
25|$|At Silverstone, {{which he}} said he {{considers}} to be his second home, he qualified 16th, outpacing Button. With heavy rain on race day, through good use of an extreme wet tyre he finished 3rd, achieving his first podium since 2005. However, in Germany, a collision with David Coulthard ended his hopes for points. In Hungary, he was lapped by the leader, repeating the same performance in Valencia. In Belgium he qualified 16th but had to retire because of a gearbox fault. At a wet Monza, he was second fastest in Friday practice and started from 16th on the grid. He managed {{to get up to}} 9th but as a result of using the wrong type of tyre in his second pit stop he ended up 17th. At the first ever night race in Singapore he was in a good position to score some points after pitting before the pit lane closed for the safety car period, but shortly afterwards the engine failed and he had to retire. In Japan he started from 17th on the grid, but managed to get up to 13th {{by the end of the}} race. In China he managed to get into Q2 for the first time in ten races, and would have started 14th. But after Mark Webber had his ten place penalty for an engine change added he was moved up to 13th. On race day he had a good start, and <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10th early on and held a strong mid table position all race and finished 11th, five places ahead of Button, who had struggled all weekend.|$|E
