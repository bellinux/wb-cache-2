The decision of utilization cable lines rather than overhead lines were made, which brings new features to distribution networks. The main idea of this work is a complex analysis of medium voltage distribution networks with long cable lines. High value of cable’s specific capacitance and length of lines determine such problems as: high values of <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> <b>currents,</b> excessive amount of reactive power flow from distribution to transmission network, possibility of a high voltage level at {{the receiving end of}} cable feeders.

In order to provide justify solution or evaluation of mentioned above problems corresponding calculations were made and in order to analyze behavior of relay protection principles PSCAD model of the examined network have been created.

The reason for the extensive cabling is the new suggestions for distribution network operators' quality of supply, which were set by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. Cabling sets a number of practical and technical challenges to distribution network operators. From the technical point of view, cables generate a significant amount of reactive power and <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> <b>current,</b> which were the main research interests of this thesis. The purpose of the thesis was to find an optimal way to compensate both reactive power and earth fault currents in extensively cabled networks.

The study was carried out by using PSCAD-simulation software and making calculations based on the results. The study revealed that there is a certain need for reactive power compensation. The main reason is Fingrid's fee for inputting reactive power in the main grid, which can cause major costs as the amount of cabling increases. Another reason is the power losses due to reactive power flow, which can be effectively limited with the correct selection and placement of shunt reactors. The reactive power compensation should be implemented by using centralized shunt reactors. Distributed shunt reactors {{did not appear to be}} profitable in the normal branched feeders.

The objective of this thesis was to find the development needs to ABB MicroSCADA Pro DMS 600 software in the aspect of medium voltage network cabling. Representatives of 4 distribution system operators were interviewed and both measurements and simulations were performed to find the needs for improvements. Also the feasibility of active voltage level management feature Volt-VAr Control for Finnish customers was discussed. As an outcome of this thesis, several development needs were gathered.

Although the concept is not new, the advent of modern control equipment allows fresh opportunities {{for them to be}} used to save lives and to decrease the cost and inconvenience to industry and the community in general that is caused by electricity supply interruptions without incurring large expenditure. <b>Earth</b> <b>fault</b> <b>currents</b> are reduced to almost zero, thus eliminating many short time power supply interruptions and preventing damage to the electricity supply system {{at the time of the}} initial fault. Because of the reduction in damage at the time of the fault, many longer duration interruptions are avoided. It is common for live high voltage conductors to be close to the ground and for the fault not to be detected by conventional power system protection equipment. Arc suppression coil systems can detect high impedance <b>earth</b> <b>faults</b> and broken conductors which cannot be detected by conventional protection systems. There are many system abnormalities which can cause neutral voltages in arc suppression coil systems. The appropriate action to be taken by the protection system depends on the type of system abnormality. The causes of neutral voltages in arc suppression coil systems are analysed and criteria are developed to differentiate between them based on the phase angle and magnitude of the neutral voltage. Fully computerised power system protection systems are now being implemented. These modern protection systems will be able to utilise the criteria developed in this research to take immediate appropriate action based on the neutral voltage caused by the system abnormality. In existing distribution systems there is a widespread use of two single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in open-delta configuration to provide economic in-line three phase voltage regulation. An original method of representing open delta regulators in symmetrical component analyses is developed. It is shown that when open-delta regulators are used in a power system equipped with an arc suppression coil very high voltages can occur. A solution is proposed whereby three single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in a closed-delta arrangement are used. One of the potential problems with these systems is cross country faults caused by the neutral voltage displacement combined with the transient voltages at the time of the initial <b>earth</b> <b>fault.</b> These transient over-voltages are analysed in detail and a method of testing the capability of existing system components to withstand the over-voltages is developed. Simple methods to estimate the transient voltages on overhead power systems are derived. A new method of minimising the transient over-voltages is proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{takes place}} in the context of {{distribution}} power system protection and tries to improve the detection and location of <b>earth</b> <b>faults.</b> The protection problem is vast and many ideas emerge every year to enhance the reliability of the grid. The author has focused his energy into the compensated and isolated network protection in the specific case of single phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault.</b> This PhD thesis is divided in two main parts that might be considered as independent. The first part studies the detection of single phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> and the second analyzes the fault location of such fault. Pragmatism was asked during these three years because a product development was necessary especially regarding the fault detection problem. The first part of the thesis took 18 months of research and development to obtain a prototype of transient protection able to detect single phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> in compensated and isolated network. The sensitivity of the algorithm has been emphasized regarding the fault impedance and to detect <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> up to 5 kOhm depending on the network characteristic. The fault location problem has been much more theoretical although the problem links to the accuracy of the algorithm and its robustness regarding wrong fault location indication has been strongly considered. Compensated networks and in some conditions isolated networks are distribution from 12 kV up to 110 kV mostly used in East and North Europe but also in China. Others areas also work with such networks but they also have others systems and they do not use them on all the territory. These networks have the particularity to obtain very small <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> in case of single phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault.</b> Low <b>current</b> means the difference between a faulty and a sound feeder is not significant. Therefore classic overcurrent protection is completely useless to protect the network, forcing the development of more complex algorithm. A possibility to overcome the problem of the small <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> is to develop a transient protection. The transient occurring {{at the beginning of the}} fault has strong information to distinguish a faulty from a sound feeder. In this work I have chosen to use not only the transient but also the steady state to get the best sensitivity. Then the fault location has been investigated but the small information coming from the faulty feeder is not sufficient to have a precise enough position of the fault. Therefore, active system has been suggested to be implemented in the grid to increase the faulty current and have enough power for a precise location. Different existing algorithms based on the steady state at the nominal frequency are compared using a tool developed during this work. Recommendations are then made depending on the topology, the network parameters, the measurements precision, etc. Due to the complexities of the problem, a simulator has been coded in Matlab. The user of a possible fault location must then use this tool to understand and see the future fault location precision that he could obtain from different algorithm on his network.

At First different existing grounding methods such as isolated neutral, solidly grounded, Resonant grounding, low and high impedance groundings are introduced.

Then these methods are further analyzed by using equivalent circuit designs. Using the equivalent circuit helps to derive the formulations and equations. It is shown that the designing of these systems in fact follows basic electrical properties such as voltage dividing and current dividing principles. The derived equations are further tested experimentally to prove the characteristics and behavior of these methods. Finally, the report is concluded by testing some of these methods (isolated neutral and grounding via resistor methods) in the laboratory and the results obtained are analyzed with the theoretical results to determine the characteristics and behavior of these methods. In this manner it is shown experimentally that in case of isolated neutral systems the summation of currents through all the phases (current flow through the line model) is zero when there is no earth fault. In case of an earth fault occurring across one of the phases the neutral-to-ground voltage becomes equal to the voltage across the faulted phase and also the sum of currents passing through the healthy phases is equal to the current flowing through the faulted phase. This phenomenon is proved in the second experiment. The third experiment proves the relation between the <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> and current via the resistor and the currents via the healthy phases whereby it is shown that the fault current is equal to the root square summation of currents of resistor and healthy phases.

40|$|The {{earthing}} {{of electric}} installations {{plays an important}} part as regards the behaviour of the network and personal safety when there are disturbances. Presently all earthing designs are performed by contractors and submitted to Ceylon Electricity Board for approval. But {{due to lack of}} information at the tender stage majority of the contractors are unable to bid the earthing design part accurately resulting deviations to the contract during the implementation stage. To minimize this problem Transmission Design Branch and the Transmission Maintenance Branch of the Ceylon Electricity Board jointly decided to do the Earthing Design and submitted with the tender for bidding. After the initial soil resistivity measurements, {{it was found that the}} resistivity values were very high compared to other Grid Substation locations. Therefore it was decided to do an earthing design for Horana Grid Substation to identify the suitabil ity of proposed land and identify the land to be developed to construct an additional earthing mat to transfer the <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> <b>current.</b> Without a properly designed grounding system large potential differences can exist between different points within the substation itself. Under normal circumstances, the current flow through the grounding grid from line - to - ground faults that constitutes the main threat to personnel. The earthing design for Horana Grid Substation has the following objectives. 1. Ensure such a degree of human safety that a person working or walking in the vicinity of grounded facilities, is not exposed to the danger of a critical electric shock. The touch and step voltages produced in a fault condition have to be at safe levels. A safe value is one that will not produce enough current within a body to case ventricular fibrillation. 2. Provide means to carry and dissipate electric currents into earth under normal and faulty conditions without exceeding any operating and equipment limits or adversely affecting continuity of service. 3. Provide grounding for lightning impulses and the surges occurring from the switching of substation equipment, which reduces damage to equipment. 4. Provide a low resistance to protective relays to see and clear ground faults, which improves protective equipment performance, particularly at minimum faults. I...|$|E

This thesis examines the electrical characteristics of the Source Isolated Earth (SIE) Fault. The Source Isolated Earth Fault is a type of high impedance earth fault that can occur on overhead electricity networks. SIE faults are caused by a broken overhead conductor falling to ground on the load side of the span with the source end of the span isolated from the ground. A simplified model for calculation of the earth fault levels in SIE faults was developed by circuit reduction of the fault schematic. The SIE fault was reduced to the equivalent of a Phase to Phase to Ground fault. Results obtained from the simplified model were compared to two peer reviewed models for SIE fault calculations in order to validate the simplified method. The comparison was undertaken in two stages, by first varying one factor at a time to determine the most significant factors and then by carrying out designed experiments on the significant factors and analysing the interactions between these factors. The results of the one factor at a time analysis identi�ed which of the factors had the largest effect on the <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> <b>current.</b> The most significant factor in determining the earth fault level in SIE faults is the pre-fault load beyond the fault location. This knowledge can be used to identify areas where SIE fault levels may be low. Computational effciency of the three models was compared using MATLAB profiling. The simplified model was found to be significantly faster than the other methods. Confidence in the theory was bolstered by the calculation of fault levels for a case study. The results were compared between all three models and data captured during an actual SIE fault event. A process was developed that allowed existing 11 kV network feeder models to be analysed using the SIE fault models. Sections of feeder where SIE fault levels may be below conventional Sensitive Earth Fault (SEF) protection pickup levels were identifed. Attempts to optimise the feeder analysis led to methods of reducing the number of network nodes to be tested to find the limit of the protection zone. The extreme case analysis led to the discovery of the circuit conditions that must exist for these types of faults to be undetectable by conventional SEF protection schemes. It was discovered that the maximum possible SIE fault current can be easily estimated by applying a factor to the pre-fault load downstream of the fault location. ...|$|E

The existences of these substations necessitate earthing design {{to ensure safety}} compliance to the mine regulations. The HV system within the mines is consisted of multiple substations which are connected throughout and underground cable. These substations provide the load with the required electrical power to perform its tasks. This paper endeavours to provide information {{in regards to the}} different types of connections between the load and the substations (TT, TN and IT Systems). Furthermore, the earthing arrangements under different connection were assessed. A case study is addressed to show the different earthing arrangements under different connection systems Keywords:- <b>Earth</b> Grid, EPR, <b>Fault</b> <b>Current,</b> High Voltage, Mines, TN and TT systems I...|$|R

In the proposed method, the MAS {{consists of two}} agents as follows; first agent is a <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> agent, i. e., to determine the <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> at all points before and after grounding. While, the second agent is the time operating, i. e., to determine the time operating relay before and after modifying the <b>fault</b> <b>current.</b> The simulation implementation is carried out in Iraqi national grid system (132 kV) - Najaf city.

50|$|By {{enclosing}} the conductors {{in separate}} housings {{a high degree}} of protection from two-phase and three-phase faults is obtained. Almost any fault would instead be a single-phase <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> which does not produce a large <b>fault</b> <b>current.</b> The conductors between the generator and the first circuit breaker are even more important to protect against two- and three-phase faults because there is no breaker that can stop the <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> from the generator. While most modern circuit breakers will interrupt the <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> in less than 50 ms, the <b>fault</b> <b>current</b> from the generator will take several seconds to interrupt because the field current in the rotor takes this amount of time to discharge. The consequenses of a two- or three-phase fault between the generator and the first circuit breaker are therefore much more serious and often result in severe damage to the busbars and nearby equipment.|$|R
