5|$|In January 2010, Metacritic editor Jason Dietz {{undertook}} a {{statistical analysis of}} whether films released in that month were, as perceived, inferior. He compared the site's aggregate scores, based on critical and audience consensus, for films released in January, February, and March from 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> throughout his term.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> {{in the numbers of}} skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S firms {{becoming}} larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and filing cabinets, all adding to the demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers.|$|E
5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10votes in the Senate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase.</b> But gas prices spiked before the measure came to a vote in the Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E

The original version went on to sell four million copies worldwide by 2009. Advent Children Complete also met with strong sales, selling 100,000 copies on its first day of release in Japan. Advent Children Complete was cited as a reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in sales of the PlayStation 3 console. Before Crisis registered 200,000 users on launch day, making it the best-selling mobile game up until that time, and was accessed 1.6 million times by June 2006.

5|$|The Second Symphony, and Livre pour orchestre and the Cello Concerto which followed, were {{composed}} during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His {{mother died in}} 1967, and in 1967–70 {{there was a great}} deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the Cello Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.|$|E
