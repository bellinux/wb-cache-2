Strategies used to communicate with foreign-language speaking patients differed, depending on the patient's language. While nearly half of respondents relied on patients' relatives to translate for Albanian, Tamil, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Portuguese and Turkish, a third did so for Spanish, and a fourth did so for Arabic. Eleven percent relied on professional interpreters for Spanish and 31 % did so for Tamil and Arabic.

The study employed the use of lesson observations, along with questionnaires and focus group interviews to examine the development of attitudes and motivation. To measure linguistic progression an oral role play task, an oral photo description task and a free writing task were administered at each time point.

40|$|When {{children}} whose first or home {{language is a}} minority language begin their school careers, they are commonly taught {{through the medium of}} a majority language for varying purposes, including the requirement that they be assessed in school through the medium of a recognised national language. For immigrant children and for children of immigrants, learning through the medium of a national language is part of their assimilation in to the society they are growing up in. However, often these children are taught only in this second or foreign language, and little support is offered to help them to gain sufficient competence in that language.

I draw on a sociocultural approach to literacy as contextualised social practice. This implies that children learn language and literacy through everyday interaction, therefore language and literacy should be studied as it happens in social life. I also look at the theoretical approaches to understanding language and literacy learning, such as reading theories, emergent literacy, as well as emergent biliteracy to understand the experiences of Congolese learners in South African primary schools...|$|E
40|$|The East Coast Encounter (ECE) is a multi-arts {{initiative}} involving significant Australian Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists, {{writers and}} songwriters to re-imagine the encounter by Lt. James Cook {{and his crew}} with Aboriginal people in 1770. Cook’s voyage along the Australian east coast has become central to national historical narratives. The exhibition is innovative in seeking to re-envisage this seminal journey by imaginatively exploring moments of contact between two world views during these encounters. In addressing the exhibition’s theme, the artists will produce work which is informed by several key sites where Cook and his crew engaged with Indigenous people: Botany Bay, K’gari/Fraser Island, Town of 1770, Palm Island and Cooktown {{as well as the}} highly symbolic site of Possession Island. Works will explore topics such as literal and metaphorical encounter, reconciliation, differing ways of seeing and knowing, journeys and forms of mapping, nature and culture, and views of country. The exhibition features work by prominent and emerging artists, working across a range of art forms, whose creative practice explores aspects of country and culture and who are recognised as distinctive story-tellers. Additionally, the selected artists broadly represent the key <b>encounter</b> <b>language</b> group nations and regions. Exhibition works will incorporate a range of media including painting, photography, three-dimensional works and installation. These will be enhanced and juxtaposed by a small selection of historical artefacts and documents. Another component of ECE will be the inclusion of historical and contemporary material and performances by leading singer songwriter/poets. A short documentary on DVD, created by Jeff McMullen and Adric Watson, will further enrich the exhibition by giving additional voice to the artists, capturing their own encounters with significant sites and traditional owners, and showing how their varying viewpoints sit together. East Coast Encounter will also be informed by dialogue, exchange and cultural material from the many Aboriginal nations along coastal NSW and Queensland. Connection with some communities has been undertaken, with appropriate protocols, by participating artists and curators. These dialogues will be expanded by an indigenous researcher. It is anticipated that there may be oral histories and other material held within the communities that can inform the project, including the publications, and contribute to the ethos of balance and access that underpins the exhibition. Visiting various sites has been a profound and moving experience for many of the participants. The resulting engagements with traditional owners, communities and places connected with the historical encounter have been central to the development of East Coast Encounter and inform the final works.

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Learning and the {{development}} of numeracy in the foundation phase are regarded as highly important. In this critical period learners attain the fundamental knowledge that is needed for future learning and development. A serious problem within South African schools is that a great number of foundation phase learners show difficulties in numeracy. Various reasons can be provided for these difficulties, for example, learners do not receive good teaching, they hold negative attitudes towards numeracy, they <b>encounter</b> <b>language</b> barriers, and so forth. It is important that the learners’ difficulties in numeracy are attended to immediately and effectively, to be able to minimise the gaps between the learners’ functioning level and the level the learner is suppose to be on. The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) laid bare their concern with the current problem in numeracy when they launched the WCED Literacy and Numeracy Strategy 2006 - 2016. As part of this the Metropole North Education and Management Development Centre (EMDC) requested and implemented an intervention programme for grade 2 and grade 3 learners. Part of this problem is that many foundation phase educators lack the necessary knowledge to identify the learners with difficulties and especially to attend to these difficulties. The goal of this research study was to investigate the realization of an early intervention programme implemented over a limited period of time of ten weeks in grade 2 and grade 3 classrooms. The current study aimed at providing educators with resources to offer learning support to their disadvantaged learners within the Numeracy classroom. This study has implications for the way in which educators approach and teach numeracy, {{as well as for the}} type of learning support the educators provide their disadvantaged learners with. The intervention programme is based on a problem centered approach with constructivism as underlying epistemology. This approach views the educator as a facilitator who provides the learners with opportunities to be actively involved in the learning environment to construct knowledge. The importance of word problems and discussion within the Numeracy classroom are emphasized and it is necessary that the educator create the appropriate classroom atmosphere so that this approach can be implemented effectively. Learning is an active process and it is the responsibility of the educator to provide the learners with appropriate learning activities for learning and development to take place. The study made use of programme evaluation as research methodology. Programme evaluation refers to a research goal instead of specific research methods, because various methods can be used which may be quantitative or qualitative in nature. The gathering of data was done through classroom observations by the researcher, informal interviews with participating educators, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews with the educators at the four schools the researcher monitored intensively during the implementation process of the intervention programme. The gathering of data was an ongoing process and the researcher analysed and interpreted the learners’ work at the end of the implementation process. The researcher checked this analysis by means of the literature review, transcripts and field notes. This formed the basis on which conclusions and recommendations could be made. The conclusions confirmed the importance of early intervention and the efficacy of the problem centered approach within the numeracy classroom. It also confirmed the disadvantages of the training model that was used, that is the Cascade model. With this study it was possible to determine that a ten week intervention programme was too short a period to observe meaningful improvements in learners. Therefore further research should be done on addressing learners’ difficulties and to train and support educators to provide learning support to their learners...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide an insight into how former English learners’ {{educational}} experiences allowed them to attain English language proficiency and meet grade level standards in English Language Arts. This study was informed by the theoretical frameworks of Albert Bandura’s social learning theory, and Lev Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory, as they pertain to English learners.
