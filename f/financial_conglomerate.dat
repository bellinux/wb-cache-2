40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates {{whether the}} {{diversity}} of activities conducted by financial institutions influences their market valuations. We find {{that there is a}} diversification discount: The market values <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> that engage in multiple activities, e. g., lending and non-lending financial services, lower than if those <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> were broken into financial intermediaries that specialize in the individual activities. While difficult to identify a single causal factor, the results are consistent with theories that stress intensified agency problems in <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> that engage in multiple activities and indicate that economies of scope are not sufficiently large to produce a diversification premium...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks into}} the economies of scope in revenue {{associated}} with financial conglomeration. In the first part, we presented a theoretical model of revenue enhancement {{brought about by the}} establishment of brand image and one-stop shopping. In the second part, we first studied the revenue enhancement effects due to the synergies between divisions that are engaged in different types of businesses, using the financial data of subsidiaries of three major <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> in Europe (ING Group, Allianz Group, and Credit Suisse Group) from 1998 to 2003. We then verified the existence of synergies between banking and insurance divisions of <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates,</b> using the <b>financial</b> data of the respective banking and insurance divisions of fourteen European <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates.</b> From among them, we collected the data of the respective banking divisions of twelve <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates,</b> separately for personal banking and corporate banking, and determined the existence of synergies among the personal banking division, corporate banking division and insurance division of the <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates.</b> As a result, we confirmed the existence of revenue synergies between banking operations and insurance operations, while no cost synergies have been observed in preceding studies...|$|R

40|$|If {{combining}} {{insurance and}} banking services generates scope economies {{in terms of}} monitoring the customers, competition {{in the financial markets}} becomes more intense after financial conglomeration.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the optimal regulation of <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> that combine {{a bank and}} a non-bank <b>financial</b> institution. The <b>conglomerate’s</b> risk-taking incentives depend upon the level of market discipline it faces, {{which in turn is}} determined by the conglomerate’s liability structure. We examine optimal capital requirements for standalone institutions, for integrated <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates,</b> and for <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> that are structured as holding companies. For a given risk profile, integrated conglomerates have a lower probability of failure than either their standalone or decentralized equivalent. However, when risk profiles are endogenously selected conglomeration may extend the reach of the deposit insurance safety net and hence provide incentives for increased risk-taking. As a result, integrated conglomerates may optimally attract higher capital requirements. In contrast, decentralized conglomerates are able to hold assets in the socially most efficient place. Their optimal capital requirements encourage this. Hence, the practice of ‘regulatory arbitrage’, or of transferring assets from one balance sheet to another, is welfare-increasing. We discuss the policy implications of our finding in the context not only of the present debate on the regulation of <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> but also in the light of existing US bank holding company regulation. capital regulation; financial conglomerate; regulatory arbitrage...|$|R

We apply this framework to different types of insurers (<b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates,</b> life insurance companies, mixed insurers, general insurers) for more than 150 institutions from 20 countries. We find significant differences between different types of insurers and between countries. The results also suggest that social and ethical aspects of CSR are better integrated in the business activities of insurers than environmental aspects are. <b>Financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> perform better than other types of insurers.

We discuss the theoretical reasons why supervisors are interested in the riskiness of a financial firm and why – for firms – a similar concern emerges from the theory on risk management, both from a market and a firm perspective. After describing the Dutch institutional set-up, we turn to the discussion of the following question: How can a supervisor devise a framework of supervision that does justice to a <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerate’s</b> own responsibility and, at the same time, safeguards the general public’s interest? The framework, we feel, should be similar in flavor to the Supervisory Review, as proposed in the new Basel accord. supervision, <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates,</b> banks, insurers, diversification...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to look at the main {{empirical}} findings related to the bank-insurance model and to outline the market practices across the world. The market dynamics underpinning the bancassurance phenomenon are analyzed alongside discussions of the various bancassurance products and bank-insurance modes of entry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a brief survey of the bank-insurance trend and provides an insight into the underlying dynamics and corporate structures of <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates.</b> Findings – There is an uneven success of the bancassurance phenomenon across the world. It is not clear whether re-regulation is the cause or response to globalization, and vice versa, which in turn both shape the bancassurance arena. A number of incentives for the formation of <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates</b> are identified. Finally, three modes of entry have been documented to reflect market realities. Originality/value – The paper will be of value to those interested in <b>financial</b> <b>conglomerates,</b> banking and insurance. It is suitable for academics and practitioners alike.
