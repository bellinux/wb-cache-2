500|$|Tibbets {{was interviewed}} {{extensively}} by Mike Harden of the Columbus Dispatch, and profiles {{appeared in the}} newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb. In a 1975 interview he said: [...] "I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did... I sleep clearly every night." [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1956, {{his song}} [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] reached number 29 on the Billboards Top 100 chart, and Berry toured {{as one of the}} [...] "Top Acts of '56". He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first heard Chuck that he'd been {{affected}} by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." [...] As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did. Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites. [...] "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe's songs as well", Perkins remembered. [...] "He told me about how he was raised very poor, very tough. He had a hard life. He was a good guy. I really liked him." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2005, ABC {{announced}} that Dick Clark {{would return to}} New Year's Rockin' Eve for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would {{be joined by a}} new co-host, media personality and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing New Year's Eve Live—which, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to USA Today, Seacrest reminisced on having watched New Year's Rockin' Eve in his childhood, stating that [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was on other shows, I knew we weren't going to beat Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve." [...] As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special. In an interview with People Magazine in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis.|$|E

2500|$|Axelrod {{was born}} on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City, {{and grew up in}} its Stuyvesant Town area. He was raised in a liberal Jewish family. His mother, Myril Bennett (née Davidson), was a {{journalist}} at PM, a liberal-leaning 1940s newspaper, and later an advertising executive at Young & Rubicam. [...] His father, Joseph Axelrod, was a psychologist and avid baseball fan, who migrated from Eastern Europe to the United States at the age of eleven. He attended Public School 40 in Manhattan. Axelrod's parents separated when he was eight years old. Axelrod traces his political involvement back to his childhood. Describing the appeal of politics, he told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I got into politics because I believe in idealism. Just {{to be a part of}} this effort that seems to be rekindling the kind of idealism that I <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a kid, it's a great thing to do. So I find myself getting very emotional about it." [...] At thirteen years old, he was selling campaign buttons for Robert F. Kennedy. After graduating from New York's Stuyvesant High School in 1972, Axelrod attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in Political Science.|$|E
