5|$|Heraclius the Elder is next {{mentioned}} in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius the Elder {{had been appointed}} to the position by Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. He might have replaced Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600. The appointment suggests that Heraclius the Elder enjoyed the favor of Maurice and would <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> to remain loyal to him. Heraclius the Elder and his African court notably lamented the death and execution of Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.|$|E
5|$|In Arizona v. Gant (2009), the Court {{ruled that}} a law {{enforcement}} officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an arrest of an occupant of that vehicle, unless 1) {{at the time of}} the search the person being arrested is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2) police officers <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that evidence for the crime for which the person is being arrested will be found in the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Women {{have higher}} levels of parental {{investment}} because they carry the developing child, and higher confidence in their maternity since they witness giving birth to the child. Hence women <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> to accept greater responsibility for raising their children. By comparison, males have no objective way of being certain that the child they are raising is biologically theirs. Because of this difference, males have to adapt their own sexual strategies to accommodate the strategies of the females around them.|$|E

25|$|Carrier {{argues in}} his book On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might <b>Have</b> <b>Reason</b> for Doubt that there is {{insufficient}} Bayesian probability, that is evidence, {{to believe in the}} existence of Jesus. Furthermore, Carrier argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century. He argues that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere in the range from 1/3 to 1/12000 depending on the estimates used for the computation.|$|E
25|$|Later, Belle {{tells her}} father about trapped ogre. When {{they arrive at}} the pit, Gaston is injured and claims the ogre had escaped and waited to attack him. Gaston {{suddenly}} sees the ogre and shoots at the creature with arrow from the tree. Gaston is ready to kill the ogre but Belle argues with him, believing there is a misunderstanding. During the argument Gaston breaks the mirror. When Belle sees the broken glass she notices Gaston's eyes glowing red. That, combined with several fresh wounds on the ogre, reveals that Gaston had tortured the ogre in order to provoke the creature so they would <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> to kill it. Belle lets the ogre escape.|$|E
25|$|In many {{cultures}} of the Old and New Worlds, this gemstone has been esteemed {{for thousands of years}} as a holy stone, a bringer of good fortune or a talisman. The oldest evidence for this claim was found in Ancient Egypt, where grave furnishings with turquoise inlay were discovered, dating from approximately 3000BCE. In the ancient Persian Empire, the sky-blue gemstones were earlier worn round the neck or wrist as protection against unnatural death. If they changed colour, the wearer was thought to <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> to fear the approach of doom. Meanwhile, it has been discovered that the turquoise certainly can change colour, but that this is not necessarily a sign of impending danger. The change can be caused by the light, or by a chemical reaction brought about by cosmetics, dust or the acidity of the skin.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{possible}} explanations for why newcomers earn less than native Canadians in the same jobs with the same skills. Lower hourly wages might be an indication that the labour productivity of immigrants is lower, and employers thus <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> to pay them less. New workers are also less familiar with the Canadian labour market and will thus not be able to maximize their salaries. Employers will also be less familiar with an immigrant's background and thus less willing to offer the same salary as to a native. Immigrants, especially visible minorities have different values than native-born Canadians as they tend to favour living in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver as opposed to other places much more than native-born Canadians. Due to lower mobility, they do not access better paying jobs, such as in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This has been changing with Calgary already surpassing Montreal in terms of percentage of visible minorities. Visible minorities in Saskatchewan earn higher wages than native-born Canadians.|$|E
25|$|The Pontifex Maximus {{determined}} when an intercalary {{month was}} to be inserted. On average, this happened in alternate years. The system of aligning the year through intercalary months broke down at least twice: {{the first time was}} during and after the Second Punic War. It led to the reform of the 191 Acilian Law on Intercalation, the details of which are unclear, but it appears to have successfully regulated intercalation for over a century. The second breakdown {{was in the middle of}} the first century and may have been related to the increasingly chaotic and adversarial nature of Roman politics at the time. The position of Pontifex Maximus was not a full-time job; it was held by a member of the Roman elite, who would almost invariably be involved in the machinations of Roman politics. Because the term of office of elected Roman magistrates was defined in terms of a Roman calendar year, a Pontifex Maximus would <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> to lengthen a year in which he or his allies were in power or shorten a year in which his political opponents held office.|$|E
25|$|Due to the LCD layer {{that generates}} the desired high {{resolution}} images at flashing video speeds using very low power electronics {{in combination with}} these excellent LED based backlight technologies, LCD technology has become the domination display technology for products such as televisions, desktop monitors, notebooks, tablets, smartphones and mobile phones. Although competing OLED technology is pushed to the market, such OLED displays does not feature the HDR capabilities like LCDs in combination with 2D LED backlight technologies <b>have,</b> <b>reason</b> why the annual market of such LCD-based products is still growing faster (in volume) than OLED-based products while the efficiency of LCDs (and products like portable computers, mobile phones and televisions) may even be further improved by preventing the light to be absorbed in the colour filters of the LCD. Although until today such reflective colour filter solutions are not yet implemented by the LCD industry and did not made it further than laboratory prototypes, such reflective colour filter solutions still likely will be implemented by the LCD industry to increase the performance gap with OLED technologies).|$|E

25|$|For many {{classical}} philosophers, {{nature was}} understood teleologically, meaning that {{every type of}} thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even said to <b>have</b> <b>reason.</b> Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal {{part of the human}} mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (psyche), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (thumos) and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He defined the highest human happiness or well being (eudaimonia) as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.|$|E

When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E
