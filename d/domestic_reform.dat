The relationship between Helen and Frederick, sister and brother, who spent all their childhood apart and reunited only as adults, is foregrounded to <b>domestic</b> <b>reform</b> – Frederick's virtue compensates for their father's neglect of Helen, and their comfortable relationship, defined by mutual respect and understanding, contrasts with Helen's problematic relationship with her husband and her suitor.|$|E

25|$|According to Helmut Schmidt, Willy Brandt's <b>domestic</b> <b>reform</b> {{programme}} {{had accomplished}} {{more than any}} previous programme for a comparable period. Levels of social expenditure were increased, with more funds allocated towards housing, transportation, schools, and communication, and substantial federal benefits were provided for farmers. Various measures were introduced to extend health care coverage, while federal aid to sports organisations was increased. A number of liberal social reforms were instituted whilst the welfare state was significantly expanded (with total public spending on social programs nearly doubling between 1969 and 1975), with health, housing, and social welfare legislation bringing about welcome improvements, {{and by the end}} of the Brandt Chancellorship West Germany had one of the most advanced systems of welfare in the world.|$|E
25|$|Having {{obtained}} the intermediary {{degree in the}} imperial exams in 1813, Xu Jiyu was initially unsuccessful in advancing in the exam system.

In the academy, he worked {{under the direction of the}} chancellor, Mujangga, with whom he would work closely during following years. In 1836, he became prefect of Xunzhou in Guangxi province. During his tenure as a prefect Xu Jiyu submitted a number of official memorials on <b>domestic</b> <b>reform,</b> which impressed the Daoguang Emperor and further helped Xu to rapidly rise through the ranks of the Qing civil service. Following the outbreak of the First Opium War, Xu was appointed circuit intendant of a coastal prefecture in Fujian province, where he witnessed the war with his own eyes, an experience that convinced him that China needed to learn more about the West.|$|E
25|$|The SPD’s last {{period in}} office was arguably a failure, due to both {{its lack of}} a {{parliamentary}} majority (which forced it to make compromises to right-wing parties) and its inability to confront the Great Depression. In 1927, the defence ministry had prevailed on the government of Wilhelm Marx to provide funds in its draft budget of 1928 {{for the construction of}} the first of six small battleships allowed for under the treaty of Versailles, although the Federal Council (largely for financial reasons) stopped this action. This issue played a major role during the 1928 election campaign, with supporters of the proposal arguing that all the possibilities left for German armaments should be fully used, while the SPD and the KPD saw this as a wasteful expenditure, arguing that such money should instead be spent on providing free meals for schoolchildren. The SPD’s lack of a parliamentary majority (which prevented it from undertaking any major <b>domestic</b> <b>reform)</b> meant that, in order to hold the coalition together, Hermann Müller and the other SPD ministers were forced to make concessions on issues such as taxation, unemployment insurance, and the construction of pocket battleships.|$|E

40|$|China's WTO {{accession}} has major implications on China's massive {{state-owned enterprise}} (SOE) sectors. In China, SOEs {{as a whole}} generate substantial losses and absorb majority of financial resources, creating increasing risks for financial crisis. This paper argues that China's WTO agreement has positive effect of reducing the subsidies to SOEs and contributing to the continuing reduction of the SOE sector and the corresponding increase in welfare. We document the history of SOE reform in China {{as well as its}} unsatisfactory performance. We hypothesize that an important rationale, among many others, of China's pursuit of WTO membership is to use WTO accession to lock-in the agenda for fundamental <b>domestic</b> <b>reforms,</b> which has been difficult to implement by domestically measures alone. We conduct quantitative analysis of the effects of SOE subsidies on GDP and welfare. The welfare effects of SOE reform induced by the WTO agreement are likely to be much bigger and more significant than the direct gains obtained from tariff reduction. This result highlights the fact that <b>domestic</b> <b>reforms</b> and trade reforms are interlinked. Trade liberalization promotes <b>domestic</b> <b>reforms,</b> often institutional in nature, which may produce substantial welfare gains. These benefits should be added to the direct benefits from tariff reduction. ...|$|R

Whitlam knew that, given the ALP's poor position after the 1966 election, victory was unlikely. Nevertheless, Whitlam scored an 18-seat swing, Labor's best performance since losing government in 1949. [...] Although the Coalition was returned for an eighth term in government, {{it was with a}} slim majority of seven seats, down from 41 after the writs were dropped. Labor actually won a bare majority of the two-party vote; only DLP preferences in four Melbourne-area seats kept Whitlam from becoming prime minister. The 1970 half-Senate election brought little change to Coalition control, but the Liberal vote fell for the first time below 40per cent, representing a severe threat to Gorton's leadership.|$|E

Bearman added that [...] "in a country that formerly suffered foreign domination, 's anti-imperialism has proved enduringly popular".

Supporters praised Gaddafi's administration {{for the creation of}} an almost classless society through <b>domestic</b> <b>reform.</b> They stressed the regime's achievements in combating homelessness, ensuring access to food and safe drinking water, and to dramatic improvements in education; under Gaddafi, literacy rates rose significantly and all education to university level was free.

Multilateral action is an intermediate strategy, important for delivering trade liberalisation in sensitive sectors and in highly protected economies. The paper then considers what institutional approaches might facilitate further <b>domestic</b> structural <b>reforms.</b> Key to this are mechanisms to review the desirability and performance of all regulations and institutions on an ongoing basis, {{and in a way}} that involves all relevant stakeholders. Such policy review institutions can provide technical solutions, helping to identify particular reform options. They can also be part of a strategy to manage the domestic political economy of reform, by providing a forum in which countervailing interests could marshal against vested interests, thus helping to build a coalition in favour of reform. Finally, they can facilitate policy coordination within and across levels of government.
