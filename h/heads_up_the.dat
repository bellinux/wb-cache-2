2500|$|SR 647 {{begins at}} a signalized {{intersection}} with the four-lane divided SR 7 {{in the city}} of Martins Ferry, near the Ohio River. Hanover Street continues southeast across a railroad towards the industrial sections of the city. SR 647 and Hanover Street head northwest into downtown Martins Ferry. The state highway briefly follows North 6th Street for about two blocks before turning left onto Carlisle Street. The route slowly climbs in elevation through the developed part of the city but as it exits the downtown residential neighborhood, the route <b>heads</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> side of a hill at a steeper slope and includes some hairpin turns. As it exits the city limits, SR 647 heads through hilly terrain and occasionally passes homes as it travels northwest. Upon entering the community of Morningview, the route turns north and then east briefly as it winds its way into a valley. After passing County Road 2 (former Ohio State Route 798), it turns north again and exits Belmont County for Jefferson County. This part of the route ascends in a narrow valley towards Mount Pleasant. At the top of the hill, the route curves west and enters the village limits on Union Street.

2500|$|SR 668 {{begins at}} SR 93 in Falls Township, about [...] {{northeast}} of Logan. The route heads north {{and almost immediately}} exits Hocking County and enters Perry County. For the first [...] of the route, the route is also {{within the boundaries of}} the Wayne National Forest. The route reaches Junction City and reaches SR 37 in the center of town. The two routes run together west on Main Street out of town. Shortly after leaving the village, the two routes separate, SR 37 continues west while SR 668 heads north. Upon entering Somerset, the road name becomes Market Street and eventually reaches US 22 (Main Street). SR 668 turns right onto US 22 and the two routes head towards the center of Somerset. SR 13 (Columbus Street) intersects Main Street at a traffic circle in the center of town. The circle houses a memorial to General Philip Sheridan who was born in Somerset. At the eastern village limits, SR 668 splits from US 22 and heads north. North of Somerset, there is a stop-controlled intersection with SR 204 where only travelers on SR 668 must stop. The route then passes a former railroad and makes a sharp turn towards the southeast at Hopewell Township Road 65. It <b>heads</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> side of a hill as it gradually curves back to the north. The route passes the Suburban Landfill before it exits Perry County and enters Licking County. After entering Licking County, SR 668 reaches a partial interchange with I-70. Known as exit 141 on I-70, the interchange only provides eastbound travelers on I-70 the opportunity to connect to SR 668 and access to I-70 westbound only from SR 668. After I-70, the route enters the unincorporated community of Brownsville (within Bowling Green Township). SR 668 comes to an end at an intersection with US 40 (National Road). Travelers that need to access I-70 eastbound can head east on US 40 and access I-70 in the nearby village of Gratiot.|$|E

60|$|A hearty, generous spirit, when vigorously displayed, always finds a ready {{response}} from human hearts.

The effect on the drooping spirits of the hunting-party was electrical. They pricked up like chargers that had felt the spur, wheeled round, and returned the cheer with interest. It was an apparently trifling incident, but it served to lighten the way, and make it seem less dreary for many a long mile.|$|E
6000|$|In August {{the first}} frost came and formed [...] "young ice" [...] on the sea, but this lasted {{only for a}} brief hour or two, and was broken up by the tide and melted.

Hummocks clustered round several rocky islets in the neighbourhood, and the rising and falling of the tide covered {{the sides of the}} rocks with bright crystals. All the feathered tribes took their departure for less rigorous climes, {{with the exception of a}} small white bird about the size of a sparrow, called the snow-bird, which is the last to leave the icy north. Then a tremendous storm arose, and the sea became choked up with icebergs and floes which the frost soon locked together into a solid mass. Towards the close of the storm snow fell in great abundance, and when the mariners ventured again to put their <b>heads</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> opened hatchways, the decks were knee-deep, the drift to windward was almost level with the bulwarks, every yard was edged with white, every rope and cord had a light side and a dark, every point and truck had a white button on it, and every hole, corner, crack, and crevice was choked up.|$|E
