40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} how well different wound <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> meet the needs of nurses in carrying out general wound assessment and whether current tools are fit for purpose. The methodology employed was evaluation research. In order to conduct the evaluation, a literature review was undertaken to identify the criteria of an optimal wound <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> which would meet nurses’ needs. Several freely available wound <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria and an audit tool was developed to evaluate the selected tools based on how well they met the criteria of the optimal wound <b>assessment</b> <b>tool.</b> The results provide a measure of how well the selected wound <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> meet the criteria of the optimal wound <b>assessment</b> <b>tool.</b> No tool was identified which fulfilled all the criteria, but two (the Applied Wound Management tool and the National Wound Assessment Form) met the most criteria of the optimal tool and were therefore considered to best meet nurses’ needs in wound assessment. The study provides a mechanism for the appraisal of wound <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> using a set of optimal criteria which could aid practitioners in their search for the best wound <b>assessment</b> <b>tool...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> is a 7 -item {{instrument}} that discriminates spasticity, dystonia, and rigidity on 3 levels: item scores, subtype, and hypertonia diagnosis for each extremity. We quantified the inter- and intrarater reliability using Kappa statistics, Gwet's first-order agreement coefficient (both with 95 % confidence interval), and percentage agreement for all levels. For validity, {{we compared the}} Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> subtype with the clinical diagnosis provided by the physicians. Two physiotherapists tested 45 children with neuromotor disorders. The interrater reliability (n = 45) of the Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> subtype was moderate to substantial whereas the intrarater reliability (n = 42) was almost perfect. The Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> showed good agreement in detecting spasticity. On the contrary, there was a higher presence of dystonia of 24 % to 25 % tested with the Hypertonia <b>Assessment</b> <b>Tool</b> compared to the clinical diagnosis.

Despite the importance of symptom assessment in palliative care, use of <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> in practice is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess factors that influence use of symptom <b>assessment</b> <b>tools.</b> Methodology: 1 : 1 interviews were conducted using a guideline developed by the researcher. Ten participants who met the inclusion criteria were interviewed. The data was recorded and then transcribed with topics and issues being isolated and grouped together into themes. Findings: The themes were perception of palliative care, communication, practical concerns and emotions associated with use of <b>assessment</b> <b>tools,</b> spirituality and cultural compatibility with <b>assessment</b> <b>tools,</b> resources, policies and training. Conclusion: Lack of quality education in palliative care coupled with incompatibility of current tools with cultural and religious practices is a major hindrance to use of <b>assessment</b> <b>tools.</b> Poor communication among clinicians negatively affects use of <b>assessment</b> <b>tool...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is a broad concept that includes environmental, social and economic aspects {{that can be applied}} to various fields, sustainable urban {{development is}} no exception. Sustainability assessments of buildings have become increasingly common in Sweden since they offer a concrete way of handling sustainability issues. Scholars however believe that a change of scale, from buildings to entire urban areas, is required in order for the sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> to reach their full potential. Several international <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> have already adapted this but there is currently no sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> for urban district developments designed to meet Swedish standards and regulations. The purpose of this master thesis is to show how sustainable urban planning is practiced in Sweden and through this conclude how a Swedish sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> for urban areas should be developed. Our goal is to identify various areas within the existing <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> that need to be altered in order for the systems to be used in Sweden or recognize if there already is an <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> that may be used successfully, in its current version, in Sweden today. Five existing sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> are compared with Swedish stakeholder’s thoughts on what should be included in a Swedish sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> and Swedish sustainable urban development. One literature review and two questionnaires were carried out. A first questionnaire was sent to correspondents for Swedish sustainable urban projects and a second questionnaire was sent to Swedish stakeholders. The results from these showed that urban design was a key area within the sustainable urban developments whilst the stakeholders rated energy and communication issues the highest. The analysis was carried out in three parts. Firstly the chosen sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> were compared with the stakeholders’ opinions, which revealed a low level of correlation between the two. Secondly the <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> were compared with the sustainable urban development projects, which showed a greater correspondence. To conclude the stakeholders’ views were matched against the urban development projects where many parallels were found concerning energy and communication issues. This thesis showed that areas concerning social and economic sustainability must be further developed within the existing international sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> {{if they are to be}} effectively used in Sweden, and accordingly that none of the studied <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> were suitable for Swedish use in their existing version. Therefore the conclusion was made that a new <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> for sustainable urban developments should be developed to meet Swedish standards and regulations using with the existing <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> as reference.

40|$|The U. S. {{criminal}} justice system has used risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> {{in an effort to}} reduce recidivism and risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> are now commonplace. Correctional organizations, however, have struggled with officersâ?? resistance to these tools in spite of the evidence for their utility. There is limited research that explores the impact of resistance to organizational change within the context of correctional agencies. To address that gap, this correlational study used organizational change theory to examine officersâ?? resistance to the use of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> based on officersâ?? opinions of the risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> being used in North Carolina. Data were collected through an online survey of 109 North Carolina probation and parole officers. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the statistical relationship between officer use of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> and the dependent variables which included officersâ?? opinions of the risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tool,</b> knowledge of risk assessments, training for use of risk assessments, risk assessments in the sentencing process, and officersâ?? length of time employed. Findings indicated that opinions of the risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> and training to use the tool statistically impact officersâ?? use of the tool in daily supervision of offenders. Organizational change theory predicted these findings as officersâ?? resistance to policy change was manifested in their opinions of that policy. Implications for positive social change include recommendations for corrections agencies to refine training regarding risk assessments in efforts to minimize officer resistance of properly applying risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> in daily job duties with the intended outcome of reducing recidivism, and therefore preventing future harms to the community...|$|R

40|$|<b>Assessment</b> <b>tools</b> such as {{that offered}} by Chan and Lee might be {{improved}} by a cross-disciplinary {{review of the literature}} base used to construct the indicators. This paper reviews the conceptual basis of the <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> and suggests how the tool might be improved by considering cross-disciplinary readings. It is argued that Chan and Lee‟s <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> for urban sustainability offers an epistemological framework for selecting indicators that is lacking in many other tools for assessing sustainable outcomes. Sustainability is positioned in this model as being achieved when there is a win for economy and in turn a win for the environment and for society. Nevertheless the <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> continues to prioritise economic growth. Inter-relationships between dimensions and connectivity between indicators tend to be suppressed. It is concluded, nevertheless that this <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> represents a significant development in the assessment of urban sustainability by providing a clear conceptual framework for the selection of indicators that is grounded in the research literature. Moreover, the transparency of the conceptual framework in Chan and Lee‟s model reveals how sustainability is understood by the designers of the <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> and clarifies the relationship between the definition of sustainability and the selected indicators. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{the number}} of farm-level {{sustainability}} <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> is growing rapidly, concerns are raised on whether the assessment results of different tools present similar and valid conclusions about the sustainability performance of farms. In this paper we analysed the thematic scope of sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tools,</b> and compared <b>assessment</b> results from sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tools.</b> A coverage analysis of four tools (RISE, SAFA, PG and IDEA) demonstrated the diversity in approaches to assess sustainability at farm level. Tool developers select different (sub) themes and indicators, and apply different methods for measurement and aggregation of scores. This variability in approaches results not only in different tools, but can also result in different conclusions on the sustainability performance of farms. Decisions made {{in the development of}} a sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> need to be transparent to understand and explain the results of a tool and support farmers in a sustainable development of their farm. To improve the transparency in sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> we presented a framework describing decisions made {{in the development of a}} tool.

Materials and Methods: An <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> was created as a checklist of critical steps involved in performing a thoracostomy. The checklist was verified by three expert physicians. Sixteen inexperienced medical students were recruited in pairs to perform one thoracostomy on a synthetic chest tube model in a simulated environment. After completing the procedure, the students used the <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> alongside a video recording of their procedure to conduct a self and peer evaluation. An expert physician conducted an independent evaluation of each student using the same <b>assessment</b> <b>tool.</b> The variations between the self, peer, and expert evaluations were compared to test the <b>assessment</b> <b>tool</b> for objectivity. Results: There was significant variation between self and expert evaluations (p = < 0. 00001) and between peer and expert responses (p = < 0. 00001).

Risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> are recommended by diabetes prevention guidelines to allow blood tests to be targeted at individuals with {{an increased risk of}} currently having non-diabetic hyperglycaemia or undiagnosed diabetes. This thesis presents work on the identification, development and validation of such risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools.</b> Key Findings: -	A systematic review of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> for prevalent non-diabetic hyperglycaemia was undertaken. This is the first systematic review to focus on risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> for prevalent non-diabetic hyperglycaemia. Eighteen risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> for prevalent non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, and prevalent non-diabetic hyperglycaemia or undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes are summarised. -	An empirical comparison of logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines and the novel application of chain event graphs for developing risk <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> found logistic regression and linear support machine vectors had the best external performance. This is the first empirical comparison for a binary medical outcome in cross-sectional data to include an external validation. -	Risk groups for the Leicester Practice risk score were established, allowing consistent advice to be given across general practices when utilising the tool. -	The Leicester Self-Assessment and Leicester Practice risk scores were externally validated using a nationally representative longitudinal dataset. Both gave comparable performance for identifying prevalent non-diabetic hyperglycaemia or undiagnosed diabetes to the dataset on which they were developed. Furthermore, both identified a small proportion of the population with a substantially increased risk of developing diabetes when utilised in the recommended two-stage screening programme and thus are advocated for use across England.
