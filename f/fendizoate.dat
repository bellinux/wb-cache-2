5000|$|Cloperastine (INN) or cloperastin, {{also known}} as {{cloperastine}} hydrochloride (JAN) (brand names Hustazol, Nitossil, Seki) and cloperastine <b>fendizoate</b> (or hybenzoate), is an antitussive and antihistamine that is marketed as a cough suppressant in Japan, Hong Kong, and in some European countries. It was first introduced in 1972 in Japan, and then in Italy in 1981. The precise mechanism of action of cloperastine is not fully clear, but several different biological activities have been identified for the drug, of which include: ligand of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 20 nM) (likely an agonist), GIRK channel blocker (described as [...] "potent"), antihistamine (Ki = 3.8 nM for the H1 receptor), and anticholinergic. It is thought that the latter two properties contribute to side effects, such as sedation and somnolence, while the former two {{may be involved in}} or responsible for the antitussive efficacy of cloperastine.|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} of an impurity {{of a drug}} substance as genotoxic means that the “threshold of toxicological concern” (TTC) value of 1. 5 ug/day intake, considered {{to be associated with}} an acceptable risk, should be the admissible limit in the raw material and that leads to new analytical challenges. In this study, reliable chromatographic methods were developed and applied as limit tests for the control of three genotoxic impurities (GTIs) in cloperastine <b>fendizoate,</b> drug widely used as an antitussive active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In particular, GC–MS was applied to the determination of one alkyl halide (2 -chloroethanol, 2 -CE), while HPLC-DAD was selected for the analysis of two sulfonate esters (methyl p-toluenesulfonate, MPTS, and 2 -chloroethyl p-toluenesulfonate, CEPTS). Regarding GC–MS, strong anion-exchange (SAX) -SPE was applied to remove <b>fendizoate</b> from the sample solutions, due its low volatility and its high amount in the raw material. The GC–MS analysis was performed on a Factor Four VF- 23 ms capillary column (30 m × 0. 25 mm I. D., film thickness 0. 25 um, Varian). Single ion-monitoring (SIM) detection mode was set at m/z 80. In the case of HPLC-DAD, a suitable optimization of the chromatographic conditions was carried out in order to obtain a good separation of the impurity peaks from the drug substance peaks. The optimized method utilizes a SymmetryShield RP 8 column (250 mm × 4. 6 mm, 5 um, Waters) kept at 50 ◦C, withphosphate buffer (pH 3. 0; 10 mM) –methanol (containing 10 % ACN) (45 : 55, v/v) as the mobile phase, at the flow-rate of 1. 7 mL/min and UV detection at 227 nm. The required sensitivity level was achieved by injecting 80 uL of sample solution, purified from <b>fendizoate</b> by SAX-SPE, followed by a 1 : 1 (v/v) dilutionof the SPE eluate with water. For both GC–MS and HPLC-DAD, the method validation was performed in relation to specificity and limit of detection (LOD), as required by ICH guidelines in relation to limit assays. The developed methods were successfully applied for the determination of GTIs in five different batches of cloperastine <b>fendizoate.</b> In all the analyzed batches, the three target GTIs were below the concentration limit...|$|E
