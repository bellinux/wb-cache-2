The Gómez-Muñoz model was applied using information obtained from the artisanal Galician fleet from 1998 to 2000. This information was used to estimate catches per unit of effort (CPUE) and total catch for the whole directed creel fishery. A total of 73 interviews were conducted in 22 ports in the west part of <b>ICES</b> <b>division</b> VIIIc and 75 interviews in 16 ports in the north part of <b>ICES</b> <b>division</b> IXa. The estimated total catch during the fishing season for the whole Galician fleet was 5214 t (2528 t in VIIIc and 2686 t in IXa), and the average CPUE for the VIIIc and IXa fishing grounds obtained from the model was 44. 11 and 23. 83 kg haul- 1 respectively. To test {{the reliability of the}} model, the outputs obtained for a subset of 35 ports (19 in VIIIc and 16 in IXa), were compared with the official statistics of these ports.

40|$|The period {{analyzed}} {{in this paper}} is 2000 - 2004. Data from the Spanish commercial fishery (hauls, positions, CPUE and length distributions) were recorded on board by scientific observers of the national sampling network. The effort data come from the Fisheries National Administration (SGPM). The Spanish pelagic redfish fishery in ICES areas XII and XIV and in the NAFO Div. 1 F and 2 J showed a significant seasonal pattern {{in terms of its}} geographical and depth distribution. The fishing season occurs mainly during the 2 nd and 3 rd quarter of every year. In the second quarter the fleet works in area XIV, between the Greenland and Iceland EEZs, in depths deeper than 500 m capturing fish of great size. Proportion of females in the catches is greater than the males. The catches length distributions present two modes that move along the time. In third quarter the fleet moves toward the south west to <b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> XII and NAFO Div. 1 F and 2 J and depth of hauls is less than 500 m. The length distributions of the catches are smaller than those of the second quarter and show only one mode rather stable in time. Proportion of the males in the catches is bigger than the females. The yields in these Divisions are smaller than in Division XIV.

40|$|Yearly {{cephalopods}} discard estimations for Spanish trawl eets {{operating in}} Northeast Atlantic area (ICES V I, V II, V IIIc and IXa) {{over the period}} 2003 - 2010 are presented. Estimations are aggregated from m etier to shing ground level. Only information for the most important species in terms of discarded biomass and those included in the Data Collection Framework directive are presented. Squid species belonging to the family Ommastrephi- dae and the Octopodidae Eledone cirrhosa were the most discarded species in the northern shing grounds, nevertheless volume discarded of those species are much higher in ICES Sub-area V I V II than in Divisions V IIIc and IXa north.

40|$|Fisheries for {{the most}} common elasmobranch species landed in the Cantabrian Sea (<b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> VIIIc) are reviewed. Special {{attention}} is given to small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the following Rajidae thornback ray (Raja clavata), spotted ray, (R. montagui) and cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus), representing more than the 90 % of ray landings. A market sampling program {{was carried out in}} 2001 to improve the knowledge of species that are frequently landed as a mixed species assemblage, occasionally gutted, {{or in the case of}} rays, "wings " (pectoral fins retained). Commercial length distributions by gear, area and quarter are presented as well. Thirty-five percent of the catches in the trawl fishery are discarded. The estimated annual average of dogfish catch is about 1 500 tons, 80 % of which is discarded. In the case of ray species, the estimated annual catch is 600 tons, ~ 30 % being discarded...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{estimates}} age and growth {{parameters of the}} European hake Merluccius mer-luccius Linnaeus, 1758 from the Northeast Atlantic (<b>ICES</b> <b>division</b> IXa, Portuguese continental waters), based on otolith analysis. A total of 951 otoliths sections were examined, covering a length range of 10 - 80 cm, from fish taken during surveys carried out between October 1996 and July 1997. The annual ring interpretation followed the recently established standard ageing cri-teria, particularly for the first age groups. Quarterly age-length keys, for combined sexes, and the respective mean length at age were obtained. An indirect validation based on length-frequency analysis was performed using the Bhattacharya method. The estimated Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L ∞ = 110. 6 cm, k = 0. 08 year– 1 and t 0 = – 0. 97 year. These values {{are similar to those}} reported by other authors for the same species...|$|E
40|$|Non-inclusion of discard data {{in stock}} {{assessment}} {{can lead to}} underestimation of biomass and fishing mortality; this is of particular concern if there have been changes in discard practices over time. Although variability {{in space and time}} is a well-documented feature of discards, the temporal dynamics of the practice has received little detailed attention. The aim here is to characterize the temporal patterns of discarding practices in the Irish Sea (<b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> VIIa) from 1994 to 2008. Trend and seasonality were explored in discards per unit effort (dpue) of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and cod (Gadus morhua) through Bayesian harmonic regression (HREG) models. The HREG models reveal discarding of all three species in annual cycles, with a peak in the second quarter, perhaps reflecting species biology or fisher behaviour, or both. The dpue of cod cycled around a constant level throughout the observation period, but whiting and haddock dpue increased...|$|E

40|$|Data {{obtained}} {{during a}} Spanish experimental fishing survey, performed in deep {{waters of the}} North East Atlantic, on board a vessel of the commercial fishing fleet, from 3 rd September to 17 th November 1994, were analyzed. The survey was aimed at prospecting new fishing zones and possible new commercially viable species at depths of over 800 metres. The areas prospected were in international waters, between parallels 54 º and 57 ºN, in Subarea XII and <b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> VIb. Nets were hauled at depths ranging between 873 and 1190 metres. The species with the largest CPUE's were Alepocephalus bairdii, with 178 k/f. h., Coryphaenoides rupestris, with 159 k/f. h. and Centroscymnus coelolepis with 97 k/f. h. The other species presented CPUE's of below 35 k/f. h. The CPUE values for the total catch increased with depth.

40|$|The age, growth, {{maturity}} and population dynamics of lemon sale (Microstomus kin), from commercial catches off {{the west coast}} of Ireland (<b>ICES</b> <b>division</b> Vllb), was determined for the period November 2000 to February 2002. The maximum age recorded was 14 years. Males of the population were dominated by 4 year olds, while females were dominated by 5 year olds. Females dominated the sex ratio in the overall sample, by month sampled, by age class and by size (from 22 cm in total length onwards. when N > 20). Mature male and female lemon sale were encountered at age 2 and above. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated using the method of Rafail (1973). In recent years, the lemon sale has exhibited a smaller asymptotic length (L∞ = 34. 47 cm), faster growth rate (K = 0. 1955) and younger age at first maturity than in the same area in 1978 - 1979. These changes are indicative of a decrease in population size following exploitation. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} {{and identification}} of all the Spanish fishing activity targeting deep-sea species was conducted using a non-hierarchical classification technique designed for large matrices (CLARA). Otter trawl and set longlines were the main gears used in deep-sea ecosystems. The otter trawl fleet conducted 3 deep-sea fishing tactics. The only otter trawl fishing tactic targeting deep-sea species was that working in the VI <b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> and targeting Alepocephalus baiirdi. The other 2 otter trawl fishing tactics targeted shallower shelf demersal resources, deep-sea species being secondary (Phycis blennoides). The longline fleet carried out 7 fishing tactics targeting deep-sea species (Molva spp.; deep water sharks; P. blennoides; Pagellus bogaraveo; and Trichiuridae) and 2 fishing tactics targeting Conger conger, which perform as deep-sea fishing tactics in the narrow continental shelf area. This classification, together with knowledge regarding their seasonal performance and spatial distribution, may help to design fisheries sampling protocols and to improve the management of these fleets, thus reducing their impact on deep-sea habitats...|$|E

40|$|A non-hierarchical {{classification}} technique (clustering large applications, CLARA) {{was used}} to identify four fishing tactics of Spanish otter trawlers in the Cantabrian Sea (<b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> VIIIc) from 1983 to 2004 : mixed fishing, blue whiting fishing, horse mackerel fishing, and mackerel fishing. There {{were no significant differences}} in the fishing tactics employed by two trawl fleets identified using a non-hierarchical classification technique (partition around medoids). There was, however, a decline in the use of the blue whiting fishing tactic from 2000 on, perhaps as a result of competition with pairtrawls, a gear whose main target species is blue whiting. There was an increase in the number of trips using the mackerel fishing tactic from 1996, a change possibly caused by improved market conditions. Between 2000 and 2004, the fleets had two distinct behaviour patterns, identified depending on the area in which they operated. The study area could therefore be subdivided into two areas based on the prevalence of the fishing tactic followed. The horse mackerel fishing tactic was more commonly used in the west, and the mixed fishing tactic in the east...|$|E
40|$|Herein {{we propose}} a nested boostrap scheme to explore di erent sources of {{variability}} in discard data. The proposed tool resamples on trips, hauls within trips and lengthclasess within hauls {{to include all}} sources of variability identified in the Spanish DCR sampling program scheme. Megrim (Lepidorhombus wiffiagonis) and Hake (Merluccius merluccius) discard data collected in 2008 from OTB- 51 metier operating in <b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> VI - VII, and Mediterranea DEF-Southern metier operating in the GSA 6 S area were considered as case studies. Bootstrap Error and Coeficients of Variation associated to mean discards per trip were obtained and compared with asymptotic estimates. Furthermore, we use the bootstrap to quantify {{the contribution of the}} given sources of variability to global variability, and to assess simulated sampling scenarios differing each others in sampling effort. The last application of this method is for detecting outliers in 2008 sampled units (Trips). The good performance of the bootstrap method validates its use to obtain reliable error estimates in further regression and/or classiffication studies on discard data...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{collected}} data support earlier indications {{of the value}} of the plerocercus of the trypanorhynch oestone Grillotia angeli as a biological tag for estimating the size of the Western stock component in populations of adult mackerel, Scomber scombrus L., of mixed stock composition. During 1981, three samples of mackerel were examined from the northern North Sea, one from the Norwegian Sea and one from off the north coast of Scotland. The proportion of Western stock mackerel in each of these samples was estimated by comparing the prevalence rate of G[?]angeli in each sample with the mean prevalence rate in mackerel samples from the western English Channel. The results indicate that some mackerel samples of Western stock origin do not return to Western stock spawning grounds but remain in the North Sea to spawn. The sample form the Norwegian Sea was estimated to consist of about 90 % North Sea stock, a result contrasts strongly with calculation of stock composition in <b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> Ila based on returns of “mechanical” tags...|$|E

40|$|The Prestige {{oil tanker}} sank in November 2002 and leaked around 60 000 mt. of heavy oil (type M- 100) into the sea. Immediately after the accident, closed areas were established. Among the fleets {{affected}} by the closures were four {{of the most important}} in <b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> VIIIc and Sub-division IXa North (bottom trawl, pair trawl, purse seine targeting sardine and hand line targeting mackerel) as they exploit considerable resources, some outside biological safety limits. A fall in effort was observed in all of them, mainly in the first quarter and in sub-divisions VIIIc West and IXa North, although it failed to lead to a very large reduction in the total annual effort of each of the fleets, with the exception of hand line. Pair trawlers can make two types of fishing trip, but differences in specific composition among the three years analysed were not found in either of them. In the case of trawl, five kinds of fishing trips were identified, and changes were only found in the type that targets Norway lobster, hake, megrim and monk (HMMN), with a fall in the presence of Norway lobster...|$|E
40|$|In the Celtic Sea and <b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> VIIj, to {{the south}} and {{southwest}} of Ireland, herring is an important commercial species and currently Ireland is the only country targeting this species in this area. Herring in this region comprise both autumn and winter spawning components. Commercial fishing has targeted the fish during spawning times, though in most recent years fish have been targeted during the summer feeding phase too. In VIIj, fishing has traditionally taken place in October, and concentrated in the bays and inlets. In contrast, fishing in VIIaS has mainly been in December to January, though in VIIg the fishery traditionally takes place from November to January. The protracted spawning period of herring and the overlap between the two spawning socks in this area (October to February) means {{that it is difficult to}} design a survey that covers all spawning fish in one specific survey. The stock structure and discrimination of herring in this area is not fully understood. It is known that fish in the eastern Celtic Sea recruit from nursery areas in the Irish Sea and tagging studies have shown linkages between these areas also. For the purpose of stock assessment and management these areas have been combined since 1982. A project is currently underway to describe stock structure and discrimination of herring around Ireland. The results of this project may have implications for the design of this survey and for the stock assessment. For a period in the 1980 ’s, egg and larval surveys were conducted for herring in this area. However, since 1989, acoustic surveys have been carried out, and currently are the only tuning indices available. In the Celtic Sea and VIIj, herring acoustic surveys have been carried out since 1989, and the current survey is the 15 th in the series. In addition to the survey track a small component (Baginbun) was intensively surveyed using acoustic and multibeam mapping techniques. The Baginbun area is located east of Waterford Harbour in <b>ICES</b> <b>division</b> VIIaS. Baginbun has supported a large winter fishery for many years and is one of the most important and well known winter spawning areas on the south coast. This year for the first time the RV Celtic Explorer was to survey the area. This allowed a more extensive degree of coverage in the time allocated, the survey was further complemented with a number of hydrographic transects concentrating along the bays in the west and southwest and also along the southern coastline.

40|$|A multinomial {{logistic}} model {{is presented as}} a tool for comparing two or more age–length keys. The model provides an objective way to fill in missing values and can be used for estimating uncertainty and visualizing age–length keys (ALKs). An example of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus L.) in <b>ICES</b> <b>Division</b> VIa (West of Scotland) is used to illustrate that significant regional differences in the proportions of age classes-at-length can exist on a small spatial scale. These differences are caused by regional variation in both length-at-age and relative abundance at age. As the length-at-age data are normally not weighted by the local catch rate (abundance), the ALK of the combined age data can result in strongly biased estimates of numbers-at-age. In the present case, the use of unweighted age data would have resulted in an overestimate of recruitment of nearly 200 % and an underestimate of spawning stock biomass of 15 %. Comparing ALKs using this method has several practical applications in fisheries science.
