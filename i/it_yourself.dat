5|$|Like their garage rock predecessors, {{these local}} scenes were {{facilitated}} by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools, garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines. In some cases, punk's do <b>it</b> <b>yourself</b> ethic reflected {{an aversion to}} commercial success, {{as well as a}} desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy. As Joe Harvard, a participant in the Boston scene, describes, it was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines left little recourse but DIY.|$|E
5|$|Homer is {{relaxing}} on a Saturday when Marge {{tells him}} {{that he should be}} doing work around the house and yard. Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment. But while there, Homer sees a do <b>it</b> <b>yourself</b> barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on the construct, mangling it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks. It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down. It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller (voiced by Isabella Rossellini), and sees Homer's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art. Homer's exhibit goes to the Louvre: American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work, Homer becomes a success.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a {{sophisticated}} do <b>it</b> <b>yourself</b> infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes {{took advantage of}} this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.|$|E
25|$|Pop-influenced {{punk rock}} {{emerged in the}} mid-1970s with a music style that was stylistically similar to power pop. By the mid-1980s, several bands merged {{hardcore}} punk with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound such as Dag Nasty, the Nip Drivers, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, and the Descendents. Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity locally in California in the mid-to-late 1980s. Pop punk particularly thrived in California, where independent record labels adopted a do <b>it</b> <b>yourself</b> (DIY) approach to releasing music. By the mid-1990s, a few pop punk bands had started to sell millions of records and receive extensive radio and television airplay. By 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. The late 1990s, exemplified by the 1999 release of Blink-182's Enema of the State, represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s. In the mid-2000s, emo pop, a fusion genre combining emo and pop punk, became popular. By {{the end of the}} 2000s, the pop punk sound of the 1990s had largely waned in mainstream popularity.|$|E
25|$|Pop punk in the United States {{began to}} grow in {{popularity}} in the late 1980s especially in California due to bands like Dag Nasty and All, but the genre was not yet considered commercially viable by major US record labels. Bands such as Bad Religion, Descendents, and The Vandals began to inspire the formation of bands like The Offspring (1984) and the more melodic Green Day (1987), although {{it would take a}} number of years for these new bands to achieve mainstream popularity. As these new bands came into the scene, they were exposed to criticism for not representing the punk image as it originated in the 1970s, most notably by Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon. Many pop punk bands espoused a do <b>it</b> <b>yourself</b> (DIY) approach to their music, and a number of independent record labels emerged during this period, often run by band members who wanted to release their own music and that of their friends. During this period several independent labels were formed that would achieve much notoriety and commercial success in the 1990s, namely Epitaph Records (1987), Lookout Records (1987), and Fat Wreck Chords (1990). During the 1980s and early 1990s, pop punk bands such as The Queers, The Mr. T Experience, Jawbreaker and Screeching Weasel emerged. Some of these bands, including Screeching Weasel, The Queers and The Mr. T Experience, were signed to the record label Lookout! Records, which also signed Green Day.|$|E

500|$|Punk rock {{emerged in}} the mid-1970s as a {{reaction}} against contemporary social conditions {{as well as what}} was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal.

500|$|Early guitar-based {{punk rock}} {{that came to}} {{prominence}} in the period 1976–77 was initially hostile to the [...] "inauthentic" [...] sound of the synthesizer, but many new wave and post-punk bands {{that emerged from the}} movement began to adopt it as a major part of their sound.
