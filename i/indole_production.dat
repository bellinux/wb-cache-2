Though this phenomenon has been reported previously, the role of aniline in the <b>production</b> of <b>indoles</b> is still a biochemical riddle. The present study aims at understanding the specific role of aniline (as precursor or stimulator) in the <b>production</b> of <b>indoles</b> and elucidating the biochemical pathway of indoles in aniline-exposed cells by using stable isotope approaches. Metabolic profiling revealed tryptophan accumulation only in aniline exposed cells along with indole 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and indole 3 -aldehyde (IAld), the two major catabolites of tryptophan. Deuterium labelled aniline feeding studies revealed that aniline is not a precursor of indoles in strain JA 2. Further, <b>production</b> of <b>indoles</b> only in aniline-exposed cells suggests that aniline is an indoles stimulator. In addition, <b>production</b> of <b>indoles</b> depended {{on the presence of}} a carbon source, and production enhanced when carbon sources were added to the culture. Isotope labelled fumarate feeding identified, fumarate as the precursor of indole, indicating de novo synthesis of indoles. Glyphosate (shikimate pathway inhibitor) inhibited the <b>indoles</b> <b>production,</b> accumulation of tryptophan, IAA and IAld indicating that indoles synthesis in strain JA 2 occurs via the de novo shikimate pathway.

Total proteins, amino acids, proline and vincristine alkaloid contents were estimated before and after stress. Both salinity and drought reduced the amount of shoot total proteins while increased the amount of total amino acids which has been attributed to enhanced protein degradation and/or de novo synthesis of amino acids. Accumulation of proline after both stresses supported the previously recorded correlation between cellular proline levels and the capacity to survive environmental stresses. Salinity and drought resulted in increased amounts of the amino acids serine, methionine and arginine, which are considered precursors for the synthesis of glycinebetaine, nicotinamide and putrescine that are commonly encountered osmolytes that accumulates in plants under salinity and drought stresses. Vincristine alkaloid content increased with two peaks at 150 mM salinity at the 2 nd month of treatment and at the 4 th month of the highest drought level. The increase in vincristine content was attributed to the raised levels of arginine subsequent to stress that could derive the biosynthesis of putrescine.

40|$|It {{has long}} been speculated that metabolites, {{produced}} by gut microbiota, influence host metabolism in health and diseases. Here, we reveal that indole, a metabolite produced from the dissimilation of tryptophan, is able to modulate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) from immortalized and primary mouse colonic L cells. Indole increased GLP- 1 release during short exposures, but it reduced secretion over longer periods. These effects were attributed {{to the ability of}} indole to affect two key molecular mechanisms in L cells. On the one hand, indole inhibited voltage-gated K+ channels, increased the temporal width of action potentials fired by L cells, and led to enhanced Ca 2 + entry, thereby acutely stimulating GLP- 1 secretion. On the other hand, <b>indole</b> slowed ATP <b>production</b> by blocking NADH dehydrogenase, thus leading to a prolonged reduction of GLP- 1 secretion. Our results identify indole as a signaling molecule by which gut microbiota communicate with L cells and influence host metabolism...|$|R
