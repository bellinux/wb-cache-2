25|$|By {{the age of}} 16, Shields {{had become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} faces in the United States, because of her <b>dual</b> <b>career</b> as a provocative fashion model and child actress. Time magazine reported in its February 9, 1981 cover story that her day rate as a model was $10,000. In 1983, Shields appeared on the cover of the September issue of Paris Vogue, the October and November issues of American Vogue and the December edition of Italian Vogue. During that period Shields became a regular at New York City's nightclub Studio 54. In 2009, a picture of a naked Brooke Shields taken when she was 10 and included in a work by Richard Prince, Spiritual America, created a row. It was removed from an exhibition at the Tate Modern after a warning from the police.|$|E
500|$|After graduation, Shostakovich {{initially}} {{embarked on}} a <b>dual</b> <b>career</b> as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his [...] "emotional restraint" [...] and [...] "riveting rhythmic drive"). He nevertheless won an [...] "honorable mention" [...] at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He explained the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He later had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates couples {{patterns of}} career and life trajectories {{and the ways}} in which their careers are linked. To this end, 90 members of the medical and psychological professions and their partners gave detailed retrospective reports on their occupational goals, positions and careers over the previous 15 years. Three distinct patterns of <b>dual</b> <b>careers</b> were observed: couples who formulated their career goals largely independently of each other and whose career paths were separate (segmentation), couples whose career paths were coordinated (integration), and couples whose career paths overlapped to such a degree that they more or less merged (de-limitation). The professions investigated, their institutional career logics, and gender role expectations proved to have particularly strong effects on the patterns of <b>dual</b> <b>careers</b> observed. Findings also showed that commonalities in the partners occupational fields not only play a significant role in terms of mutual career support in couples, but also affect the relationship between their career trajectories. In a supplementary interview study with 23 couples representing the three patterns of <b>dual</b> <b>careers</b> identified, the focus of analysis was widened to cover personal goals and biographies in addition to career goals. Empirical type analysis was used to identify five complex types of dyadic lifestyles: 1.) traditional/complementary type, 2.) non-traditional/complementary type, 3.) coordinated/symmetrical type, 4.) individualistic/symmetrical type and 5.) de-limited/symmetrical type. The ratio of individual to joint goals and the gender division of labour emerged to be particularly relevant when it came to describing and distinguishing between these types. The interview study also provided insights into the apparent contradiction between the theoretical expectations of intimate relationships in todays society and the continued gendered division of labour in practice, and into the question of why college-educated couples often fail to capitalise on the potential of <b>dual</b> <b>careers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Retiring from elite sport {{can be a}} {{difficult}} and disruptive process for an elite athlete. To {{improve the quality of}} the transition after retirement, elite athletes are recommended to have <b>dual</b> <b>careers</b> which mean they combine their sport with education to be prepared for a new career when they retire from elite sport. To help elite student-athletes with this combination, universities and sport organizations provide different kind of support. This study was conducted and aimed to investigate elite athletes’ perceptions of support offered by a university in Sweden and the elite athletes’ perceptions of combining top level sport and academic studies. Questions about identity, balance and future were also examined. Qualitative interviews were made with nine elite student-athletes within the University. The results showed that elite student-athletes experience <b>dual</b> <b>careers</b> important and feel support from Universities and Sports Organizations is needed for this combination. The results also showed that elite student-athletes knowledge of support functions is lacking and that there are missing different kinds of support. Most elite student-athletes experience difficulties balancing sport, studies and social life, strongly identifying themselves to the athletic role and believe that an academic career is of great importance for the future. The study points to the importance of understanding the elite athletes’ different needs and further research about the combination of top level sport and academic studies are needed to increase knowledge about what kind of support is needed to be able to provide elite student-athletes the right support for <b>dual</b> <b>careers...</b>|$|R

The RSQ-JA therefore provides the first valid measure to assess the role strain associated with the <b>dual</b> <b>careers</b> of junior elite athletes...|$|R
