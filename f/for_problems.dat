5|$|The Mobile Arts Council is an {{umbrella}} {{organization for the}} arts in Mobile. It was founded in 1955 as a project of the Junior League of Mobile with the mission to increase cooperation among artistic and cultural organizations in the area and to provide a forum <b>for</b> <b>problems</b> in art, music, theater, and literature.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipeline}} is surveyed {{several times}} per day, mostly by air. Foot and road patrols also {{take place to}} check <b>for</b> <b>problems</b> such as leaks or pipe settling or shifting. The pipeline can be surveyed {{in as little as}} two hours, but most surveys take longer to ensure thoroughness. These external inspections are only part of standard maintenance, however. The majority of pipeline maintenance is done by pipeline pigs—mechanical devices sent through the pipeline to perform a variety of functions.|$|E

5|$|As {{referenced}} in {{the larger}} ACLU article, in 1929, the ACLU defended Margaret Sanger's right to educate the general public about forms of birth control. In 1980, the Project filed Poe v. Lynchburg Training School after 8,000 women had been sterilized without their authorization. In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment <b>for</b> <b>problems</b> caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v. Pierce, the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent Medicaid patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981-1990, the Project litigated Hodgson v. Minnesota, a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not {{to comply with a}} state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being attacked for educating about sexuality and AIDS. In 1995, the Project filed Curtis v. School Committee of Falmouth, the U.S.'s first condom availability program.|$|E
5|$|From its foundation, the Court of Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the Court of Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute of Wills, many people used feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting of assets, the process used by the Court of Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the Court of Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters, but their remedies <b>for</b> <b>problems</b> were far more limited.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 had {{a mostly}} {{positive}} reception, {{although it was}} criticized <b>for</b> <b>problems</b> with its controls. The game received some initial complaints of racism, but {{an investigation by the}} British Board of Film Classification found the complaints were unsubstantiated. Resident Evil 5 was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. As of June 2017 it has sold over 7.2 million units, making it Capcom's best-selling game and the best-selling game of the Resident Evil franchise. A special edition of the game, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition, has sold an additional 2.3 million units. A sequel, Resident Evil 6, was released in 2012.|$|E

50|$|Intuitively, problem A is {{reducible}} {{to problem}} B via an approximation-preserving reduction if, given {{an instance of}} problem A and a (possibly approximate) solver <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> B, one can convert the instance of problem A into an instance of problem B, apply the solver <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> B, and recover a solution <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> A that also has some guarantee of approximation.|$|R

5|$|The revised LC2s {{appeared}} {{once again}} at the 1000 km of Monza to start the 1984 season, with suspension redesigned {{to work with the}} Dunlop tyres. Lancia opened the season with a podium finish, followed by another pole position on the fast Silverstone Circuit for the 1000 km of Silverstone led to a fourth-place finish. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, both cars qualified on the front row {{in the absence of the}} Rothmans Porsche team, with Bob Wollek's pole time of 3:17.11 being some 11 seconds faster than the fastest Porsche 956's from Joest Racing who occupied the second row. Wollek and Nannini led at mid-race after battles with the Kremer Porsche of Vern Schuppan (the defending race winner) and Alan Jones, only <b>for</b> <b>problems</b> with the gearboxes on both cars to lose the team their lead. Wollek and Nannini at least proved the potential reliability of the LC2 by completing the full race distance and finishing in eighth position, with Nannini setting the races fastest lap of 3:28.90. The team also ran a private entry LC2 in the race for drivers Pierluigi Martini, Xavier Lapeyre and Beppe Gabbiani. This car crashed heavily in qualifying, with most observers believing it would require a new chassis to be repaired. As changing a chassis was prohibited by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, the car was repaired in time to qualify and race, though rumours persisted that Lancia had broken the rules and used a new chassis to replace the original.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{study was to examine the}} {{relation}} between culturally-derived values and beliefs and risk <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> gambling. In Study 1, 331 participants completed web-based versions of the Individualism-Collectivism Scale, Social Axioms Survey (SAS), the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MC-SDS). In Study 2, 90 participants completed these measures. Results were mixed with regard to the relation between Horizontal/Vertical Individualistic/Collectivistic values and risk <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> gambling as measured by the PGSI. However, it was found in both studies that risk <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> gambling was positively correlated with beliefs in Fate Control and Social Cynicism. Reward for Application, Religiosity and Social Complexity were not found to be related to risk <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> gambling. Stepwise regression of the Study 1 data indicated that the beliefs of Fate Control and Reward for Application were the only significant predictors of risk <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> gambling, explaining 22...|$|R

40|$|The demands–control–support model {{indicates}} that workers can use job control {{and social support}} <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> solving. We examined whether personal initiative moderated relationships between, on the one hand, job control used <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> solving and social support used <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> solving and, on the other hand, ideas generation and implementation. We operationalized job control used <b>for</b> <b>problem</b> solving as ‘changing aspects of work activities to solve problems’.
