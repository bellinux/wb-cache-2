Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in.

The Seattle Post-Intelligencers reviewer, Tyrone S. Reid, considered the song [...] "beautifully written, waxing poetic about love and longing – a forte that the singer employs with great results in his work." [...] In a similar review, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly felt that the debut studio album [...] "aptly applies Mars’ studio talents...in his own postmillennial way", calling [...] "Talking to the Moon" [...] "woebegone", adding that [...] "a malt-shop heart beats beneath [...] digital skin". Emily Yang of The Signal stated that Mars [...] "focuses on the slow pace of the drums and piano to convey his sorrow. He sings of loneliness which is almost palpable in the chorus." ...|$|E
