25|$|Eva {{insists on}} a glamorous image {{to impress the}} people of Argentina and promote Perónism. She prepares to tour in Europe as she is dressed for success by her fashion {{consultants}} ("Rainbow High"). The next song has Che representing leaders of the countries and even an Italian admiral. Her famous 1946 tour meets with a mixed reception ("Rainbow Tour"); Spaniards adore her, but the Italians liken her husband to Benito Mussolini. Even though the Italian people didn't like Evita, Argentina still had support from Italy. France is unimpressed because Eva started to <b>get</b> <b>tired,</b> but still had some mixed reviews. And the English snub her by inviting her to a country estate, rather than Buckingham Palace. Eva affirms her disdain for the upper class, while Che (pretending to be a random peasant) asks her to start helping those in need as she promised ("The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines (You'd Like to Hear)"). After returning to Argentina, she establishes the Eva Perón Foundation and distributes aid. Che describes Eva's controversial charitable work, and possible money laundering ("And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)").|$|E

500|$|The Celtics {{eventually}} {{added two}} talented forwards, future Hall-of-Famer Frank Ramsey and defensive specialist Jim Loscutoff. Along with Celtics colleague Bob Brannum, Loscutoff also became Cousy's unofficial bodyguard, retaliating against opposing players who {{would try to}} hurt him. The Celtics were unable to make their mark in the 1954 NBA Playoffs, 1955 NBA Playoffs, and 1956 NBA Playoffs, where they lost {{three times in a}} row against the Nationals. Cousy attributed the shortcomings to fatigue, stating: [...] "We would <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> in the end and could not get the ball". As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive center who could get easy rebounds, initiate fast breaks and close out games.|$|E

In September 1954, Hemingway wrote in a letter, [...] "At present I work at about 1/2 the capacity I should but everything is better all the time." [...] However, three months later in late December he wrote in a letter: [...] "This has been sort of a rough year.... We call this 'black-ass' and one should never have it.

500|$|In the {{following}} 1951–52 NBA season, Auerbach made a remarkable draft pick of future Hall-of-Fame guard Bill Sharman. With the high-scoring Macauley, elite passer Cousy, and new prodigy Sharman, Auerbach had a core that provided high-octane fast-break basketball. Other notable players {{who joined the}} Celtics were forwards Frank Ramsey and Jim Loscutoff. In the next years until 1956, the Celtics would make the playoffs every year, but never won the title. In fact, the Celtics often choked in the playoffs, going a mere 10–17 in the postseason from 1951 through 1956. As Cousy put it: [...] "We would <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> in the end and could not get the ball." [...] As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive big man who could both get easy rebounds, initiate fast breaks, and close out games.|$|E

On the other hand, Sterling Whitaker of The Boot put [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] at number six on his list of Top 10 Jason Aldean Songs. Laura McClellan of Taste of Country ranked the song at number three of Aldean's Top 10 songs, citing it as [...] "the biggest reason the industry is beginning to recognize Aldean with award nominations." [...] Chuck Dauphin of Billboard ranked the song atop his list of Jason Aldean's 10 Best Songs and described it as [...] "a ballad that one doesn’t <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> of hearing – and that’s not something you see everyday." [...] He also put the song at number 25 in his list of Top 50 Country Love Songs of All Time.|$|E
500|$|The Way I See It has a {{traditional}} soul style fashioned after the 1960s Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul. It is {{a departure from}} Saadiq's previous work with neo soul, which bears a hip hop influence. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer said that Saadiq expands further beyond {{his work as a}} producer for other recording artists, for whom he encouraged a [...] "classic aesthetic, heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic, deeply indebted to the past and distrustful of easy formulas". BBC Music's Chris Jones interpreted Saadiq's use of 1960s soul as the album's source material to be a reflection of [...] "America's most recent great political and cultural shift ... the first true post-Obama expression of hope in record form." [...] Saadiq viewed his rootsy direction {{as a response to the}} state of popular music and found it analogous to modern politics: [...] "You force so many terrible things on people, they <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> of it.

Male called it [...] "technically stunning", but also [...] "dreadfully acted, tediously 'profound' and painfully overlong", and accused the {{director}} of misogyny. The Village Voices Karina Longworth had several reservations about the film. She thought that the characters lacked emotional depth and called the story [...] "a lame fusion of stoner lifestyle, sexual fetish, and philosophical inquiry", but still ended the review: [...] "I could stare at this movie for days and not <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> of the sensation. A mash-up of the sacred, the profane, and the brain-dead, Enter the Void is addictive." [...] Jen Chaney of The Washington Post thought that the film was successful as an [...] "attempt to transport moviegoers to a hallucinatory version of the hereafter unlike anything they've ever witnessed on film", but added: [...] "The problem is that it's also the most excruciating sit in recent cinematic memory.

500|$|Jeff Gerstmann, {{co-founder of}} Giant Bomb, felt that while Forza Motorsport 4 was a [...] "fantastic driving game" [...] it merely {{felt like an}} {{incremental}} improvement on its predecessor. [...] "I found myself getting a very 'annual sports game update' vibe off of it," [...] stated Gerstmann. Justin Calvert of GameSpot agreed; he said that Forza Motorsport 4 refines upon its predecessor, [...] "but also feels {{just a little too}} familiar". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile also felt that Forza Motorsport 4 an improvement over Forza Motorsport 3, [...] "making it the absolute king of the road." [...] He cited the game's audio and visuals, the number of cars and tracks, the online play and variable skill level all as high points. However, D'Aprile felt that the Kinect implementation was [...] "a gimmick" [...] and expressed disappointment that there was not more content involving Top Gear. Matthew Kato, reviewer for Game Informer, was unimpressed by Forzas Kinect integration as well.

While this story had the potential to be 'special material,' it just didn't materialize in the final produced product." [...] Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said, [...] "It makes me sad to think about how something so pleasurable has declined into something so tedious." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "With a laugh-skimpy script, 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' may be confirming a trend I noticed back with the last original SpongeBob toon to get its own disc release, Pest of the West: SpongeBob shorts are starting to <b>get</b> <b>tired.</b> And 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' is even less funny than 'Pest of the West'," [...] adding the episode was [...] "Not a good sign." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{squadron}} armourers {{and mechanics}} repaired the faulty machine-gun synchroniser on {{his most recent}} S.E.5 mount, A8898, Ball had been sporadically flying the Nieuport again, and was successful with it on 6 May, destroying one more Albatros D.III in an evening flight to raise his tally to 44. He had continued to undertake his habitual lone patrols, but had of late been fortunate to survive. The heavier battle damage that Ball's aircraft were now suffering bore witness to the improved team tactics being developed by his German opponents. Some time on 6 May, Ball had visited his friend Billy Bishop at the latter's aerodrome. He proposed that the pair attack the Red Baron's squadron at its airfield at dawn, catching the German pilots off guard. Bishop agreed {{to take part in}} the daring scheme at the end of the month, after he returned from his forthcoming leave. That night, in his last letter to his father, Ball wrote [...] "I do <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> of always living to kill, and am really beginning to feel like a murderer. Shall be so pleased when I have finished".|$|E
500|$|In 1962 he {{appeared}} in Wendy Toye's comedy film We Joined the Navy before teaming up again with Peter Sellers in Only Two Can Play, Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure [...] "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—Waltz of the Toreadors—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy The Wrong Arm of the Law. Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that [...] "I thought I knew by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that I could ever <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> of any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year {{he appeared}} in a third Sellers film, The Pink Panther, as a defence lawyer, {{and in the second}} Tony Hancock vehicle, The Punch and Judy Man. Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role [...] "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.|$|E
500|$|By July, {{the team}} had begun initial {{construction}} of the game's levels. Thief IIs increased focus on stealth necessitated new level design concepts: the most stealth-based missions in Thief had centered on urban burglary, but Pearsall explained that this [...] "would <b>get</b> <b>tired</b> pretty fast" [...] if repeated in every level. The team diversified Thief II by designing missions with such objectives as kidnapping, blackmail and eavesdropping. The first two levels were designed to seamlessly introduce new players to the core game mechanics, without a tutorial mission that might lose the interest of experienced players. When creating a mission, the team would often begin by deciding on the player's objective, after which they would produce a rough level design. The mission would then undergo a peer review to determine if it should {{be added to the}} game. Each of the game's levels was a team effort rather than the work of a single designer. Designer Randy Smith explained that, while Thiefs levels had been designed to fit a pre-existing story, the Thief II team [...] "tried to think of really good missions first" [...] and then adjusted the plot to suit them. He noted that it was highly difficult to harmonize the two.|$|E
