Hyperspectral sensors operating in the long-wave infrared regime have well-demonstrated detection capabilities.

The <b>detector</b> <b>banks</b> are trained to detect a total of 9, 918 sentiment-biased visual concepts from six major languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, German and Chinese. In the original MVSO release, adjective-noun pair (ANP) detectors were trained for the six languages using an AlexNet-styled architecture by fine-tuning from DeepSentiBank. Here, through a more extensive set of experiments, parameter tuning, and training runs, we detail and release higher accuracy models for detecting ANPs across six languages from the same image pool and setting as in the original release using a more modern architecture, GoogLeNet, providing comparable or better performance with reduced network parameter cost. In addition, since the image pool in MVSO can be corrupted by user noise from social interactions, we partitioned out a sub-corpus of MVSO images based on tag-restricted queries for higher fidelity labels. We show {{that as a result}} of these higher fidelity labels, higher performing AlexNet-styled ANP detectors can be trained using the tag-restricted image subset as compared to the models in full corpus.

30|$|Obtaining {{satisfactory}} arterial enhancement {{is crucial}} {{in the assessment of}} intravascular pathology. One of the important scan parameters that can influence arterial enhancement is scan acquisition time. A short acquisition time is preferable once the scan begins (in most situations) to ensure uniform arterial opacification on the acquired images. For helical scans, the acquisition time is equal to the gantry rotation time multiplied by the number of gantry rotations required to cover the anatomical area. The number of gantry rotations is determined by the scan range divided by the product of the <b>detector</b> <b>bank</b> width and the pitch. Axial scanning acquires multiple volumes, and is used in particular when performing ECG-gated studies such as coronary and aortic CTA, to help reduce radiation dose [4]. For axial acquisitions of volumes smaller than the width of detectors, the scan time is equal to the gantry rotation time. When axial scanning is used for volumes larger than the detector width, the total scan time is equal to the total number of volumes required to cover the desired anatomical area multiplied by the gantry rotation time, added to the sum of the interscan time intervals required for table repositioning.|$|R

At the same time, the transmitted portion of the neutron beam was recorded with the goal to analyze the position and shape of the Bragg edges, using a novel time energy resolved Microchannel Plate MCP detector with pixel size of 55 Dm and a 28 x 28 mm 2 field of view. Lattice strains obtained using neutron diffraction indicate that the deformation path tension versus torsion has important effect on their evolution and related results are summarized. The emphasis {{of this paper is to}} explain the aspects of the experimental setup and data interpretation associated with neutron Bragg edge transmission technique for obtaining throughthickness averaged strain measurements. Implications of using transmission imaging based strain mapping for samples subjected to deformation under tensile loading where stress at a given cross section is constant versus torsional loading where stress varies linearly from center to outer radius are discussed. In the case of samples subjected to tensile loading, analysis of the Bragg edge shifts provides the strain value in the direction of the transmitted beam. Thus, three strain components are measured simultaneously when performing Bragg edge imaging in addition to diffraction using two <b>detector</b> <b>banks.</b> For specimens subjected to pure shear by torsion, the Bragg edge transmission technique cannot readily provide quantitative strain information as the mid point of the Bragg edge does not shift uniformly due to external loading, but results in a broadening of the Bragg edge. Such information can be used to describe the variation of strain distribution along the transmitted beam direction. Spatially resolved Bragg edge maps will be very helpful to detect d spacing inhomogeneities within the illuminated volume, which may remain undetected when using diffraction only measurement...|$|E

40|$|Drums {{of uranium}} waste should be {{disposed}} of in an economical and environmentally sound manner. The most accurate possible assays of the uranium masses in the drums are required for proper disposal. The accuracies of assays from a shuffler {{are affected by the}} type of matrix material in the drums. Non-hydrogenous matrices have little effect on neutron transport and accuracies are very good. If self-shielding is known to be a minor problem, good accuracies are also obtained with hydrogenous matrices when a polyethylene sleeve is placed around the drums. But for those cases where self-shielding may be a problem, matrices are hydrogenous, and uranium distributions are non-uniform throughout the drums, the accuracies are degraded. They can be greatly improved by determining the distributions of the uranium and then applying correction factors based on the distributions. This paper describes a technique for determining uranium distributions by using the neutron count rates in <b>detector</b> <b>banks</b> around the waste drum and solving a set of overdetermined linear equations. Other approaches were studied to determine the distributions and are described briefly. Implementation of this correction is anticipated on an existing shuffler next year...|$|E

Here, we report {{on the state of the}} RD which is based on a YAP scintillator viewing a natural uranium analyser foil. The response of the YAP detector to the radiative capture g emission from the uranium analyser foil has been characterized with a biparametric measurement of a reference Pb sample, which allowed simultaneous measurements of both neutron time-offlight and gamma pulse height (energy) spectra. The analysis of the gamma pulse height and neutron time-of-flight spectra permitted to identify the signal and background components.

40|$|International audienceTime-of-flight neutron {{diffraction}} methods {{are widely used}} to study the structure of liquids and glasses. The scattering nuclei in these experiments suffer nuclear recoil {{in the course of}} the neutron scattering process, which gives rise to distortions to both the self and distinct structure factors extracted from the data. These distortions are in general difficult to evaluate quantitatively, especially when the mass of the nucleus is similar to that of the neutron, such as when hydrogen is present in the material being studied. Here a model for the scattering kernal is developed based on the well known harmonic oscillator model (A C Zemach and R J Glauber, Phys. Rev. 101, 118 (1956)). This is shown to have the correct first and second moments of the scattering kernal for both the self and distinct scattering, and is used to estimate the self and distinct scattering from a diatomic "dumbell" molecule. The model gives a realistic account of the single atom scattering from light and heavy water over a wide range of incident neutron energies, but is not yet accurate enough to perform quantitative corrections.

40|$|New {{perspectives}} for {{epithermal neutron}} spectroscopy are opened {{by the development}} of new detectors for inverse Geometry time of flight spectrometers at pulsed neutron sources. One example is the Very Low Angle <b>Detector</b> (VLAD) <b>bank</b> planned to be delivered, within the next 4 years, within the eVERDI project, on the neutron spectrometer VESUVIO. at the ISIS pulsed neutron source (UK). VLAD will extend the (q,omega) kinematical region for neutron scattering to low wavefactor transfer (q 1 eV, thus allowing the investigations of new experimental studies in condensed matter systems. The technique being developed for detection of epithermal neutrons, within this low q and high-energy transfer region, is the Resonance Detection Technique. In this work, the state of the detector development will be presented with special focus on the results obtained with some prototype detectors. namely YAP scintillators and cadmium-zinc-telluride semiconductors.
