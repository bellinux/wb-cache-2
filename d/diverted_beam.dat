Almost always, an ejection kicker is used to eject the entire particle train, emptying the synchrotron. This means that it has the entire tail-to-head gap in the synchrotron to function, and the switch-off time is essentially irrelevant. However, it must hold a stable field for longer (one full rotation of the synchrotron), and must generate a stronger magnetic field, as {{it is used to}} eject a higher energy beam that has been accelerated in the synchrotron.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Foucaults {{determination}} of the relative speed of light in air vs water. Light from a passing through a slit (not shown) is reflected by mirror m (rotating clockwise around c) towards the concave spherical mirrors M and M. Lens L forms images of the slit on the surfaces of the two concave mirrors. The light path from m to M is entirely through air, while the light path from m to M is mostly through a water-filled tube T. Lens L compensates {{for the effects of}} the water on the focus. The light reflected back from the spherical mirrors is <b>diverted</b> by <b>beam</b> splitter g towards an eyepiece O. If mirror m is stationary, both images of the slit reflected by M and M reform at position α. If mirror m is rapidly rotating, light reflected from M forms an image of the slit at α while light reflected from M forms an image of the slit at α".|$|R

40|$|Laser {{illumination}} {{used in both}} conventional widefield epi-fluorescence as well as {{in total}} internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy is subject to nonuniformities in intensity that obscure true image details. These intensity variations are interference fringes arising from coherent light scattering and diffraction at every surface in the laser light's optical path, including the lenses, mirrors, and coverslip. We present an inexpensive technique for effectively eliminating these interference fringes based upon introduction of the excitation laser beam by oblique through-the-objective incidence coupled with rapid azimuthal rotation of the plane of incidence. Although this rotation can be accomplished in several ways, a particularly simple method applicable to a free laser beam is to use an optical wedge, spun on a motor, which <b>diverts</b> the <b>beam</b> into a hollow cone of fixed angle. A system of lenses converts this collimated beam cone into a focused spot that traces a circle at the objective's back focal plane. Consequently, a collimated beam with fixed polar angle and spinning azimuthal angle illuminates the sample. If the wedge is spun rapidly, then the different interference patterns at every particular azimuthal incidence angle average out over a single camera exposure to produce an effectively uniform field of illumination.

40|$|A laser {{drilling}} research team was formed {{from members of}} academia, industry and national laboratory to explore the feasibility of using modern high-powered lasers to drill and complete oil and gas wells. The one-year Phase 1 study discussed in this report had the goals of quantifying the amount of pulsed infrared laser energy needed to spall and melt rock of varying lithologies and to investigate the possibility of accomplishing the same task in water under atmospheric conditions. Previous work by some members of this team determined that continuous wave lasers of varying wavelengths have more than enough power to cut, melt and vaporize rock. Samples of sandstone, limestone, and shale were prepared for laser beam interaction with a 1. 6 kW pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam {{to determine how the}} beam's size, power, repetition rate, pulse width, exposure time and energy can affect the amount of energy transferred to the rock for the purposes of spallation, melting and vaporization. The purpose of the laser rock interaction experiment was to determine the threshold parameters required to remove a maximum rock volume from the samples while minimizing energy input. Absorption of radiant energy from the laser beam gives rise to the thermal energy transfer required for the destruction and removal of the rock matrix. Results from the tests indicate that each rock type has a set of optimal laser parameters to minimize specific energy (SE) values as observed in a set of linear track and spot tests. In addition, it was observed that the rates of heat diffusion in rocks are easily and quickly overrun by absorbed energy transfer rates from the laser beam to the rock. As absorbed energy outpaces heat diffusion by the rock matrix, local temperatures can rise to the melting points of the minerals and quickly increase observed SE values. The lowest SE values are obtained in the spalling zone just prior to the onset of mineral melt. The current study determined that using pulsed lasers could accomplish removing material from rock more efficiently than continuous wave lasers. The study also determined that reducing the effect of secondary energy absorbing mechanisms resulted in lower energy requirements in shale and, to some extent, in sandstones. These secondary mechanisms are defined as physical processes that <b>divert</b> <b>beam</b> energy from directly removing rock, and may include thermally-induced phase behavior changes of rock minerals (i. e., melting, vaporization, and dissociation) and fractures created by thermal expansion. Limestone is spalled by a different mechanism and {{does not seem to be}} as affected by secondary mechanisms. It was also shown that the efficiency of the cutting mechanism improved by saturating porous rock samples with water, and that a laser beam injected directly through a water layer at a sandstone sample was able to spall and melt the sample...|$|R
40|$|X-ray free-electron lasers {{are unique}} sources of high-brightness {{coherent}} radiation. However, existing devices supply only linearly polarized light, precluding studies of chiral dynamics.

40|$|Abstract: An electrothermally {{actuated}} planar micromotor {{has been}} developed for multi degree-of-freedom (DoF) motion, including rolling along the vertical or horizontal axes, spinning about the z-axis, and also the out-of-plane piston motion. In this design, a light-weight spherical solder ball rotor with plastic core is supported by electrothermal actuator array (EAA). Each bimorph actuator consists of the silicon and aluminum layers to produce large vertical deflection due to their distinct coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). The micromotor fabrication procedures involve standard CMOS-MEMS processes. Rolling and spinning motions of the spherical rotor are performed by driving the electrothermal actuators with multi-phase signals, and the piston motion {{can be achieved by}} synchronizing the drive signals to all actuators without phase difference. The dynamic behavior of this micromotor has been successfully predicted by multibody dynamics simulation software. Such unique dynamic motions of this planar micromotor device show promising capabilities in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Optical Coherence Microscope (OCM) applications. If this sphere is mounted with a highly-reflective mirror platform, {{it can be used to}} <b>divert</b> the light <b>beam</b> to achieve a full 360 ° circumferential scan about the optical axis. 1...|$|R
40|$|To {{augment the}} {{monitoring}} capabilities of a Balzers 760 coating chamber, we replaced the simple, single wavelength optical monitor with a wide-band scanning monochromator system which records transmission data over the visible {{region of the}} spectrum. The system is controlled by an IBM-PC. The same computer is also interfaced to a quartz crystal monitoring system which was purchased with the Balzers chamber. The scanning monochromator system required a new brighter light source to deliver sufficient signal to the detector array through the more complex, dispersive optical train. Above the chamber the filter and the photomultiplier pair were removed, and replaced by a flat mirror which <b>diverts</b> the <b>beam</b> horizontally into the scanning monochromator system. The beam passes first through a telescope-slit configuration onto a Jobin-Yvon holographic grating, built to disperse the 400 - 800 nm band of which we use approximately 360 nm. This reflective grating images the spectrum of the slit onto a Fairchild CCD array, which consists of 1728 elements. These elements are then averaged into 173 data points and recorded by the IBM-PC. The 173 data points allows us a wavelength resolution of about 2 nm. The IBM incorporates a Tecmar A/D board in accepting data from both the quartz crystal monitor and the scanning monochromator system. Although the system is capable of recording data at a faster rate, it is generally stored once every three seconds. This is adequate since at normal deposition rates this gives us information every 10 - 20 Angstroms of deposited material. The system {{has been used in}} several applications which will be discussed in this dissertation. They include in situ measurements of water adsorption into a film, derivation of optical constant profiles during the film deposition, both of which may lead us {{to a better understanding of}} the growth of a thin film. The monochromator has also been used to analyze the components of a multilayer coating by monitoring the film's transmission spectra while it was sputter-etched off. The extension of the system into the ultraviolet region of the spectrum and some future applications are also considered...|$|R
