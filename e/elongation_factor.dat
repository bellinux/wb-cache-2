40|$|The {{synthesis}} of proteins in eukaryotes is typically {{divided into four}} steps, i. e. initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. This key biological event is tightly regulated by the cell. Under condition of increased demand or reduced production of cellular energy the cell can downregulate this process. While a tight regulation exists for the rate limiting initiation step, elongation {{also appears to be}} under a somewhat strict control. Among key targets of elongation regulation are the eukaryotic <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> A 1 /A 2 (eEF 1 A 1 /A 2) and the eukaryotic elongation factor- 2 (eEF 2). In addition of being involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, evidences indicate that these factors play a relevant role in the genesis and maintenance of many forms of human cancers. For this reason, <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> have been considered as valuable markers for different forms of cancers as well as attracting candidates for targeted anti-cancer therapeutic approaches. In this chapter we focus on the description of the factors taking part in the process of elongation, as well as their involvement in cancer. Particular emphasis is put on the description of 1) the physiological role of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> in <b>elongation</b> and in other biological processes; 2) the control of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> by signaling pathways; 3) the involvement of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> in cancer and 4) the anti-cancer therapeutic approaches based on the targeting of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R

Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics.

This phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed in its current form since the Cretaceous era (roughly 145 to 66 million years ago), and all known morel species evolved from a similar ancestor. M.rufobrunnea is genetically closer to the yellow morels than the black morels. M.anatolica, described from Turkey in 2012, is a closely related sister species.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{proteins}} recruited to polymerase are <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation. There are different classes of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors.</b> Some factors {{can increase the}} overall rate of transcribing, some can help the polymerase through transient pausing sites, and some can assist the polymerase to transcribe through chromatin. One of the <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> P-TEFb, is particularly important. P-TEFb phosphorylates the second residue (Ser-2) of the CTD repeats (YSPTSPS) of the bound Pol II. P-TEFb also phosphorylates and activates SPT5 and TAT-SF1. SPT5 is a universal transcription factor that helps recruit 5'-capping enzyme to Pol II with a CTD phosphorylated at Ser-5. TAF-SF1 recruits components of the RNA splicing machinery to the Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD. P-TEFb also helps suppress transient pausing of polymerase when it encounters certain sequences immediately following initiation.|$|R
25|$|The {{positive}} transcription <b>elongation</b> <b>factor,</b> P-TEFb, {{plays an}} essential role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in eukaryotes. Immediately following initiation Pol II becomes trapped in promoter proximal paused positions on the majority of human genes (Figure 1). P-TEFb is a cyclin dependent kinase that can phosphorylate the DRB sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and negative <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> (NELF), as well as the carboxyl terminal domain of the large subunit of Pol II and this causes the transition into productive elongation leading to the synthesis of mRNAs. P-TEFb is regulated in part by a reversible association with the 7SK snRNP. Treatment of cells with the P-TEFb inhibitors DRB or flavopidirol leads to loss of mRNA production and ultimately cell death.|$|E
25|$|Fragment A {{inhibits}} {{the synthesis}} of new proteins in the affected cell by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> EF-2—a protein that {{is essential to the}} translation step of protein synthesis. This ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of an ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a diphthamide (a modified histidine) residue within the EF-2 protein. Since EF-2 is needed for the moving of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome during protein translation, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 prevents protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|PIKKs {{have four}} domains at the protein level, which {{distinguish}} them from other protein kinases. From the N-terminus to the C-terminus, these domains are named FRAP-ATM-TRAAP (FAT), the kinase domain (KD), the PIKK-regulatory domain (PRD), and the FAT-C-terminal (FATC). The FAT domain, consisting of four α-helices, is N-terminal to KD, but that part {{is referred to}} as the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain, which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The FAT domain consists of repeats, referred to as HEAT (Huntingtin, <b>Elongation</b> <b>factor</b> 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and TOR1). Specific protein activators regulate the PIKK kinases but binding of them to the kinase complex causes a conformational change that increases substrate access to the kinase domain.|$|E

Alternatively, apoptotic cells may secrete antigens, including eEF1A and other <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> to induce an autoimmune response during cancer. It is postulated that high expression and secretion of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> from tumor tissues, combined with altered levels of eEF1A-derived bacterial peptides in neoplastic disease, may lead to autoimmunity in breast cancer.|$|R
25|$|Transcription {{fidelity}} {{is achieved}} through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding {{base in the}} DNA is admitted to the active center. RNA polymerase performs two known proof reading functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing. The former removes the incorrectly inserted ribonucleotide by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. <b>Elongation</b> <b>factor</b> TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation. Note that all reactions (phosphodiester bond synthesis, pyrophosphorolysis, phosphodiester bond hydrolysis) are performed by RNA polymerase by using a single active center.|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{elongation}} is not {{a smooth}} ride along the DNA railway. For proofreading, the polymerase is made to back-up, erase some of the RNA it has already made and have another go at transcription. In general, RNA polymerase does not transcribe through a gene at a constant pace. Rather it pauses periodically at certain sequences, sometimes {{for long periods of}} time before resuming transcription. In extreme cases, for example, when the polymerase encounters a damaged nucleotide, it comes to a complete halt. More often, an elongating polymerase is stalled near the promoter. Promoter-proximal pausing during early elongation is a commonly used mechanism for regulating genes poised to be expressed rapidly or in a coordinated fashion. Pausing is mediated by a complex called NELF (negative <b>elongation</b> <b>factor)</b> in collaboration with DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor containing SPT4/SPT5). The blockage is released once the polymerase receives an activation signal, such as the phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD tail by P-TEFb. Other elongation factors such as ELL and TFIIS stimulate the rate of elongation by limiting the length of time that polymerase pauses.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} reports which {{demonstrate}} {{that the rate of}} protein biosynthesis at the elongation stage is actively regulated in eukaryotic cells. Possible physiological roles for this type of regulation are: the coordination of translation of mRNA with different initiation rate constants; regulation of transition between different physiological states of a cell, such as transition between stages or the cell cycle; and in general, any situation where the maintenance of a particular physiological state is dependent on continuous protein synthesis. A number of covalent modifications of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> offer potential mechanisms for such regulation. Among the various modifications of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> phosphorylation of eEF- 2 by the specific Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent eEF- 2 kinase is the best studied and perhaps the most important mechanism for regulation of elongation rate. Since this phosphorylation is strictly Ca 2 +-dependent, and makes eEF- 2 inactive in translation, this mechanism could explain how changes in the intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration may regulate elongation rate. We also discuss some recent findings concerning <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> such as the discovery of developmental stage-specific <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> and the regulated binding of eEF- 1 α to cytoskeletal elements. Together, these observations underline the importance of the elongation stage of translation in the regulation of the cellular processes essential for normal cell life...|$|R
