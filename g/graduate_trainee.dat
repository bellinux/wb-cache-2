40|$|BackgroundThe Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) {{was invited}} to {{collaborate}} with the National Referral Hospital (NRH), Solomon Islands, to establish an acute care pediatric education program for the country’s inaugural class of national medical <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees.</b> ObjectiveTo develop and evaluate a sustainable, need-based post-graduate training curriculum in pediatric acute care, resuscitation, and point-of-care ultrasound. MethodsA need-based training curriculum was developed utilizing the ADDIE model and was implemented and revised {{over the course of}} 2 [*]years and two site visits. Implementation followed a train-the-trainer model. The curriculum consisted of high-yield didactics including workshops, simulations, hands-on ultrasound sessions, and lectures at the NRH. A mixed-methods design was used to evaluate the curriculum, including pre/posttesting, qualitative group discussions, and individual surveys. The curriculum was revised in response to ongoing learner evaluations and needs assessments. Continuing educational sessions after the site visit demonstrated sustainability. ResultsThe curriculum included 19 core topics with 42 teaching sessions during the two site visits. A total of 135 pre/posttests and 366 individual surveys were collected from 46 trainees. Completion rates were 78. 2 % for surveys and 71. 3 % for pre/posttests. Pre/posttest scores increased from 44 to 63 % during the first site visit and 69. 6 to 77. 6 % during the second. Learners reported a mean 4. 81 / 5 on a standard Likert scale for curriculum satisfaction. Group discussions and surveys highlighted key areas of knowledge growth, important clinical care advances, and identified further needs. Initial sustainability was demonstrated by continued ultrasound sessions led by local <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees.</b> ConclusionA collaborative team including Johns Hopkins PED staff, Solomon Islands’ <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees,</b> and NRH administration initiated a professional education curriculum for the first class of Solomon Islands’ medical graduates. Knowledge growth and positive impacts of the program were reflected in learner survey and test scores. <b>Graduate</b> <b>trainees</b> were identified as local champions to continue as course instructors. This innovative curriculum was developed, revised, and initially sustained on site.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a process model in order to meet {{outcomes}} of graduate training programmes, with specific relevance to Volkswagen of South Africa. To do this, VWSA’s Graduate Training Programme was assessed in terms of the approach currently used by VWSA to recruit, select and train <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees.</b> A literature study was conducted to reveal strategies for effectively training new recruits and the development of leadership competencies. Based on this study a model was developed to facilitate the graduate training programme process to achieve programme objectives. The study aimed at making a contribution to graduate training programmes by identifying key leadership competencies, as well as the training interventions which lead to the development of these competencies. It was found that the technical skills that the trainees acquire at their tertiary educational institutions are not sufficient in today’s workplace, thereby necessitating closer working relationships between these institutions and businesses so that needs can be shared, as well as more comprehensive training programmes being provided. The research methodology comprised the following steps: An analysis was made of VWSA’s current processes regarding recruitment, selection and training of their <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees.</b> iv An assessment of leadership competencies in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes that contribute to successful performance was undertaken. Training interventions as a process was studied. An analysis was made as to what extent the existing training interventions for VWSA’s graduate programme achieve the desired programme outcomes by means of a research questionnaire circulated to mentors/coaches and <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees</b> within the organisation. A model was developed to serve as a holistic framework for the recruitment, selection and training of <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees</b> for all motor and related industries undertaking graduate training programmes. The above was achieved through a practical study and a literature study, making use of questionnaires, as well as relevant published, unpublished and electronic texts and studies.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify factors affecting the approaches to studying among Sri Lankan medical undergraduates and post <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees</b> and to analyze the change in the pattern of study skills with time and experience. Method Pre-clinical and clinical students of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo and postgraduate trainees in Surgery at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka were invited to complete the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) questionnaire. Results A total of 187 pre clinical (M: F = 96 : 91), 124 clinical (M: F = 61 : 63) and 53 post <b>graduate</b> <b>trainees</b> (M: F = 50 : 3) participated in the study. Approaches of male and female students were similar. SA was significantly affected by age among the preclinical students (p = 0. 01), but not in other groups.
