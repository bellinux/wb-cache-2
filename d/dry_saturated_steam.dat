5000|$|The steam can {{therefore}} cool (lose internal energy) by some amount, {{resulting in a}} lowering of its temperature without changing state (i.e., condensing) from a gas, to a mixture of saturated vapor and liquid. If saturated steam (a mixture of both gas and saturated vapor) is heated at constant pressure, its temperature will also remain constant as the vapor quality (think dryness, or percent saturated vapor) increases towards 100%, and becomes dry (i.e., no saturated liquid) saturated steam. Continued heat input will then [...] "super" [...] heat the <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>steam.</b> This will occur if saturated steam contacts a surface with a higher temperature.|$|E
50|$|Superheaters, {{which are}} {{generally}} {{placed in the}} radiant zone of the furnace, are used for increasing the temperature of <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> coming out from boiler drum and to maintain the required parameters before sending it to the steam turbine. The thermal efficiency of a thermal power plant depends {{on the performance of}} the superheater. The CFD analysis of superheaters is done at design stage and later at the troubleshooting and performance evaluation during the operation of the plant. The CFD results obtained can be useful for the maintenance engineer to make suitable predictions of the tube life and make suitable arrangements for the high temperature zone to reduce the erosion of the tube coil and restricting the tube leakage problem. CFD analysis consists of modelling the superheater and doing analysis to study the velocity, pressure and temperature distribution of the steam inside the superheater. The uneven temperature distribution of steam in the tube leads to boiler tube leakage. CFD also helps to study the effect of the operating parameters on the tube erosion rate. Thermal power plants operates round the year and it is not always possible to shut down and analyse the problem. CFD helps in this.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{operates}} on {{basic principles of}} thermodynamics using the part 3-4 of the Rankine cycle shown in the adjoining diagram. Superheated steam (or <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>steam,</b> depending on application) leaves the boiler at high temperature and high pressure. At entry to the turbine, the steam gains kinetic energy by passing through a nozzle (a fixed nozzle in an impulse type turbine or the fixed blades in a reaction type turbine). When the steam leaves the nozzle it is moving at high velocity towards the blades of the turbine rotor. A force is created on the blades due to {{the pressure of the}} vapor on the blades causing them to move. A generator or other such device can be placed on the shaft, and the energy that was in the steam can now be stored and used. The steam leaves the turbine as a saturated vapor (or liquid-vapor mix depending on application) at a lower temperature and pressure than it entered with and is sent to the condenser to be cooled. The first law enables us to find a formula for the rate at which work is developed per unit mass. Assuming there is no heat transfer to the surrounding environment and that the changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible compared to the change in specific enthalpy we arrive at the following equation ...|$|E
50|$|Superheated {{steam and}} liquid water cannot coexist under {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium, as any additional heat simply evaporates more {{water and the}} <b>steam</b> will become <b>saturated</b> <b>steam.</b> However this restriction may be violated temporarily in dynamic (non-equilibrium) situations. To produce superheated steam in a power plant or for processes (such as <b>drying</b> paper) the <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> drawn from a boiler is passed through a separate heating device (a superheater) which transfers additional heat to the steam by contact or by radiation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>steam</b> is <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> {{that has}} been very {{slightly}} superheated. This {{is not sufficient to}} change its energy appreciably, but is a sufficient rise in temperature to avoid condensation problems, given the average loss in temperature across the steam supply circuit. Towards the end of the 19th century, when superheating was still a less-than-certain technology, such steam-drying gave the condensation-avoiding benefits of superheating without requiring the sophisticated boiler or lubrication techniques of full superheating.|$|R
50|$|During normal operation, rotor {{imbalance}} {{can lead}} to vibration, which, {{because of the high}} rotation velocities, could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing. To reduce this risk, considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine. Also, turbines are run with high-quality steam: either superheated (<b>dry)</b> <b>steam,</b> or <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> with a high dryness fraction. This prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades (moisture carry over). Also, liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft. To prevent this, along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high-quality steam, condensate drains are installed in the steam piping leading to the turbine.|$|R
5000|$|The Clayton forced-circulation steam {{generator}} {{does not have}} a steam drum in the typical sense. A series of small tubes that are part of one giant coil, usually made of steel, have feed water pumped through at great speed. The water is pumped {{from the top of the}} {{steam generator}} down to the bottom and out. The tubes that are arranged in such a way that the combustion gasses pass around the tube subsequently heating the water. Essentially, the arrangement can be best described as having a large thin walled coil of pipe wrapping around the circumference of a vertical steel drum looping around and down until it reaches the bottom. As only some of the water may become steam, it is important to separate the two and send any water back through to absorb more heat. If this separation does not occur, the damage to the system could be costly. If steam goes through the generation tubes inside, the tubes may overheat and become weak, and if water is allowed down into the steam system, corrosion, water hammer, or other ill effects may occur. To combat this, after exiting the steam generator, the mixture is put through a centrifugal steam separator which does exactly that producing steam that is above ninety-nine percent <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>steam.</b> If superheated steam is desired, an additional coil is run back through the steam generator. To maintain a constant level of water in the steam separator, the feed pump in conjunction with a leveling system is utilized. A great advantage to this system is that steam can be generated very quickly. However, the downside to this system is the complete dependence on a constant supply of feed water. Without the constant supply, the system may be subject to a massive and expensive damage ...|$|E
5000|$|Blowing {{pressure}} - Frequency {{increases with}} blowing pressure, which determines gas volume {{flow through the}} whistle, allowing a locomotive engineer to play a whistle like a musical instrument, using the valve to vary the flow of steam. The term for this was “quilling.” An experiment with a short plain whistle reported in 1883 showed that incrementally increasing steam pressure drove the whistle from E to D-flat, a 68 percent increase in frequency. Pitch deviations from the whistle natural frequency likely follow velocity differences in the steam jet downstream from the aperture, creating phase differences between driving frequency and natural frequency of the whistle. Although at normal blowing pressures the aperture constrains the jet to the speed of sound, once it exits the aperture and expands, velocity decay {{is a function of}} absolute pressure. Also, frequency may vary at a fixed blowing pressure with differences in temperature of steam or compressed air. Industrial steam whistles typically were operated in the range of 100 to 300 pounds per square inch gauge pressure (psig) (0.7 - 2.1 megapascals, MPa), although some were constructed for use on pressures as high as 600 psig (4.1 MPa). All of these pressures are within the choked flow regime, where mass flow scales with upstream absolute pressure and inversely with the square root of absolute temperature. This means that for <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>steam,</b> a halving of absolute pressure results in almost a halving of flow. This has been confirmed by tests of whistle steam consumption at various pressures. Excessive pressure for a given whistle design will drive the whistle into an overblown mode, where the fundamental frequency will be replaced by an odd harmonic, that is a frequency that is an odd number multiple of the fundamental. Usually this is the third harmonic (second overtone frequency), but an example has been noted where a large whistle jumped to the fifteenth harmonic. A long narrow whistle such as that of the Liberty ship John W. Brown sounds a rich spectrum of overtones, but is not overblown. (In overblowing the [...] "amplitude of the pipe fundamental frequency falls to zero.") Increasing whistle length increases the number and amplitude of harmonics, as has been demonstrated in experiments with a variable-pitch whistle. Whistles tested on steam produce both even-numbered and odd-numbered harmonics. The harmonic profile of a whistle might also be influenced by aperture width, mouth cut-up, and lip-aperture offset, as is the case for organ pipes.|$|E

40|$|STEAM QUALITY {{has been}} {{generally}} {{defined as the}} amount of moisture/vapor (or lack thereof) contained within steam produced from some form of boiler.

Since water vapor is always present at the interface between the water level and the steam in a boiler, some water vapor will always tend to pass through the system with the steam.

Thermal modifications under <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> conditions (160 °C or 170 °C) and superheated steam conditions (170, 185, and 212 °C) were investigated by analysing the presence of water-soluble 5 -(hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF), furfural, and carbohydrates in heat-treated wood. The influence of thermal modifications on Scots pine, Norway spruce, and silver birch was also studied. Furfurals were analysed using HPLC at 280 nm, while monosaccharides and water-soluble carbohydrates were determined by GC-FID as their acetylated alditiols and, after methanolysis, as their trimethylsilylated methyl-glycosides, respectively.

5000|$|The {{next stage}} in the process is to boil water and make steam. The {{goal is to make}} the heat flow as {{completely}} as possible from the heat source to the water. The water is confined in a restricted space heated by the fire. The steam produced has lower density than the water and therefore will accumulate at the highest level in the vessel; its temperature will remain at boiling point and will only increase as pressure increases.

Previous studies have only considered using steam with high levels of superheat where it behaves more like an ideal gas. This present study considers steam with low levels of superheat and at wet saturated conditions. The isentropic real gas flow coefficient, which is needed for the calculation of the flow through a sonic nozzle, has been obtained using the equations of state for steam.

40|$|Abstract. With {{superheated}} steam, {{there is}} no direct relationship between temperature and pressure, Therefore, at a particular pressure it is possible for superheated steam to exist at a wide range of temperatures higher than that of its <b>saturated</b> <b>steam.</b> The heat transfer coefficient is 1 / 150 - 1 / 250 as much as that of <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> during heat transferring, and it takes a relatively long time to cool, during which time the steam is releasing very little energy and transmitted long distances. The mechanisms of superheated steam stimulation are mainly pointed to the performance of crude oil viscosity reduced, flow environment improved, rock wettability changed, oil displacement efficiency improved. Physical simulation shows that oil displacement efficiency by superheated steam is 6 - 12 % higher than that of <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> at the same temperature, and under the condition of carrying the same heat, superheated steam enlarged the heating radius by about 10 m, oil steam ratio increased by 0. 7.
