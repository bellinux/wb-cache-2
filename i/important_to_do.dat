Richthofen acknowledged {{that not all of}} these components could be conducted simultaneously.

His view of anti-shipping operations, and von Wild’s conduct of them, was scathing.

The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was [...] "brilliant". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante."

[...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when the last time I thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E

This training helped the anti-terrorism group become better at eliminating their targets so there were fewer terrorism threats.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} non-maleficence is {{embodied}} by the phrase, [...] "first, do no harm," [...] or the Latin, primum non nocere. Many consider {{that should be}} the main or primary consideration (hence primum): that it is more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good. This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no (or only acceptable levels of) harm. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, [...] "The treatment was a success, but the patient died." [...] It is not only more <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> no harm than to do good; {{it is also important to}} know how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful—he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.|$|E

The director fibbed to Warner Independent's president that he wanted 10% of the dialogue in Hindi, and she approved the change. Filming locations included shooting in Mumbai's megaslum and in shantytown parts of Juhu, so film-makers controlled the crowds by befriending onlookers. Filming began on 5 November 2007.|$|E
