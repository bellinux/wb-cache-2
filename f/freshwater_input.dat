A peak in abundance during the late autumn months is observed, with the maxima for different species occurring on different dates. Such a pattern is also observed in modern-day tropical zooplankton. The diversity of living habits is also reflected by the depth of water and distance from the shore. [...] Different species are found in highest abundance at different depths. [...] While deeper waters around 40km from the shoreline are generally the optimal environment, some species appear to prefer very shallow water. On the whole, chitinozoans are less abundant in turbulent waters or reef environments, implying an aversion to such regimes when alive, if it is not an effect of sedimentary focusing. [...] Chitinozoans also become rarer in shallower water - although the reverse is not necessarily true. They cannot survive <b>freshwater</b> <b>input.</b>|$|E

The aim of this 6 year study was to assess whether <b>freshwater</b> <b>inputs</b> (rainfall and dam discharges) were acting as physical, physiological or trophic forcing factors on phytoplankton pigment concentrations and the dominant mysids of a temperate estuary (Guadalquivir estuary; SW, Spain). The effects of natural and human-controlled <b>freshwater</b> <b>inputs</b> modified the physico-chemical conditions and consequently biological production (bottom up control). Nutrient (nitrogen hypernutrification), suspended particulate matter and allochthonous photosynthetic pigment imports linked to <b>freshwater</b> <b>inputs</b> from adjacent habitats were observed, as well as light-limited autochthonous primary production. Seasonal and/or spatial patterns were shown by all study variables, including mysids. Freshwater management effects on dominant mysids differed depending on the species’ salinity tolerance (physiological forcing) and preferred prey availability (trophic forcing). Moreover, high inorganic matter content had a negative effect on the density of Mesopodopsis slabberi (physical forcing), which led to an increased detritivory/herbivory ratio (Neomysis integer/M. slabberi ratio). In conclusion, <b>freshwater</b> <b>inputs</b> appeared to effect estuarine lower trophic levels via a combination of different forcing mechanisms.

In recent years, stable isotope analysis has become a widespread and reliable method for the examination of trophic structure over time and space, also in complex ecosystems such as coastal lagoons.

The originality {{of this study is}} to investigate with such a global model, the response of the coupled system to freshwater discharges for three different climate contexts, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Last Glacial Inception (LGI) and the present-day (PD) climates. We first show that in all climate contexts, the North Atlantic circulation is more sensitive to freshwater flux when ice sheets are present. Secondly, the "seesaw" mechanism occurs mostly for the North Atlantic freshwater perturbation whereas it remains very weak for the Southern Ocean freshwater release. Moreover, this seesaw is generally enhanced when ice sheets are interactive. The most striking result is that the freshwater perturbation amplifies the inception of the North American ice sheet at LGI the sea-level drop associated is significantly increased and in a much better agreement with data...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{productivity}} of Ria de Aveiro is {{sustained by the}} large quantities of dissolved inorganic nutrients, mainly from <b>freshwater</b> <b>inputs</b> (e. g. agricultural drainage) and organic-rich anthropogenic point sources (e. g. urban sewage). The concentration of silicate and nitrate showed a similar seasonal variation and conservative behaviour, since 63 to 96 % {{of the total variance}} of the concentration of silicate and 88 to 96 % of the total variance of the concentration of nitrate were explained by salinity. On the other hand, the concentration of nitrite, ammonium, and phosphate did not seem dependent on the <b>freshwater</b> <b>inputs,</b> showing a random distribution with salinity. Nutrient concentrations were always higher in the two inner areas than at the outer boundary of the system. Chlorophyll a showed higher concentrations throughout spring and sum-mer, and also in the inner areas. The annual variation of N:P, N:Si and phytoplankton biomass suggests that there is a large excess of nitrate. The results suggest that within a system with low overall eutrophic condition (OEC) and low susceptibili-ty (US-NEEA index), the quality status of different areas within the system can vary (Applying the EU-WFD criteria pro-posed for the trophic classification of the Baltic Sea).
