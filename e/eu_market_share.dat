40|$|This paper aims to {{show the}} uneven process of changes in {{competitiveness}} across Polish manufacturing industries during the period prior to Poland's EU membership (1996 - 2003). Based on the Schumpeterian approach to competitiveness, that {{is the ability to}} compete, it looks at changes in competitiveness as effects of competition and its factors. Using two types of measure, four clusters of Polish manufacturing industries are selected: double winners, export-led industries, export-oriented industries and losers. The analysis shows that the use of <b>EU</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as a measure of changes in competitiveness fails to reveal differentiation in levels and changes in relative productivity in those industries that increased their <b>EU</b> <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> It also shows that the larger the initial differences in labour productivity across industries, the stronger the process of differentiation of changes in competitiveness. Systemic transition and external liberalisation are conducive to improvement in the competitiveness of highly productive industries, but create a weak stimulus for improvement in the competitiveness of the most backward ones. Secondly, the higher the investment rate and its dynamics, the larger the increase in competitive pressure on the EU market. This conclusion is of great importance for Polish manufacturing, all of the more so given that the potential to reduce employment seems to have been largely exhausted and investment intensity has dropped considerably, especially since 1998. competitiveness, productivity, transition economies, manufacturing industry, EU integration...|$|E

40|$|Tariff rate quotas (TRQs) {{have been}} {{introduced}} and legitimised as a market access instrument in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA). TRQs combine both restriction of imports, and safeguard of current or preferential agricultural trade flows. By restricting the market access through high level tariff beyond the quota, one can imagine that exporters enjoying low level tariff would take share of quota rent. Do developing exporting countries benefit from EU TRQs? Do they enjoy quota rents or guaranteed market access? What should be their interest to defend about TRQs at WTO agricultural negotiations? This article aims to present {{an analysis of the}} 87 EU's agricultural TRQs implementation from 1997 to 2002, in order to bring to the fore the effects of such an import instrument for exporting countries in competition on the import market. Some theoretical elements of the economy of TRQs are first presented in order to introduce the empirical work. The database built is then used to interpret EU agricultural TRQs implementation during the period 1997 - 2002, and the global results in terms of potential total rent that one can theoretically expect from TRQs is detailed by products grouping and export country grouping. A first examination of the database shows that while preference margin is potentially high for TRQs as a whole, potential rent is not so high. Moreover, this potential rent seems to be concentrated on only bananas and sugar, because TRQs are actually binding for those two commodities. A focus on those products indicates that only few exporting countries are susceptible to enjoy this potential rent: Latin American for bananas and ACP for sugar. However that does not signify that TRQs may be eliminated without big losses for exporters: they actually procure guaranteed <b>EU's</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> protected from foreign competition. tariff rate quotas, quota rent, developing countries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

Nevertheless, if the Next WTO Round is going to be along the same lines as the Uruguay Round, the EU may be able to stay within the WTO commitments for export subsidy in the dairy sector without further reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy. Certainly, some minor reforms are needed to relieve the binding commitments for cheese and other milk products. The upcoming reform in the dairy sector under Agenda 2000 starting from year 2005 may help in reforming the dairy sector for the new round. In contrast, a steeper reduction in the export subsidy commitments compared to the Uruguay Round may cause problems for cheese and other milk products because the majority of exports in these products will have to be exported without any export subsidy. After enlargement, in particular with a steeper reduction formula, the EU may face troubles in the categories of butter, skim milk powder, cheese, and other milk products. The reforms under Agenda 2000 may not be sufficient because the difference between the <b>EU</b> internal <b>market</b> price and world market price is still too high for EU dairy products to allow unsubsidised exports to the world <b>market.</b> The <b>EU</b> internal <b>market</b> will have to absorb the dairy products intended for the export <b>market.</b> Consequently, the <b>EU</b> internal <b>market</b> for dairy products will be under pressure for further price reduction, and the <b>EU</b> world <b>market</b> <b>share</b> in dairy products will shrink.

To infer competitiveness from the changes in export value over time, a first- level Constant <b>Market</b> <b>Share</b> (CMS) analysis was used to decompose the changes in export value into a structural effect, competitive effect and second-order effect. To augment this technique, an empirical analysis on the determinants of the Ghanaâs canned tuna export was conducted using the Armington trade model by OLS regression on monthly data from January 1999 â December 2009, with quantity <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the dependent variable.

The main integration indicator used is the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> (premium based) of foreign companies in domestic markets. For the calculation of this indicator, three different kinds of foreign presence are taken into account: foreign presence through merger and acquisitions, through branches and agencies and direct cross-border sales without physical presence. Whereas the static view reveals {{a high degree of}} national fragmentation the dynamic view indicates advancing integration. The results also show that integration is even less advanced for life than for non-life insurance and that mergers and acquisitions are the dominant strategy to access a foreign market. Besides summarising the liberalisation history of the European insurance sector and discussing consumer benefits from further integration, the study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} obstacles to insurance market integration. ...|$|R
