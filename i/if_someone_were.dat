25|$|A {{legacy of}} serious {{environmental}} problems has beset {{the area from}} the time the canal arose from the local tidal wetlands and fresh water streams. In recent years, there has been a call once again for environmental cleanup. In addition, development pressures have brought speculation that the wetlands of the Gowanus should serve waterfront economic development needs which may not be compatible with environmental restoration. Experts have said that it is so polluted that <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to fall in the canal, they would need to be taken to a hospital for decontamination. Also, if anyone were to drink the water, they would likely contract dysentery and would be at risk of cancer and arsenic poisoning.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> {{to behave}} as if they {{understood}} a language which no-one else can make sense of, we might call this {{an example of a}} private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.|$|E

Transit police would search riders at random before boarding a bus or entering a station. It also explained its intent to stop anyone acting suspiciously. Metro claims that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision in MacWade v. Kelly, which upheld random searches on the New York City Subway, allows Metro Transit Police to take similar action. Metro Transit Police Chief Michael Taborn stated that, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> {{to turn around and}} simply enter the system through another escalator or elevator, Metro has [...] "a plan to address suspicious behavior". Security expert Bruce Schneier characterized the plan as [...] "security theater against a movie plot threat" [...] and does not believe random bag searches actually improve security.|$|E

500|$|The adult {{interest}} in the show is {{comparable to that of}} The Magic Roundabout, Tiny Toon Adventures, Rocko's Modern Life, Animaniacs, Dexters Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob SquarePants, Yo Gabba Gabba!, and Phineas and Ferb: older audiences appreciate jokes aimed at adult viewers and a sense of nostalgia for older cartoons and animated films. Many of the aforementioned shows had attracted college-aged fans who, when Friendship Is Magic was airing, would be raising children of their own. The show references works that older viewers would recognize, such as I Love Lucy, The Benny Hill Show, X-Men, , Diamond Dogs, The Big Lebowski, The Avengers, Star Wars, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Most of these fans are surprised by their fondness for the show. Shaun Scotellaro, operator of Equestria Daily, one of the main fan websites for the show, said, [...] "Honestly, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to have told me I'd be writing a pony blog seven months ago, I would have called them insane." [...] He commented that the spread among adults was accelerated by its presence in online gaming. Mike Fahey, an editor for the gaming website Kotaku, noted that the fandom was [...] "building friendships among a diverse group of people that otherwise might have just sat {{on either side of the}} Internet, flinging insults at each other". Dr. Patrick Edwards, who performed several [...] "Brony Studies" [...] to survey and analyze the fandom, observed that the brony fandom is unlike most other fandoms which [...] "aren't welcoming to people who are different", and promote the show's message of love and tolerance. [...] Further interest came from the furry community, which includes a large number of animation fans. One contributor to [...] "The Brony Study" [...] (below), Dr. Marsha Redden said that the adult fans are [...] "a reaction to the US having been engrossed in terrorism for past ten years" [...] in a manner similar to the Cold War, and are [...] "tired of being afraid, tired of angst and animosity"; the show and its fandom are outlets from those strifes. She compared the brony fandom to that of the bohemian and beatniks after World War II and of the hippies after the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, Amy Keating Rogers, one of the show's writers, believes that the fans have come to like Friendship Is Magic due to [...] "so much cynicism and negativity out there in so many [...] shows", while the show [...] "has such a positive message" [...] that counters this.|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{explains}} this unintelligibility with {{a series}} of analogies. For example, in section 265 he observes the pointlessness of a dictionary that exists only in the imagination. Since the idea of a dictionary is to justify the translation of one word by another, and thus constitute the reference of justification for such a translation, all this is lost the moment we talk of a dictionary in the imagination; for “justification consists in appealing to something independent". Hence, to appeal to a private ostensive definition as the standard of correct use of a term would be [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{immunity}} has intrigued mankind {{for thousands of}} years. The prehistoric view of disease {{was that it was}} caused by supernatural forces, and that illness was a form of theurgic punishment for [...] "bad deeds" [...] or [...] "evil thoughts" [...] visited upon the soul by the gods or by one's enemies. Between the time of Hippocrates and the 19th century, when the foundations of the scientific methods were laid, diseases were attributed to an alteration or imbalance in one of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile or black bile). Also popular during this time before learning that communicable diseases came from germs/microbes was the miasma theory, which held that diseases such as cholera or the Black Plague were caused by a miasma, a noxious form of [...] "bad air". <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> exposed to the miasma in a swamp, in evening air, or breathing air in a sickroom or hospital ward, they could get a disease.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime in {{the distant}} past, God {{dictated}} the angel scribe Metatron to write a compendium of tablets known as the Word of God. They cover a variety of subjects, including demons, angels, and leviathans. God then sealed the tablets inside the [...] "Vault of the Earth" [...] and even <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to find them, only a few chosen human, the prophets, are able to decipher them. The Leviathan Tablet, which was dug from somewhere in Iran, has an instruction regarding how to kill a leviathan. The Demon Tablet, recovered by Crowley through unknown means, contains an instruction about locking all demons in Hell forever as well as techniques about disposing demons, such as devil's traps, holy water, and demon bombs. The Angel Tablet, stored in one of Lucifer's crypts, has the {{information on how to}} make all angels fall from Heaven as well as an incantation to imbue an angel with great power. The Demon Tablet is currently in the possession of Castiel, who has destroyed the Angel Tablet in the ninth season to prevent Metatron from using its powers.|$|E

2500|$|Sanielevici {{believed}} to have also detected traces of Zalmoxian and Dionysian practice in various elements of Romanian folklore, reading Mioriţa as a codified record of human sacrifice in Dacian times. Around 1901, he had dismissed Mioriţa as a crude and absurd poem, noting that its protagonists displayed a suicidal indifference to murder, [...] "instead of calling the police". Literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu describes Sanielevici's comment as mere reification, [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to ask why King Lear won't book himself a hotel room". A transition was already evident in La Vie des mammifères..., where Sanielevici suggests that Mioriţa, like Tristan and Iseult, is a wonderful sample of [...] "intoxicated", African-like, mentalities {{in the heart of}} Europe. By 1930, Sanielevici had revised his own argument: his Mioriţa sau patimile lui Zalmoxis formed part of a resurgence in Dacian studies and essayistics. Writing in 2006, University of Turin academic Roberto Merlo includes it among a list of period works that focused in large part on Zalmoxis, with various interpretations to his story; other authors cited therein include Dan Botta, Mircea Eliade, Alexis Nour, Lucian Blaga and Theodor Speranţia. As such, Sanielevici's final take on the poem described the shepherd's indifference as a ritualized initiation into death.|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{also argues}} that one couldn't {{possibly}} use {{the words of a}} private language. He invites the reader to consider a case in which someone decides that each time she has a particular sensation she will place a sign S in a diary. Wittgenstein points out that in such a case one could have no criteria for the correctness of one's use of S. Again, several examples are considered. One is that perhaps using S involves mentally consulting a table of sensations, to check that one has associated S correctly; but in this case, how could the mental table be checked for its correctness? It is [...] "s <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true", as Wittgenstein puts it. One common interpretation of the argument is that while one may have direct or privileged access to one's current mental states, there is no such infallible access to identifying previous mental states that one had in the past. [...] That is, the only way to check to see if one has applied the symbol S correctly to a certain mental state is to introspect and determine whether the current sensation is identical to the sensation previously associated with S. [...] And while identifying one's current mental state of remembering may be infallible, whether one remembered correctly is not infallible. Thus, for a language to be used at all it must have some public criterion of identity.|$|E
2500|$|The other style, the [...] "ghost rider," [...] when {{performed}} correctly, can {{be faster}} than the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] style, but has the tendency to be more dangerous, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it is no longer taught to rookies during rookie week. In order to perform the exchange the rider goes through all the same steps as in the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, except, instead of stepping off the bike, the rider sets the handlebars and then grabs hold of the seat. Once set, the rider will push herself off the back of the bike while it is still moving. As long as the handle bars stay in line and the rider clears the back wheel, then the bike will keep going straight on its own until the other rider grabs hold and jumps on. The name [...] "ghost rider" [...] comes from the fact that when the first rider gets off, the bike keeps going as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> really still on it, like a ghost. There are several risks to this exchange. The first is if the first rider doesn't set the handle bars properly, then when she lets go, the bike will swerve and the rider will be thrown from the bike, and possibly take out other members of hers or other teams. Any rider performing this exchange must also be careful to clear the back wheel of the bike or else face the inevitable injuries associated with this type of accident. Another risk is that the second rider can miss the bike and it will cut into other teams exchanges or even worse, race traffic. In the women's race, the only team to consistently use this technique is Kappa Alpha Theta.|$|E
