The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate germination parameters and early seedlings growth of maize under different salinity conditions (0, - 0. 3, - 0. 6, - 0. 9 and - 1. 2 MPa). Germination was tested in <b>double</b> <b>rolled</b> filter paper, moistened with different NaCl solution, in the dark at 25 °C. Osmotic stress had significant effects on all examined characteristics, except on final germination. Under the highest osmotic stress, mean germination time and time to 50 % germination were 14 h and 30 h longer than at control. Root and shoot length under those conditions (- 1. 2 MPa) were 76 % and 87 % shorter compared to control, while root and shoot weight were reduced (81 % and 87 %). Minor reduction in germination energy was recorded under stress. These results showed different responses of germination parameters and early seedling growth in the observed genotype under different salinity conditions...|$|E
40|$|Information {{is needed}} on {{potential}} biomass crops for marginal lands in southern Europe. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate switchgrass establishment in four seedbed preparation treatments (sowing, rolling before sowing, rolling before and after sowing and no till) for two varieties (small and large seed types). A 4 × 2 split-plot factorial design with four blocks was adopted over a 2 years period. Trials were conducted in Bologna (latitude 44 ° 33 ′N, longitude 11 ° 21 ′E, 32 m a. s. l.), in a silt loam soil (Udic Ustochreps fine silty, mixed, mesic). In general, emergence was lower in the autumn trials than in the spring one. Emergence on rolled soil (single and double) was statistically higher than tilled unrolled soil. Cumulative analysis of the two autumn trials including no till showed a significant (P≤ 0. 05) interaction between treatment and varieties: the large seed variety had a better performance only with no till, particularly in the first year. Overall, if no till was not considered, no significant interactions between variety and tillage treatments were found for final seedling numbers. The statistical analysis on both varieties was therefore combined. Although the <b>double</b> <b>rolled</b> tillage treatment consistently showed a slightly higher average seedling emergence than the single rolled treatment, the final number of emerged seedlings was never significantly different. In all cases, the rolled treatments (single and double) had significantly higher final emergence rates than the treatment with no soil compaction. The average emergence index of unrolled plots was 20 % lower than rolled plots. A function was calculated to predict the seedling numbers at the end of emergence based on the seedling numbers at the beginning of emergence. Generally rolling was needed to obtain best switchgrass performances. In northern Italy both varieties had a good emergence when soil conditions were appropriated...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Double</b> jelly <b>roll</b> capsid {{proteins}} {{consist of}} two single jelly roll folds {{connected by a}} short linker region. They are found exclusively in double-stranded DNA viruses of at least nine different viral families, including viruses that infect all domains of life, and spanning a large capsid size range. In the <b>double</b> jelly <b>roll</b> capsid architecture, the jelly roll axis is oriented perpendicular or [...] "vertically" [...] relative to the capsid surface. <b>Double</b> jelly <b>roll</b> proteins {{are believed to have}} evolved from single jelly roll proteins by gene duplication; however, because of the major differences in architecture and assembly, it is unclear whether the <b>double</b> jelly <b>roll</b> capsid evolved directly from a single jelly roll capsid or if the two capsid forms represent distinct lineages of adaptation from common ancestral jelly roll proteins. However, the degree of structural similarity among double-jelly-roll virus capsids has led to the conclusion that these viruses likely have a common evolutionary origin despite their diversity in size and in host range; this has become known as the PRD1-adenovirus lineage. Although most members of this group are icosahedral, a few families such as the Poxviridae and Ascoviridae have oval or brick-shaped mature virions; poxviruses such as Vaccinia undergo dramatic conformational changes mediated by highly derived <b>double</b> jelly <b>roll</b> proteins during maturation and likely derive from an icosahedral ancestor. Shared double-jelly-roll capsid proteins, along with other homologous proteins, have also been cited in support of the proposed order Megavirales containing the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV).|$|R

40|$|Double {{diffusion}} of a viscous fluid is simulated for heat leakage driven by buoyant convection under cryogenic storage conditions in a cylindrical tank with laminar flow. If the tank is stably stratified, {{there is a}} potential instability due to the inability of the fluid in the lower layer to release heat to the top vapor space, whereas the upper liquid layer can exchange heat and mass through sensible heat transfer and evaporation with the vapor space. Eventually, the lower layer becomes less dense due to thermal expansion and is no longer constrained in the stratification. The rapid rise and overturning of the fluid is termed rollover, and can be accompanied by a potentially explosive release of vapor. In this paper, hydrodynamics and heat and mass transport are used to study the stability characteristics of rollover. The transient state is used as a base state for a linear stability analysis which shows the transition from a “corner eddy” mode spinning down to spinning up is the driver for the rollover instability. Four different vapor-liquid interfacial boundary conditions are tested, with similar results for the time to rollover. Surprisingly, the long time prerollover state is dominated in the laminar flow regime by heat conduction and diffusion, as the expected <b>double</b> <b>roll</b> structure is suppressed and advection plays a small roll in the majority of the prerollover period. Scalings are suggested for controlling dimensionless groups on this prerollover basis that {{can be used as a}} guideline to determine the regime of <b>double</b> diffusion—a single <b>roll</b> or a <b>double</b> <b>roll</b> stratification, as well as the severity of the eventual rollover event. An energy analysis demonstrates the switch from practically advection free to free convection regimes. ...|$|R
