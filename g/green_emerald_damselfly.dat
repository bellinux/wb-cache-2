50|$|Winterton Dunes is {{also known}} as the first site in Britain where the {{southern}} <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> occurred (Nobes 2003).|$|R
50|$|The shores are {{dominated}} by various species of Oligochaeta, Gastropoda, and Odonata. Superficial sediments {{are dominated}} by Oligochaeta and non-biting midges while deeper layers contain the freshwater crustacean Asellus aquaticus and larvae of mayflies and Odonatas. Gyraulus crista and Hippeutis complanatus are unusual freshwater snails present in the lake. The most common dragonfly is the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> but azure damselfly, variable <b>damselfly,</b> scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> common blue <b>damselfly,</b> downy <b>emerald,</b> and red-eyed <b>damselfly</b> are also present. In Stockholm, Aeshna osiliensis is unique to Norra Djurgården, while the large white-faced darter is protected by the EU.|$|R
50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, southern hawker, brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable <b>damselfly,</b> downy <b>emerald,</b> red-eyed <b>damselfly,</b> northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.|$|R
50|$|Lestes dryas is {{a species}} of {{damselfly}} in the family Lestidae, the spreadwings. Its common names include emerald spreadwing, scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> and robust spreadwing. An alternate name in Ireland is the turlough spreadwing.|$|R
50|$|Lestes sponsa, is a damselfly, {{with a wide}} Palaearctic distribution. It {{is known}} {{commonly}} as the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> or common spreadwing. Both males and females have a metallic green colour and when resting its wings are usually half opened.|$|R
50|$|Chalcolestes viridis, {{formerly}} Lestes viridis, is a damselfly of {{the family}} Lestidae. It has a metallic green body and at rest it holds its wings away from its body. Its common name is the willow <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> or the western willow spreadwing.|$|R
500|$|Southern <b>Emerald</b> <b>Damselfly,</b> first {{recorded}} at Winterton Dunes, Norfolk on 30 July 2002 (Nobes 2003 [...] ); in 2003 & 2004, the species was again seen here and at Sandwich Bay, Kent (Forrest 2005 [...] ), {{but there have}} been no subsequent sightings at either location.|$|R
50|$|Thousands of anthills of {{the yellow}} meadow ant {{can be found in}} the ancient grasslands of Old Hall Marshes as well as around twenty-four species of butterfly. Dragonflies are also popular in this area which include the scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> and good numbers of ruddy darters.|$|R
500|$|... 3. The {{following}} {{is a list of}} species which have previously been predicted to occur in Britain but have not yet been recorded (see Merritt, Moore & Eversham 1996 [...] pp.113–114 and Parr 1998, [...] 1999 [...] ): Subarctic Hawker Aeshna subarctica, Northern White-faced Darter Leucorrhina rubicunda and Small <b>Emerald</b> <b>Damselfly</b> Lestes virens.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} members of the Lestes genus both sexes of L. dryas have largely {{metallic}} green bodies with a bronze iridescence. They usually rest with their wings half spread. L.dryas is very similar in appearance to the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> Lestes sponsa and care must be taken to tell the two species apart.|$|R
50|$|The marshes are {{unimproved}} coastal grassland, dykes and creeks, with a {{wide variety}} of maritime herbs and grasses, some of them nationally rare. The site is the main British location for least lettuce. Insects with restricted distributions include the scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> and Roesel's bush cricket. There are birds at Vange Marsh such as avocets, common terns and black-tailed godwits.|$|R
5000|$|Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the {{subjective}} notion of similarity. Two <b>green</b> <b>emeralds</b> are usually considered more similar than two grue ones {{if only one}} of them is green. Observing a <b>green</b> <b>emerald</b> makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a <b>green</b> <b>emerald)</b> next time. <b>Green</b> <b>emeralds</b> are a natural kind, but grue emeralds are not. Quine investigates [...] "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind". Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. identity, negation, disjunction. However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to similarity or kind; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.|$|R
2500|$|... – Given {{the same}} set of {{observations}} of <b>green</b> <b>emeralds,</b> someone using the predicate [...] "grue" [...] will inductively infer that all emeralds, which will be observed after t, will be blue, {{despite the fact that he}} observed only <b>green</b> <b>emeralds</b> so far.|$|R
500|$|Willow <b>Emerald</b> <b>Damselfly,</b> since 2007 {{this species}} is {{established}} and spreading in south-east England, especially Suffolk and Essex. It was previously only known {{from a single}} record from Hertfordshire in 1899 (although this record {{is based on a}} specimen regarded by some as perhaps not of British origin, see Gladwin 1997 [...] ) and a single exuvia collected in Kent in 1992 (Brook & Brook 2002, 2004 [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} {{a variety of}} habitats, such as grassland, scrub, reedbed, fen, ponds and saltmarsh. It was {{reclaimed}} in the seventeenth century, when Pitseahall Fleet was excavated to construct sea walls. The Fleet has a large and varied bird population. Dykes and ponds support the scarce <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly,</b> and other rare invertebrates include Roesel's bush-cricket, a harvestman Leiobunum rotundum, a hoverfly xanthandrus comtus, and a ground beetle dyschirius impunctipennis.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{a mixture}} of woodland, scrub and grassland. Most soils in London are acidic, but this site has a very {{alkaline}} soil due to the dumping of fuel ash, and can therefore support locally unusual plants. The most important of these are pyramidal and southern marsh orchids, grey club rush and wild basil. The site also has large numbers of rabbits and goldfinches. Some rare species of insects are present, including <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fauna {{is unusually}} varied, {{including}} the European hare, the European stonechat, the shrike, the diving bell spider and {{many kinds of}} amphibians and reptiles, such as the natterjack toad, northern crested newt and grass snake. Waders and songbirds use the area as a brooding site, raptors use the arable land {{as a source of}} prey, and the entire area has an extremely varied insect population including the scarce blue-tailed <b>damselfly</b> and small <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{valuable}} habitat {{has been}} generated on the Große Aue for {{plants and animals}} typical of water meadows. In the wet biotopes and in the standing and flowing waters there are grass rushes, water violets and blister sedges as well as short-winged coneheads and large marsh grasshoppers. Threatened dragonflies, such as the banded darter, southern <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> live here as do birds like the whitethroat and little grebe. Reed buntings, reed warblers and snipe also occur here.|$|R

50|$|The {{badge of}} the Nishan-e-Imtiaz {{is in the}} form of pure golden star with light-white enamel, with well {{polished}} <b>green</b> <b>emerald</b> circumference to the inside the golden star. Written in gold words around the <b>green</b> <b>emerald,</b> it reads as نشان امتیاز. A golden Jasminum stands between the point of the star. It is worn around the neck with a yellow, bright yellow and white ribbon (for civilians) or bright green and white ribbon (for military officers) with white edge stripes.|$|R
40|$|Females of the <b>emerald</b> <b>damselflies,</b> Lestes sponsa, L. temporalis and L, japonicus, were {{captured}} in the wild and their reproductive organs were observed. The number of mature eggs was rather constant during their reproductive ages at about 200, 100 and 100 in L. sponsa, L. temporalis and L. japonicus, respectively. The egg maturation seemed to occur continuously after a particular developmental stage of adult female. The mature egg size of L. temporalis was more than two times of that of other species and decreased with age. The realized fecundity {{seemed to be the}} largest in L, sponsa...|$|R
50|$|Preferred {{habitats}} of {{this species}} are pools, ponds and moorlands, it is a species of still or very slow flowing water. The <b>emerald</b> <b>damselfly</b> has a large Palaeartic distribution, and is found in a band across central Europe and Asia from Spain to the Pacific. It is {{not found in the}} far north in Europe and Asia or in the extreme south, being absent from southern Spain, southern Italy and Greece. It probably occurs in some areas of north Africa; where it occurs around the Mediterranean it is found at altitude. In Great Britain it is the only Lestes species that is common.|$|R
