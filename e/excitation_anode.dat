The Ignitron dispenses with excitation anodes by igniting the arc each time conduction is required to start. In this way, ignitrons also avoid the need for control grids.|$|E
50|$|Since {{momentary}} interruptions or {{reductions of}} output current may cause the cathode spot to extinguish, many rectifiers incorporate an additional electrode {{to maintain an}} arc whenever the plant is in use. Typically, a two or three phase supply of a few amperes passes through small <b>excitation</b> <b>anodes.</b> A magnetically shunted transformer {{of a few hundred}} VA rating is commonly used to provide this supply.|$|R

The sample is excited by a rotating <b>anode</b> (<b>excitation</b> at constant energy, Cu Kα at 8 keV, power 40 kV × 40 mA) while the fluorescence signal is analyzed by EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray). The excitation beam {{is focused on the}} sample by a capillary lens (spot diameter 20 μm) provided by IFG GmbH. The XRF technique is particularly suitable for analysis of heavy elements, typically heavier than sodium.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} threats to human health from heavy metals is {{associated}} with the exposure to lead (Pb). In vivo X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) of human bone is a widely used technique to determine the total Pb body burden. The intention of this work was to study the feasibility of in vivo L-shell XRF measurements of Pb in bone using X-ray tubes as excitation sources. Parameter studies using direct tube <b>excitation</b> with various <b>anode</b> materials (Mo and W) and filters as well as different secondary targets and low Z polarizers were performed with regard to the lowest detection limits (LLD) achievable for Pb in bone matrix. A breakthrough {{for the development of a}} portable spectrometer was achieved using of an air cooled low power (50 W) Pd anode X-ray tube, Mo secondary target and a Peltier cooled SDD detector. LLDs for Pb in bone were determined from measurements on a plaster-of-paris standard without overlying tissue equivalent material and found to be around 0. 6 µg/g. 1...|$|R
30|$|The X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) {{measurements were}} carried out by using a SPECS GmbH X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (SPECS, Berlin, Germany). Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed under vacuum inside the load lock for 16 h. The binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C 1 s) line at 284.6 eV was used for calibration, and the positions of other peaks were corrected according {{to the position of}} the C 1 s signal. For the measurements of high-resolution spectra, the analyzer was set to the large area lens mode with energy steps of 25 m eV and in fixed analyzer transmission (FAT) mode with pass energies of 34 eV and dwell times of 100 ms. The photoelectron spectra of the four samples were recorded with the acceptance area and angle of 5 mm in diameter and up to ± 5 °, respectively. The base pressure during all measurements was 5 [*]×[*] 10 − 9 mbar. A standard dual <b>anode</b> <b>excitation</b> source with Mg Kα (1, 253.6 eV) radiation was used at 13 kV and 100 W.|$|R

A procedure conbining solvent extraction enrichment techniques and spectrographic analysis was developed for the quantitative determination of many trace elements in a wide range of silicate rocks and in a series of highly saline Antarctic lake waters. Since a great deal of the work depended on spectrographic analysis, an investigation was carried out to improve the precision and sensitivity of existing methods. An improved method for the determination of spectralline intensities was developed. This was based on the author's nodification of the partial Seidel function, referred to as B-functions. A conversion table for these is given. A scale calibrated in B-functions was incorporated into a Hilger microphotometer enabling such values to be obtained directly without the use of conversion tables. B-values can be plotted directly onto the linear ordinate of semilog paper if the self-calibration method is used for evaluating line intensities. This results in a straightening of the characteristic curve with an attendant time saving and an improvement in the accuracy of the background extrapolation. A nomographic technique was also developed for use in conjunction with this scale and resulted in a rapid evaluation of line intensities but with some loss in precision. Cathode excitation as distinct from cathode layer was compared with <b>anode</b> <b>excitation</b> under the same conditions. Data on 33 elements were used to study relative self-absorption effects, absolute sensitivities, volatilisation curves, times for complete combustion and background effects. Data on 14 elements and 35 line pairs were used to study reproducibilities in the three matrices, NaCl, CaCl 2 and carbon. It was shown that cathode excitation in a carbon matrix afforded the greatest precision for a number of the more volatile elements. <b>Anode</b> <b>excitation</b> provided generally better precision if a NaCl matrix was used. CaCl 2 was a very unsatisfactory rnatrix. For the more volatile elements cathode excitation provided a higher sensitivity than <b>anode</b> <b>excitation</b> but with increased background and cyanogen emission. The extraction of the elements Au,Zn,Cd,Hg, Ga, In,Tl,Sn,Pb,As,Sb and Bi from hydrochloric acid into the three solvents cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol and cyclohexane was studied as a function of acid concentration. Cyclohexanone is a more efficient, but less selective extractant, than cyclohexanol. Cyclohexane has little extracting power for these elements. Solvent extraction of hydrochloric acid solutions of a series of highly saline Antarctic lake waters into cyclohexanone was used to enrich the elements Zn,Pb, In, Bi, Fe, Mn, Mo prior to spectrographic analysis. For this, the percent extraction of Fe, Mn and Mo into cyclohexanone from 3 N hydrochloric acid was obtained. This investigation has shown that one of these lakes, Lake Bonney, has most probably had a seawater origin. It is also possible that another of these lakes, Lake Fryxell, may also have contained seawater in the past. From the relative abundance of the various elements in the other lakes, it was possible to conduct a geochemical reconnaissance of the areas surrounding the lakes. This suggested that the two most likely areas for mineralisation in the McMurdo Oasis area of Antarctica are the region surrounding and feeding water to Lake Hoare and the region surrounding Lake Joyce. A consideration of the theory of discontinuous counter current liquid-liquid extraction has shown that it is possible to simultaneously determine the extraction characteristics of a large number of elements for a given solvent system. If this technique is coupled with spectrographic analysis the determination is particularly rapid. The extraction of the elements Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, As, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, La, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi from hydrochloric acid into methyl isobutyl ketone was studied as a function of acid concentration. The data were obtained by studying spectrographically the distribution patterns of the elements after equilibration on a discontinuous counter current liquid-liquid extraction apparatus. A comparison of some of the data so obtained with results for the same system as reported by other workers showed that the technique is valid and accurate. Using these data it was possible to devise a scheme which could separate Fe from the majority of the trace elements extracted by cyclohexanone from a hydrochloric acid solution of a rock. By a combination of batch extraction with cyclohexanone and counter current distribution with methyl isobutyl ketone it was possible to obtain quantitative data for Zn and Ga and semiquantitative data for In in a wide range of silicate rocks by spectrochemical analysis. By the use of extraction into cyclohexanone coupled with atomic absorption spectrometry it was possible to determine the concentration of Pb, Cd and Bi in the same suite of rocks. By the use of these techniques it wa spossible to obtain fresh abundance data for the above elements in the four standard rocks,G- 1, W- 1 CAAS syenite and CAAS sulphide. The cyclohexanone/hydrochloric acid extraction system provides a satisfactory enrichment technique for the spectrographic analysis of trace elements in material with a low Fe content. For material containing a high concentration of Fe, it is necessary to combine this technique with discontinuous counter current liquid-liquid extraction to separate the Fe before spectrographic analysis. However, under these conditions, certain elements can be determined by direct atomic absorption spectrometry of the cyclohexanone extract...|$|R
40|$|Using {{diffraction}} {{x-ray tubes}} (2 kW) as the excitation source in Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Analysis (TXRF) results in less photon flux on the sample {{compared to the}} <b>excitation</b> with rotating <b>anode</b> tubes (18 kW) or synchrotron radiation. An efficient way of increasing the photon flux on the sample is the insertion of x-ray optical elements in the primary beam path. In this experiment a mechanically bent W/C multilayer monochromator on a Sisubstrate of 0. 5 mm thickness was used, leading {{to an increase in}} intensity of a factor 2 to 3 (comparable to a 4 or 6 kW x-ray tube). A flat multilayer monochromator offers the advantage of a reduction in spectral background {{due to the fact that}} only monoenergetic photons arrive on the sample to cause scattered radiation but it leads to losses in intensity because of the sharp angular acceptance of the Bragg equation. The basic idea is that the bending curve approaches a logarithmic spiral having a constant angle between the radius of the spiral and the respective tangent at each point. This curvature was achieved by fixing one end of the 70 mm long multilayer mechanically tight. In a distance of 40 mm of the remaining length the bending was performed by applying a transversal force and a torque on this free end of the multilayer. This was done by one micrometer screw pressing against the rear side of the multilayer and by a second micrometer producing the torque by means of a simple lever acting at the free end of the multilayer. The result of bending is a large angular acceptance to fulfill the Bragg equation. The calculations leading to values for the mechanical force and torque involved to produce the curvature as well as the scheme of the experimental set-up and spectra comparing the effects of bending the multilayer with the straight multilayer are presented.
