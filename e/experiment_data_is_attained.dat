This study, {{which used}} {{a sample of}} 197, 707 {{students}} from 46 coun-tries that participated in the TIMSS 2003 project in eight grade, examined whether, for {{a large number of}} the TIMSS countries, trustworthy TIMSS measures of several dimensions of mathematics attitude can be developed.
