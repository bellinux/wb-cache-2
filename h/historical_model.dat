500|$|The Kingdom of the Picts (based in Fortriu by the 6th century) was {{the state}} that {{eventually}} became known as [...] "Alba" [...] or [...] "Scotland". The development of [...] "Pictland", according to the <b>historical</b> <b>model</b> developed by Peter Heather, was a natural response to Roman imperialism. Another view places emphasis on the Battle of Dun Nechtain, and the reign of Bridei m. Beli (671–693), with another period of consolidation in the reign of Óengus mac Fergusa (732–761).|$|E
500|$|Ziad J. Asali, who {{considers}} Zionism [...] "the heir—albeit illegitimate—of the Crusader movement," [...] goes further and writes that Prawer [...] "recognized {{the extent of}} the similarity in the individual and social experience of Crusaders and Zionists. Rather than studying the comparison and denying its validity, he chose to study the Crusader's experience {{as if it were a}} <b>historical</b> <b>model</b> which could be completely analyzed and dissected in order to benefit from its experience and avoid its mistakes." [...] To Zionist author Yoram Hazony, however, it is exactly because of Prawer's readiness to draw the analogy that he considers him a subverter of Zionism and a progenitor of post-Zionist thought. David Ohana, a professor of history at Ben Gurion University who rejects the Zionist-Crusader analogy, writes that the subject has now become a litmus test for clarifying one's views on Zionism, with post-Zionists freely making the analogy and sympathizers with the Zionist viewpoint rejecting it.|$|E

In December 2011, Russia finally joined the World Trade Organisation, allowing it a greater access to overseas markets. Some analysts estimate that WTO membership could bring the Russian economy a bounce of up to 3% annually. Russia ranks as the second-most corrupt country in Europe (after Ukraine), according to the Corruption Perceptions Index. The Norwegian-Russian Chamber of Commerce also states that [...] "orruption {{is one of the}} biggest problems both Russian and international companies have to deal with". Corruption in Russia is perceived as a significant problem impacting all aspects of life, including public administration, law enforcement, healthcare and education. The phenomenon of corruption is strongly established in the <b>historical</b> <b>model</b> of public governance in Russia and attributed to general weakness of rule of law in Russia. According to 2016 results of Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International, Russia ranked 131th place out of 176 countries with score 29.|$|E

2500|$|The United East India Company or the United East Indian Company, {{also known}} as the United East Indies Company ( [...] ; or Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie in modern spelling; VOC), {{referred}} to by the British as the Dutch East India Company, or sometimes known as the Dutch East Indies Company, was originally established as a chartered company in 1602, when the Dutch government granted it a 21-year monopoly on the Dutch spice trade. A pioneering early model of the multinational corporation in its modern sense, the company is also often considered to be the world's first true transnational corporation. In the early 1600s, the VOC became the first company in history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public. In other words, the VOC was the world's first formally listed public company, {{because it was the first}} corporation to be ever actually listed on an official (formal) stock exchange. As the first <b>historical</b> <b>model</b> of the quasi-fictional concept of the megacorporation, the VOC possessed quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies.|$|E
2500|$|Nike {{manufactured}} the kits for Paris Saint-Germain and Emirates Airlines {{continued to}} be the club's main sponsor. Nike have been PSG's official kit provider since 1989. Emirates have been a partner of the capital club since 2005 and the major shirt sponsor since January 2006. PSG were handed brand new home and away kits. The 2010-11 season marked PSG's 40th Anniversary and the shirt commemorated it by reverting to the club's original colours. The Stade Saint-Germain club played mainly in white until 1970, when they merged with Paris FC and combined the white of Saint-Germain-en-Laye with the red and blue colors of Paris. The new shirts presented a special badge commemorating PSG's 40th Anniversary. A golden embroidery encircled the shield with the traditional dates 1970 and 2010. The home shirt was mainly solid red, the original colour of the club. Across the body there was a watermark that red ‘PSG 1970'. The v-neck collar and the sleeves ends were navy. The away shirt had PSG's traditional colors and included graphic details directly inspired by {{the architecture of the}} Parc des Princes. It featured a navy blue base with a red vertical band in the middle and two thinner white zigzagging stripes around the band that recalled the architecture of the stadium's roof. The shirt also featured a stylized red trimming around the sleeves ends, the bottom of the shirt and the v-neck collar. The chosen colors and their alternation (blue-white-red-white-blue) honored the club's original graphic codes and dropped Daniel Hechter's <b>historical</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the short}} first section, the author {{points out that}} the {{investigation}} is crucial for the trial and because of this the position of the accused in investigation is of utmost importance. This also justifies the analysis of the accused's position in four <b>historical</b> <b>models</b> of criminal proceedings. The second section is concerned with the position of the accused in investigation of Roman law. The third section discusses the position of the accused in early feudal criminal proceedings when neither official nor private investigation in the contemporary form existed. The fourth section is devoted to the position of the accused in the inquisitorial procedure. The fifth section deals with the position of the accused in the investigation of a mixed type process of the early nineteenth century. In the brief conclusion the author highlights that there is no straight line evolution of the accused's position in investigation. The <b>historical</b> <b>models</b> rather show its raises and falls. The current position of the accused in investigation is certainly far more favourable {{than it was in the}} examined <b>historical</b> <b>models</b> of criminal proceedings...|$|R
