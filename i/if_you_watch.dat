500|$|Edmondson has {{discussed}} the surprised reaction he encountered upon assuming {{the role of}} Abra, stating: [...] "I'm sure people are surprised I'm in it, but I don't give a toss. I have always liked it. It's like any soap - <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> it, you get stuck in. I love working on it." [...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream". Commenting on his decision only ever to reprise the role of Abra on short term contracts, Edmondson has stated that: [...] "I don't think I could handle any longer. The regulars on the show work very, very hard. Basically I don't think I could do what they do and still be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum said West's action {{direction}} improved {{upon the}} previous film's direction by Stallone. Schwarzbaum considered {{that the film}} is [...] "excellent crap, fine junk, an exercise in campy movie nostalgia", commenting that while she did not consider the film artistic, she found it enjoyable. USA Todays Claudia Puig considered the shift from the serious tone of the original to an emphasis on humor to be entertaining. Puig said the film was [...] "corny, barbaric and sometimes visually murky. But humor and self-deprecating macho charm make this male pattern badness crowd-pleasing fun." [...] The New York Times Neil Genzlinger judged the film [...] "pleasantly-dumb fun <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> with the right mindset", but considered its dialog [...] "embarrassing" [...] (if intended seriously) and the plot formulaic. Rolling Stones Peter Travers gave the film two (out of four) stars, saying that the film was not even [...] "big, dumb fun" [...] and criticizing the script; it did not [...] "so much defy credulity as bludgeon it to death." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn. Kahn, who also directed the video for Brown and Ester Dean's [...] "Drop It Low", said that Brown played him tracks from his album on the set, and had {{a clear idea of}} what he wanted for the [...] "I Can Transform Ya" [...] video. Kahn said, [...] "...obviously, him going in there and dancing and turning into cars and trucks is right up my alley. His interests, in terms of kung fu and special effects and science fiction and all the boy-culture stuff, it falls directly in line with what I like. [...] "His talent is phenomenal. I'm still struggling to try and capture that talent on film, and it's a challenge. Here's a guy who can literally do anything. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> this thing, he's doing nunchuck tricks, and I'm a huge kung fu aficionado, and they're mind-blowing. I've never seen stuff like that before in kung fu flicks. I would say it's like a pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it. Everything dances onscreen. Everything has movement. Everything has a certain mechanical rhythm. He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical. It's sort of a hyper-intense version of the robot. Even the transformations go directly in line with the movements." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} that appeared in Cinefantastique, Argento noted that the film was intended as near-science fiction, taking place [...] "about five or more years in the future... Tenebrae occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people {{with the result that}} the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has happened to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants to remember... It isn't exactly my Blade Runner, of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> the film with this perspective in mind, it will become very apparent." [...] Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city, fifteen years in the future, and that the disaster the city's inhabitants were striving to forget was an atomic bomb blast. Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science-fictional concept [...] "isn't apparent at all" [...] and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film. The film critic and author Kim Newman countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia, Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen. Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento's intention did come across in these scenes, and Newman cites the on-screen use a videophone as an attempt by Argento to place Tenebrae in the near future.|$|E
500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows {{are going to be the}} same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Loeb {{compared}} the series' approach to telling stories over multiple seasons to [...] "the world of publishing, {{where you have}} the Frank Miller, you have the Brian Bendis run, you have the Ed Brubaker run. I was lucky enough to do Daredevil: Yellow. But they feel different. They have different elements to them. Same cast. In many cases, same tone. But a different adventure ... you can watch Daredevil season two without having seen Daredevil season one. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> each of them, it's like getting two different books.

2500|$|Following {{the arrival}} of Martin O'Neill {{in the summer of}} 2000, Larsson had his most {{successful}} season for Celtic. He forged a prolific partnership with new arrival Chris Sutton, as he scored 35 league goals in 38 league games to become SPL top goalscorer and to win the European Golden Shoe. The season saw Celtic win the domestic treble of the Scottish League Cup, Scottish Cup and the SPL. Larsson scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Kilmarnock at Hampden Park to win the Scottish League Cup, the first non-Scot to do so in a Cup Final in Scotland. [...] He also scored a brace in the Scottish Cup in a 3–0 win over Hibernian. Other highlights for Larsson included a double against Rangers in the 6–2 win at Parkhead early in the season, and scoring his 50th goal of the season against Rangers at Ibrox in a 3–0 victory {{towards the end of the}} season and finishing the season with a total of 53 goals in all competitions. He was again voted SPFA Players' Player of the Year, as well as SFWA Footballer of the Year. Rangers manager Dick Advocaat said: [...] "Larsson is one of the best strikers in Europe, maybe the world. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>watch</b> Batistuta, he is sometimes not seen for 90 minutes but he scores two goals.
