40|$|This book {{presents}} 20 peer-reviewed {{chapters on}} current aspects of derivatives markets and derivative pricing. The contributions, written by leading {{researchers in the}} field as well as experienced authors from the financial industry, present {{the state of the}} art in: • Modeling counterparty credit risk: credit valuation adjustment, <b>debit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment,</b> funding valuation adjustment, and wrong way risk. • Pricing and hedging in fixed-income markets and multi-curve interest-rate modeling. • Recent developments concerning contingent convertible bonds, the measuring of basis spreads, and the modeling of implied correlations. The recent financial crisis has cast tremendous doubts on the classical view on derivative pricing. Now, counterparty credit risk and liquidity issues are integral aspects of a prudent valuation procedure and the reference interest rates are represented by a multitude of curves according to their different periods and maturities. A panel discussion included in the book (featuring Damiano Brigo, Christian Fries, John Hull, and Daniel Sommer) on the foundations of modeling and pricing in the presence of counterparty credit risk provides intriguing insights on the debate. ...|$|E
30|$|The first CVA models {{focussed}} {{only on the}} unilateral case, {{meaning they}} were only {{taking into account the}} default risk of the counterparty. It was soon observed that this could create a price asymmetry, as each counterparty would propose a price that considered only the other party’s default risk and not its own–potentially scuppering any deal. Bilateral models were then introduced to address this issue. In a bilateral setting, symmetry is restored by calculating the CVA term for each counterparty as a cost and considering its algebraic opposite as a benefit for the other party. The total adjustment for a given counterparty is therefore the difference between the cost and the benefit. The benefit is known as <b>debit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (DVA)–a source of great controversy upon its introduction. The mechanism allows a bank to report a profit as a consequence of its deteriorating financial health, given that a higher default risk means a higher CVA for its counterparty and a symmetrically higher DVA for itself. This not only raises an eyebrow for its economic implications and propensity for perverse incentives; it also creates a challenge, since this quantity cannot be replicated, and therefore hedging and monetising it is not possible. One theoretical solution to hedge DVA is for a bank to take a long position in its own credit default swaps (CDS)–but that is not technically doable. A way around the problem some banks are said to employ (see Carver, 2012) is to take a long position on a basket of CDSs on correlated entities: a US bank could, for example, use CDSs on other US banks to hedge its own DVA.|$|E
40|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is a collateralized {{counterparty}} valuation adjusted pricing equation, which allows to price a deal while taking into account credit and <b>debit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> (CVA, DVA) along with margining and funding costs, all in a consistent way. Funding risk breaks the bilateral nature of the valuation formula. We find that the equation has a recursive form, making the introduction of a purely additive funding <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (FVA) difficult. Yet, we can cast the pricing equation into a set of iterative relationships which can be solved by means of standard least-square Monte Carlo techniques. As a consequence, we find that identifying funding costs and <b>debit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> is not tenable in general, contrary to what has been suggested in the literature in simple cases. The assumptions under which funding costs vanish are a very special case of the more general theory. We define a comprehensive framework that allows us to derive earlier results on funding or counterparty risk as a special case, although our framework is {{more than the sum of}} such special cases. We derive the general pricing equation by resorting to a risk-neutral approach where the new types of risks are included by modifying the payout cash flows. We consider realistic settings and include in our models the common market practices suggested by ISDA documentation, without assuming restrictive constraints on margining procedures and close-out netting rules. In particular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, and exogenous liquidity policies and hedging strategies. Re-hypothecation liquidity risk and close-out amount evaluation issues are also covered. Finally, relevant examples of non-trivial settings illustrate how to derive known facts about discounting curves from a robust general framework and without resorting to ad hoc hypotheses.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an innovative}} theoretical {{framework for the}} valuation and replication of derivative transactions between defaultable entities {{based on the principle}} of arbitrage freedom. Our framework extends the traditional formulations based on credit and <b>debit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> (CVA and DVA). Depending on how the default contingency is accounted for, we list a total of ten different structuring styles. These include bi-partite structures between a bank and a counterparty, tri-partite structures with one margin lender in addition, quadripartite structures with two margin lenders and, most importantly, configurations where all derivative transactions are cleared through a central counterparty (CCP). We compare the various structuring styles under a number of criteria including consistency from an accounting standpoint, counterparty risk hedgeability, numerical complexity, transaction portability upon default, induced behaviour and macro-economic impact of the implied wealth allocation...|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} paper we apply this {{framework}} to the concrete setup of a bank engaged in bilateral trade portfolios. In this context, the discounted expectation of losses due to the default of counterparties or of the bank itself are respectively known as CVA (credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment)</b> and DVA (debt <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment).</b> Counterparty risk mitigants include the variation margin (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the initial margin (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its variation margin during liquidation periods. The cost of funding cash collateral for the variation margin is known as funding <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated collateral posted as initial margin is the margin <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment). The contra-liability component of a unilateral CVA is dubbed CVACL.|$|R

40|$|The credit {{crisis and}} the ongoing European {{sovereign}} debt crisis have highlighted the native form of credit risk, namely the counterparty risk. The related credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA), debt <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (DVA), liquidity <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (LVA) and replacement cost (RC) issues, jointly referred to in this paper as total <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (TVA), have been thoroughly investigated in the theoretical papers [7] and [8]. The present work provides an executive summary and numerical companion to these papers, through which the TVA pricing problem {{can be reduced to}} Markovian pre-default TVA BSDEs. The first step consists in the counterparty clean valuation of a portfolio of contracts, which is the valuation in a hypothetical situation where the two parties would be risk-free and funded at a risk-free rate. In the second step, the TVA is obtained as the value of an option on the counterparty clean value process called contingent credit default swap (CCDS).

We derive the dynamics of the bilateral CVA in a general form with related jump martingales. We also introduce the Spread Value Adjustment (SVA) indicating the counterparty risk adjusted spread. Counterparty risky and the counterparty risk-free spread dynamics are derived and the dynamics of the SVA is found as a consequence.

40|$|Credit (CVA), Debit (DVA) and Funding <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustments</b> (FVA) are now {{familiar}} <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> made to {{the value}} of a portfolio of derivatives to account for credit risks and funding costs. However, recent changes in the regulatory regime and the increases in regulatory capital requirements has led many banks to include the cost of capital in derivative pricing. This paper formalises the addition of cost of capital by extending the Burgard-Kjaer (2013) semi-replication approach to CVA and FVA to include an addition capital term, Capital <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (KVA, i. e. Kapital <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustment</b> to distinguish from CVA.) The utilization of the capital for funding purposes is also considered. The use of the semi-replication approach means that the flexibility around the treatment of self-default is carried over into this analysis. The paper further considers the practical calculation of KVA with reference to the Basel II (BCBS- 128) and Basel III (BCBS- 189) capital regimes and their implementation via CRD IV. The paper also assesses how KVA may be hedged, given that any hedging transactions themselves lead to regulatory capital requirements and hence capital costs. Finally a number of numerical examples are presented to gauge the cost impact of KVA on vanilla derivative products. Comment: 25 pages, 6 table...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{counterparty risk}} for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) in presence of correlation between default of the counterparty and default of the CDS reference credit. Our approach is innovative in that, besides default correlation, which {{was taken into}} account in earlier approaches, we also model credit spread volatility. Stochastic intensity models are adopted for the default events, and defaults are connected through a copula function. We find that both default correlation and credit spread volatility have a relevant impact on the positive counterparty-risk credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> to be subtracted from the counterparty-risk free price. We analyze the pattern of such impacts as correlation and volatility change through some fundamental numerical examples, analyzing wrong-way risk in particular. Given the theoretical equivalence of the credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> with a contingent CDS, we are also proposing a methodology for valuation of contingent CDS on CDS.

30|$|Capital <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (KVA) {{accounts}} {{for the cost of}} equity capital a bank incurs when entering a derivative trade. To explain the concept, some would say KVA is affine to FVA, in the sense that, in both cases, the cost is associated with a source of funding. The difference is that KVA, rather than measuring the funding cost coming from debt, refers to the funding cost from equity. That is, as a new deal is agreed on, it generates a cost of borrowing from the shareholder. That cost is normally of comparable scale to that of other <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments,</b> which means its importance cannot be underestimated.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{introducing}} rigorous methods and formulas for bilateral counterparty risk credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA) on interest-rate portfolios. In doing so, we summarize the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including the default of the investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net present value of the contract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor and counterparty, and for correlation of each with the underlying risk factor, namely interest rates. We also analyze the often neglected impact of credit spread volatility. We include close-out netting rules in our examples, although other agreements, such as periodic margining or collateral posting, are left for future work.

5000|$|As above, (OTC) {{derivative}} pricing {{has relied}} on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate {{and the ability to}} perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment. Post the financial crisis of 2008, therefore, issues such as counterparty credit risk, funding costs and costs of capital are additionally considered, and a Credit <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustment,</b> or CVA—and potentially other <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments,</b> collectively xVA—is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.

3000|$|... {{where the}} clean price {{is given by}} a {{solution}} to a linear BSDE and the total <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (denoted as XVA) is determined by solving either a linear or a nonlinear BSDE. Of course, if all three terms appearing in (74) (that is: the full price, the clean price, and the total <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment)</b> are given by solutions to particular linear BSDEs, then {{it is possible to}} argue that decomposition (74) can be formally justified. However, if the <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (and thus also the full price) is given by a solution to a nonlinear BSDE, which is the case of our primary interest, then the two terms appearing in the right-hand side in (74) cannot be computed separately and subsequently aggregated to obtain the full price. This observation is valid, in general, {{despite the fact that the}} clean price is always computed through a solution to linear BSDE or, equivalently, a suitable version of the risk-neutral valuation formula and thus it enjoys the additivity property across several (uncollateralized and non-defaultable) deals. Therefore, in our opinion, the introduction of the concept of the clean price, although convenient in practice since it refers to the pre-crisis experience and facilitates calibration of commonly used models for the underlying securities, may further complicate the theoretical problem of searching for the full price of a contract and the corresponding hedging strategy when working in a nonlinear setup.|$|R
40|$|Pricing {{counterparty}} credit risk, although {{being in}} the focus {{for almost a decade}} by now, is far from being resolved. It is highly controversial if any <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> besides the basic CVA should be taken into account, and if so, for what purpose. Even today, the handling of CVA, DVA, FVA, [...] . differs between the regulatory, the accounting, and the economic point of view. Eventually, if an agreement is reached that CVA has to be taken into account, it remains unclear if CVA can be modeled linearly, or if nonlinear models need to be resorted to. Finally, industry practice and implementation differ in several aspects. Hence, a unified theory and treatment of FVA and alike is not yet tangible. The conference Challenges in Derivatives Markets, held at Technische Universitat¨ Munchen in March/April 2015, featured a panel discussion with panelists repre- ¨ senting different point of views: John Hull, who argues that FVA might not exist at all; in contrast to Christian Fries, who sees the need of all relevant costs to be covered within valuation but not within adjustments. Damiano Brigo emphasizes the nonlinearity of (most) <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> and is concerned about overlapping adjustments and double-counting. Finally, Daniel Sommer puts the exit price in the focus.

40|$|An uncollateralized swap hedged {{back-to-back}} by a CCP swap is used {{to introduce}} FVA. The open IR 01 of FVA, however, is {{a sure sign of}} risk not being fully hedged, a theoretical no-arbitrage pricing concern, and a bait to lure market risk capital, a practical business concern. By dynamically trading the CCP swap, with the liability-side counterparty provides counterparty exposure hedge and swap funding, we find that the uncollateralized swap can be fully replicated, leaving out no IR 01 leakage. The fair value of the swap is obtained by applying to swap's net cash flows a discount rate switching to counterparty's bond curve if the swap is a local asset or one's own curve if a liability, and the total <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the present value of cost of funding the risk-free price discounted at the same switching rate. FVA is redefined as a liquidity or funding basis component of total <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment,</b> coherent with CVA, the default risk component. A Longstaff-Schwartz style least-square regression and simulation is introduced to compute the recursive fair value and adjustments.

30|$|We {{stress that}} (76) {{is true for}} any choice for a proxy α for the risk-free {{interest}} rate, which further supports {{the view that the}} clean price is an abstract concept dissociated from the actual trading and the total <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> is a necessary mechanism needed to bring it back to reality. More importantly, terms appearing in the right-hand side in (76) are intertwined so that various <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> cannot be computed without the prior knowledge of the hedging strategy for the full contract. We thus conclude that the additivity and separation of adjustments, which is visibly suggested by the shape of equality (76), is in fact illusory, unless the underlying trading model has fully linear features so {{that it is possible to}} use the theory of linear BSDEs in order to justify separation. Obviously, this does not mean that separation cannot hold in some models with certain nonlinear features but this should be an exceptional situation, rather than the rule.|$|R
