The shake <b>flask</b> <b>method</b> was used for extremely hydrophilic or hydrophobic compounds with a Kpart values greater than 100 and less than 0. 01. For other ligands which possess moderate lipophilicity (Kpart values between 0. 01 - 100) the filter probe method was used. Also the partition coefficient of four ligands with moderate lipophilicity was determined by shake <b>flask</b> <b>method</b> in order to check comparability of these two methods. While the shake <b>flask</b> <b>method</b> was able to determine either extremely hydrophilic or hydrophobic compounds efficiently, the filter probe method was unable to measure such Kpart values.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Trace {{concentrations}} of iron oxide minerals in carbonate sediments can preserve fine details about Earth processes, from high-resolution {{recordings of the}} Earth’s ancient magnetic field to microscopic remnants of extraterrestrial impacts. This paper presents a novel <b>flask</b> extraction <b>method</b> which uses a neodymium magnet and an orbital shaker for simple and efficient separation of magnetic minerals from carbonate sediments. A mineral assemblage of magnetic standards (titanomagnetite, magnetite, goethite, and hematite) combined with other mineral standards (kaolinite, quartz, and nanoscale TiO 2) was subjected to the extraction procedure and compared to a natural speleothem sample. Exposure of the magnetic standards to a mildly acidic acetate buffer (pH, 4) did not cause physical or chemical alteration. The strongly magnetic minerals were reproducibly extracted, with greater than 90 % efficiency (by mass), from mixtures of the mineral standards. XRD and low-temperature magnetic characterization demonstrated phase purity of the extracts. Quantitative comparison with two commonly used literature methods showed that the <b>flask</b> extraction <b>method</b> was more reproducible and efficient. The addition of surfactant (Na(PO 3) 6) did not significantly improve extraction efficiency. Sequential dissolution and flask extraction of a simulated speleothem containing magnetic particles resulted in consistent extraction efficiencies for samples containing large (. 1 mm) strongly magnetic grains, but a reduction in efficiency was observed for smaller (, 1 mm) grain sizes. No method successfully extracted the weakly magnetic goethite and hematite. However, unprecedented, representative characterization of these minerals wa...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Previously, {{development}} of novel brain radiotracers has largely relied on simple screening tools. Improved selection methods {{at the early}} stages of radiotracer discovery and an increased understanding of the relationships between in vitro physicochemical and in vivo radiotracer properties are needed. We investigated if high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methodologies could provide criteria for lead candidate selection by comparing HPLC measurements with radiotracer properties in humans. Methods Ten molecules, previously used as radiotracers in humans, were analysed to obtain the following measures: partition coefficient (Log P); permeability (Pm); percentage of plasma protein binding (%PPB); and membrane partition coefficient (Km). Relationships between brain entry measurements (Log P, Pm and %PPB) and in vivo brain percentage injected dose (%ID); and Km and specific binding in vivo (BPND) were investigated. Log P values obtained using in silico packages and <b>flask</b> <b>methods</b> were compared with Log P values obtained using HPLC. Results The modelled associations with %ID were stronger for %PPB (r 2 = 0. 65) and Pm (r 2 = 0. 77) than for Log P (r 2 = 0. 47) while 86 % of BPND variance was explained by Km. Log P values were variable dependant on the methodology used. Conclusions Log P should not be relied upon as a predictor of blood-brain barrier penetration during brain radiotracer discovery. HPLC measurements of permeability, %PPB and membrane interactions may be potentially useful in predicting in vivo performance and hence allow evaluation and ranking of compound libraries for the selection of lead radiotracer candidates at early stages of radiotracer discover...|$|R

CO 2 /S molar ratios observed at DYK ranged from 3 - 17, similar ratios were observed using a Multi-GAS sensor box of 8 - 16. SO 2 at GZP was low, higher concentrations were observed at DYK where SO 2 /H 2 S ratios were close to 1 for both methods. A lower CO 2 /H 2 S ratio was measured via Giggenbach flask sampling (7. 2) than was found in the plume using the gas sensor at GZP (9. 2). This may reflect rapid oxidation of H 2 S as it mixes with background air. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) levels were observed in the fumarole gases using a portable mercury spectrometer. These are the first such measurements of mercury at Tatun. Mean GEM concentrations in the fumarole plumes were ∼ 20  ng m- 3, with much higher concentrations observed close to the ground (mean [GEM] 130 and 290  ng m- 3 at DYK and GZP, respectively). The GEM in the fumarole plume was elevated above concentrations in industrial/urban air in northern Taiwan and the increase in GEM observed when the instrument was lowered suggests high levels of mercury are present in the surrounding ground surface. The GEM/CO 2 (10 - 8) and GEM/S (10 - 6) ratios observed in the fumarole gases were comparable to those observed at other low-temperature fumaroles.
