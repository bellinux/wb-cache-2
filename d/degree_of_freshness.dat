40|$|Several {{real-time}} {{delay-sensitive applications}} pose varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness</b> {{demands on the}} requested content. The performance of cache replacement policies that are agnostic to these demands {{is likely to be}} sub-optimal. Motivated by this concern, in this paper, we study caching policies under a request arrival process which incorporates user freshness demands. We consider the performance metric to be the steady-state cache hit probability. We first provide a universal upper bound on the performance of any caching policy. We then analytically obtain the content-wise hit-rates for the Least Popular (LP) policy and provide sufficient conditions for the asymptotic optimality of cache performance under this policy. Next, we obtain an accurate approximation for the LRU hit-rates in the regime of large content population. To this end, we map the characteristic time of a content in the LRU policy to the classical Coupon Collector's Problem and show that it sharply concentrates around its mean. Further, we develop modified versions of these policies which eject cache redundancies present in the form of stale contents. Finally, we propose a new policy which outperforms the above policies by explicitly using <b>freshness</b> specifications <b>of</b> user requests to prioritize among the cached contents. We corroborate our analytical insights with extensive simulations...|$|R

60|$|There {{are persons}} who hold this long, gay, shabby, spotty perspective, in which, with its immense field of {{confused}} reflection, the houses have infinite variety, the dullest expanse in Venice. It was not dull, we imagine, for Lord Byron, {{who lived in}} the midmost of the three Mocenigo palaces, where the writing-table is still shown at which he gave the rein to his passions. For other observers it is sufficiently enlivened by so delightful a creation as the Palazzo Loredan, once a masterpiece and at present the Municipio, not to speak of a variety of other immemorial bits whose beauty still has a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness.</b> Some of the most touching relics of early Venice are here--for it was here she precariously clustered--peeping out of a submersion more pitiless than the sea. As we approach the Rialto indeed the picture falls off and a comparative commonness suffuses it. There is a wide paved walk {{on either side of the}} Canal, on which the waterman--and who in Venice is not a waterman?--is prone to seek repose. I speak of the summer days--it is the summer Venice that is the visible Venice. The big tarry barges are drawn up at the fondamenta, and the bare-legged boatmen, in faded blue cotton, lie asleep on the hot stones. If there were no colour anywhere else there would be enough in their tanned personalities. Half the low doorways open into the warm interior of waterside drinking-shops, and here and there, on the quay, beneath the bush that overhangs the door, there are rickety tables and chairs. Where in Venice is there not the amusement of character and of detail? The tone in this part is very vivid, and is largely that of the brown plebeian faces looking out of the patchy miscellaneous houses--the faces of fat undressed women and of other simple folk who are not aware that they enjoy, from balconies once doubtless patrician, a view the knowing ones of the earth come thousands of miles to envy them. The effect is enhanced by the tattered clothes hung to dry in the windows, by the sun-faded rags that flutter from the polished balustrades-- these are ivory-smooth with time; and the whole scene profits by the general law that renders decadence and ruin in Venice more brilliant than any prosperity. Decay is in this extraordinary place golden in tint and misery couleur de rose. The gondolas of the correct people are unmitigated sable, but the poor market-boats from the islands are kaleidoscopic.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rather}} a {{troublesome}} matter {{to get the}} cow and calf up the mountain. The first did not see enough that was attractive in naked rocks, to induce her to mount {{in the best of}} humours. She drank freely, however, at the brook, appearing to relish its waters particularly well. At length the plan was adopted of carrying the calf up a good distance, the cries of the little thing inducing its mother immediately to follow. In this way both were got up into Eden, in the course of an hour. And well did the poor cow vindicate the name, when she got a look at the broad glades of the sweetest grasses, that were stretched before her. So strongly was her imagination struck with the view--for we suppose that some cows have even more imagination than many men--that she actually kicked up her heels, and away she went, head down and tail erect, scampering athwart the sward like a colt. It was not long, however, before she began to graze, the voyage having been made on a somewhat short allowance of both food and water. If there ever was a happy animal, it was that cow! Her troubles were all over. Sea-sickness, dry food, short allowances of water, narrow lodgings, and hard beds, were all, doubtless, forgotten, as she roamed at pleasure over boundless fields, on which the grass was perennial, seeming never to be longer or shorter than was necessary to give a good bite; and among which numberless rills of the purest waters were sparkling like crystal. The great difficulty in possessing a dairy, in a warm climate, is the want of pasture, the droughts usually being so long in the summer months. At Vulcan's Peak, however, and indeed in all of that fine region, it rained occasionally, throughout the year; more in winter than in summer, and that was the sole distinction in the seasons, after allowing for a trifling change in the temperature. These peculiarities appear to have been owing to the direction of the prevalent winds, which not only brought frequent showers, but which preserved a reasonable <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness</b> in the atmosphere. Within the crater, Mark had often found the beat oppressive, even in the shade; but, without, scarcely ever, provided his body was not directly exposed to the sun's rays. Nor was the difference in the temperature between the Reef and the Peak, as marked as might have been expected from the great elevation of the last. This was owing to the circumstance that the sea air, and that usually in swift motion, entered so intimately into the composition of the atmosphere down on that low range of rocks, imparting its customary freshness to everything it passed over.|$|E

An excessive refresh allows a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> content <b>freshness</b> at a greater cost of system resource.

To address the freshness-cost problem, we formulate the refresh scheduling problem with a generic cost model and use this cost model to determine an optimal refresh frequency that gives the best tradeoff between refresh cost and content freshness. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal refresh frequency under the assumptions that the arrival of content update is Poisson and the age-related cost monotonically increases with decreasing freshness. In addition, we provide an analytic comparison of system performance under fixed refresh scheduling and random refresh scheduling, showing that with the same average refresh frequency two refresh schedulings are mathematically equivalent {{in terms of the}} long-run average cost...|$|R

60|$|The {{brilliant}} illumination within {{seemed to}} press upon {{his eyes with}} palpable force after the pale scattered lights and broad shadows of the piazza, {{and for the first}} minute or two he could see nothing distinctly. That yellow splendour was in itself something supernatural and heavenly to many of the peasant-women, for whom half the sky was hidden by mountains, and who went to bed in the twilight; and the uninterrupted chant from the choir was repose to the ear after the hellish hubbub of the crowd outside. Gradually the scene became clearer, though still there was a thin yellow haze from incense mingling with the breath of the multitude. In a chapel on the left-hand of the nave, wreathed with silver lamps, was seen unveiled the miraculous fresco of the Annunciation, which, in Tito's oblique view of it from the right-hand side of the nave, seemed dark with the excess of light around it. The whole area of the great church was filled with peasant-women, some kneeling, some standing; the coarse bronzed skins, and the dingy clothing of the rougher dwellers on the mountains, contrasting with the softer-lined faces and white or red head-drapery of the well-to-do dwellers in the valley, who were scattered in irregular groups. And spreading high and far over the walls and ceiling there was another multitude, also pressing close against each other, that they might be nearer the potent Virgin. It was the crowd of votive waxen images, the effigies of great personages, clothed in their habit as they lived: Florentines of high name in their black silk lucco, as when they sat in council; popes, emperors, kings, cardinals, and famous condottieri with plumed morion seated on their chargers; all notable strangers who passed through Florence or had aught to do with its affairs--Mohammedans, even, in well-tolerated companionship with Christian cavaliers; some of them with faces blackened and robes tattered by the corroding breath of centuries, others fresh and bright in new red mantle or steel corselet, the exact doubles of the living. And wedged in with all these were detached arms, legs, and other members, with only here and there a gap where some image had been removed for public disgrace, or had fallen ominously, as Lorenzo's had done six months before. It was a perfect resurrection-swarm of remote mortals and fragments of mortals, reflecting, in their varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness,</b> the sombre dinginess and sprinkled brightness of the crowd below.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to analyse by sensory {{as well as by}} physico-chemical methods if and to what extent seasonal differences can be detected until the end of shelf life (first appearance of spoilage notes) of the ice-stored rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was reached. The object of this study were 400 gutted rainbow trouts of which one-hundred (100) fish were tested per each of the 4 seasons of the year during the time period from November 2005 to September 2006. Trout were stored in melting ice and were sampled, evaluated and rated every two (2) or three (3) days for their sensory characteristics by means of a quality grading scheme assessing degrees of freshness by use of the Quality-Index-Method (QIMorginal and QIMmodified) and the sensory investigation of profiles (“SPP”) of cooked fillet samples until the first occurrence of spoilage happened. Within the scope of this work, it was also investigated to what extent the linear approximation of the quality index (QI) towards the progressing storage period can be optimized by applying a multivariate combination of the QI with additional parameters. In addition to the SPP-indices (total index, odour-, taste-, texture-index), the physical-chemical parameters pH-value, Fishtester value, and cook loss were measured. Within the sensory evaluation, the attribute “fresh taste” was of special importance being the essential criterion for the definition of the rejection threshold of the fish. The following conclusion can be drawn due to seasonal effects by assessing the degree of freshness: 1. 	Rejection threshold (end of shelf life) of the fish for specific seasons was exceeded at different days of iced storage: on day 14 in autumn, in winter, spring and in summer on day 16. The parameter season did not significantly influence the shelf life of rainbow trout. 2. 	Although QIoriginal and QImodified varied to some extent to seasonal influence, they did not result in essential grading differences when assessing the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness.</b> Seasonal differences could only be shown at a few sampling days, they were, however, not clearly persistent during whole storage periods. 3. 	A closer examination of QImodified as the total average showed that the fish examined through winter received the best rating throughout the whole storage period. Fish examined in spring, summer and autumn showed QI-values inferior to winter fish. However, when assessing with the QIoriginal, it was the fish examined during summer- and winter season, which generally and also as a function of time obtained the better QI-values. In direct comparison between fish examined during summer and winter, it was the “summer” fish that received the better average value for <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness.</b> Independently of the version of the Quality-Index-Method (“QIM”) applied, fish examined during spring and winter received inferior scores for freshness. 4. 	Fish examined during winter received superior scores using QIM and also similarly favourable scores with the SPP texture index. Within the scope of this evaluation, fish examined during spring were equal to fish examined during winter. Yet, {{on the basis of the}} QIM results, fish examined during spring and winter received the least scores for “degree of freshness”. The prominent position of fish examined during summer which was identified with the QIMoriginal, corresponds well with the SPP-taste-index. The SPP total index as well as the SPP odour index remained unaffected by sensitivity irrespectively of seasonal changes. 5. 	According to both measuring techniques, QIM and SPP, fish examined during winter and summer received top scores for <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness.</b> The test results obtained from QIM and SPP scored a moderate dimension only as to seasonal related conformity, though there were significant seasonal differences in the weighed average value to the rating of <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness</b> throughout the whole storage period. These differences were evident only on a few days and not later in a consecutive order amongst the four seasons. However, on closer inspection of the separate days of storage, it could be shown that the average value differences were replicated merely on some selective days. The rating results of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness</b> presented only minor seasonal differences among each other and seasonal convergences respectively. At the beginning of the storage period, the rating results of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness</b> showed only a slight scattering and from day 9 and day 11, respectively, the scattering (range) of the values increased. 6. 	The test results presented were more reliable when applying QIM, as there occurred contradictory information between the SPP-indices, which showed between SPP texture and SPP taste when evaluating the fish assessed during winter, spring and summer. Moreover, there appeared to be seasonal inconsistencies and irregularities with increasing storage time with the SPP-indices. 7. 	QIM, which has been used in this thesis, showed always a linear approximation of the quality index with the storage time of the fish irregardless of any selective deviations. This approximation allows for a more certain predictability of the fish freshness and remaining shelf life (in days in ice) when ice-stored. The linear approximation of the quality index can be optimized by adding the SPP-item “fresh taste” and the Fishtester value to the QIM scores. The predictability of the SPP-indices proves to be extremely low and therefore unqualified as a method used alone without additional measurements, as the indices are clearly quite unsystematic and variable...|$|E

Then four supervised classifiers, namely multilayer perceptron, learning vector quantization, probabilistic neural network and radial basis function network, were used to classify the samples into the three observed states <b>of</b> <b>freshness.</b> A comparative evaluation of the classifiers was conducted for this application. The best results suggest that we are able to predict egg <b>freshness</b> into one <b>of</b> three states with up to 95...|$|R

40|$|In case of fish, a {{value of}} {{hydrogen}} ion concentration in a muscle or a gastric juice is a guide to know the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness</b> of the fish. Actually we have already reported in {{the first volume of}} the bulletin of the Faculty of Fisheries Nagasaki University that the desired effect was obtained to some extent by applying this theory. How do we find about shell-fishes, creatures or lower order? According to the result of experiment with pearl-oyster, a degree of change of these values of hydrogen ion concentration is slow to a high degree, in comparison with a fish this slowness must rather be a peculiarity of a shellfish. 1. アコヤ貝が海水中で棲息して居る時の貝柱の示すpH価は 5. 8 ～ 6. 8 (春,秋) で海水から揚げると極めて徐々に酸性に移行する. 2. 分泌粘液のpH価は 5. 6 ～ 6. 2 (春,秋) であるが海水から貝を揚げるとアルカリの方に移行する. 9. 胃液の示すpH価は 5. 4 ～ 6. 0 (春,秋) であるが海水から揚げるとアルカリの方に移行する...|$|E
40|$|The quality {{changes of}} cultured sea bream (Sparus aurata) stored in ice {{for a period}} of up to 23 days were {{determined}} by K and related values, sensory assessment and texture by texturometer. Sensory schemes, based on the Tasmanian Food Research Unit (TFRU) scheme for raw fish and on the Torry scheme for cooked fish were modified to be appropriate for whole cultured sea bream, according to the trained panellists' perceptions, during the storage period in ice. The TFRU sensory score of fish showed good agreement with K value and texture results throughout the storage period. The limit for acceptability of cultured sea bream stored in ice was about 17 - 18 days. Generally, K, K(i) and G values had good correlation with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness</b> and can be used as freshness indicators. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Electronic nose' {{applications}} {{have been}} increasing in number in recent years. The reliability of these applications is mainly {{based on the}} selectivity properties of the sensors composing the array and on the stability of their characteristics. In this paper an electronic nose based on metalloporphyrins-coated quartz microbalance sensors is described. Due {{to the nature of}} the chosen metals, the sensors are particularly suitable to classify environments in which compounds containing donor atoms, such as mines, alcohols and sulphides, play a key role. The aroma of fish during storage is one of these environments. The array has been applied both for classification and for identification of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freshness</b> of stored cod fish. Data on the recognition of storage days and continuous short time monitoring are reported and discussed. Results of the electronic nose response are displayed by a method that is based on the parametrization of the input temporal evolution and allows an adequate representation of the evolving chemical environment...|$|E
