6000|$|... 1549. An {{arrangement}} {{was made for}} discharge between two balls (1485.) (fig. 129.) but, in place of connecting the inducteous ball directly with the discharging train, it was put in communication with the <b>inside</b> <b>coating</b> of a Leyden jar, and the discharging train with the outside coating. Then working the machine, {{it was found that}} whenever sonorous and luminous discharge occurred at the balls A B, the jar became charged; but that when these did not occur, the jar acquired no charge: and such was the case when small rounded terminations were used in place of the balls, and also in whatever manner they were arranged. Under these circumstances, therefore, discharge even between the air and conductors was always luminous.|$|E

After experience with several materials for its construction, the American Petroleum Institute (API) standardized the use of two materials or compositions for this part: carbon steel and brass, both with an <b>inside</b> <b>coating</b> of chrome.

Although the capacitance is small, around 500 pF, due to the low anode current it is sufficient to act as a filter capacitor.|$|E

Annealing {{as a general}} post-treatment was used to {{enhance the quality of}} the Al 2 O 3 coatings. The optical properties of the films were analyzed from the transmission spectra of the samples. The composition of the samples before and after annealing were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). According to the analysis of the results, it can be found that the oxidation degree of the coatings increases after annealing in O- 2 <b>inside</b> <b>coating</b> chamber. The laser-induced damage thresholds of the Al 2 O 3 films can be increased after the annealing process. Finally, the damage morphologies of the Al 2 O 3 coatings were analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous {{hydrogenated}} {{diamond-like carbon}} films (a-C:H) {{are well known}} for their high hardness, high wear resistance and low friction coefficients. The incorporation of additional elements leads to considerable modifications of the coating properties. E. g. silicon containing a-C:H:Si coatings provide low friction coefficients and lower surface energies. Incorporation of Si and O (a-C:H:Si:O) leads to highly hydrophobic coatings with still lower surface energies (< 25 mN/m). Both types of modified coatings had anti-adhesive properties. Modified DLC coatings were prepared by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) processes, powered with radio frequency, bipolar pulsed DC voltage or by a linear micro wave plasma source in industrial scale coating machines. The different DLC modifications can be combined in a multilayer coating for optimization of properties. The developed modified DLC films with low surface energies and high wear resistance are promising for several technical applications, e. g. for forming or pressing tools or for reduction of fouling effects in heat exchangers. These coatings were used to realize an alternative approach for <b>inside</b> <b>coating</b> of pipes. After coating deposition on flat metal sheets followed a cold forming process to fabricate a pipe and a welding along the joint line to close the pipe...|$|E
40|$|Functional oxide {{coatings}} {{are essential}} components {{in a variety}} of today 2 Ì† 7 s technical products and developments, but often applications are limited by the low flexibility and the high cost of the vapor phase deposition techniques used at present. Wet chemical processes based on the sol-gel and nanoparticle approaches can provide desired alternatives for a large number of such applications. This is shown for the high temperature sol-gel processing and the low-temperature nanoparticle approach with a focus on transparent conducting oxides (TCO). The paper presents recent developments realized at the Institute for New Materials (INM) in the field of thin film deposition including the <b>inside</b> <b>coating</b> of cavities such as tubes in optical quality using a modified dip coating equipment as well as the coating of complex shaped substrates and the high-throughput coating of large area flat glasses using a spray technology. Moreover the use of functional crystalline nanoparticles allows now to apply thick coatings or patterns with elaborate functionalities on temperature sensitive substrates like plastics and pre-shaped glass parts by U-V-curing at low temperature. The concept is exemplified for transparent conducting ITO coatings...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to successfully deposit Titanium Ti- 6 Al- 4 V layers onto Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrate using two new commercially available Cold Spray processes such as Low Pressure Cold Spray (LPCS) and Pulsed Gas Dynamic Spray (PGDS). The second {{objective of}} this work is to develop a technique to repair Titanium parts since there is currently no repair technique commercially available. It is envisioned that commercial cold spray systems could be used to repair gashes on Titanium components. The examination of both feedstock powders and coatings were performed by different techniques such as optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Porosity, hardness, adhesion strength, flattening ratio, wipe test, fracture surface, wear test, XRD and chemical composition of the coatings using EDS have been evaluated. Cold spray has shown to be a promising technique for the deposition of heat sensitive particles such as titanium. LPCS and PGDS both produced high quality coatings. Low porosity, high hardness, adhesion strength over 40 MPa, metallurgical bonding, similar to bulk material wear rate, no oxide and nitride phases <b>inside</b> <b>coating</b> were measured...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructured {{metallic}} multilayers (NMMs) are {{well-known for}} their high strength in smaller bilayer thicknesses. Six Al/Ti (NMM) with different individual layer thickness were tested for their mechanical hardness using a nanoindentation tool. Individual layer thicknesses were chosen carefully {{to cover the}} whole confined layer slip (CLS) model. Nano-hardness had a reverse relation with the square root of individual layer thickness and reached a steady state at ~ 5 nm bilayer thickness. Decreasing the layer bilayer thickness from ~ 104 nm to ~ 5 nm, improved the mechanical hardness up to ~ 101 %. Residual stresses were measured using grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Effect of residual stress on atomic structure and dislocation propagation was then investigated by comparing the amount and type of stresses in both aluminum and titanium phases. Based on the gathered data from GIXRD scans tensile stress in Ti phases, and compressive stress in Al would increase the overall coherency of structure. Wear rate in coatings is highly dependent on design and architect of the structure. NMM coatings {{are known to have}} much better wear resistance compare to their monolithic constituent phases by introducing a reciprocal architect. In current study wear rate of two Al/Ti NMMs with individual layer thicknesses of ~ 2. 5 nm and ~ 30 nm were examined under normal loads of 30 ÂµN, 60 ÂµN, and 93 ÂµN. Wears strokes were performed in various cycles of 1, 2, 3, 4 5 and 10. Wear rates were then calculated by comparing the 3 D imaging of sample topology before and after tests. Nano-hardness of samples was measured pre and post each cycle of wear using a nanoindentation tool. The microstructure of samples below the worn surface was then characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), focus ion beam (FIB) and an optical profilometer. Orientation mapping was performed to analyze the microstructure of layers beneath the nano indents. TEM imaging from the cross section of worn samples indicated severely plastically deformed layer (SPDL) below the worn surface. Shear bands and twins are visible after wear and below the worn surface. Decreasing the layer thickness from 30 nm to 2. 5 nm resulted in ~ 5 timeâ€™s better wear resistance. Nanowear caused surface hardening which consequently increased nano hardness up to ~ 30 % in the sample with 2. 5 nm individual layer thickness. Increasing the interfaces density of NMMs will significantly improve the corrosion resistance of coating. Reciprocal layers and consequently interfaces will block the path of aggressive content toward the substrate. Corrosion rate evolution of Al/Ti multilayers was investigated through DC corrosion potentiodynamic test. Results seem to be very promising and demonstrate up to 30 times better corrosion resistance compared to conventional sputtered monolithic aluminum. Corrosion started in the form of pitting and then transformed to the localized galvanic corrosion. Decreasing the bilayer thickness from ~ 10. 4 nm to ~ 5 nm will decrease the corrosion current density (icorr) of ~ 5. 42 Ã— 10 - 7 (A/cm 2) to ~ 6. 11 Ã— 10 - 10 (A/cm 2). No sign of corrosion has been seen in the sample with ~ 2. 5 nm individual layer thickness. Further AFM and TEM analysis from surface and cross section of NMMs indicate that a more coherent layer by layer structure improves the corrosion rate. Interfaces have a significant role in blocking the pores and imperfections <b>inside</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|E
