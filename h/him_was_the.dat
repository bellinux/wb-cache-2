5|$|In parallel, {{he himself}} became a {{representative}} of literary and artistic Symbolism, and supposedly maintained contacts with authors such as Joris-Karl Huysmans, Maurice Maeterlinck, Octave Mirbeau, Jean Moréas, and Paul Verlaine.

5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duke Ferdinando {{encouraged}} Cosimo {{to go on}} a European tour {{to distract}} him from Marguerite Louise's renewed hostility. On 28 October 1667 he arrived in Tyrol, where he was entertained by his aunt, Anna de' Medici, Archduchess of Further Austria. He took a barge down the Rhine to Amsterdam, where he was well received by the art community, meeting painter Rembrandt van Rijn. From Amsterdam, he travelled to Hamburg, where awaiting <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Queen of Sweden. He reached Florence in May 1668.|$|E

5|$|On September 13, 2012, {{long time}} Tory MHA and former cabinet {{minister}} Tom Osborne {{announced he was}} leaving the PC Party to sit as an independent. He cited Dunderdale's leadership {{as the reason for}} his defection and said that the turning point for <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> debate over Bill 29. Osborne said that while he voted in favour of the new legislation he did not support it. On October 19, 2012, Dunderdale shuffled her cabinet and Justice Minister Felix Collins, who was responsible for Bill 29, was shuffled out of the Justice portfolio and became Minister of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs. Though the portfolio change was considered to be a demotion Dunderdale stated that Collins' handling of Bill 29 was not connected to his move. At the time of the cabinet shuffle Dunderdale also created the Office of Public Engagement, which will bring together different departments to aid in communications efforts. The new office will also be responsible for access to information.|$|E
5|$|Besides honors, memberships, and postings to prestigious {{organizations}} worldwide, Edward Said {{was awarded}} some twenty honorary university {{degrees in the}} course of his professional life as an academic, critic, and Man of Letters. Among the honors bestowed to <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Bowdoin Prize by Harvard University. He twice received the Lionel Trilling Book Award; the first occasion was the inaugural bestowing of said literary award in 1976, for Beginnings: Intention and Method (1974). He also received the Wellek Prize of the American Comparative Literature Association, and was awarded the inaugural Spinoza Lens Prize. In 2001, Said was awarded the Lannan Literary Award for Lifetime Achievement, and in 2002, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord. He was the first U.S. citizen to receive the Sultan Owais Prize (for Cultural & Scientific Achievements, 1996–1997). The autobiography Out of Place (1999) was bestowed three awards, the 1999 New Yorker Book Award for Non-Fiction; the 2000 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Non-Fiction; and the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award in Literature.|$|E
5|$|During an {{engagement}} early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused {{to help and}} Walpole carried {{one end of a}} stretcher and dragged the man to safety. For this he was awarded the Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of The Daily News, had successfully lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to borrowing deities from the Celestial Masters and the Shangqing School, the Lingbao School also developed its own gods. The supreme god of Lingbao Daoists {{is known as}} the Yuanshi Tianzun or the Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning, who played a similar role to the deified Laozi in the Celestial Masters. According to the scriptures, this god went through a series of kalpa cycles that were given names similar to dynastic names, until emerging {{at the beginning of the}} Kaihuang period. The next most important god was Laojun, the deified form of Laozi, who was the Celestial Worthy's chief disciple. Below these two main gods in the celestial hierarchy were those deities associated with the Southern Palace, where spirits went after death to prepare for rebirth. The head of this group of gods was known as the Perfected of the Southern Extremities. Beneath <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Director of the Equerry, who was in charge of the life records of the spirits, and Lord Han, who controlled Fengdu, the city of the dead. Below these principal gods in the Lingbao hierarchy were other deities such as the Five Old Men, the Dragon Kings, and the Demon Kings.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions {{and other}} {{literary}} records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected {{the crown prince}} based on heredity. The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister (Mahasandhivigrahi) whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called Panchamahashabdas. Under <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> commander (Dandanayaka), the foreign minister (Mahakshapataladhikrita) and a prime minister (Mahamatya or Purnamathya), {{all of whom were}} usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier. A Mahasamantha was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science (Rajneeti) and possessed military training. There were cases where women supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of Amoghavarsha I, administered Edathore Vishaya.|$|E
5|$|Maricello's super soft tyres {{began to}} degrade quickly, {{allowing}} Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer {{over the next}} two laps. Rossi caught Maricello by the start of the sixth lap but the latter remained on the circuit. King, who was delayed by a long queue of vehicles behind <b>him,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and rejoined the track in clear air. On lap eight, Matsushita collided heavily with de Jong at the Novelle chicane, causing him to retire and was later penalised with a three-place grid penalty for the sprint race after the stewards judged him to have missed the corner's braking point. De Jong was able to continue. Marciello made his pit stop for new tyres on the next lap, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to move into the first and second places and both drivers built an advantage over the remainder of the field. Maricello rejoined in eleventh, behind Pic, who made his pit stop one lap later. Sørensen was placed into the Casino Hairpin barriers at the apex of the corner by Nato on lap ten, ending his race. Nato was issued with a ten-second time penalty, but no safety car was deployed. Marvelov retired from the race in the pit lane with damage to his car after running off the circuit, and drove over a kerb exiting the left-hand Louis Chiron corner, causing him to become airborne, and hit the barriers lining the track.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps Szigeti's most {{fruitful}} musical partnership {{was with}} his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, {{was one of a}} pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience. Szigeti came to his friend's aid by securing donations from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for Bartók's medical treatment, and then, together with conductor and compatriot Fritz Reiner, persuaded Serge Koussevitzky to commission from Bartók what eventually became his much-beloved Concerto for Orchestra. The work's success brought Bartók some measure of financial security and provided him with a much-needed emotional boost.|$|E
