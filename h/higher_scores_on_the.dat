Methods—Data from the 2001 – 2007 National Health Interview Survey identified the emotional and behavioral problems, characteristics, conditions, and service use of children aged 4 – 17 years. Results—Approximately 7 % of children had either <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brief SDQ or serious overall difficulties, with 2 % having only <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brief SDQ, 3 % having only serious overall difficulties, and 2 % having both <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brief SDQ and serious overall difficulties.

25|$|Molecular genetic {{research}} into alexithymia remains minimal, but promising candidates {{have been identified}} from studies examining connections between certain genes and alexithymia among those with psychiatric conditions {{as well as the}} general population. A study recruiting a test population of Japanese males found <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Alexithymia Scale among those with the 5-HTTLPR homozygous long (L) allele. The 5-HTTLPR region on the serotonin transporter gene influences the transcription of the seretonin transporter that removes serotonin from the synaptic cleft, and is well studied for its association with numerous psychiatric disorders. Another study examining the 5-HT1A receptor, a receptor that binds serotonin, found higher levels of alexithymia among those with the G allele of the Rs6295 polymorphism within the HTR1A gene. Also, a study examining alexithymia in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder found higher alexithymia levels associated with the Val/Val allele of the Rs4680 polymorphism in the gene that encodes Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine. These links are tentative, and further research will be needed to clarify how these genes relate to the neurological anomalies found in the brains of people with alexithymia.|$|E
