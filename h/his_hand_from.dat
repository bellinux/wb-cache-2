5|$|The {{institution}} of marriage is stated to have come into existence after he married {{to set an example}} for other humans to follow. His life is also credited by Jains with starting the {{institution of}} charity (daana) from layperson to mendicants, when he received surgarcane juice in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> king Sreyamsa, to break his fast. This is accepted in the Jain tradition as what started the tradition of alms giving in its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
5|$|The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something {{in the direction of}} the cameraman, then waves and shouts {{in the direction of the}} Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the months}} and years that followed, {{commentators}} questioned the accuracy of France2's report. The Israel Defense Forces accepted responsibility for the shooting at first but later retracted. French journalists who saw the raw footage confirmed that France2 had cut a final few seconds in which Muhammad appeared to lift <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his face; they acknowledged that he had died, but said the footage alone did not show it. France2's news editor said in 2005 {{that no one could}} be sure who fired the shots. Other commentators, particularly Philippe Karsenty, a French media commentator, went further, alleging that the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters; France 2 sued him for libel and in 2013 he was fined €7,000 by the Court of Appeal of Paris. In May that year an Israeli government report supported Karsenty's view. Jamal al-Durrah and Charles Enderlin rejected its conclusion and called for an independent international investigation.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the majority}} were completed by Jan, from an overall design by Hubert, who probably oversaw the construction {{of most of the}} frames. A number of difficulties present themselves, not least that there is no surviving work confidently attributed to Hubert, and it is thus impossible to detect his style. Instead, art historians have resorted to comparing individual passages to known works by Jan, looking for stylistic differences that might indicate the work of another hand. Advances in Dendrochronology have for example established that parts of the wing panels were felled around 1421. Allowing a seasoning time of at least 10 years, we must assume a completion date well after Hubert's death in 1426, thus ruling out <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> large portions of the wings.|$|E

After two years, The Garry Moore Show returned to the CBS prime-time lineup in the fall of 1966. It was canceled mid-season because of low ratings against NBC's highly rated western Bonanza.|$|E
500|$|When Leicestershire {{appointed}} Ewart Astill {{as their}} captain for the 1935 season, {{he became the}} first professional [...] to lead any county on a regular basis since the 19th century. Yorkshire did not have a professional skipper in the 20th century until Vic Wilson in 1960. Alan Gibson believed that Yorkshire erred in rejecting Sutcliffe. He further argued that, if appointed, Sutcliffe would have been made England Test captain in 1931 instead of Douglas Jardine and that he would have done a good job for several years. Sutcliffe later regretted withdrawing his acceptance. In later years, he told Bill Bowes that Jack Hobbs, Sutcliffe's opening partner on the national side, should have been made England captain. According to Bowes, he said, [...] "Lord Hawke lifted professional cricket from there to there'... raising <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> knee to shoulder level. 'Professional cricketers lifted it to there,' he continued, raising his hand above his head, '—and even Lord Hawke wanted it back again.

[...] Richard made a strategic move {{to drop out of the}} challenge early and Rudy was eliminated after four hours in the hot sun when he inadvertently dropped <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> the idol the competitors had to keep their hands on. This left 23-year-old Kelly Wiglesworth the challenge victor as she voted Boesch out of the game. Despite his resentment about Hatch's move, Boesch still voted for Hatch at the final tribal council, who became the first Survivor winner.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of its}} plans, Lance Storm {{became the}} first WCW wrestler to appear on WWF programming, by making a run-in during a match on the May 28 episode of Raw Is War. Hugh Morrus made his WWF debut on the June [...] episode of Raw Is War by attacking Edge. At King of the Ring on June 24, then-WCW wrestler Booker T {{interfered}} during the triple threat main event match for the WWF Championship and almost cost Stone Cold Steve Austin the title. Additionally, Austin legitimately suffered fractured bones in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> the side slam he took from Booker into an announce table. The next night on Raw Is War, which was held in New York City's Madison Square Garden, a confrontation occurred between WCW owner Shane McMahon and WWF owner Vince McMahon. While Vince was in the ring, Booker T came from behind to deliver a scissor kick to Vince. The WWF roster ran to the ring to aid Vince, but Booker T and Shane McMahon escaped through the crowd. This incident marked the official start of the Invasion storyline; Raw Is War commentator Jim Ross announced, [...] "The battle lines have been drawn!".|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara cited [...] to {{show that}} Abraham walked righteously and {{followed}} the commandments. Rabbi Simlai taught that God communicated to Moses a total of 613 commandments — 365 negative commandments, corresponding {{to the number of}} days in the solar year, and 248 positive commandments, corresponding to the number of the parts in the human body. The Gemara taught that David reduced the number of precepts to eleven, as [...] says, [...] "Lord, who shall sojourn in Your Tabernacle? Who shall dwell in Your holy mountain? — He who (1) walks uprightly, and (2) works righteousness, and (3) speaks truth in his heart; who (4) has no slander upon his tongue, (5) nor does evil to his fellow, (6) nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor, (7) in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but (8) he honors them who fear the Lord, (9) he swears to his own hurt and changes not, (10) he puts not out his money on interest, (11) nor takes a bribe against the innocent." [...] Isaiah reduced them to six principles, as [...] says, [...] "He who (1) walks righteously, and (2) speaks uprightly, (3) he who despises the gain of oppressions, (4) who shakes <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> holding of bribes, (5) who stops his ear from hearing of blood, (6) and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil; he shall dwell on high." [...] The Gemara explained that [...] "he who walks righteously" [...] referred to Abraham, as [...] says, [...] "For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him." [...] Micah reduced the commandments to three principles, as [...] says, [...] "It has been told you, o man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of you: only (1) to do justly, and (2) to love mercy, and (3) to walk humbly before your God."

2500|$|The Gemara {{read the}} closing admonition of the haftarah, [...] ""to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God," [...] {{as one of}} several distillations of the {{principles}} underlying the Torah. [...] Rabbi Simlai taught that God communicated 613 precepts to Moses. [...] David reduced them to eleven principles, as [...] says, [...] "Lord, who shall sojourn in Your Tabernacle? [...] Who shall dwell in Your holy mountain? — He who [...] walks uprightly, and [...] works righteousness, and [...] speaks truth in his heart; who [...] has no slander upon his tongue, [...] nor does evil to his fellow, [...] nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor, [...] in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but [...] he honors them who fear the Lord, [...] he swears to his own hurt and changes not, [...] he puts not out his money on interest, [...] nor takes a bribe against the innocent."

[...] Micah reduced them to three principles, as [...] says, [...] "It has been told you, o man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of you: only [...] to do justly, and [...] to love mercy, and [...] to walk humbly before your God." [...] The Gemara interpreted [...] "to do justly" [...] to mean maintaining justice; [...] "to love mercy" [...] to mean rendering every kind office, and [...] "walking humbly before your God" [...] to mean walking in funeral and bridal processions. [...] And the Gemara concluded that if the Torah enjoins [...] "walking humbly" [...] in public matters, it is ever so much more requisite in matters that usually call for modesty. [...] Returning to the commandments of the Torah, Isaiah reduced them to two principles, as [...] says, [...] "Thus says the Lord, [...] Keep justice and [...] do righteousness."
