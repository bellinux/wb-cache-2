5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{production}} {{with the}} ISP <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than with electrolytic zinc plants, so several smelters operating this technology have closed in recent years. However, ISP furnaces {{have the advantage}} of being able to treat zinc concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can electrolytic zinc plants.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E
5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can {{spend as much time}} as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} other types of {{features}} which <b>are</b> <b>more</b> or less <b>expensive</b> to machine. Generally chamfers cost less to machine than radii on outer horizontal edges. 3D interpolation is used to create radii on edges that {{are not on the}} same plane which incur 10X the cost. [...] Undercuts <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> to machine. Features that require smaller tools, regardless of L:D ratio, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin may be {{recommended in}} addition to lactulose for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to neomycin or metronidazole. Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use, rifaximin is generally only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective. When rifaximin is added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately. Rifaximin <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than lactulose, but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although {{it is seen as}} a high caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups because it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> and larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E

40|$|Cormorants hunt both benthic (sedentary) and pelagic (motile) prey {{but it is}} {{not known}} if the energy costs of {{foraging}} on these prey differ. We used respirometry to measure the costs of diving in double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) foraging either for sedentary (fish pieces) or motile (juvenile salmon) prey in a deep dive tank. Short dives for sedentary prey <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than dives of similar duration for motile prey (e. g. 20 % higher for a 10  s dive) whereas the reverse was true for long dives (i. e. long dives for motile prey <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than for sedentary prey). Across dives of all durations, the foraging phase of the dive <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> when the birds hunted motile prey, presumably due to pursuit costs. The period of descent in all the dives undertaken appears to have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> when the birds foraged on sedentary prey, probably due to a higher swimming speed during this period...|$|R
