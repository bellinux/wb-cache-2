25|$|Both {{sections}} {{struck the}} sea bed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> to collapse entirely. The bow {{is by far}} the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down {{on top of each other}} and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.|$|R

50|$|The bow section {{remained}} {{stuck on}} the sand bank with huge seas washing over it. The bow section had the captain, Harry Kissing and fourteen of the crew all crouched in the Forecastle. The other sixteen members of the crew were in <b>the</b> drifting <b>stern</b> section. <b>The</b> next morning (21 November) the steamer Trent sighted <b>the</b> drifting <b>stern</b> section and lifted the 16 crewmen to safety. The Trent then steamed on to the bow section {{stuck on the}} sand bank. In <b>the</b> meantime <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> section had drifted North West and was spotted off Cromer. Henry Blogg, coxswain of the Cromer lifeboat H F Bailey, attending to <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> reported at 3.15 p.m. that the ship had been abandoned although at this time they were unaware that the ship was in two halves as <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> was creeping higher into the air. The Cromer lifeboat attended <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> section all that night warning shipping of the danger. Back at the bow section the Great Yarmouth coastguard had learned of the disaster at 9 p.m. and the Gorleston lifeboat had been called to assist. Trent had wirelessed a message to warn that it was to dangerous to approach <b>the</b> stricken <b>stern</b> and it made for Cromer to land the rescued men from <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> section.|$|R
50|$|Besides its eight torpedo tubes forward, this {{submarine}} {{class has}} four in <b>the</b> <b>stern,</b> which point rearward. All are for torpedoes of the French 550 mm diameter; while the forward tubes hold full-length torpedoes, <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> tubes only shortened ones.|$|R
50|$|When {{a vessel}} is moving backwards, her rudder {{and in the}} case of a submarine, her planes, {{function}} in the opposite manner than when she is moving forwards. <b>The</b> <b>stern</b> planesman failed to compensate for this phenomenon and continued to try to trim the boat as if they still were making headway. When <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> began to rise, he raised <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> planes, which would have depressed <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> if they had been moving forward. While making sternway, it had the opposite effect, increasing <b>the</b> down-angle. <b>The</b> <b>stern</b> continued to rise, more rapidly as the boat accelerated backwards. Before the problem could be corrected, Houston had attained a 70 degree down-angle and her screw broached the surface while still turning at a high rpm. The control team performed a partial emergency ballast tank blow and safely surfaced the boat, and the engineering team safely scrammed (emergency shutdown) the reactor plant to prevent damage.|$|R

40|$|Several {{decades after}} the {{development}} of acoustic stealth technology for ships, there remains an urgent necessity to reduce low frequency structural and acoustic response due to excitation from <b>the</b> <b>stern.</b> This paper reviews research into the coupled vibration and acoustic problems of <b>the</b> <b>sterns</b> of vessels. Attention is especially paid to three key aspects: the characteristics of propeller forces, the vibration-acoustic signatures of coupled propeller-shaft-hull systems, and vibration/noise controls. Therefore, the mapping relationships of vibration noise from <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> excitation and propeller-shaft-hull system is obtained, and the control approaches for low frequency vibration noise is presented. Thereafter, several suggestions are made for further research work in the testing technology of the unsteady force of propellers, the structural vibration induced by <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> bearing friction and the vibration control of propeller-shaft systems in the future...|$|R
5000|$|The Lake design, S-2, was a {{modified}} double hull type, with ballast tanks {{wrapped around the}} inner pressure hull. <b>The</b> <b>stern</b> ended in a flat [...] "shovel" [...] shape which gave <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> needed buoyancy. <b>The</b> rudder was mounted beneath <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> and <b>the</b> pivot structure also supported <b>the</b> <b>stern</b> diving planes. To gain surface buoyancy, the superstructure atop the boat was partially watertight. Sea trials showed that the bow tended to burrow into the waves so Lake added a buoyancy tank to the bow, which gave it a humped appearance. This boat suffered from poor maneuverability and was overcomplicated. It proved to be unreliable and was not well liked by its crew. The Navy did not choose it for mass production and no further boats were produced to this design.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> <b>Stern</b> Review added {{balanced}} growth equivalences (BGE) {{to the economic}} climate change research agenda. We first propose rigorous definitions of the BGE for multiple regions and under uncertainty. We show that {{the change in the}} BGE is independent of the assumed scenario of per capita income. For comparable welfare economic assumptions as <b>the</b> <b>Stern</b> Review, we calculate lower changes in BGE between a business as usual scenario and one without climate impacts with the model FUND than <b>the</b> <b>Stern</b> Review found with the model PAGE. We find that optimal mitigation policies give even lower changes in BGE and argue that those policy choices should be the focus of the research effort rather than total damage estimates. Sensitivity analyses show that <b>the</b> <b>Stern</b> Review chose parameters that imply high impact estimates. However, for regionally disaggregated welfare functions, we find changes in BGE that are orders of magnitude higher than the results from <b>the</b> <b>Stern</b> Review, both for total damage as for optimal policy analysis. With regional disaggregation and high risk aversion, fat tails and with that very high welfare losses emerge...|$|R
