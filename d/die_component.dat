40|$|The Cluster of Excellence "Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries" at the RWTH Aachen University, {{promoted}} and {{financed by}} the German Research Foundation (DFG) is pursuing the long-term goal of increasing the com-petitiveness of German production technology. Focus is {{on the development of}} cross-solutions for complicated tasks with an integrative approach. A major goal for production processes of the future is to create a synthesis of mass and individual production. The motivation behind this work lies in the reduction of production costs with a simultaneous increase of the current product range. For high pressure die casting in general, there is a one-to-one correlation between the die and casting. The time-consuming and costly design and manufacturing of die casting dies will be simplified, enabling rapid implementation of product variants. To achieve this, the methodology is composed of a sequence of three phases. During these phases, the focus is narrowed down from company perspective to die perspective, and finally, to <b>die</b> <b>component</b> perspective. By consecutively proceeding through the phases, one identifies the stage of the production process where modularisation is most beneficial, and categorises die components with respect to their modularisation potential. The final phase determines how a chosen component is turned into a module. This includes determining how many different variations of each module property are needed to be able to cover the desired product portfolio by simultaneously lowering the overall costs. The methodology provides a systematic approach for designing modular dies with which even individual customer requirements can be met...|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of microelectronic circuits, their scale of integration, and clock speed re quirements have been increasing steadily. All {{of these changes}} {{have the effect of}} increasing the power density of the micro-circuits. IC's with a power of several watts and area of over a square centimeter are quite common. Thus, there is more heat generated per device at <b>die,</b> <b>component,</b> and substrate-attach levels of electronic packaging. In order to maintain reliability of finished products, the junction temperature of the con stituent devices must be kept low. It has been demonstrated that thermal management can be one key to lowering the cost and increasing the performance life of microelectronic products. The cost effectiveness of lowering device temperature has been demonstrated to be dramatic in comparison to the cost of thermal management materials(l, 2). Proper thermal management of advanced microelectronic devices has to be addressed at all levels. One should address the problem from the basic level of die-attach, through com ponent attach, and eventually substrate-attach to thermal drains. Thermal management is almost invariably coupled with a thermally induced stress problem. The increase in temperature at the device level also means a larger fluctuation of tempera ture from the ambient. Each cycle of on-off for the device represents one thermal cycle. Stress induced failures due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch is much more acute for higher power devices. In this paper, we will also address the thermally induced stress on the microelectronic product at all levels of packaging with major emphasis on component and substrate levels. We will demonstrate various ways and examples of reducing or eliminating this stress, which is a major cause of device failures. One of the proven methods is through the use of low Tg epoxies with high thermal stability...|$|E

The result of an axisymmetric model shows that the friction between <b>die</b> <b>components</b> and the sample has a substantial effect on the material flow behavior. Although strain heterogeneity index (SHI) slightly decreases {{with an increase in}} friction, large portion of the sample experiences significant strain heterogeneity. Increasing the friction factor also localizes the strain heterogeneity effect in the backward section, and spread the effect in the forward section. Decreasing the friction in the FBRE process can reduce the amount of the strain heterogeneity in the product while decreases the required punch force substantially. Furthermore, an increase in gap thickness increases the deformation in the area close to the lower punch {{at the expense of the}} area in the vicinity of the upper punch.

But for lots of special and complicated structures of fine-blanking dies, especially some progressive dies, many problems occurred during the traditional two-dimensional design method, such as heavy workload, time-consuming, difficulty of modification, difficulty of checking interference, difficulty of novice entry. To solve these problems, a rapid parametric CAD system based on SolidWorks is developed for fine-blanking progressive dies in the present study. The system comprises five modules, namely DIEBASE, WORKPART, STANDARD, MOTION and DRAWING.
