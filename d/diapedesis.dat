50|$|A {{female dog}} is diestrous {{and goes into}} heat {{typically}} twice every year, although some breeds typically have one or three cycles a year.

50|$|Different {{hemorrhagic fever}} viruses {{act on the}} body in {{different}} ways, resulting in different symptoms. In most VHFs, {{it is likely that}} several mechanisms contribute to symptoms, including liver damage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and bone marrow dysfunction. In DIC, small blood clots form in blood vessels throughout the body, removing platelets necessary for clotting from the bloodstream and reducing clotting ability. DIC is thought to cause bleeding in Rift Valley, Marburg, and Ebola fevers. For filoviral hemorrhagic fevers, there are four general mechanisms for pathogensis. The first mechanism is dissemination of virus due to suppressed responses by macrophages and dendritic cell (antigen presenting cells). The second mechanism is prevention of antigen specific immune response. The third mechanism is apoptosis of lymphocytes. The fourth mechanism is when infected macrophages interact with toxic cytokines, leading to <b>diapedesis</b> and coagulation deficiency. From the vascular perspective, the virus will infect macrophages, leading to the reorganization of the VE-cadherin catenin complex (a protein important in cell adhesion). This reorganization creates intercellular gaps in endothelial cells. The gaps lead to increased endothelial permeability and allow blood to escape from the vascular circulatory system.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Metastasis {{involves}} the emigration of tumor cells through the vascular endothelium, a process {{also known as}} <b>diapedesis.</b> The molecular mechanisms regulating tumor cell <b>diapedesis</b> are poorly understood, but may involve heterocellular gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) between tumor cells and endothelial cells. Method: To test this hypothesis we expressed connexin 43 (Cx 43) in GJIC-deficient mammary epithelial tumor cells (HBL 100) and examined their ability to form gap junctions, establish heterocellular GJIC and migrate through monolayers of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) grown on matrigel-coated coverslips. Results: HBL 100 cells expressing Cx 43 formed functional heterocellular gap junctions with HMVEC monolayers within 30 minutes. In addition, immunocytochemistry revealed Cx 43 localized to contact sites between Cx 43 expressing tumor cells and endothelial cells. Quantitative analysis of <b>diapedesis</b> revealed a two-fold increase in <b>diapedesis</b> of Cx 43 expressing cells compared to empty vector control cells. The expression of a functionally inactive Cx 43 chimeric protein in HBL 100 cells failed to increase migration efficiency, suggesting that the observed up-regulation of <b>diapedesis</b> in Cx 43 expressing cells required heterocellular GJIC. This finding is further supported by the observation that blocking homocellular and heterocellular GJIC with carbenoxolone in co-cultures also reduced <b>diapedesis</b> of Cx 43 expressing HBL 100 tumor cells. Conclusion: Collectively, our results suggest that heterocellular GJIC between breast tumor cells and endothelial cells {{may be an important}} regulatory step during metastasis...|$|E

40|$|<b>Diapedesis</b> of leukocytes across endothelial {{cells is}} a crucial step in both the innate and {{adaptive}} immune responses. Surface molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells critical for <b>diapedesis</b> have been identified, but the mechanisms underlying this process are not understood. Homophilic interaction between platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) on leukocytes and PECAM at the endothelial border triggers targeted recycling of membrane from a reticulum localized close to the endothelial cell lateral border. This membrane surrounds the transmigrating leukocyte (Mamdouh, Z., X. Chen, L. M. Pierini, F. R. Maxfield, and W. A. Muller. 2003. Nature. 421 : 748 – 753). How this process occurs and whether it is required for <b>diapedesis</b> independent of PECAM are not known. We now report that targeted recycling from this lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC) is required for <b>diapedesis,</b> is mediated by kinesin family molecular motors, and requires normally functioning endothelial microtubules. Selective disruption of microtubules or inhibition of kinesin motor domain blocked targeted recycling and <b>diapedesis</b> of monocytes. Furthermore, targeted recycling of membrane from the LBRC was required for transmigration of lymphocytes, which migrate independently of PECAM. Thus, trafficking of membrane from the LBRC to surround leukocytes may be a general requirement for migration of leukocytes across the endothelial cell border. Furthermore, these data provide the first demonstration of a role for endothelial microtubules and kinesins in promoting <b>diapedesis,</b> and a mechanism to explain targeted recycling...|$|E

Inflammatory conditions, inducing high levels of endothelial ICAM- 1, promoted rapid initiation of transcellular <b>diapedesis</b> of CD 4 (+) T cells across the BBB, while intermediate levels of endothelial ICAM- 1 favored paracellular CD 4 (+) T-cell <b>diapedesis.</b> Importantly, the route of T-cell <b>diapedesis</b> across the BBB was independent of loss of BBB barrier properties.

40|$|The endothelial {{cells that}} pave the inner lining {{of blood vessels}} {{maintain}} a tight barrier between the vasculature and the underlying tissues. However, disruptive stressors, such as transmigrating leukocytes and inflammatory mediators challenge blood vessel integrity every day.

On a daily basis billions of leukocytes traverse the endothelial barrier without damaging the vascular bed or underlying tissue. In this thesis, we show that leukocyte <b>diapedesis</b> is in part regulated by the spatial distribution of ICAM- 1 in microdomains within the plasma membrane. However, the precise mechanisms by which the endothelium maintains a tight barrier during ICAM- 1 -mediated leukocyte transendothelial migration is currently poorly understood.
