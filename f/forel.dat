5|$|After Ned Stark is imprisoned {{following}} his {{failed attempt to}} arrest Joffrey and Cersei Lannister, the Lannisters move against {{the rest of the}} Stark household. While Ned's eldest daughter Sansa is detained, Arya is able to escape after her fencing teacher Syrio <b>Forel</b> holds off the Lannister men. As Arya runs outside looking for her sword, a stable boy tries to detain her for the Queen, but she fatally stabs him before fleeing the castle.|$|E

Fresh fish is served whole, in the Mediterranean style, grilled, or fried, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Trout (called <b>forel),</b> gilthead seabream (called denisse), St. Peter's fish (known as 'musht') and other fresh fish are prepared this way. Fish are also eaten baked, with or without vegetables, or fried whole or in slices, or grilled over coals, and served with different sauces.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Arya Stark {{deals with}} her father's injury and her loss of Jory during her sword-dance lessons; Syrio <b>Forel</b> tells her it's a perfect {{opportunity}} {{for her to}} learn to avoid distraction while fighting. In the Starks' common room, Sansa Stark and Septa Mordane are interrupted by Prince Joffrey Baratheon, who apologizes to Sansa for his earlier behavior and gives her a necklace, vowing that she will become his queen in an elaborate wedding ceremony. Sansa happily accepts the apology, unaware Joffrey has been forced into it by his mother.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the scenes}} were highly praised by reviewers. The closing scene with Arya taking her first lesson from the Braavosi Syrio <b>Forel</b> was highlighted. Maureen Ryan from AOL TV stated {{that it was her}} {{favorite}} scene of the series so far, and James Hibberd remarked upon the quality of all the child actors of the show and stated that Maisie Williams owned her role in this episode. Other scenes that were noted by the critics were the father-daughter dialogue with Eddard Stark and Arya, King Robert remembering with the members of his Kingsguard their first killings, and Eddard attending his first session of the Small Council.|$|E
5|$|First {{identified}} by Gustav Mayr in 1862, Mayr provided the first description of M. nigriceps {{in his journal}} Myrmecologische Studien. The species was described under the binomial name Myrmecia nigriceps, based on syntype workers collected from Gayndah and Sydney. In 1907, Swiss myrmecologist Auguste <b>Forel</b> treated M. nigriceps as a variant of M. vindex, but he eventually treated it as a synonym in 1910. M. nigriceps was revived as a full species in 1933 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler, {{on the basis that}} it is distributed throughout Australia and its average size is greater than M. vindex. Scottish born Australian entomologist John S. Clark published one synonym – Myrmecia fasciata, now considered a junior synonym. M. nigriceps {{is a member of the}} genus Myrmecia, a part of the primitive subfamily Myrmeciinae; most ancestors of the genus are only found in fossils, with the exception of the dinosaur ant (Nothomyrmecia macrops).|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{has been}} {{classified}} into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858 British entomologist Frederick Smith {{placed it in}} the family Poneridae, subfamily Myrmicidae. It {{was placed in the}} subfamily Ponerinae by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. This classification was short-lived, as Mayr reclassified the genus into the subfamily Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established subfamily Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established Myrmicidae as a family in 1851, reclassified it as a subfamily in 1858. He would again treat it as a family in 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste <b>Forel</b> initially treated Poneridae as a subfamily and classified Myrmecia as one of its constituent genera, but later placed it in Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler. In 1954, Myrmecia was placed into Myrmeciinae; this would be the last time the genus would be placed into a different ant subfamily.|$|E

25|$|F.A. <b>Forel,</b> {{who is also}} {{referred}} to as the father of limnology, was the first scientist to classify lakes according to their thermal stratification. His system of classification was later modified and improved upon by Hutchinson and Laffler. Because the density of water varies with temperature, with a maximum at +4 DC, thermal stratification is an important physical characteristic of lakes that controls the fauna and flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and other aspects of individual lakes. First, the colder, heavier water typically forms a layer near the bottom, which called the hypolimnion. Second, normally overlying it is a transition zone known as the metalimnion. Finally, overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of a warmer, lighter water is called the epilimnion. However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.|$|E
25|$|In King's Landing, Ned finds Robert's eldest brother Stannis Baratheon {{left the}} city after Jon Arryn's death for his island of Dragonstone. Ned begins to {{investigate}} into Jon Arryn's affairs, which leads him to visiting locations where Jon Arryn visited with Stannis - including places where Robert's bastard children are found. On {{the way back from}} one such place, Ned and his soldiers are waylaid by Jaime Lannister, who demands Tyrion's return, and when he does not get what he wants he orders Ned's men be killed - in the ensuing skirmish, Ned is crippled in one leg when his horse collapses on top of him. Even afterwards, Ned continues to investigate and eventually discovers that Robert's legal heirs, including Joffrey, are in fact Cersei's children by Jaime and that Jon Arryn was killed to conceal his discovery of their incest. Ned offers Cersei a chance to flee before he informs Robert, but she uses this chance to arrange Robert's death in a hunting accident. Ned, made lord-regent by Robert's will, enlists Littlefinger's help to secure the loyalty and assistance of the city guards to challenge Joffrey's claim on the throne and place Stannis on the throne; but Littlefinger betrays him, resulting in Ned's arrest, and the death of his men. Whilst Joffrey is crowned King of the Seven Kingdoms, Ned eventually agrees to falsely confess to high treason and join the Night's Watch in exchange for Sansa and Arya's safety, but Joffrey has him beheaded anyway. Whilst Sansa is retained into custody, Arya escapes {{with the help of her}} fencing instructor, Syrio <b>Forel,</b> and Yoren, a recruiting agent for the Night's Watch.|$|E

500|$|Novomessor ensifer is {{a species}} of ant endemic to Mexico. A member of the genus Novomessor in the {{subfamily}} Myrmicinae, it was first described by Swiss entomologist Auguste <b>Forel</b> in 1899. N. ensifer was originally {{a part of the}} genus Aphaenogaster until a recent phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct and should be separated. The ant is a medium-sized species, measuring [...] The ant is ferruginous-colored in some certain parts of the body, and small workers (nanitics) in incipient colonies are noticeably different in color and body structure.|$|E

60|$|Alice Deringham was {{trembling}} visibly, {{and knew that}} Mrs. <b>Forel's</b> eyes were upon her, {{but that did not}} seem to count at all.

60|$|As Hallam had surmised, {{one or two}} {{affairs of}} {{importance}} detained Alton in Vancouver. The winter had been exceptionally rigorous, {{and he knew that}} the claim was guarded securely by frost and snow. Having also, he fancied, effectually silenced his indiscreet visitor by flinging him down-stairs, he thought no more about that affair, and spent one or two evenings pleasantly at <b>Forel's</b> house, where Alice Deringham greeted him with slightly reserved cordiality.|$|R
500|$|The {{scenes with}} Sansa Stark were also noted. According to Elio Garcia from westeros.org, [...] "Sophie Turner really shines in her scenes. There {{are a lot}} of people out there who judge Sansa very harshly, but you would have to have a heart of stone not to sympathize with her plight in this episode." [...] Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment, commenting on the {{transition}} from a [...] "spoiled brat" [...] to a young, confused, but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively. Times reviewer James Poniewozik emphasized the growth of Robb Stark's character, praising both Martin's writing and Richard Madden's acting. Maureen Ryan highlighted the scene where Syrio <b>Forel</b> confronts the Lannister men to allow Arya's escape, which she considered masterfully staged.|$|E
500|$|Novomessor ensifer was {{originally}} described as Aphaenogaster ensifera in 1899 by Swiss entomologist Auguste <b>Forel,</b> {{who provided the}} first description of N. ensifer in his third volume of Biologia Centrali-Americana. Among the genus Aphaenogaster, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery placed N. ensifer in the subgenus Deromyrma in 1915, although this is now a synonym. In 1934, the taxon Novomessor manni {{was described as a}} new species of Novomessor based on workers collected by William M. Mann at Colima, Mexico. However, a study showed that N. manni was a synonym of N. ensifer. Brown comments that N. manni was described as a new species because of the supposed distinct features between two type specimens of N. ensifer, but Brown noticed no morphological differences. The exact type locality for N. manni is unknown, but entomologist Paul Kannowski speculates that the ant is restricted to arid scrub forests around the Pacific Slope in Mexico. This speculation is consistent with the preferred habitat of N. ensifer.|$|E
500|$|In {{the capital}} city {{the members of the}} council are presented. Series regular Aidan Gillen, known for his roles in Queer as Folk and The Wire takes the role of Lord Petyr Baelish, the king's master of coin known as [...] "Littlefinger." [...] Gethin Anthony plays the king's {{youngest}} brother Renly Baratheon, and veteran actor Julian Glover, well known to science fiction and fantasy fans after appearing in films such as The Empire Strikes Back and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, was cast as Grand Maester Pycelle after actor Roy Dotrice had to be replaced for medical reasons. Author George R. R. Martin wrote on the casting of Conleth Hill as spymaster Varys: [...] "Hill, like Varys, is quite a chameleon, an actor who truly disappears inside the characters he portrays, more than capable not only of bringing the slimy, simpering eunuch to life." [...] Ian McElhinney plays Ser Barristan Selmy, the commander of the Kingsguard, and Miltos Yorelemou appears as the fencing instructor Syrio <b>Forel.</b> McElhinney had previously played Gillen's father in Queer as Folk.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Forel's</b> {{predilection for}} finding in ants the analogs of human social and {{political}} behaviors was always controversial. In the foreword to his 1927 edition of British Ants: their life history and classification, Donisthorpe opined, [...] "I should wish ... to protest against the ants being employed as a supposed weapon in political controversy. In my opinion an entomological work is not the appropriate means for the introduction of political theories of any kind, still less for their glaring advertisement. [...] But in 1937, the work was excerpted in Sir J.A.

60|$|Alton saw it all, {{and did not}} for {{a moment}} turn aside {{so long as the}} smiles and whispers were {{directed}} at him, but he stopped and waited, leaning on a chair some distance behind the spot where <b>Forel's</b> party were until the curtain rose again. The next act commenced, as he knew, with a night scene, and while most of the audience had no eyes for any one but the great tragedian, he moved forward quickly, and Alice Deringham turned her head a trifle as a shadowy form slipped into the vacant place beside her. She could scarcely see the man, and was not certain that she desired to, but she would have known who he was had he been wholly invisible.|$|R
500|$|Nansen did not resume formal {{studies at}} the university. Instead, on Collett's recommendation, he {{accepted}} a post as curator in the zoological department of the Bergen Museum. He was {{to spend the next}} six years of his life there—apart from a six-month sabbatical tour of Europe—working and studying with leading figures such as Gerhard Armauer Hansen, the discoverer of the leprosy bacillus, and Daniel Cornelius Danielssen, the museum's director who had turned it from a backwater collection into a centre of scientific research and education. Nansen's chosen area of study was the then relatively unexplored field of neuroanatomy, specifically the central nervous system of lower marine creatures. [...] Before leaving for his sabbatical in February 1886 he published a paper summarising his research to date, in which he stated that [...] "anastomoses or unions between the different ganglion cells" [...] could not be demonstrated with certainty. This unorthodox view was confirmed by the simultaneous researches of the embryologist Wilhelm His and the psychiatrist August <b>Forel.</b> Nansen is considered the first Norwegian defender of the neuron theory, originally proposed by Santiago Ramon y Cajal. His subsequent paper, The Structure and Combination of Histological Elements of the Central Nervous System, published in 1887, became his doctoral thesis.|$|E
500|$|Ant {{society has}} always fascinated humans {{and has been}} written about both humorously and seriously. Mark Twain wrote about ants in his 1880 book A Tramp Abroad. Some modern authors have used the example of the ants to comment on the {{relationship}} between society and the individual. Examples are Robert Frost in his poem [...] "Departmental" [...] and T. H. White in his fantasy novel The Once and Future King. The plot in French entomologist and writer Bernard Werber's Les Fourmis science-fiction trilogy is divided between the worlds of ants and humans; ants and their behaviour is described using contemporary scientific knowledge. H.G. Wells wrote about intelligent ants destroying human settlements in Brazil and threatening human civilization in his 1905 science-fiction short story, The Empire of the Ants. In more recent times, animated cartoons and 3-D animated films featuring ants have been produced including Antz, A Bug's Life, The Ant Bully, The Ant and the Aardvark, Ferdy the Ant and Atom Ant. Renowned myrmecologist E. O. Wilson wrote a short story, [...] "Trailhead" [...] in 2010 for The New Yorker magazine, which describes {{the life and death of}} an ant-queen and the rise and fall of her colony, from an ants' point of view. The French neuroanatomist, psychiatrist and eugenicist Auguste <b>Forel</b> believed that ant societies were models for human society. He published a five volume work from 1921 to 1923 that examined ant biology and society.|$|E

40|$|Sympathoexcitatory reticulospinal neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are oxygen {{detectors}} {{excited by}} hypoxia to globally elevate regional {{cerebral blood flow}} (rCBF).

However, there are no direct cortical projections from the RVLM/MCVA, suggesting a relay that diffusely innervates cortex and possibly originates in thalamic nuclei. Systematic mapping by electrical microstimulation of the thalamus and subthalamus revealed that elevations in rCBF were elicited only from a limited area, which encompassed medial pole of zona incerta, <b>Forel’s</b> field, and prerubral zone.
