This investigative judgment determines who of the myriads sleeping in the dust of the earth are worthy of a part in the first resurrection, and who of its living multitudes are worthy of translation (1 Peter 4:17, 18; Daniel 7:9, 10; Revelation 14:6, 7; Luke 20:35).|$|E
25|$|Mental {{prayer was}} defined by Fr. John Hardon in his Modern Catholic Dictionary {{as a form of}} prayer in which the sentiments {{expressed}} are one's own and not those of another person. Mental prayer is a form of prayer whereby one loves God through dialogue with him, meditating on his words, and contemplating him. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> silence focused on God and one's relationship with him. It is distinguished from vocal prayers which use set prayers, although mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. Mental prayer can be divided into meditation, or active mental prayer; and contemplation, passive mental prayer.|$|E

25|$|Messianic Jews {{and some}} other sabbatarian churches also observe Yom Kippur as a holy day, from evening to evening. In the Christian observance, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> prayer and fasting from all food and drink and a time of {{instruction}} through study and church attendance. It focuses on Christ's sacrifice and atonement for sins. It {{is seen as a}} time to give thanks and praise, to humble oneself and to seek repentance. It is also a time where Messianic Jews pray for Israel and Jews who have not yet proclaimed Yeshua/Jesus is the Messiah that was promised in prophesies from the Old Testament.|$|E
25|$|According to Clayton Christensen, {{disruptive}} innovation {{is the key}} to future success in business. The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> risk but even greater opportunity. The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced {{to reduce the number of}} people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} states of afterlife in Catholic belief. Heaven <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> glorious union with God {{and a life}} of unspeakable joy that lasts forever. Purgatory is a {{temporary}} place for the purification of souls who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring penance and purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were not sorry for their sins and {{had no intention of}} changing their ways go to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God and his love. He predestines no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned. Catholicism teaches that God's mercy is such that a person can repent even at the point of death and be saved, like the good thief who was crucified next to Jesus.|$|E

25|$|Lithe is a Midsummer {{holiday in}} the Shire. It is {{mentioned}} in The Fellowship of the Ring. Lithe falls between Forelithe, the sixth {{month of the}} year, and Afterlithe, the seventh month. In most years there are three Lithedays: 1 Lithe, Midyear's Day, and 2 Lithe. In Leap-years there is a fourth Litheday called Overlithe between Midyear's Day and 2 Lithe. Midyear's Day and Overlithe are not assigned any weekday, while 1 Lithe always falls on a Friday and 2 Lithe is a Saturday. Lithe and the Midwinter holiday called Yule are the two major holidays in the Shire. Lithe <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> great feasting and merriment. During Lithe, the Free Fair is held on the White Downs, where Hobbits gather to celebrate and {{to buy and sell}} goods. Every seven years at the Free Fair during Lithe, an election is held for the office of Mayor of the Shire. In the years that Overlithe occur, it is a day of special celebration. Overlithe falls during the Great Year of Plenty in 3020 after the War of the Ring, and it is the merriest holiday {{in the history of the}} Shire.|$|E

500|$|Winter in Minnesota is {{characterized}} by cold (below freezing) temperatures. Snow is the main form of winter precipitation, but freezing rain, sleet, and occasionally rain are all possible during the winter months. Common storm systems include Alberta clippers or Panhandle hooks; some of which develop into blizzards. Annual snowfall extremes have ranged from over [...] in the rugged Superior Highlands of the North Shore to as little as [...] in southern Minnesota. Temperatures as low as [...] have occurred during Minnesota winters. Spring <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> major transition in Minnesota. Snowstorms are common early in the spring, but by late-spring as temperatures begin to moderate the state can experience tornado outbreaks, a risk which diminishes but does not cease through the summer and into the autumn.|$|E
500|$|Spring <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> major {{transition}} in Minnesota. [...] As winter nears its end, {{the sun rises}} higher {{in the sky and}} temperatures begin to moderate. As this happens much of the Midwest starts to experience severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Storm systems that move inland from the Pacific begin to collide with the increasingly warm and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. [...] In {{the early part of the}} spring, Minnesota is usually not in a geographically favorable position to experience severe weather since the warm air needed for it has not yet pushed that far to the north. [...] Early spring tornado outbreaks do occur occasionally in Minnesota though, as evidenced by the 1998 Comfrey – St. Peter tornado outbreak on March 29, 1998. [...] More often, Minnesota is on the northern (cooler) side of major storm systems in the early spring, which instead results in only rain and possibly snow. [...] Even though the winter snow pack typically starts to melt in southern Minnesota in early March, there is usually still enough cold air present over Canada to allow for major snow storms in Minnesota until late April.|$|E
