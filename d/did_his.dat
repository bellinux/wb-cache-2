5|$|After the 1836 election, Harrison did {{not really}} stop running for president, nor <b>did</b> <b>his</b> {{supporters}} stop boosting him—an Ohio political convention endorsed him as early as 1837. His finances were somewhat secured by his appointment as clerk of Hamilton County's circuit court, a post that paid no salary, but allowed considerable income from fees. The years between 1838 and 1840 were years of personal tragedy for the general, as three of his adult children died and his wife Anna fell seriously ill. Harrison <b>did</b> <b>his</b> best to manage a network of acquaintances and supporters {{from his home in}} North Bend, corresponding extensively and seeking to have items favorable to him placed in the newspapers.|$|E

5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often {{than any of his}} colleagues <b>did.</b> <b>His</b> goal during {{oral argument}}s was to get across his position to the other justices.|$|E

5|$|On July 28, 1880, Wyatt was {{appointed}} deputy sheriff {{for the eastern}} part of Pima County, which included Tombstone, by Democratic County Sheriff Charlie Shibell. Wyatt passed on his Wells Fargo job as shotgun messenger to his brother Morgan. Wyatt <b>did</b> <b>his</b> job well, and from August through November, his name was mentioned nearly every week by The Tombstone Epitaph or the Nugget newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Thompson posted an 8–14 {{record for}} the Virginians in 1954; his ERA totaled 5.00 in 29 starts and he placed third on the team in innings pitched (198). His 112 strikeouts led Richmond, as <b>did</b> <b>his</b> 232 hits allowed. After a 6–16 season and a 5.17 ERA in 1955, Thompson retired from baseball.|$|E
5|$|A snow {{called the}} Unity {{was added to}} the fleet, and used as a tender, but was {{abandoned}} during an encounter with a man of war named the Mermaid. As Low's success increased in the Caribbean, so <b>did</b> <b>his</b> notoriety. Eventually, a bounty was placed on his head, and Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up with Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.|$|E

5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, New Hampshire. He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as <b>did</b> <b>his</b> personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, he <b>did</b> <b>his</b> {{best to keep}} his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E
5|$|Barrowman is also {{featured}} {{on more than}} a dozen musical theatre recordings including cover tunes found on his 2007 album, Another Side, and 2008's Music Music Music.

Furthermore, Barrowman has published two memoirs and autobiographies, Anything Goes (2008) and I Am What I Am (2009), with his sister Carole as co-author. The siblings also teamed up to write a novel, Hollow Earth (2012). The second book in the series, Bone Quill, has been released in the UK and was released in the US in July 2013.|$|E

5|$|Creative {{differences}} {{arising from}} his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he <b>did</b> <b>his</b> writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E
5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim <b>did</b> <b>his</b> best to avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era Greed was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.|$|E
5|$|Edward (Ted) Ford {{was born}} in Bethanga, Victoria, on 15 April 1902, the son of Edward John Knight Ford and his wife Mary Doxford, née Armstrong. His first job after leaving Clunes Higher Elementary School was as a {{telegraph}} boy at the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), which he joined in April 1917, later working in its accounts branch. After he matriculated {{at the age of}} 24 he enrolled in an arts course at the University of Melbourne, but soon switched to medicine. He supported himself by continuing to work for the PMG by night. He graduated with his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees in 1932, and <b>did</b> <b>his</b> residency at Melbourne Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Eorpwald {{was the son}} of Rædwald by a wife {{whose name}} is not recorded. He had at least one brother, Rægenhere, and another sibling, Sigeberht, may also have been his brother. Rædwald used the letters R and E when naming two of his own sons, (as <b>did</b> <b>his</b> own father when he and his younger brother Eni were named), which {{suggests}} that Eorpwald was the younger sibling and would only have become Rædwald's heir after his elder brother Rægenhere was slain in battle in 616.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{worked in}} Los Angeles {{for a time}} as a hotel janitor and a {{hospital}} file clerk, before joining Lionel Hampton's orchestra in 1952. He toured Europe with the orchestra, and shared the organization's trumpet chairs with Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones and Benny Bailey. This aided his musical development considerably, as <b>did</b> <b>his</b> 1953 membership of Teddy Charles' New Directions band – the compositions he encountered in this band allowed him to consider {{a broader range of}} expression during improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Filitti's death {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} a Romanian communist regime came into existence. He was {{survived by his}} wife and son.

Alexandrina Filitti was stripped of virtually all her land during the land reform and nationalization, but still forced to meet agricultural quotas imposed by the government; when she failed to do so, Manole Filitti took it upon himself to face the consequences, and spent some three years in communist jails.|$|E
