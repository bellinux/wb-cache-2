The RB subjected to preheating temperature of 200  °C, before subjecting to the adsorption process carried out. The IR spectra of RB before adsorption of water vapour at 298 and 313  K were studied. The adsorbed and <b>desorbed</b> <b>water</b> vapour from bentonite surfaces at 298 and 313  K was determined at different time. The adsorptive capacities of RB sample at 298 and 313  K were 0. 0097 and 0. 0141  mol/g of dry RB, respectively, after 72  h. The desorbed amounts are 0. 0085 and 0. 01  mol H 2 O/g of RB at 298 and 313  K, respectively after 72  h. A kinetic models of second order of the adsorption and desorption of water vapour fitted well the experimental data. Application of Van’t Hoff’s law at two temperatures (298 and 313  K) yields the adsorption and desorption enthalpy. The adsorption enthalpy (stored energy) of RB increased with increasing contact time up to 5  h. At this time the maximum enthalpy was about 30  kJ/g dry bentonite, at which the clay has lost all the energy that could be released due to adsorption of water vapours. Then it shows a decrease in sorption energy when the time increases. On the other hand, the desorption enthalpy increases gradually with the increase of the time up to 72  h then become constant, maximum enthalpy was 14. 99  kJ/g. The rate of water vapour adsorption was found to be very high so that the extracted energy from the bentonite surface would not be a problem in any practical utilization of this system...|$|E
40|$|Water-soluble {{macromolecular}} polyacids {{can play}} a potentially {{important role in the}} hygroscopic properties of atmospheric aerosols. These acids have molecular structures similar to natural fulvic acids (FA) (or humic acids) and are referred to as humic-like substances (HULIS). In this study, the hygroscopicity of HULIS and the mixture of HULIS and sodium chloride (NaCl) and that of HULIS and ammonium sulfate (AS) aerosols at a mass ratio of 1 : 1 are studied using two natural FA: the Nordic Aquatic Fulvic Acid (NAFA) and the Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) as model compounds in an electrodynamic balance. NAFA and SRFA both absorbed and <b>desorbed</b> <b>water</b> reversibly without crystallization and retained water at a relative humidity (RH) < 10 %. NAFA and SRFA have a mass growth ratio of 1. 25 and 1. 45 from RH = 10 % to RH = 90 %, respectively. However, these results are different from those of another natural FA (the Nordic River Fulvic Acid Reference) in the literature. The differences are possibly due to the differences in the chemical composition of the natural FA, which depends on their sources and the isolation methods. These results suggest that a standardization of the isolation methods of HULIS is needed for better understanding of their atmospheric properties and environmental impacts. In general, the deliquescence and crystallization RH of FA-inorganic mixtures are comparable with those of their respective pure inorganic species. Since FA are less hygroscopic than NaCl and AS, all mixtures absorb less water compared to their respective pure inorganic species of equal particle mass. The FA-AS mixtures have a larger water uptake than the sum of those of the FA and AS individually following a simple additivity rule as noninteracting species at RH = 90 %. This enhancement effect increases as the RH decreases. There is no such enhancement effect for the FA-NaCl mixtures until RH is below 90 %. These results reveal that the effect of the interactions between FA and inorganic species on the water uptake of the mixtures, in general, is a function of RH...|$|E
40|$|The hygroscopicity, {{the water}} uptake property, of {{atmospheric}} aerosols describes {{the interaction between}} water vapor and aerosols. It affects the phase, size, and chemical composition of aerosols, and thus influences many atmospheric processes such as cloud activation activity, light scattering, and chemical reactions. Recent studies have revealed that organic species derived from biomass burning, amino acids, and macromolecular polyacids contribute to {{a substantial portion of}} water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC) and the aerosol mass. This thesis focuses on studying the hygroscopicity of particles of these three major groups of WSOC using the single particle levitation technique in an electrodynamic balance (EDB). The hygroscopic measurements were performed by equilibrating singly levitated particles at different relative humidity (RH) in the EDB for in-situ mass determination. Levoglucosan, marnosan, and galactosan are commonly detected in the biomass burning aerosols, derived from the combustion of cellulose. The particles of these species exist as highly concentrated solutions at RH as low as 5 %. Our results suggest that biomass burning aerosols, which contain these non-crystallizing organic species, may not be completely dry and absorb water at low RH. Our results support the reports in the literature that the light scattering coefficient of biomass burning aerosols starts to increase with increasing RH, even at low RH. Crystallization was observed in some amino acid particles (glycine, alanine, serine, glutamine, and threonine) upon evaporation of water while no phase transition was observed in some others (arginine and asparagine), even at 5 %RH. Best fittings of the literature and experimental data with the model estimates yield a new set of UNIFAC interaction parameters that give predictions to within 15 % of the measurements up to the supersaturation regime for atmospheric application. Water-soluble macromolecular polyacids have molecular structures similar to natural fulvic acids (FA) and are referred to as humic-like substances (HULIS). The role of HULIS on the hygroscopicity of atmospheric aerosols was studied using their model compounds: two natural FA: Nordic Aquatic Fulvic Acid (NAFA) and Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA).

Techniques of chemical conversion using simple solid reagents have advanced considerably in the past 20 years. In this investigation we researched the advancements in techniques to reversibly adsorb and <b>desorb</b> <b>water</b> and focused on the techniques potentially useful for the temperatures and pressures on the Martian surface. During the granting period from June 15, 1998 to August 14, 1998, a literature study of the material appropriate for use in a chemical conversion device and the availability of these materials were undertaken. The focus of this investigation was searching for methods and materials potentially useful in enhancing the measurements of water. Three different methods were considered for the means to extract water from a given gas sample. These methods included adsorption in a desiccant, adsorption on a clean metal surface, and adsorption in a carbon molecular sieve or zeolite. Each method was evaluated with feasibility and reversibility in mind. By far the simplest and perhaps cheapest way to remove water from a gaseous sample is by means of a bulk desiccant. Desiccants are commercially available from many companies including those that supply chemicals. The main feature of a desiccant is its ability to rapidly bind or absorb water from the atmosphere. Calcium chloride, for example, is frequently incorporated into drying tubes by organic chemists when reactions require the absence of water. Other desiccants include sodium hydroxide, calcium hydride, and commercial products such as Drierite, available from Aldrich Chemical. The disadvantage to most desiccants is a direct consequence of what makes them so advantageous. Desiccants rapidly and strongly bind water, often reacting chemically with it.

The fractional abundance of O 2 relative to H 2 is (0. 3 - 7. 3) × 10 - 6. The unusual velocity suggests an association with a ~ 5 '' diameter source, denoted Peak A, the Western Clump, or MF 4. The mass of this source is ~ 10 M sun and the dust temperature is >= 150 K. Our preferred explanation of the enhanced O 2 abundance is that dust grains in this region are sufficiently warm (T >= 100 K) to <b>desorb</b> <b>water</b> ice and thus keep a significant fraction of elemental oxygen in the gas phase, with a significant fraction as O 2. For this small source, the line ratios require a temperature >= 180 K. The inferred O 2 column density sime 5 × 1018 cm- 2 can be produced in Peak A, having N(H 2) ~= 4 × 1024 cm- 2. An alternative mechanism is a low-velocity (10 - 15 km s- 1) C-shock, which can produce N(O 2) up to 1017 cm- 2.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{thermally}} induced methanol reactions on bimetallic Ru(0001) -based catalyst surfaces performed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Specifically, reaction intermediates and pathways on various clean and oxygen covered surfaces (Ru(0001), Cu/Ru(0001), Pt/Ru(0001), and Pt_xRu_ 1 -x/Ru(0001) surface alloys) have been studied by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption. On {{the basis of this}} comparison and results reported in the literature methanol reactions on metal surfaces can be subdivided into two major pathways: (i) total dehydrogenation of methanol leading to CO, and (ii) an oxidation pathway which produces gaseous CO_ 2. On the clean surfaces either the dehydrogenation pathway is observed or no reaction occurs at all. The CO_ 2 producing path opens up only upon adsorption of oxygen. In parallel, the CO formation diminishes. In this context, the influence of oxygen on the yields of possible reaction products is analyzed. Generally, it is found that methanol reactions are promoted by disordered and dilute oxygen layers; dense and ordered O-overlayers, on the other hand, passivate the surface effectively. Referring to the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), a significant drawback of adding oxygen is the reaction of the oxygen atoms with hydrogen from methanol dehydrogenation to gaseous water. As hydrogen is the energy provider in a DMFC the <b>desorbing</b> <b>water</b> represents an unwanted drain of H atoms. Interestingly, the surfaces which produce the highest amount of CO_ 2 are also most efficient with respect to water formation.

40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} thermally induced methanol (CH_ 3 OH) reactions on bimetallic Ru(0001) -based catalyst surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Specifically, the following clean and oxygen covered surfaces were used: Ru(0001), (sub-) monolayer Cu/Ru(0001), multilayer Cu/Ru(0001), Pt_n/Ru(0001) layers, and Pt_xRu_{ 1 -x}/Ru(0001) surface alloys. The adsorption and reactions of methanol are of great technological relevance for the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). Thereby, it is desirable to influence chemical reactivity and selectivity of catalysts to convert methanol to CO_ 2 instead of CO which acts as a poison affecting a continued and stable operation. The stability of reaction intermediates and {{the height of the}} activation barriers of the various reaction steps critically depends on specific properties of the substrate material. Straightforward methods to design novel catalysts in a controlled way are the deposition of ultrathin metal films on a host material, the building of alloys or the addition of coadsorbates. In the experiments performed in this work methanol was added at 20 or 80 K to the catalyst surfaces and slowly annealed with 1 K/s to increasingly higher temperatures. Thereby, the surface species were identified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, i. e. the observed vibrational modes were analyzed in detail. For an unambiguous assignment of the observed peaks isotopic labeling was applied using different isotopes of methanol, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. The desorbing species, on the other hand, were analyzed by temperature programmed desorption using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The desorption temperature provides information about the binding strength of an adsorbate and about the dissociation temperature of stable surface species which decays into gaseous products. Moreover, isotopic labeling (18 -O and 16 -O) allows the discrimination of reactions involving surface oxygen, e. g the formation of <b>desorbing</b> <b>water.</b> Similarly, the CD_ 3 OH isotope allows to distinguish whether hydrogen from the CD_ 3 or the OH group contributes to a certain reaction. For the quantitative analysis of the chemical composition of the surface and the adsorbates, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was applied. The experiments focus on the identification of fundamental reaction steps and stable intermediate species and, in the second step, on the variation of surface parameters, such as the sort and thickness of a deposited metal, the addition of coadsorbates, changing the adsorbate order and density or modifying the composition of the surface alloy. The reactions on the investigated surfaces can be subdivided into two major pathways; (i) : a total dehydrogenation pathway leading to CO, and (ii) : an oxidation pathway which produces gaseous CO_ 2. On the clean Ru(0001), Cu/Ru(0001) and Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces either the dehydrogenation pathways are observed or no reaction occurs at all. The CO_ 2 producing path, on the other hand, can be opened by the adsorption of oxygen. In parallel, the CO formation becomes reduced. In this context, the influence of oxygen on the yielded reaction products was investigated. Generally, it is found that only disordered and dilute oxygen promote methanol reactions; dense and ordered O-overlayers passivate the surface effectively. A significant drawback of adding oxygen is the reaction of the oxygen atoms with hydrogen from methanol dehydrogenation to gaseous water. As hydrogen is the energy provider in a DMFC the <b>desorbing</b> <b>water</b> represents an unwanted drain of H atoms from the surface. Interestingly, the surfaces which produce the highest amount of CO_ 2 are also most efficient with respect to the formation of water.

In particular, alloys with a Pt contents of 50 - 80 % are found to be most suitable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The role of soil {{phosphorus}} (P) in the eutrophication {{of fresh}} water systems is well established. It is crucial therefore to assess the potential loss of P from soil in the various scenarios where soil can {{come into contact with}} water. To date, such assessment has often been based on soil P tests that are used for agronomic purposes (e. g. fertilizer recommendations). The purpose of this work was to examine the useful-ness of one such test (viz. the Olsen test, which is based on extraction with bicarbonate) for pre-dicting not only the amount of soil P available to plants, but also that which can be <b>desorbed</b> to <b>water</b> in a group of 32 Portuguese soils, of which 29 were acid and 3 calcareous.

Our experiments {{concentrate on the}} description of fundamental reaction steps and the identification of stable intermediate species. Thereby a number of surface parameters have been systematically varied: sort and thickness of deposited metal overlayer, addition of coadsorbates, long range order of adsorbate layer, density and composition of surface alloy (P.

40|$|The {{hygroscopicity}} {{of water}} soluble organic compounds (WSOCs) {{plays an important}} role in many applications such as pharmaceutical and food industries and atmospheric science. Unfortunately, most work on hygroscopicity has been focused only on inorganics. In this project, the equilibrium water sorption and desorption characteristics (i. e., the water cycle) of a series of WSOCs using an electrodynamic balance (EDB) was studied. In the EDB, a combination of AC and DC fields is used to trap and levitate a charged particle. The mass of the particle undergoing evaporation or condensation is proportional to the DC voltage required to balance the particle stagnant. The WSOCs studied include four respiratory drugs (atropine sulfate (AS), isoproterenol hydrochloride (IPHC) and isoproterenol hemisulfate (IPHS) and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG)), three model additives in pharmaceutical formulations (glucose, citric acid and sorbitol) and nine atmospheric WSOCs. Measurements of the drugs were made at 37 ℃ and those of the model additives and atmospheric WSOCs were made at 25 ℃. Combining the bulk water activity (aw) measurements with the EDB measurements, the equilibrium relationship between particle composition and aw of each species was obtained. The growth ratios of the WSOCs were also estimated. Compared with typical inorganic species which exhibit efflorescence and deliquescence in the water cycle, most of the WSOCs studied (all the pharmaceuticals, additives and some atmospheric species (sodium malonate and sodium maleate) studied) do not effloresce nor deliquesce. They sorb and <b>desorb</b> <b>water</b> reversibly in the water cycle. The other atmospheric WSOCs (sodium formate, sodium acetate, sodium succinate, sodium pyruvate and sodium methanesulfonate (Na-MSA)) demonstrated similar behaviors as typical inorganic salts. Residual water exists in the particles of some species when RH is very low. In most cases, the solid states of single particles resulted from crystallization of supersaturated droplets do not form the most thermodynamically stable state found in bulk studies. The findings of this project clearly show that many WSOCs can be as hygroscopic as typical inorganic species but they also have hygroscopic characteristics very different from those of inorganic deliquescent species...|$|R
