5000|$|... #Caption: The {{anchor and}} escape {{wheel of a}} late 19th-century clock. The plate that {{normally}} holds the front <b>end</b> of the <b>pinions</b> has been removed for clarity. The pendulum is behind the back plate.|$|R
50|$|Orders for the {{subsequent}} Class 5E1, Series 3 and later models made provision for roller suspension bearings incorporating a lip-type {{cylindrical roller bearing}} to replace the self-aligning ball bearing at the <b>pinion</b> <b>end,</b> and alternatively for tapered roller bearings at both ends. Since the external dimensions of the bearing housings would remain the same, the traction motors would still be freely interchangeable.|$|R
500|$|The {{mechanical}} clockworks for Su Song's astronomical tower {{featured a}} great driving-wheel that was 11 feet in diameter, carrying 36 scoops, {{into each of}} which water poured at a uniform rate from the [...] "constant-level tank" [...] (Needham, Fig. 653). The main driving shaft of iron, with its cylindrical necks supported on iron crescent-shaped bearings, <b>ended</b> in a <b>pinion</b> which engaged a gear wheel {{at the lower end}} of the main vertical transmission shaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangement}} {{consisted of}} a self-aligning spherical roller (ball) bearing at the <b>pinion</b> <b>end</b> and a parallel roller bearing at the commutator end of the traction motor. The bearings were grease-lubricated and were carried in a split cannon box to which the traction motor was attached by means of two clamps which engaged cylindrically-machined seatings {{on the outside of}} the housing. The roller-type suspension bearings required little attention other than the replenishment of the grease when the wheels were removed for tyre-turning.|$|R
40|$|A folding, {{retractable}} dome {{for protecting}} a feature, {{such as a}} docking mechanism, a hatch or other equipment at an exterior surface of a space vehicle, includes a plurality of arcuate ribs, each having opposite <b>ends</b> respectively <b>pinioned</b> at {{opposite sides of the}} feature at the surface of the vehicle for rotational movement about an axis of rotation extending through the opposite ends and through an arcuate path of revolution extending over the feature, and a flexible cover attached to each of the ribs such that, in a deployed configuration of the dome, in which adjacent ribs are rotated apart from each other at a maximum relative angle therebetween, the cover is stretched generally tangentially between the adjacent ribs to form a generally arcuate shield over the feature, and in a retracted position of the dome, in which adjacent ribs are rotated together at a minimum relative angle therebetween, the cover is collapsed to define folded pleats between the adjacent ribs...|$|R
50|$|Like the Series 2, the {{traction}} motors of the Series 3 were also equipped with roller-type suspension bearings. On the Series 2 locomotives the arrangement {{consisted of a}} self-aligning ball bearing at the <b>pinion</b> <b>end</b> and a parallel roller bearing at the commutator end of the traction motor. The bearings were grease-lubricated and were carried in a split cannon box to which the traction motor was attached by means of two clamps that engaged cylindrically-machined seatings {{on the outside of}} the housing. The roller-type suspension bearings required little attention other than the replenishment of the grease when the wheels were removed for tyre-turning.|$|R
40|$|Current Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) aim at high {{temperatures}} in the Thermal Energy Storage (TES). Such high TES temperatures together with high pressures {{are not easy to}} handle. In order to avoiding this technical challenge, we developed a Low-temperature Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (LTA-CAES) plant based on a two-tank non-thermocline TES. We selected and designed multistage radial compressors and expanders with single stages arranged at the <b>ends</b> of several <b>pinion</b> shafts rotating with different- and for the assembled impellers optimal speeds. The proposed LTA- CAES design shows cycle efficiencies in the range of 58 to 67 %, slightly lower compared to those envisioned for high temperature A-CAES. However, it can be shown that its fast start-up characte ristics and wide-ranging part load ability overcompensate the lower cycle efficiencies with regard to plant profitability...|$|R
40|$|Integrally geared {{compressors}} (IGCs) {{comprise of}} single stage impellers {{installed on the}} <b>ends</b> of <b>pinion</b> shafts, all driven by a main bull gear (BG) and shaft system. When compared to single shaft multistage centrifugal compressors, the benefits of IGCs include better thermal efficiency, reduced footprint and simple foundation, dispensing with a high speed coupling, as well as better access for maintenance and overhauls. In IGCs the compression of the process gas induces axial loads on the pinion shafts that are transmitted via thrust collars (TCs) to the main drive shaft and balanced by a single thrust bearing. The TCs, located {{on either side of}} pinion gears, slightly overlap with the BG outer diameter to form lentil-shaped lubricant-wetted regions. A numerical model, based on classical thin film lubrication theory, predicts the force response of lubricated thrust collars for use in integrally geared compressors. The predictive model determines performance parameters such as lubricant flow rate, mechanical power loss, peak pressure, lubricant temperature rise, as well as rotordynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for a lubricated TC and bull gear pair. A Newton-Raphson based iterative procedure determines an equilibrium operating position for a given set of TC and BG operating conditions and geometry. Periodic, dynamic displacements from the equilibrium position renders complex dynamic stiffnesses (H = K+i?C), from which the fluid film force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients are determined. In a lubricated thrust collar and bull gear, a hydrodynamic pressure builds in {{the lower half of the}} lubricated zone and lubricant cavitation occurs in the upper half. The minimum film thickness and peak pressure in the lubricated zone shift location due to the difference in taper angles between the TC and BG surfaces. For a given applied load, a study on the differences in taper angle between the TC and BG surfaces reveals that current angular tolerances of ? 0. 1 produce TC/BG pairs with similar performance parameters (power loss, lubricant temperature rise, etc.) and dynamic force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients. Increasing the taper angles of both the TC and BG decreases mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise, but also decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. In addition, static angular misalignments of the TC and BG about the horizontal (x) axis joining the BG and TC centers alters the shape and extent of the lubricant cavitation region. This change alters the load carrying capacity and mechanical power losses of the lubricated element. For the specific TC/BG pair investigated herein, there exists a maximum difference between the two taper angles for which the mechanical element can support an imposed thrust load. Increasing the speed of the BG (and proportionally the TC speed) increases the mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise and decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. As with most fluid film bearings, increasing the applied load increases the power loss, lubricant temperature rise, and axial stiffness and damping coefficients. The thesis delivers a predictive tool, yet to be benchmarked against experimental data, that provides insight to both the static and dynamic force performance of a lubricated thrust collar, not currently in the archived literature...|$|R
