5|$|After Kerr {{resigned}} as Governor-General, he still sought a government position, reasoning {{that it had}} been his intent to remain for ten years as Governor-General.

5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, <b>his</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but <b>his</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E
