5|$|During {{the offseason}} the Red Sox {{acquired}} All-Star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, {{and with the}} <b>imminent</b> departure of Adrián Beltré, Youkilis agreed to the make the switch back to third base.|$|E
5|$|On January 30, 2009, {{scientists}} from the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) warned that an eruption was <b>imminent,</b> sending experienced Alaskans shopping for protection against a dusty shower of volcanic ash that could descend on south-central Alaska.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} issues raised on appeal was that the defendants' {{political}} advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate <b>imminent</b> violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or <b>imminent</b> tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not <b>imminent.</b> The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear. The visit was {{reported}} up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received {{requests for information}} about Montgomery's movements. There {{is no indication that}} Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the <b>imminent</b> invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this {{to the fact that the}} deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an <b>imminent</b> invasion.|$|E
5|$|With {{closure of}} the PoW camp <b>imminent,</b> Trautmann {{declined}} an offer of repatriation and stayed in England, working {{on a farm in}} Milnthorpe then subsequently working on bomb disposal in Huyton.|$|E
5|$|After the assassination, Admiral Souchon {{assessed}} {{that war}} was <b>imminent</b> between the Central Powers and the Triple Entente, and ordered his ships {{to make for}} Pola for repairs. Engineers came from Germany {{to work on the}} ship. Goeben had 4,460 boiler tubes replaced, among other repairs. Upon completion, the ships departed for Messina.|$|E
5|$|Assisted {{suicide and}} abortion: Viewing all human life as sacred, the Assemblies of God opposes {{assisted}} suicide and abortion (unless it is medically {{confirmed that the}} mother's life is in <b>imminent,</b> physical danger). It believes scripture is silent {{on the use of}} contraception and therefore takes no position on this subject.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore Sun {{reporter}} Scott Templeton {{claims to}} have been contacted by McNulty's fake serial killer. City Editor Gus Haynes becomes suspicious, but his superiors are enamored of Templeton. The story gains momentum and Carcetti spins the resulting attention on homelessness into a key issue in his <b>imminent</b> campaign for Governor and restores funding to the Police Department.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata {{has been}} {{reported}} as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study this pathogen {{was found to have}} no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage of populations infested or facing <b>imminent</b> infestation, the species was classed as having a very low extinction risk.|$|E
5|$|Following test Baker {{decontamination}} problems, the United States Navy equipped newly constructed {{ships with}} a CounterMeasure WashDown System (CMWDS) of piping and nozzles to cover exterior {{surfaces of the}} ship with a spray of salt water from the firefighting system when nuclear attack appeared <b>imminent.</b> The film of flowing water would theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made}} to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from what was perceived as an <b>imminent</b> Confederate attack. Many of the makeshift trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Runyon.|$|E
5|$|From Forum Iulii, Alboin next reached Aquileia, {{the most}} {{important}} road junction in the northeast, and the administrative capital of Venetia. The <b>imminent</b> arrival of the Lombards had a considerable impact on the city's population; the Patriarch of Aquileia Paulinus fled with his clergy and flock to the island of Grado in Byzantine-controlled territory.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{apparition}} of 1456 {{was also}} witnessed in Kashmir and depicted {{in great detail}} by Śrīvara, a Sanskrit poet and biographer to the Sultans of Kashmir. He read the apparition as a cometary portent of doom foreshadowing the <b>imminent</b> fall of Sultan Zayn al-Abidin (AD 1418/1420–1470).|$|E
5|$|However, {{the emperor}} was later unable {{to cope with}} the {{mounting}} incursions of Ottoman forces, Hungarian invasions from the northwest and the Black Death. In an ill-fated attempt to combat these problems, he divided the country between his two sons, thus forcing it to face the <b>imminent</b> Ottoman conquest weakened and divided.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Betances {{attempted}} {{to use his}} diplomatic contacts to impede a Puerto Rico annexation by the United States, which was deemed <b>imminent</b> by the events following {{the sinking of the}} USS Maine. He knew that Puerto Ricans would welcome an American invasion, but was vehement about the possibility of the United States not conceding independence to Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Paul began {{appearing}} in infomercials warning about an upcoming financial meltdown {{as a result}} of the <b>imminent</b> crash of the world’s currencies. He urges listeners to read America 2020: The Survival Blueprint, a book written by Porter Stansberry.|$|E
5|$|In March 2017, after heavy {{fighting}} damaged the {{main control panel}} at the dam and disabled the hydroelectric power station, ISIL warned of the <b>imminent</b> collapse of the Tabqa Dam, during a joint US/SDF operation to capture the dam. SDF forces announced they captured the dam on 10 May 2017.|$|E
5|$|In September 1841, Hermano Pule {{traveled}} from Manila to Bay, Laguna {{to meet with}} the cofradía members that evaded capture. Anticipating an <b>imminent</b> attack, Pule and Purgatorio rallied 4,000 followers at Barrio Isabang on the slopes of Mount Banahaw. A group of pagan Aetas from Sierra Madre also allied themselves with the cofradía.|$|E
5|$|Michael Douglas reprises {{his role}} as Gordon Gekko, which won him an Academy Award after the {{original}} film. Gekko has recently been released from prison and, after a failed attempt to warn business leaders of the <b>imminent</b> economic downturn, he decides to try to rebuild a relationship with his estranged daughter Winnie.|$|E
5|$|Non-war related {{free speech}} rights were also {{advanced}} during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a Ku Klux Klan member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision Brandenburg v. Ohio, which held that only speech which advocated <b>imminent</b> violence could be outlawed.|$|E
5|$|On January28 while Firinga was {{approaching}} Réunion, {{officials on the}} island issued a level1 tropical cyclone alert on the Organisation de la Réponse de SÉcurité Civile (ORSEC) plan. By the next day, this was raised to a level3 when landfall was <b>imminent.</b> The government of Mauritius also warned {{the citizens of the}} approach of the storm.|$|E
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an <b>imminent</b> attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of <b>imminent</b> hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E
5|$|Operation Graffham was a {{military}} deception employed by the Allies during the Second World War. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic deception designed to disguise the <b>imminent</b> Allied invasion of Normandy. Graffham provided political support to the visual and wireless deception of Operation Fortitude North. These operations together created a fictional threat to Norway {{during the summer of}} 1944.|$|E
5|$|Radar-equipped Japanese {{reconnaissance}} aircraft sighted various task {{groups of the}} Third Fleet throughout {{the day and night}} of 11October, giving area commanders on Formosa and in the Philippines early warning. Knowing that dawn strikes on 12October were <b>imminent,</b> ground forces were placed on alert and aircraft were readied for early morning intercept.|$|E
5|$|Rumours spread {{throughout}} London that more rioting was <b>imminent,</b> including in Bermondsey and the Wood Green shopping centre near Broadwater Farm. On 1 October, there were disturbances in Toxteth, Liverpool, {{and on the}} same day police stopped and searched all vehicles entering the Farm, finding a petrol bomb there the next day, David Rose wrote in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Secrecy for the {{operation}} was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of {{the operation}} and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire. British signals intelligence (Ultra) recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation was <b>imminent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an <b>imminent</b> Egyptian {{collapse}} caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack.

The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day.|$|E
5|$|Slowly {{fighting}} {{their way}} up the Italian peninsula, the Allies took Rome and then Florence in the summer of 1944 and later that year they began advancing into northern Italy. With the final collapse of the German army's Gothic Line in April 1945, total defeat for the Salò Republic and its German protectors was <b>imminent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The PHC {{believes}} in the <b>imminent,</b> personal, premillennial second coming of Jesus Christ. It will occur in two stages: the first stage will be the rapture of the saints before the Tribulation, and the second stage {{will be at the}} end of the Tribulation when Christ will return to defeat the Antichrist, judge the nations of the world, and begin his millennial reign.|$|E
5|$|The XXII Corps was {{supported}} by the majority of the Yildirim Army's heavy artillery for counter battery operations. Here, three of the five Ottoman Army heavy artillery batteries in Palestine (the 72nd, 73rd and 75th Batteries) were deployed. Further, the Ottoman front line regiments had been alerted that a major attack was <b>imminent.</b>|$|E

Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) is frantic because Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is still missing and Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) health threatens his {{marriage}} to Phoebe (Emily Mortimer).|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} Japan in December 1941, and the <b>imminent</b> threat of invasion saw the 6th and 7th Divisions transferred to the Far East in early 1942. In March, Morshead was given command of all Australian forces in the Mediterranean theatre, and was promoted to lieutenant general, while still remaining commander of the 9th Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{undertaken}} rapidly, and 24 sites were completed and garrisoned {{by the end}} of 1540, with almost all of the rest finished {{by the end of}} 1543. By the time they were completed, however, the alliance between Charles and Francis had collapsed and the threat of <b>imminent</b> invasion was over.|$|E
