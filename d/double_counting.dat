25|$|A {{combinatorial}} proof {{establishes the}} equivalence of different expressions {{by showing that}} they count the same object in different ways.

25|$|A pointed pseudotriangulation with v {{vertices}} {{must have}} exactly 2v − 3 edges. This follows {{by a simple}} <b>double</b> <b>counting</b> argument involving the Euler characteristic: as each face but the outer one is a pseudotriangle, with three convex angles, the pseudotriangulation must have 3f − 3 convex angles between adjacent edges. Each edge is the clockwise edge for two angles, {{so there are a}} total of 2e angles, of which all but v are convex. Thus, 3f − 3 = 2e − v. Combining this with the Euler equation f − e + v = 2 and solving the resulting simultaneous linear equations gives e = 2v − 3.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} proof {{works by}} <b>double</b> <b>counting.</b> It goes as follows: Count {{the number of}} ordered triples of vertices, x, y, z, such that the edge, (xy), is red and the edge, (yz), is blue. Firstly, any given vertex will be the middle of either 0×5=0 (all edges from the vertex are the same colour), 1×4=4 (four are the same colour, one is the other colour), or 2×3=6 (three are the same colour, two are the other colour) such triples. Therefore, there are at most 6×6=36 such triples. Secondly, for any non-monochromatic triangle (xyz), there exist precisely two such triples. Therefore, there are at most 18 non-monochromatic triangles. Therefore, at least 2 of the 20 triangles in the K6 are monochromatic.|$|E

2500|$|The mela {{system of}} ragas was first propounded by Raamamaatya {{in his work}} Svaramelakalanidhi c. 1550. He is {{considered}} the father of mela system of ragas. Later Venkatamakhin expounded in the 17th century in his work Caturdandi Prakaasikaa a new mela system known today as melakarta. He had made some bold and controversial claims and defined somewhat arbitrarily 6 swaras from the known 12 semitones, at that time, to arrive at 72 melakarta ragas. The controversial parts relate to <b>double</b> <b>counting</b> of R2 (and similar swaras) and his exclusive selection of madyamas {{for which there is}} no specific reasoning (also known as asampurna melas as opposed to sampurna ragas). [...] However, today the 72 melakarta ragas use a standardized pattern, unlike Venkatamakhin's pattern, and have gained significant following. Govindhacharya is credited with standardization of rules and giving a different name for such standard ragas, which have different structure but same swaras as that proposed by Venkatamakhin. The scales in this page are those proposed by Govindhacharya.|$|E
2500|$|Melchior {{observed}} that, for any graph {{embedded in}} the real projective plane, the formula V'E+F must equal 1, the Euler characteristic of the projective plane. Here V, E, and F, are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the graph, respectively. Any [...] nontrivial line arrangement on the projective plane defines a graph in which each face is bounded by at least three edges, and each edge bounds two faces; so, <b>double</b> <b>counting</b> gives the additional inequality F≤2E/3. Using this inequality to eliminate F from the Euler characteristic leads to the inequality E≤3V3. But if every vertex in the arrangement were the crossing point of three or more lines, then {{the total number of}} edges would be at least 3V, contradicting this inequality. Therefore, some vertices must be the crossing point of only two lines, and as Melchior's more careful analysis shows, at least three ordinary vertices are needed in order to satisfy the inequality E≤3V3.|$|E
