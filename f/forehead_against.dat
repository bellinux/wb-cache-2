60|$|She whispered them at last. Not bravely, at all. Feebly, haltingly, with {{a little}} sob: her <b>forehead</b> pressed <b>against</b> the cold iron seat, as if that could help her.|$|R
6000|$|Graham {{shook off}} the {{paralysis}} {{of his first}} astonishment. He struck his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> Lincoln's and bawled, [...] "What is this darkness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, what is impossible?" [...] murmured {{the young}} man, {{going over to}} the window, and leaning his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> the cold, mist-stained glass.|$|E
60|$|On {{the summit}} he {{fell on his}} knees and knelt {{at the foot of the}} Cross, leaning his aching <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> the cold, dank wood.|$|E

6000|$|... “I’ll bang myself {{against the}} tree!” he cried, and, rushing {{up to the}} nearest {{hardwood}} tree, he brought his <b>forehead</b> up <b>against</b> the bark. A thump was heard and each time his head went forward another thump followed.|$|R

60|$|Clyffurde {{went up to}} {{the tall}} hearth. He rested his hand on the ledge of the mantel and leaning his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> it he stared moodily into the fire.|$|E
60|$|With his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> the window, Armine {{watched and}} did his utmost to repress the eagerness {{that seemed to}} irritate his brother, and at last gave vent to an irrepressible hurrah.|$|E
60|$|The {{memory was}} {{intolerable}} now. She rose--restless and feverish--and {{stood by the}} fire, {{one hand on the}} high mantel-shelf, her <b>forehead</b> resting <b>against</b> that hand, one foot on the fender, and her aching eyes gazing into the red hot glow.|$|R
5000|$|In the episode's last scene, Blair goes to Brooklyn. Dan isn't expecting her, {{as he is}} {{assuming}} she {{got back}} together with Chuck. Blair tells him that she isn't there to tell him off and she isn't with Chuck. Dan cracks a joke that clearly expresses his disbelief and surprise at Blair choosing him over the [...] "love of her life," [...] Chuck. She tells him that she told Chuck that he doesn't have her heart anymore as it now belongs to someone else. They kiss and rest their <b>foreheads</b> <b>against</b> each other's. Blair calls him {{by his first name}} which amuses Dan and he asks her to [...] "say it again" [...] and they start kissing passionately.|$|R

60|$|Through {{his head}} went {{a medley of}} sayings to soothe {{children}} that are hurt; but he felt unsteady, unlike himself. And suddenly she knelt, and put her hot <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} shot, dear Lena," [...] Heyst {{said in a}} steady voice, while Davidson, at the question, turned away and leaned his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> the post of {{the foot of the}} bed.|$|E
6000|$|... [There is a moment's silence. DAISY passes {{her hand}} over her [...] <b>forehead.</b> <b>Against</b> her will she is strangely {{impressed}} by what LEE [...] TAI has said. She gives a little shudder and recovers herself.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid her}} hands upon his <b>forehead,</b> her cheek <b>against</b> his--smooth and cold--exquisitely {{refreshing}} {{it seemed to}} his jaded nerves.|$|R
60|$|I saw her shrug her {{uncovered}} shoulders impatiently. Her <b>forehead</b> was <b>against</b> {{the very}} {{blackness of the}} panes; pulled upward from the beautiful, strong nape of her neck, the twisted mass of her tawny hair was held high upon her head by the arrow of gold.|$|R
6000|$|With {{the curious}} little {{movement}} {{of one who}} sees something he [...] does not like to see, he goes.

60|$|The priest {{passed his}} hand {{several times over}} his face. Then, resting his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> his hand, he leaned towards the grating and, with eyes still averted, spoke slowly. His voice was weary and old.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the gentleman {{had gone up}} to the mantelpiece, {{right in front of}} the fire, and had laid his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> the mantelpiece (which it is a low one, and brought him into the attitude of leap-frog), and had heaved a tremenjous sigh. His hair was long and lightish; and when he laid his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> the mantelpiece, his hair all fell in a dusty fluff together over his eyes; and when he now turned round and lifted up his head again, it all fell in a dusty fluff together over his ears. This give him a wild appearance, similar to a blasted heath.|$|E
5000|$|Copy-robots - Androids {{which are}} given to Permen from Superman to help keep their secret. Each one {{transforms}} into a clone {{of the person who}} pushes a button on its nose. The memories of that copy robot can also be transferred to the original person by placing both <b>foreheads</b> <b>against</b> each other. In the first series, the robot had a red nose that remained visible even after the transformation, and they often were deactivated by well-meaning people trying to wipe their noses clean. The duplication procedure also copies whatever clothing or items that are on the activator's person, which landed Mitsuo in trouble on a few occasions for abusing this property. These made a cameo in the Doraemon series as one of his many gadgets from the future.|$|R
60|$|Almanz. It pleases me your army is so great; For now I know there's more {{to conquer}} yet. By heaven!

60|$|His story being {{ended with}} his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, {{this way and}} that, and very soon were sleeping.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Berta!' said Picotee, close beside her. She was {{kneeling}} {{in front of}} the couch, and now flinging her arm across Ethelberta's shoulder and shaking violently, she pressed her <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> her sister's temple, and breathed out upon her cheek: ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Had to in one place,” {{said the}} stolid constable. “I sent a keeper to fetch a spade. When he heard me {{scraping}} {{the ground with}} it he leaned his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> a tree, and was as sick as a dog.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've {{nothing to}} do with it,' she began coldly; but Mrs. Boulte's sobs overcame her, and she {{addressed}} herself to the man. 'I don't know what I am to say, Captain Kurrell. I don't know what I can call you. I think you've you've behaved abominably, and she has cut her <b>forehead</b> terribly <b>against</b> the table.' ...|$|R
40|$|HE SAT on the sidewalk, {{a compact}} little unit; legs crossed {{and his head}} down between his knees. Danny 2 ̆ 7 s <b>forehead</b> pressed <b>against</b> the sidewalk.

Also, I thought, like the spines {{on the back of}} a dinosaur [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{the kiss}} {{he had seen}} her give the pillow afflicted him with sudden headiness, and he went up to her. Touching her eyes with his lips, he thought with queer excitement: 'I've done it! Yesterday all was sudden--anyhow; but now--I've done it!' The girl let her <b>forehead</b> rest <b>against</b> his lips, which moved {{downwards}} till they reached hers. That first real lover's kiss-strange, wonderful, still almost innocent--in which heart did it make the most disturbance? ...|$|R
