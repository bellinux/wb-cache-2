5|$|The Stella power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood {{on either side of}} a bend of the River Tyne: Stella South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and Stella North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby Stella Hall, a manor house close to Stella South that by the time of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British electrical supply industry until two years after the <b>Electricity</b> <b>Act</b> of 1989, when the industry passed into the private sector.|$|E

25|$|The key {{development}} {{objectives of the}} power sector is supply of electricity to all areas including rural areas as mandated in section 6 of the <b>Electricity</b> <b>Act.</b> Both the central government and state governments would jointly endeavour to achieve this objective at the earliest. Consumers, particularly those {{who are ready to}} pay a tariff which reflects efficient costs have the right to get uninterrupted twenty four hours supply of quality power. About 56% of rural households have not yet been electrified even though many of these households {{are willing to pay for}} electricity. Determined efforts should be made to ensure that the task of rural electrification for securing electricity access to all households and also ensuring that electricity reaches poor and marginal sections of the society at reasonable rates is completed within the next five years. India is using Renewable Sources of Energy like Hydel Energy, Wind Energy, and Solar Energy to electrify villages.|$|E
25|$|The Fire Services Act 1947 {{introduced}} a new pension scheme for fire-fighters, while the <b>Electricity</b> <b>Act</b> 1947 introduced better retirement benefits for workers in that industry. A Workers' Compensation (Supplementation) Act was passed in 1948 that introduced benefits for workers with certain asbestos-related diseases which had occurred before 1948. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1948 and the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act of 1949 were passed to improve conditions for seamen. The Shops Act of 1950 consolidated previous legislation which provided {{that no one could}} be employed in a shop for more than six hours without having a break for at least 20 minutes. The legislation also required a lunch break of at least 45 minutes for anyone for worked between 11:30am and 2:30pm and a half-hour tea break for anyone working between 4pm and 7pm. The government also strengthened a Fair Wages Resolution, with a clause that required all employers getting government contracts to recognise the rights of their workers to join trade unions.|$|E

50|$|Biogas {{production}} in Germany has developed rapidly {{over the last}} 20 years. The main reason is the legally created frameworks. Government support of renewable energy started in 1991 with the <b>Electricity</b> Feed-in <b>Act</b> (StrEG).

In 2000 the <b>Electricity</b> Feed-in <b>Act</b> {{was replaced by the}} Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). This law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over 20 years.
