5|$|After {{months of}} speculation, on May 23, 1994, Top Rank {{successfully}} purchased the franchise for $152.5 million {{with the intention}} of relocating it to New Orleans. The purchase occurred following an agreement between Top Rank and Timberwolves ownership that allowed Top Rank to purchase the franchise if no local ownership groups were found by May 20, 1994. On June 6, 1994, Top Rank officially filed the paperwork to the NBA seeking to relocate the Timberwolves to New Orleans for the 1994–95 NBA season. The <b>filings</b> also identified Fred Hofheinz as the sole Top Rank stockholder, with Houston lawyer John O'Quinn and stockbroker Robert Higley serving as the team's major partners.|$|E
5|$|Copeland was {{considered}} a prodigy who rose to stardom despite not starting ballet {{until the age of}} 13. By age 15, her mother and ballet teachers, who were serving as her custodial guardians, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, Copeland, who was already an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal issues involved <b>filings</b> for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. Both sides dropped legal proceedings, and Copeland moved home to begin studying under a new teacher who was a former ABT member.|$|E
5|$|Lehman Brothers sold One Times Square in 1997 to the Jamestown, L.P. for $117 million. <b>Filings</b> {{related to}} the sale {{revealed}} that the billboards on the tower had been generating a net revenue of $7 million yearly, representing a 300% profit. With growing tourism and high traffic in the Times Square area (with a yearly average of over 100 million pedestriansalongside its prominence in media coverage of New Year's festivities, seen by a wide audience yearly), annual revenue from the signs grew to over $23 million by the year 2012rivaling London's Piccadilly Circus as the most valuable public advertising space in the world.|$|E

5|$|Schulze, {{with its}} {{signature}} Butternut Bread, eventually became Interstate Bakeries Corporation/Hostess Brands. The business was once Chicago's largest wholesale business entity. Although, according to Form 10-K <b>filings</b> by the Interstate Bakeries Corporation with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schulze Baking Company was not formed until 1927, many records contradict this claim. Historical accounts of Chicago claim that Paul Schulze, 1910-11 {{president of the}} National Association of Master Bakers, started the Schulze Baking Company in 1893 with his brothers. Interstate's own company history even confirms the 1893 beginning of Schulze.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron <b>filings.</b> The flame that shot from the lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated tinder that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, {{the company}} shares traded at $2.01 per share. The {{value of the}} stock {{continued}} to grow steadily and by 1996, shares were trading at $2,300 per share; and hitting as high as $3,600 a share in 2003. Though not required to provide U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <b>filings,</b> the company does distribute similar-style reports to its shareholders annually, and in the 1930s and 40s, its annual earnings were reported in the Christian Science Monitor. In 1936, the company reported an net income of $195,077, up nearly $10,000 from its 1935 earnings of $185,320. As the company grew, so did its earnings. In 2001, the company reported sales of $91.4 million, giving it a net profit of $4.6 million. Sales began declining, and by 2007, they were down to $44,800,000.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application <b>filings,</b> and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Pitt and Jolie {{established}} a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world. The foundation made initial donations of $1million each to Global Action for Children and Doctors Without Borders, {{followed by an}} October 2006 donation of $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, an organization created {{in memory of the}} late American journalist Daniel Pearl. According to federal <b>filings,</b> Pitt and Jolie invested $8.5million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4million in 2006 and $3.4million in 2007. In June 2009 the Jolie-Pitt Foundation donated $1million to a U.N. refugee agency to help Pakistanis displaced by fighting between troops and Taliban militants. In January 2010 the foundation donated $1million to Doctors Without Borders for emergency medical assistance to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to running the museum, Nettie {{had a large}} role in running the Master Building as a whole; however, the exact division of responsibilities between Nettie and her husband is unclear. She was secretary of the corporation, although this may have been a nominal position as Louis and his lawyer prepared most of the corporation's correspondence and its <b>filings.</b> She also probably helped her husband decide to provide more than one million dollars toward achieving the Roeriches' spiritual and cultural ambitions. She met with the Roeriches and their other supporters in making plans for the Roerich Museum, Master Institute, Corona Mundi, and the other organizations housed in the Master Building. She was active as president of the Roerich Society and, after its demise, directed the Riverside Museum for many years.|$|E
5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature {{had been present}} during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent <b>filings</b> in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.|$|E
5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court <b>filings</b> include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right to remain silent. He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their <b>filings,</b> the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E
5|$|Ron (Nick Offerman) sends Leslie (Amy Poehler) to run {{an errand}} at the DMV in Pawnee Hall's fourth floor, a dark and unsettling place that {{includes}} probation offices and divorce <b>filings.</b> A reluctant and frightened Leslie navigates past reprobates and blood stains {{on the floor and}} spots Tom (Aziz Ansari) leaving the divorce office with his wife Wendy (Jama Williamson). Unaware that their relationship was a green card marriage to prevent Wendy from being deported back to Canada, Leslie later tries to comfort Tom, who insists he is fine. Nevertheless, Leslie persists in her efforts to cheer him up, in part by ordering a singing horse telegram to cheer him up. Ron, who knows about Tom's fake marriage, suggests Tom act sad so Leslie can feel like she cheered him up. When Leslie sets up a social event to cheer him up, Tom suggests a strip club, but Leslie follows Jerry's (Jim O'Heir) suggestion they go to the dinosaur-themed restaurant, Jurassic Fork.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{crews of}} the government's Department of Social Security (DSS) visited {{locations}} throughout the region, receiving damage claims, requests for monetary aid, and <b>filings</b> for unemployment benefits. The Commonwealth pledged to provide $150million in relief {{over a three-year}} period to the government of Queensland in exchange for deregulation; however, its offer was initially rejected. Planes flew claims adjusters and other officials to Innisfail, establishing an insurance emergency service in the city hall, while the Insurance Council of Queensland deployed its special emergency service employees for the first time. As a result of severe damage, a disaster declaration for northern regions was issued by Queensland Government on 4February. The first $10million in aid from the state government, paid by the federal government, was supplied the same day. Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures. Looters took advantage of confusion in the days following the cyclone, striking residences throughout Innisfail. By the end of the day, 2200tarpaulins had been distributed; however, the previously-smooth relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms in Cairns.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the cyclone, the Australian government distributed financial and emergency aid, offering to provide assistance to hard-hit banana and sugar cane farmers in northern Queensland. Hundreds of State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers were deployed to restore electrical and water services, evacuate local citizens, provide food, and repair and protect structures. The Department of Social Security (DSS) sent employees to receive claims for damage, requests for financial aid, and <b>filings</b> for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth of Australia initiated a three-year, $150million program to provide relief to damaged areas. Fund payments, however, were frequently incorrectly distributed, and in some cases, fraudulent. In the confusion in the days following the cyclone, looters stole possessions in areas within the vicinity of Innisfail, and relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms at Cairns. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) was subject to heavy criticism in the days following the storm's landfall, accused of not giving ample warning in advance of Winifred's approach; however, these concerns were later addressed in its report on the cyclone's impact. Due to the severity of the storm's damage, the name Winifred was retired after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} paratroops some {{artillery}} support, Lieutenant Colonel Alan Blyth of the 2/4th Field Regiment proposed dropping {{some of its}} eight short 25-pounders by parachute. A call went out for volunteers and four officers and 30 other ranks were selected. On 30 August, Vasey watched them carry out a practice jump at Rogers Airfield. This {{turned out to be}} the easy part. Brand new guns were received from the 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot at Port Moresby on 23 August. Two were handed over for training while, as a precaution, the remaining six were sent the 2/117th Field Workshops for inspection and checking. All six were condemned, owing to a number of serious defects in assembly and manufacture. On 30 August, the gunners received orders to move out the next day, so the 2/51st Light Aid Detachment cannibalised six guns to produce two working guns, which were proofed by firing 20 rounds per gun. Only one was ready in time to leave with the gunners so the other followed on a special flight. Eight of the 2/4th Field Regiment’s Mark II 25-pounders were also condemned owing to the presence of <b>filings</b> in the buffer system. Vasey was less than impressed.|$|E
