25|$|In 1940, {{the first}} <b>electron</b> <b>micrograph</b> of a {{bacteriophage}} was published and this silenced sceptics who {{had argued that}} bacteriophages were relatively simple enzymes and not viruses.|$|E
25|$|Pollen is {{produced}} in the microsporangia in the male cone of a conifer or other gymnosperm or in the anthers of an angiosperm flower. Pollen grains come {{in a wide variety}} of shapes, sizes, and surface markings characteristic of the species (see <b>electron</b> <b>micrograph,</b> right). Pollen grains of pines, firs, and spruces are winged. The smallest pollen grain, that of the forget-me-not (Myosotis spp.), is around 6µm (0.006mm) in diameter. Wind-borne pollen grains can be as large as about 90–100µm.|$|E
500|$|The {{virus is}} {{transmitted}} by the faecal-oral route. It infects and damages the cells {{that line the}} small intestine and causes gastroenteritis (which is often called [...] "stomach flu" [...] despite having no relation to influenza). Although rotavirus was discovered in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by <b>electron</b> <b>micrograph</b> images and accounts for approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children, its importance has historically been underestimated within the public health community, particularly in developing countries. In addition to its impact on human health, rotavirus also infects animals, and is a pathogen of livestock.|$|E
