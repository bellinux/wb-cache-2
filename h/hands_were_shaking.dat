500|$|When {{asked about}} Gorbachev, Yanayev replied [...] "Let {{me say that}} Mikhail Gorbachev is now on vacation. He is {{undergoing}} treatment, himself, in our country. He is very tired after these many years and he will need some time to get better." [...] At a press conference Yanayev's <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> rather violently, leading many journalists to focus on Yanayev's apparent drunkenness instead of Gorbachev's allegedly bad health.|$|E
2500|$|The {{magazine}} hired Robert Capa, {{the distinguished}} war photographer. A veteran of Collier's magazine, Capa accompanied {{the first wave}} of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944. A mishap at the Life photography darkroom ruined dozens of Capa's photos which he had taken during the beach landing. [...] The magazine wrote in the captions that the photos were fuzzy because Capa's <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking.</b> He denied it, and later poked fun at Life by titling his war memoir Slightly Out of Focus (1947). In 1954, Capa was killed after stepping on a landmine, while working for the magazine covering the First Indochina War. Life photographer Bob Landry also went in with the first wave at D-Day, [...] "but all of Landry's film was lost, and his shoes to boot." ...|$|E
60|$|The Doctor {{was terribly}} agitated. His <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> like {{leaves in the}} wind.|$|E
60|$|Slackwater Charley got out his revolver, but his <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking,</b> {{as with a}} chill, and he fumbled.|$|R
60|$|With {{enthusiasm and}} a shout of laughter, the toast was pledged in cocoa-nut milk, {{and once again}} Christian's <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> by his comrades all round.|$|R
6000|$|... "Present, citizen!" [...] came in {{immediate}} response. And a tall {{figure in the}} tattered uniform affected by the revolutionary guard stepped briskly out of the crowd. Chauvelin's claw-like <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> visibly.|$|R
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} Duke, and I was {{surprised}} to see that his <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking.</b> For a man who rarely displayed feeling the Duke seemed to be wonderfully affected.|$|E
60|$|He {{was sitting}} on the couch, white-faced, one sea-boot in his hands, and I could have sworn his <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking.</b> That much I saw, and the next moment was out on deck.|$|E
60|$|Monty mumbled for {{a moment}} or two and was silent. A look of dull {{disappointment}} struggled with the vacuity of his face. Trent noticed that his <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> pitifully and his eyes were bloodshot.|$|E
60|$|About midnight Hendry {{climbed the}} attic stair and joined {{me at the}} window. His <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> as he pulled back the blind. I {{began to realize that}} his heart could still overflow.|$|R
6000|$|... (Dowsett {{proceeds}} rather limply {{across to}} join group at tea-table.) (Chalmers and Hubbard enter from right, laughing about something. At sight of Starkweather they immediately become sober.) (No <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> <b>shaken.</b> Starkweather barely acknowledges Hubbard's greeting.) ...|$|R
60|$|The banker's clerk took up {{the lamp}} and led the way. But he paused in the passage outside the door, and his <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking,</b> so that the light flickered {{up and down the}} high, bare walls.|$|R
60|$|Caligula was livid. He had {{donned a}} dark woollen robe {{and his head}} was uncovered. His knees, arms and <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> and his mouth opened and closed {{as if he were}} gasping for breath. His eyes were bloodshot and staring out of his head like those of a man who is being strangled.|$|E
60|$|If I had had {{any doubt}} but that tragedy was afoot that morning {{it would have}} been banished by a glance at her face. She was terribly pale; her <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking.</b> Rapidly she withdrew the pins from her hat, hung it upon a peg and {{smoothed}} her hair in front of the looking-glass. Then, though her hands were trembling all the time, she filled a bowl with hot water and arranged a manicure set on a little table.|$|E
60|$|And all the while, {{with the}} face of a man forced into the {{presence}} of tragedy, Lord Chelsford was reading that letter. When he had finished his <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> and his face was grey. He moved over to the fireplace, and, without a moment's hesitation, he thrust the letter into the flames. Not content with that, he stood over it, poker in hand, and beat the ashes into powder. Then he turned to the door.|$|E
60|$|Giles Faswig strode {{up to the}} {{two young}} hunters and caught Snap by the arm. The next instant the <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> off violently and the youth stood before the man with blazing eyes and doubled-up fists.|$|R
50|$|When playing, {{a pair of}} chácaras is held in each hand, {{secured by}} the cord, and the <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> <b>shaken.</b> The macho (male) chácara, with a deeper sound, held in one hand, sets the rhythm, and the hembra (female) chácara, in the other <b>hand,</b> <b>is</b> the one that chimes.|$|R
60|$|She {{sank into}} a chair, leaning back, with her knees crossed; {{and at that}} moment Noel admired her. She had said it beautifully; she looked so calm. Fort was {{lighting}} her cigarette; his <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking,</b> his face all sorry and mortified.|$|R
60|$|Violet {{felt the}} same; and {{in fear and}} {{trembling}} begged Theodora to call Percy. She knew herself {{to be responsible for}} the danger, but saw the impossibility of preventing the interview without still greater risk. Indeed, while Theodora delayed Percy with cautions, impatience, and the fear of being disappointed, were colouring each sunken cheek with a spot of burning red, the <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> uncontrollably, and the breath was shorter than ever, so that she was on the point of going to hasten the visitor, when he knocked at the door.|$|E
6000|$|A {{note for}} her! Could {{it be that}} her friends had arrived and had managed {{to send a message}} to her? It must be so. She took it from the maid. As she did so she noticed that the other's <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> as though she had the ague. [...] "You are not well, Rebecca," [...] said Kate kindly. [...] "Oh yes, I am. You read your note and don't mind me," [...] the girl answered, in her usual surly fashion. Instead of leaving the room, she was bustling about the bed as though putting things in order.|$|E
60|$|It was an {{absolute}} relief {{to her when she}} entered the ambulance, for the continued roar of the guns and the thought {{of what was going on}} were well nigh intolerable to her nerves, and her <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> as she removed her bonnet and cloak. Even the quiet hospital tents shared in the excitement outside. The patients whose hurts were comparatively slight were sitting up in their beds discussing the battle eagerly. Others more seriously hurt raised their heads to listen, while some lying apparently unconscious moaned and moved uneasily, muttering occasionally incoherent words, the quiver in earth and air arousing a dim sense of battle and danger.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{who ever}} heard of heart disease in the Forrests?" [...] he muttered, as, still sitting, leaning against the pillar for support, he mopped his face dry. His <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking,</b> and he felt a slight nausea from an {{internal}} quivering that still persisted.|$|R
6000|$|But {{this was}} his first editor, and under the {{circumstances}} he did not desire to scare him too abruptly. To his surprise, Mr. Ford leaped into {{the air with a}} [...] "You don't say so!" [...] and the next moment, with both <b>hands,</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> Martin's <b>hand</b> effusively.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} stood stockily. He seemed to swell as his {{somewhat}} muddy <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> directly at, under, {{and about the}} circumference of, Adolph Zolzac's hairy nose. The farmer was stronger, but he retreated. He took up the reins. He whined, [...] "Don't I get nothing I break de harness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now are {{you both}} ready?" [...] I said, as people {{do when they}} are going to fire a mine. There was no answer, so I took the big key, rubbed some salad oil into the wards, and after one or two bad shots, for my <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking,</b> managed to fit it, and shoot the lock. Leo bent over and caught the massive lid in both his hands, and with an effort, for the hinges had rusted, forced it back. Its removal {{revealed}} another case covered with dust. This we extracted from the iron chest without any difficulty, and removed the accumulated filth of years from it with a clothes-brush.|$|E
60|$|There was no answer. Dick waited till {{he could}} regain {{some sort of}} control over himself. His <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking,</b> and he prided himself on their steadiness; he could feel that his lips were quivering, and the sweat was running down his face. He was lashed by fear, driven forward {{by the desire to}} get to work at once and {{accomplish}} something, and maddened by the refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news {{that he was about to}} go blind. 'It's a humiliating exhibition,' he thought, 'and I'm glad Torp isn't here to see. The doctor said I was to avoid mental worry.|$|E

60|$|Maisie {{would have}} wept on the least encouragement, but Dick's indifference, albeit his <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{as he picked}} up the pistol, {{restrained}} her. She lay panting on the beach while Dick methodically bombarded the breakwater. 'Got it at last!' he exclaimed, as a lock of weed flew from the wood.|$|R
60|$|Gorman made an effort. The knife was dull. He was weak. Besides, his <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{so violently}} that he nearly dropped the knife. The three boys were {{crouched}} apart, in a huddle, crying and sobbing. With {{the exception of}} Mahoney, the men were gathered about the victim, craning their necks to see.|$|R
50|$|The joy buzzer {{was invented}} in 1928 by Soren Sorensen Adams of the S.S. Adams Co. It was modeled after another product, The Zapper, which {{was similar to the}} joy buzzer, but did not have a very {{effective}} buzz and contained a button that had a blunt point which would hurt the person whose <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "My <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> when I {{tried to}} play, {{because she was}} {{right there in the}} control room," [...] he says. [...] "There was no way I could do it with her around, so I came back and did it later." ...|$|E

5000|$|With Norah Buckland, {{the wife}} of a vicar, she {{launched}} the Clean Up TV Campaign in January 1964 with a manifesto appealing to the [...] "women of Britain". The campaign's first public meeting on 5 May 1964 was held in Birmingham's Town Hall. Richard Whitehouse, one of her sons, recalled in 2008: [...] "Coaches arrived from all over the country. Two thousand people poured in and suddenly there was my mother on a podium inspiring them to rapturous applause. Her <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking.</b> But she didn't stop".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the basic}} jazz hands position, the <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> open, the palms face forward, and the fingers are splayed; in {{addition}} sometimes the <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> <b>shaken</b> and the fingers are moving. [...] 🤗 The arm is often straight. Gus Giordano describes the {{position as the}} [...] "palm of the hand facing forward with fingers stretched". Frank Hatchett instructs dancers to [...] "spread fingers (jazz hands); face palms front".|$|R
60|$|The note {{of bitter}} resentment, of wounded pride and {{smouldering}} hatred {{became more and}} more marked while he spoke: his voice now sounded hoarse and his throat seemed dry. Presently he raised his mug to his lips and drank eagerly, but his <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> visibly as he did this, and some of the wine was spilled on the table.|$|R
60|$|And {{then they}} had got hold of each other's <b>hands</b> and <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> them till I {{wondered}} their arms didn't come unscrewed.|$|R
