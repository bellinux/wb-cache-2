Smetana wrote that she had died [...] "gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet <b>drew</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> to her." [...] After placing Žofie with Kateřina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, by Liszt's pupil Peter Cornelius. This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, {{and fell in love with}} Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiová, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.|$|E

60|$|And {{then at the}} end of a week a man rode {{into the}} {{courtyard}} of Pagliano one day, and flung down from his horse shouting to be led to Messer Galeotto.

60|$|This {{little story}} entirely <b>drew</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> from the gay {{scene of the}} fête, and fixed it upon the {{beautiful}} Annette.

Several of the peasantry followed her in silence; and I felt too much interested, not to do the same.|$|E
60|$|The fascination of {{speculation}} was strong upon me.
