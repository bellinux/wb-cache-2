50|$|For {{the initial}} start {{up of the}} reactor neutron sources were located within the core to provide {{sufficient}} neutrons to initiate the nuclear reaction. Other aspects of the design included the use of <b>flux</b> <b>flattening</b> bars to even out (to some extent) the neutron flux density across the core. If not used, the flux in the centre would be very high relative to the outer areas making control more difficult and leading to excessive central temperatures. Each fuel channel would {{have a number of}} elements stacked one upon another to form a stringer. This required the presence of a latching mechanism to allow the stack to be withdrawn and handled. This caused some problems as the nemonic springs used contained cobalt, which became irradiated giving high gamma level when removed from the reactor. Additionally, thermocouples were attached to a number of elements and needed to be removed on fuel discharge from the reactor.|$|R
40|$|String theory {{models of}} axion monodromy {{inflation}} exhibit scalar potentials which are quadratic for small {{values of the}} inflaton field and evolve to a more complicated function for large field values. Oftentimes the large field behaviour is gentler than quadratic, lowering the tensor-to-scalar ratio. This effect, known as flattening, has been observed in the string theory context through {{the properties of the}} DBI+CS D-brane action. We revisit such flattening effects in type IIB flux compactifications with mobile D 7 -branes, with the inflaton identified with the D 7 -brane position. We observe that, with a generic choice of background <b>fluxes,</b> <b>flattening</b> effects are larger than previously observed, allowing to fit these models within current experimental bounds. In particular, we compute the cosmological observables in scenarios compatible with closed-string moduli stabilisation, finding tensor-to-scalar ratios as low as r ~ 0. 04. These are models of single field inflation in which the inflaton is much lighter than the other scalars through a mild tuning of the compactification data. Comment: 56 pages, 11 plot...|$|R
40|$|In January 1997 a large {{fleet of}} NASA and US {{military}} satellites provided {{the most complete}} observations to date {{of the changes in}} 3 ̆e 2 MeV electrons during a geomagnetic storm. Observations at geosynchronous orbit revealed a somewhat unusual two-peaked enhancement in relativistic electron fluxes [Reeves et al., 1998]. In the heart of the radiation belts at L ≈ 4, however, there was a single enhancement followed by a gradual decay. Radial profiles from the POLAR and GPS satellites revealed three distinct phases. (1) In the acceleration phase electron fluxes increased simultaneously at L ≈ 4 – 6. (2) During the passage of the cloud the radiation belts were shifted radially outward and then relaxed earthward. (3) For several days after the passage of the cloud the radial gradient of the <b>fluxes</b> <b>flattened,</b> increasing the <b>fluxes</b> at higher L-shells. These observations provide evidence that the acceleration of relativistic electrons takes place within the radiation belts and is rapid. Both magnetospheric compression and radial diffusion can cause a redistribution of electron fluxes within the magnetosphere that make the event profiles appear quite different when viewed at different L-shells...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, mechanical and economic characteristics of fast breeder reactor configurations containing an internal blanket has been performed. This design, called the parfait blanket concept, employs a layer of axial blanket fuel pellets at the core midplane in the fuel pins of the inner enrichment zone; otherwise, the design {{is the same as}} that of the conventional LMFBR's to which the parfait configuration was compared. Two significant advantages were identified for the parfait blanket concept relative to the conventional design. First, the parfait configuration has a 25 % smaller peak fast flux which reduces wrapper tube dilation by 37 % and fuel element elongation by 29 %; and second, axial and radial <b>flux</b> <b>flattening</b> contribute to a 7. 6 % reduction in the peak fuel burnup. Both characteristics significantly diminish the problems of fuel and metal swelling. Other advantages identified for a typical parfait design include: a 25 % reduction in the burnup reactivity swing, which reduces control rod requirements; a 7 % greater overpower operating margin; an increased breeding ratio, which offsets the disadvantage of a higher critical mass; and more favorable sodium voiding characteristics which counteract the disadvantage of an 8 % smaller power Doppler coefficient. All other characteristics investigated were found to differ insignificantly or slightly favor the parfait design. "January 1974. "Also issued as a Ph.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete theoretical framework for plasma turbulence and transport in tokamak plasmas. The fundamental scale separations present in plasma turbulence are codified as an asymptotic {{expansion in the}} ratio of the gyroradius to the equilibrium scale length. Proceeding order-by-order in this expansion, a framework for plasma turbulence is developed. It comprises an instantaneous equilibrium, the fluctuations driven by gradients in the equilibrium quantities, and the transport-timescale evolution of mean profiles of these quantities driven by the fluctuations. The equilibrium distribution functions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a rigid body. The magnetic equillibrium is obtained from the Grad-Shafranov equation for a rotating plasma and the slow (resistive) evolution of the magnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety factor q. Large-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given by neoclassical theory. The fluctuations are determined by the high-flow gyrokinetic equation, from which we derive the governing principle for gyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local cascade of free energy. Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature and flow velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the neoclassical corrections and the fluctuations act back upon the mean profiles through fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy conservation laws for the mean profiles are derived. Total energy is conserved and there is no net turbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of <b>fluxes</b> <b>flattening</b> gradients, Ohmic heating, and the equilibration of mean temperatures. Finally, this framework is condensed, in the low-Mach-number limit, to a concise set of equations suitable for numerical implementation. Comment: 113 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

Heat generation from the HTS windings requires to be suppressed as much as possible, when those coils are under operation with either direct or alternative currents.

With an outlook to cold recycling of sheet metals, this paper focuses on experimental quantification of damage and degradation in load carrying capacity due to forming process. Assuming that cold recycling of sheet metals involves an intermediate flattening prior to secondary forming process, the adverse effects of <b>flattening</b> on <b>material</b> was also investigated. An industrial cold roll forming process was taken as case study. Experimental investigation using microhardness mapping on the cross-section of fold zones, in conjunction with 3 D global-local FE modelling were the basis of through-thickness damage analysis. Taking advantage of strain-hardness correlation a new method was established to extrapolate hardness for ductile damage characterization. Investigation on sensitivity of the measured microhardness to crystallographic texture and sample surface preparation backed the experimental results. The results particularly outlined the progressive decrease in load carrying capacity of material after forming and after flattening.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on recent {{advances}} made in global gyrokinetic simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes and other microinstabilities. The nonlinear development and saturation of ITG modes and the role of E × B zonal flows are studied with a global nonlinear δf formulation that retains parallel nonlinearity and thus allows for a check of the energy conservation property as a means of verifying the quality of the numerical simulation. Due to an optimized loading technique, the conservation property is satisfied with an unprecedented quality well into the nonlinear stage. The zonal component of the perturbation evolves to a quasi-steady state with regions of ITG suppression, strongly reduced radial energy flux and steepened effective temperature profiles alternating with regions of higher ITG mode amplitudes, larger radial energy <b>flux</b> and <b>flattened</b> effective temperature profiles. A semi-Lagrangian approach free of statistical noise is proposed as an alternative to the nonlinear δf formulation. An ASDEX-Upgrade experiment with an internal transport barrier is analysed with a global gyrokinetic code that includes trapped electron dynamics. The weakly destabilizing effect of trapped electron dynamics on ITG modes in an axisymmetric bumpy configuration modelling W 7 -X is shown in global linear simulations that retain the full electron dynamics.

A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength. Platen pressure had little effect above the level required to <b>flatten</b> the <b>materials</b> for good contact. Bar sealing process window for each sample were developed. The optimum combination of platen temperature and dwell time for each laminated film can be obtained in the respective process windows. Strength of heat-seal and its failure modes are closely related. Plateau initiation temperature closely corresponds to the final melting point of sealant materials. Relatively higher platen temperature was required to seal laminated films with lower thermal conductance. Required dwell time corresponds closely to the heat flow rate of bar sealing process.

First are described, with their limitations and precisions, the different sensors following the in-flight hot particle parameters (trajectories, temperatures, velocities, sizes, and shapes). A few comments are also made about techniques, still under developments in laboratories, to improve our understanding of coating formation such as plasma jet temperature measurements in non-symmetrical conditions, hot gases heat <b>flux,</b> particles <b>flattening</b> and splats formation, particles evaporation. Then are described the illumination techniques by laser flash of either cold particles (those injected in hot gases, or in cold spray gun) or liquid injected into hot gases (suspensions or solutions). The possibilities they open to determine the flux and velocities of cold particles or visualize liquid penetration {{in the core of}} hot gases are discussed. Afterwards are presented sensors to follow, when spraying hot particles, substrate and coating temperature evolution, and the stress development within coatings during the spray process as well as the coating thickness. The different uses of these sensors are then described with successively: (i) Measurements limited to particle trajectories, velocities, temperatures, and sizes in different spray conditions: plasma (including transient conditions due to arc root fluctuations in d. c. plasma jets), HVOF, wire arc, cold spray.

The most remarkable spectral feature is a sharp drop, by a factor ~ 5, in the spectrum at 8 keV. This is a similar, but stronger, feature to that which we found in 1 H 0707 - 495. Significant flattening of the hard X-ray spectrum occurs when the source <b>flux</b> decreases. The <b>flattening</b> of the spectrum can be modelled as {{an increase in the}} column density of the absorbing material and/or its covering fraction. Below ~ 1. 5 keV the spectrum is dominated by a giant soft X-ray excess, and at around ~ 1. 2 keV there is a significant absorption feature detected, most probably due to ionized Fe L absorption. The new X-ray spectral properties detected with XMM-Newton in IRAS 13224 - 3809 support a partial covering interpretation, i. e. the presence of dense material inside the accretion-disc region partially obscuring the emission from the accretion disc. However, the sharpness of the feature, if due to photoelectric absorption, is surprising and may require an alternative explanation. One possibility which does fit the whole spectrum is that it is dominated by ionized reflection rather than absorption. The unusual spectral properties detected with XMM-Newton from Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies increase the known spectral complexity of active galactic nuclei and should further stimulate a combined theoretical and observational effort to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} physics of the innermost regions of AGN.

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} ability of the TG- 119 {{commissioning}} process and the IROC credentialing to detect errors in the commissioning process for a commercial treatment planning system. Methods: We introduced commissioning errors into the commissioning process for the Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA) within the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (TPS). We included errors in MLC Dosimetric Leaf Gap (DLG), electron contamination modeling parameters, incorrect <b>flattening</b> filter <b>material,</b> and beam profile measurement with an inappropriately large farmer chamber (simulated using sliding window smoothing of the input dose profiles). We evaluated the clinical impact of these errors for a variety of clinical intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans by looking at PTV D 99 and mean and max dose to OARs. The different cases included a head and neck plan, low and intermediate risk prostate plans, a lung plan, and a scalp plan. Finally, for the errors with substantial clinical impact, we determined the sensitivity of the commissioning & credentialing processes with the TG 119 C-shape and RPC IMRT head and neck phantoms. This was determined by comparing plans before and after commissioning errors were introduced in the commissioning process using the technique suggested by each respective organization. IROC IMRT credentialing includes film analysis at the midpoint between PTV and OAR using a 4 mm distance to agreement metric along with a 7 % TLD dose comparison. The TG 119 C-shape IMRT phantom looks at 3 separate dose planes and using gamma criteria of 3 % 3 mm. Results: The most clinically significant commissioning errors came from large changes in the MLC DLG with a change of 1 mm resulting in up to a 5 % change in the primary PTV D 99. This resulted in a discrepancy in the IROC TLDs in the PTVs and OARs of 7. 1 % and 13. 6 % respectively, which would have resulted in detection. While use of incorrect flattening filter caused only subtle errors (6 %). Conclusion: The AAA commissioning process within the Eclipse TPS is surprisingly robust to user error. When errors do occur, the IROC and T 119 commissioning credentialing criteria are effective at detecting them; however the OAR TLDs are the most sensitive to errors despite the IROC currently excluding them from their analysis.

Traditional solar panels used to power satellites can be bulky with heavy panels folded together using mechanical hinges. When launching into space, mass and volume are everything, and ROSA is 20 percent lighter and four times smaller in volume than rigid panel arrays. It is a flexible and rollable solar array like a measuring tape wound on its spool. The new solar array design rolls up to form a compact cylinder for launch with significantly less mass and volume, potentially offering substantial cost savings {{as well as an}} increase in power for satellites. Being smaller and lighter than the traditional solar panels, ROSA has a center wing made of a flexible material which support the strings of photovoltaic cells that churn out electrical energy. Both the sides of the wing have a narrow arm that extends through the length of the wing to provide support to the array, called a high strain composite boom.

40|$|A long-standing {{open issue}} of the {{paradigm}} of low-mass star formation is the luminosity problem: most protostars are less luminous than theoretically predicted. One possible solution is that the accretion process is episodic. FU Ori-type stars (FUors) {{are thought to be}} the visible examples for objects in the high accretion state. FUors are often surrounded by massive envelopes, which replenish the disk material and enable the disk to produce accretion outbursts. However, we have insufficient information on the envelope dynamics in FUors, about where and how mass transfer from the envelope to the disk happens. Here we present ALMA observations of the FUor-type star V 346 Nor at 1. 3 mm continuum and in different CO rotational lines. We mapped the density and velocity structure of its envelope and analyze the results using channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and spectro-astrometric methods. We found that V 346 Nor is surrounded by gaseous material on 10000 au scale in which a prominent outflow cavity is carved. Within the central ∼ 700 au, the circumstellar matter forms a <b>flattened</b> pseudo-disk where <b>material</b> is infalling with conserved angular momentum. Within ∼ 350 au, the velocity profile is more consistent with a disk in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 0. 1 M_. We determined an infall rate from the envelope onto the disk of 6 × 10 ^- 6 M_yr^- 1, a factor of few higher than the quiescent accretion rate from the disk onto the star, hinting for a mismatch between the infall and accretion rates as the cause of the eruption.

40|$|Background: Stereotactic body {{radiotherapy}} (SBRT) using {{flattening filter}} free (FFF) -techniques has been increasingly applied {{during the last}} years. However, clinical studies investigating this emerging technique are still rare. Hence, we analyzed toxicity and clinical outcome of pulmonary SBRT with FFF-techniques and performed dosimetric comparison to conventional techniques using <b>flattening</b> filters (FF). <b>Materials</b> and methods: Between 05 / 2014 and 06 / 2015, 56 consecutive patients with 61 pulmonary lesions were treated with SBRT in FFF-mode. Central lesions received 8 [*]×[*] 7. 5  Gy delivered to the conformally enclosing 80 %-isodose, while peripheral lesions were treated with 3 [*]×[*] 15  Gy, prescribed to the 65 %-isodose. Early and late toxicity (after 6  months) as well as initial clinical outcomes were evaluated. Furthermore, [deleted] plan quality and efficiency were evaluated by analyzing conformity, beam- on and total treatment delivery times in comparison to plans with FF-dose application. Results: Median follow-up time was 9. 3  months (range 1. 5 – 18. 0  months). Early toxicity was low with only 5 patients (8. 9  %) reporting CTCAE 2 ° or higher side-effects. Only one patient (1. 8  %) was diagnosed with radiation-induced pneumonitis CTCAE 3 °, while 2 (3. 6  %) patients suffered from pneumonitis CTCAE 2 °. After 6  months, no toxicity greater than CTCAE 2 ° was reported. 1 -year local progression-free survival, distant progression-free survival and overall survival were 92. 8  %, 78. 0  %, and 94. 4  %, respectively. While plan quality was similar for FFF- and FF-plans in respect to conformity (p[*]=[*] 0. 275), median beam-on {{time as well as}} total treatment time were significantly reduced for SBRT in FFF-mode compared to FF-mode (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001, p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Conclusions: Patient treatment with SBRT using FFF-techniques is safe and provides promising clinical results with only modest toxicity at significantly increased dose delivery speed...|$|R
40|$|Robust {{adhesion}} of polymers {{is necessary}} for applications in many industries; however, adhesion is poorly understood on a molecular level. Here, a surface and interface-sensitive nonlinear optical technique, sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy was used to study polymer adhesive surfaces and polymer/adhesive interfaces {{to gain a better}} understanding of polymer adhesion mechanisms. Silane adhesion promoters are often used to enhance the adhesion of elastomeric materials to polymer substrates. The interfacial structures of a known silane adhesion promoting mixture at polymer/liquid, silicone elastomer/liquid and polymer/silicone elastomer buried interfaces were studied with SFG and correlated to adhesion testing results. The silane adhesion promoters exhibited orientational order at all buried interfaces, implying that interfacial ordering of silane adhesion promoters may be necessary to enhance adhesion. Silane adhesion promoters cannot be used in microfluidics fabrication. In these applications, surface treatments are used to oxidize the silicone surface prior to adhesion, but due to hydrophohbic recovery these effects are temporary. Hydrophobic recovery can be slowed by removing extractable short chain oligomers from the silicone bulk. SFG analysis of silicone surfaces before and after extractable materials were removed showed that the silicone surface methyl group orientation changed after extractions. Also, the surface <b>flattened</b> after extractable <b>materials</b> were removed. These changes in surface structure may slow hydrophobic recovery, and therefore improve adhesion enhancement by oxidative surface treatments. Lastly, the adhesion of a different class of polymer adhesives, epoxy resins, was investigated. Epoxy resins are used as underfills in flip-chip devices, and adhesion failure of underfills can cause the flip-chip device to fail. Here, SFG was used to study the surface structures of model epoxy compounds before cure, after cure and after moisture exposure. Surface structural changes were observed for all three conditions, which may affect adhesion of epoxy underfills. Further, the buried interfacial structures of the cured epoxies and a model polymer were investigated before and after moisture exposure and correlated to adhesion testing results. These studies showed that SFG is a powerful technique to study polymer adhesion mechanisms and the surface and interfacial structures required for adhesion...|$|R
