5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenade</b> bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E
5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are armed with a single <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenade</b> and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are armed with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
500|$|That {{afternoon}} his platoon {{was conducting}} combat control operations {{in an effort}} to reduce and control sectarian violence in the area. While Private McGinnis was manning the M2 [...]50-caliber Machine Gun, a <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenade</b> thrown by an insurgent fell through the gunner's hatch into the vehicle. Reacting quickly, he yelled [...] "grenade," [...] allowing all four members of his crew to prepare for the grenade's blast. Then, rather than leaping from the gunner's hatch to safety, Private McGinnis made the courageous decision to protect his crew. In a selfless act of bravery, in which he was mortally wounded, Private McGinnis covered the live grenade, pinning it between his body and the vehicle and absorbing most of the explosion.|$|E

500|$|The {{awarding}} of the Freedom of the City was controversial {{in some quarters}} because of the far-from-clean reputation of RLI soldiers while off duty. [...] "The RLI's own brand of mayhem and havoc", in Binda's words, was infamous—while they were on rest and recuperation, alcohol-fuelled fights would routinely erupt in Salisbury bars and nightclubs between RLI men and their civilian counterparts over women, perceived bad service or simple misunderstandings. These sometimes led to the summoning of the police, but the soldiers' vehement, combative refusal to be arrested made this step somewhat counter-productive. Apart from these violent confrontations with civilian men and policemen, stunts pulled by off-duty RLI men often {{took the form of}} immature pranks on women: for example, soldiers would defecate in a girl's handbag while she was on the dancefloor, or sneak into the ladies' lavatories to rub extremely itchy buffalo beans on the seats and paper. Sometimes they went even further; on one occasion, two men were given a lift back to Cranborne Barracks by an elderly lady, whose handbag they then stole. On another night, an RLI soldier tossed a <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenade</b> into a taxi, then ran away. In the most extreme cases, men would be disciplined, but the Regiment's officers would often {{turn a blind eye to}} less serious incidents as they were so common.|$|E
2500|$|The No 6 was a {{concussion}} grenade. A variant of it called the [...] "No 7" [...] contained shrapnel, {{making it a}} primitive <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenade.</b> Pulling a loop {{at the top of}} the grenade ignited the fuse. Once the loop was pulled, the grenade was armed and had to be thrown immediately.|$|E
2500|$|British and Empire {{soldiers}} {{were instructed to}} throw the Mills bomb, a hand-held <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenade</b> using a technique {{similar to that of}} bowling a cricket ball. [...] Training classes were given on how to best do this. [...] A cartoon satirising this was published by Geoffrey Stobie in 1918. The image has two panes; in the left pane, a cricketer is about to deliver the ball, his left arm {{out in front of him}} and his right vertically down behind his back holding the ball. [...] In the right pane, this position is mirrored by a soldier, but rather than a cricket ball, he is holding a grenade in his right hand.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{well known}} {{use of the}} High-Low System was by the U.S. Army with the {{introduction}} of the M79 grenade launcher shortly before the Vietnam War. [...] The M79 fired a 40-mm shell which contained a standard <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenade</b> with a modified fuze. [...] The cartridge casing contained a heavy cup-shaped [...] "High Pressure Chamber" [...] in the bottom. [...] On firing, the propellant builds up pressure until it breaks through the copper cover, venting out to the [...] "Low Pressure Chamber". [...] The U.S. Army referred to their high-low system as the High-Low Propulsion System. [...] Along with a heavy rubber pad on the M79 butt stock, the High-Low system kept recoil forces manageable for the infantryman using the weapon.|$|E

5000|$|Smoke screen: In urban {{settings}} or other environments with limited movement and fields of view, smoke {{can be an}} effective means to screen friendly movement. This can be used either to pass through and escape, or to close in on and eliminate the enemy sniper. Ordinary soldiers can still do damage through smoke by firing randomly or on intuition, but snipers lose their precision advantage and are far less likely to hit anything with their much lower possible shot volume. A determined enemy, such as an emplaced heavy machine gun, will fire randomly through smoke, so this is a dangerous tactic. It {{should also be noted that}} weapons of opportunity may also provide a smoke screen, anything from igniting a car's gas tank, oil drum, or using <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenades</b> to throw up debris and quickly break line of sight and concentration. Flash-bang (distraction) grenades have a wider blast radius than <b>fragmentation</b> <b>grenades.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Fragmentation</b> <b>grenades</b> can {{be divided}} into two main types, {{defensive}} and offensive, where the former are designed to be used from a position of cover, (e.g. in a slit trench or behind a suitable wall,) and have an effective radius greater than the distance they can be thrown, while the latter are for use by assaulting troops, and have a smaller effective fragmentation radius.|$|R
