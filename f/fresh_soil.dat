40|$|Nitrification occurs {{slowly in}} many acid Scots pine forest soils. We {{examined}} if bacterial community structure and interactions {{between members of}} the bacterial community in these forest soils prohibit growth of ammonia-oxidising microorganisms and their nitrifying activity. Native and gamma-irradiated Scots pine forest soils known to have low net nitrification rates were augmented with <b>fresh</b> <b>soils</b> or soil slurries from nitrifying Scots pine forest soil, and vice versa. Augmentation of native non-nitrifying soils with nitrifying soils induced net nitrification, although no significant changes in bacterial community structure, as measured by 16 S rRNA gene-based {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE), were observed. In sterilised soils, the inoculum, i. e. native nitrifying soil or non-nitrifying soil, determined the occurrence of net nitrification and bacterial community structure, and not the origin of the sterilised soils. Our results demonstrate that low net nitrification rates in acid Scots pine forest soils cannot be (solely) explained by unfavourable abiotic soil conditions, but that still uncaptured biotic factors contribute to suppression of nitrification. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One forgets that, where land is so plentiful and labor so dear as it is here, a totally different principle must be pursued from that which prevails in populous countries, and that the consequence will of course be a want of tidiness, as it were, and finish, about everything which requires labor.” Of the two causes mentioned, the plentifulness of land {{seems to me the}} true explanation, rather than the dearness of labor; for, however dear labor may be, when food is wanted, labor will always be applied to producing it in preference to anything else. But this labor is more effective for its end by being applied to <b>fresh</b> <b>soil</b> than if it were employed in bringing the soil already occupied into higher cultivation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess genetic {{structure}} and local adaptation of Albizia gummifera to associated mycorrhiza using three populations from Uganda, Kenya and Madagascar. Using variation in chloroplast DNA sequences, estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation were obtained. Local adaptation of A. gummifera to the associated mycorrhiza was investigated by planting seed from different A. gummifera provenances into soils inoculated with soil microbial samples from respective local sites. In addition, the stability of inoculum was tested by comparing the performance of <b>fresh</b> and stored <b>soils</b> as inoculum. Four weeks after seedling emergence, height measurements were initiated and continued for six weeks. Mycorrhizas in the soil inoculum were identified using direct microscopic observation. Genetic data were analysed using GENALEX while greenhouse data were analysed using GENSTAT. The results showed that the species is genetically diverse with 14 cpDNA haplotypes identified (hTOT = 0. 803), with Uganda showing most diversity (h = 0813) and Kenya the least (h = 0. 398). Although the majority of variation was distributed within populations (75 %), significant population differentiation was observed (ΦPT = 0. 249, p > 0. 01) and each population contained private haplotypes: Uganda (5), Madagascar (3) and Kenya (1). Greatest genetic distance was observed between Kenya and Madagascar (2. 711). The lowest distance was observed between Uganda and Kenya (0. 298). The diversity of the mycorrhizal community varied between sites with Ugandan <b>fresh</b> <b>soils</b> being more diverse than Kenyan <b>fresh</b> <b>soils.</b> For the old soils, fungal diversity was highest in Kenya, followed by Madagascar and then Uganda. Based on the growth performance measurements, there was no evidence of adaptation of A. gummifera provenances to local mycorrhizas though plant performance for inoculated plants was higher than that of the control. From the study, it appears that the specific kind of fungi the A. gummifera plants are exposed to is not important, although they benefit from the exposure. The tree populations seem to have genetically differentiated and transferring them to sites outside their own may pose a genetic threat. More research is however needed to ascertain adaptive differences of A. gummifera to abiotic and other biotic factors, the suitable founding genetic diversity and other factors that may affect introductions. The exact mycorrhizas that colonise the plants also need to be identified...|$|R
60|$|The way in which, {{these effects}} are {{produced}} {{seems to be}} this. We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population, which is found to act {{even in the most}} vicious societies, increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease, while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land, to turn up <b>fresh</b> <b>soil,</b> and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage, till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened, and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|$|E

And on that fuller knowledge he hoped to mould a statement which would in any case save him from the necessity of quitting Florence. Tito had never had occasion to fabricate an ingenious lie before: the occasion was come now--the occasion which circumstance never fails to beget on tacit falsity; and his ingenuity was ready.

60|$|Yet, {{with each}} fresh manifestation of Darwin's inexhaustible resources, {{on the other}} hand, the {{opposition}} to his principles grew feebler and feebler, and the universality of their acceptance more and more pronounced, till at last, among biologists at least, {{not to be a}} Darwinian was equivalent to being hopelessly left behind by the general onward movement of the time. In 1874 Tyndall delivered his famous address at the Belfast meeting of the British Association; and in 1877, from the same presidential chair at Plymouth, Allen Thomson, long reputed a doubtful waverer, enforced his cordial adhesion to the Darwinian principles by his inaugural discourse on 'The Development of the Forms of Animal Life.' A new generation of active workers, trained up from the first in the evolutionary school, like Romanes, Ray Lankester, Thistleton Dyer, Balfour, Sully, and Moggridge, had now risen gradually around the great master; and in every direction he could see the seed he had himself planted being watered and nourished in <b>fresh</b> <b>soil</b> by a hundred ardent and enthusiastic young disciples. Even in France, ever irresponsive to the touch of new ideas of alien origin, Colonel Moulinié's admirable and sympathetic translations were beginning to win over to the evolutionary creed many rising workers; while in Germany, Victor Carus's excellent versions had from the very first brought in the enthusiastic Teutonic biologists with a congenial 'swarmery' to the camp of the Darwinians. Correspondents from every part of the world kept pressing fresh facts and fresh applications upon the founder of the faith; and Darwin saw his own work so fast being taken out of his hands by specialist disciples that he abandoned entirely his original intention of publishing in detail the basis of his first book, and contented himself instead with tracing out minutely some minor portions of his contemplated task as specimens of evolutionary method.|$|E

60|$|Intermingled, fantastically and inconsistently, {{with the}} story of St. Brendan, is that of St. Maclovius or Machutus, who has given his name to the seaport of St. Malo, in Brittany. His life, written by Sigebert, a monk of Gembloux, about the year 1100, tells us how he was a Breton, who sailed with St. Brendan in search of the fairest of all islands, in which the {{citizens}} of heaven were said to dwell. With St. Brendan St. Malo celebrated Easter on the whale's back, and with St. Brendan he returned. But another old hagiographer, Johannes a Bosco, tells a different story, making St. Malo an Irishman brought up by St. Brendan, and preserved by his prayers from a wave of the sea. He gives, moreover, to the Isle of Paradise the name of Inga, and says that St. Brendan and his companions never reached it after all, but came home after sailing round the Orkneys and other Northern isles. The fact is, that the same saints reappear so often {{on both sides of the}} British and the Irish Channels, that we must take the existence of many of them as mere legend, which has been carried from land to land by monks in their migrations, and taken root upon each <b>fresh</b> <b>soil</b> which it has reached. One incident in St. Malo's voyage is so fantastic, and so grand likewise, that it must not be omitted. The monks come to an island whereon they find the barrow of some giant of old time. St. Malo, seized with pity for the lost soul of the heathen, opens the mound and raises the dead to life. Then follows a strange conversation between the giant and the saint. He was slain, he says, by his kinsmen, and ever since has been tormented in the other world. In that nether pit they know (he says) of the Holy Trinity: but that knowledge is rather harm than gain to them, because they did not choose to know it when alive on earth. Therefore he begs to be baptized, and so delivered from his pain. He is therefore instructed, catechised, and in due time baptized, and admitted to the Holy Communion. For fifteen days more he remains alive: and then, dying once more, is again placed in his sepulchre, and left in peace.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} popular of American humorists has {{elicited}} from a member of an English audience, who did not quite hear him lecture, a remark of an amusing sort. The aggrieved listener proclaimed that he [...] "had a right to hear." [...] This was one of the turbulent people who should read Mazzini, and learn that man has no rights worth mentioning--only duties, one of which is to hold his tongue in season. If Mr. Bret Harte's words did not reach all his audience, his writings at least have come home to most English readers. They suggest a consideration of the many points of difference which distinguish American from English humour. The Americans are of our own stock, yet in their treatment of the ludicrous how unlike us they are! As far as fun goes, the race has certainly become [...] "differentiated," [...] as the philosophers say, {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic. It does not seem probable that the infusion of alien blood has caused the difference. The native redskin can claim few descendants among the civilized Americans, and the native redskin had no sense of humour. We all remember Cooper's Hawk-eye or Leather Stocking, with his [...] "peculiar silent laugh." [...] He was obliged to laugh silently for fear of attracting the unfavourable notice of the Mingo, who might be hiding in the nearest bush. The red men found it simpler and safer not to laugh at all. No, it is not from the natives that the people of the States get their peculiar fun. As to the German emigrants--But why pursue the subject? The Abbe Bouhours told the bitter truth about German wit, though, in new conditions and on a <b>fresh</b> <b>soil,</b> the Teuton has helped to produce Hans Breitmann. We laugh at Hans, however, and with his creator. Hans does not make us laugh by conscious efforts of humour. Whence, then, come Artemus Ward, Mark Twain, and Mr. Bret Harte, who are probably the American humorists whose popularity is widest? Mr. Bret Harte's own fun is much more English and less thoroughly Yankee than that of his contemporaries. He is a disciple of Thackeray and Dickens. Of all the pupils of Dickens he is perhaps the only one who has continued to be himself, who has not fallen into a trick of aping his master's mannerisms. His mixture of the serious, the earnest, the pathetic, makes his humour not unlike the melancholy mirth of Thackeray and Sterne. He is almost the only American humorist with sentiment. It is only the air, not the spirit, that is changed--coelum non animus.|$|E
60|$|And {{now think}} what a {{wonderful}} fairy tale you might write for yourself--and every word of it true--of the adventures of one atom of Potash or some other Salt, {{no bigger than a}} needle's point, in such a lava stream as I have been telling of. How it has run round and round, and will run round age after age, in an endless chain of change. How it began by being molten fire underground, how then it became part of a hard cold rock, lifted up into a cliff, beaten upon by rain and storm, and washed down into the soil of the plain, till, perhaps, the little atom of mineral met with the rootlet of some great tree, and was taken up into its sap in spring, through tiny veins, and hardened the next year into a piece of solid wood. And then how that tree was cut down, and its logs, it may be, burnt upon the hearth, till the little atom of mineral lay among the wood-ashes, and was shovelled out and thrown upon the field and washed into the soil again, and taken up by the roots of a clover plant, and became an atom of vegetable matter once more. And then how, perhaps, a rabbit came by, and ate the clover, and the grain of mineral became part of the rabbit; and then how a hawk killed that rabbit, and ate it, and so the grain became part of the hawk; and how the farmer shot the hawk, and it fell perchance into a stream, and was carried down into the sea; and when its body decayed, the little grain sank through the water, and was mingled with the mud {{at the bottom of the}} sea. But do its wanderings stop there? Not so, my child. Nothing upon this earth, as I told you once before, continues in one stay. That grain of mineral might stay at the bottom of the sea a thousand or ten thousand years, and yet the time would come when Madam How would set to work on it again. Slowly, perhaps, she would sink that mud so deep, and cover it up with so many fresh beds of mud, or sand, or lime, that under the heavy weight, and perhaps, too, under the heat of the inside of the earth, that Mud would slowly change to hard Slate Rock; and ages after, it may be, Madam How might melt that Slate Rock once more, and blast it out; and then through the mouth of a volcano the little grain of mineral might rise into the open air again to make <b>fresh</b> <b>soil,</b> as it had done thousands of years before. For Madam How can manufacture many different things out of the same materials. She may have so wrought with that grain of mineral, that she may have formed it into part of a precious stone, and men may dig it out of the rock, or pick it up in the river-bed, and polish it, and set it, and wear it. Think of that--that in the jewels which your mother or your sisters wear, or in your father's signet ring, there may be atoms which were part of a live plant, or a live animal, millions of years ago, and may be parts of a live plant or a live animal millions of years hence.|$|E

Our results clearly demonstrated that soil type had a considerable effect on the decomposition of SMT buried in soil. Differences in the rate of decomposition were up to three times greater in the Podsol compared with the Rendzina. The rate of microbial respiration was correlated to the rate of soft tissue loss, which suggests that the decomposition of SMT is dependent on the microbial community present in the soil. Decompositional by-products caused the pH of the immediate soil environment to change, becoming more alkaline at first, before acidifying.

6000|$|Before yet any woodchuck or {{squirrel}} had {{run across}} the road, or the sun had got above the shrub oaks, while all the dew was on, though the farmers warned me against it--I would advise you to do all your work if possible while the dew is on--I began to level the ranks of haughty weeds in my bean-field and throw dust upon their heads. Early in the morning I worked barefooted, dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy and crumbling sand, but {{later in the day}} the sun blistered my feet. There the sun lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and forward over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows, fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where I could rest in the shade, the other in a blackberry field where the green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another bout. Removing the weeds, putting <b>fresh</b> <b>soil</b> about the bean stems, and encouraging this weed which I had sown, making the yellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass, making the earth say beans instead of grass--this was my daily work. As I had little aid from horses or cattle, or hired men or boys, or improved implements of husbandry, I was much slower, and became much more intimate with my beans than usual. But labor of the hands, even when pursued to the verge of drudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a constant and imperishable moral, and to the scholar it yields a classic result. A very agricola laboriosus was I to travellers bound westward through Lincoln and Wayland to nobody knows where; they sitting at their ease in gigs, with elbows on knees, and reins loosely hanging in festoons; I the home-staying, laborious native of the soil. But soon my homestead was out of their sight and thought. It was the only open and cultivated field for a great distance {{on either side of the}} road, so they made the most of it; and sometimes the man in the field heard more of travellers' gossip and comment than was meant for his ear: [...] "Beans so late! peas so late!"--for I continued to plant when others had begun to hoe--the ministerial husbandman had not suspected it. [...] "Corn, my boy, for fodder; corn for fodder." [...] "Does he live there?" [...] asks the black bonnet of the gray coat; and the hard-featured farmer reins up his grateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manure in the furrow, and recommends a little chip dirt, or any little waste stuff, or it may be ashes or plaster. But here were two acres and a half of furrows, and only a hoe for cart and two hands to draw it--there being an aversion to other carts and horses--and chip dirt far away. Fellow-travellers as they rattled by compared it aloud with the fields which they had passed, so that I came to know how I stood in the agricultural world. This was one field not in Mr. Coleman's report. And, by the way, who estimates the value of the crop which nature yields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man? The crop of English hay is carefully weighed, the moisture calculated, the silicates and the potash; but in all dells and pond-holes in the woods and pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by man. Mine was, as it were, the connecting link between wild and cultivated fields; as some states are civilized, and others half-civilized, and others savage or barbarous, so my field was, though not in a bad sense, a half-cultivated field. They were beans cheerfully returning to their wild and primitive state that I cultivated, and my hoe played the Ranz des Vaches for them.|$|E

5000|$|Sugarcane quickly {{exhausts}} {{the soil}} in which it grows, and planters pressed larger islands with <b>fresher</b> <b>soil</b> into production {{in the nineteenth century}} as demand for sugar in Europe continued to increase: [...] "average consumption in Britain rose from four pounds per head in 1700 to eighteen pounds in 1800, thirty-six pounds by 1850 and over one hundred pounds by the twentieth century."In the 19th century Cuba rose to become the richest land in the Caribbean (with sugar as its dominant crop) because it formed the only major island landmass free of mountainous terrain. Instead, nearly three-quarters of its land formed a rolling plain — ideal for planting crops. Cuba also prospered above other islands because Cubans used better methods when harvesting the sugar crops: they adopted modern milling methods such as watermills, enclosed furnaces, steam engines, and vacuum pans. All these technologies increased productivity. Cuba also retained slavery longer than the {{most of the rest of}} the Caribbean islands.|$|R
