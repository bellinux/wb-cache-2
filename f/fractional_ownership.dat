25|$|<b>Fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in revitalizing the general aviation manufacturing industry since the late 1990s, and most manufacturers actively support <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of the term <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> has caused extensive rebranding in other industries where similar concepts, such as real estate timeshares, were already well established. The main distinction between timeshare and <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> is that with a timeshare you buy {{the right to use}} a property, but with <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership,</b> you are buying real estate. You get a deeded piece of real estate, just not for the entire parcel.|$|E
25|$|Berkshire {{acquired}} NetJets Inc. in 1998. NetJets is the world’s {{leading provider}} of <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> programs for general aviation aircraft. In 1986, NetJets created the <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> of aircraft concept and introduced its NetJets {{program in the}} United States with one aircraft type. In 2004, the NetJets program operated 15 aircraft types with a fleet size of nearly 650.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} type system to {{guarantee}} safe resource deal-location for shared-memory concurrent programs by extend-ing the previous type {{system based on}} <b>fractional</b> <b>ownerships.</b> Here, safe resource deallocation means that memory cells, locks, or threads are not left allocated when a program ter-minates. Our framework supports (1) fork/join parallelism, (2) synchronization with locks, and (3) dynamically allo-cated memory cells and locks. The type system is proved to be sound. We also provide a type inference algorithm for the type system and a prototype implementation of the algo-rithm...|$|R
25|$|Many pilots get {{together}} to buy light aircraft in a privately bought and managed <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership,</b> this is often known as group flying.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> is also {{beginning}} to appear for luxury {{items such as}} small yachts and megayachts, jet aircraft (especially business jets) and high-end motor homes.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is operated}} by private individuals, companies, non-government organizations and executive charter operators. A {{number of companies}} also use the aircraft as part of <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> programs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} type {{system for a}} {{programming}} language with memory allocation/deallocation primitives, which prevents memory-related errors such as double-frees and memory leaks. The main idea is to augment pointer types with <b>fractional</b> <b>ownerships,</b> which express both capabilities and obligations to access or deallocate memory cells. By assigning an ownership to each pointer type constructor (rather than to a variable), our type system can properly reason about list/tree-manipulating programs. Furthermore, thanks {{to the use of}} fractions as ownerships, the type system admits a polynomial-time type inference algorithm, which serves as an algorithm for automatic verification of lack of memoryrelated errors. A prototype verifier has been implemented and tested for C programs. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1987, the NetJets {{program was}} officially {{announced}} {{becoming the first}} <b>fractional</b> aircraft <b>ownership</b> format in history. Around the same time, painted on every NetJets U.S. aircraft was a three-digit tail number punctuated with QS, symbolizing the revolutionary concept of selling Quarter Shares of an aircraft—a feature that is still representative of the NetJets brand today.|$|R
50|$|Executive Jet Aviation was {{purchased}} in 1984 by former Goldman Sachs executive Richard Santulli who became chairman and CEO of the corporation. In 1986 the NetJets program {{was created by}} Santulli as the first <b>fractional</b> aircraft <b>ownership</b> program. In 1998, after being a NetJets customer for three years, Warren Buffett, Chairman & CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway company, acquired NetJets Inc.|$|R
25|$|Whether <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> {{provides}} a financial advantage over renting {{is an ongoing}} debate, and some countries and regions have tax laws that provide additional benefits for owners, such as capital-loss allowances, while others might penalize ownership over renting.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> {{concept has}} since been {{extended}} to smaller aircraft and now has become common for single-engine piston aircraft like the Cirrus SR22, which are beyond the financial means of many private pilots. The same concepts apply, except that the management company may not provide flight crews nor reposition the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> divides a {{property}} into more affordable segments {{for individuals and}} also matches an individual's ownership time to their actual usage time. A fractional share gives the owners certain privileges, such {{as a number of}} days or weeks when they can use the property. Occasionally, the property is sold after a predetermined time, distributing the relative proceeds back to the owners. A few private owner-groups have developed highly sophisticated usage allocation schemes and other features based on the principle of attempting to get {{as close as possible to}} the flexibility of individual ownership, and only compromising this to the minimum extent necessary to accommodate multiple owners. In such schemes, the basic agreement is between the members themselves, whereas in most commercial <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> schemes, the owner's principal relationship is with the property developer and/or promoter of the scheme.|$|E
50|$|Milestone Aviation Group {{was founded}} in August 2010 by Richard Santulli. Santulli has nearly 40 years of {{experience}} in helicopters, private jets and finance industries. He is known for inventing the <b>fractional</b> jet <b>ownership</b> industry and growing NetJets into a multinational corporation. Milestone is based in Dublin, Ireland, where the company can benefit from Ireland’s skill set and tax infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|VistaJet's {{business}} model is said by Flohr to be {{a reaction to}} his experience of <b>fractional</b> jet <b>ownership,</b> where usage prices tend to be lower but the overall cost of ownership is potentially greater. Fractional owners have no secondary market to sell their fraction to, other than the original vendor, who sets the price and is, in effect, in a monopoly purchaser position.|$|R
5000|$|Flying {{a lot of}} One Leg Journeys - As {{you only}} pay for {{the time that you}} are in the air, then if you need to fly a lot of one-leg {{journeys}} the <b>Fractional</b> Jet <b>Ownership</b> could be cost effective. In comparison, when you charter a jet, then you are effectively paying for the empty leg return from where the charter operates from.|$|R
25|$|In business, <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> is a {{percentage}} share of an expensive asset. Shares are sold to individual owners. Typically, a company manages the asset {{on behalf of}} the owners, who pay monthly/annual fees for the management plus variable (e.g., per-hour, per-day) use fees. For rapidly depreciating assets, the management company may sell the asset and distribute the proceeds back to the owners, who can then claim a capital loss and optionally purchase a fraction of a new asset.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> is {{a method}} in which several {{unrelated}} parties can share in, and mitigate the risk of, ownership of a high-value tangible asset, usually a jet, yacht or piece of resort real estate. It can be done for strictly monetary reasons, but typically there is some amount of personal access involved. One of the main motivators for a fractional purchase {{is the ability to}} share the costs of maintaining an asset that will not be used full-time by one owner.|$|E
25|$|Outside the USA a {{non-commercial}} form of <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> {{has been}} in existence for several decades. In this form, otherwise unconnected individuals (rather than family or friends) form private syndicates to purchase, for example, vacation property or boats. These syndicates operate as private member groups with small numbers on a non-profit basis, generally just sharing expenses and usage. These groups can involve assets ranging from modest apartments or condominium-type properties to multimillion-euro / dollar properties, and leverage their ability to make collective purchases of additional assets such as boats or vehicles as additional facilities, while retaining control entirely within {{the membership of the}} group.|$|E
50|$|CitationAir by Cessna, {{founded in}} 2000 as CitationShares, is a {{subsidiary}} of Cessna Aircraft Company that provides private aviation services. It offered services in <b>fractional</b> jet <b>ownership,</b> jet card membership, corporate solutions and whole aircraft management. CitationAir {{was one of the}} four major players in the private aviation market. It is a seven-time winner of Best of the Best awards from the Robb Report, most recently in 2009.|$|R
5000|$|CitationAir offered four {{different}} programs for its customers [...] Citation Air Jet Shares, formerly Citelines, {{referred to the}} <b>fractional</b> jet <b>ownership</b> program that CitationAir offered. This program incorporated all operating expenses into one annual or twelve monthly payments, regardless of where one flies. This program differentiates between peak and non-peak days, allowing share owners to pick one of four packages: 365 days, 350 days, 335 days or 320 days a year.|$|R
5000|$|Richard T. Santulli (born August 14, 1944), is an American {{entrepreneur}} and philanthropist. He is {{best known}} for pioneering the concept of <b>fractional</b> jet <b>ownership</b> with NetJets, a successful company he developed in 1986. Santulli was once considered by analysts as a possible successor to Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. [...] He currently serves as Chairman of his latest venture, Milestone Aviation Group, a helicopter and business jet leasing company.|$|R
2500|$|Shared {{ownership}} of the property and its deed will also entitle shareholders to certain usage rights, usually {{in the form of}} weeks. Conceptually, <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> {{is not the same as}} timeshare. <b>Fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> affords much of the freedom and usage benefits offered in timeshare, however, the fundamental difference with <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> is that the purchaser owns part of the title (as opposed to units of [...] "time"). Therefore, if the property appreciates in value, then so do the shares. As with whole ownership, fractional owners can sell whenever they deem necessary or prudent, releasing the capital growth from their [...] "bricks & mortar" [...] investment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to luxury private residence clubs, single [...] "stand-alone" [...] vacation homes and condos {{can be converted}} to <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership.</b> This fractional home conversion process can be accomplished by any knowledgeable seller or through a fractional consulting company. The benefit of fractional home conversion includes the ability of the homeowner to keep a portion of the ownership for themselves, pay off debt and reduce expenses.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> {{originally}} {{became popular}} for business jets. Richard Santulli of NetJets pioneered {{the concept of}} allowing businesses to purchase shares in a jet to reduce costs. [...] With a fractional jet plan, members will typically fly in any jet available, not necessarily {{the one in which}} they own shares. [...] The management company will reposition jets as necessary and provide flight crews. [...] Companies with greater needs purchase larger shares to get access to more time.|$|E
5000|$|Ricci founded Cleveland, Ohio-based Flight Options in 1998 in {{an effort}} to develop a {{nationwide}} <b>fractional</b> jet services <b>ownership</b> program. Flight Options enjoyed significant early success, with its annual revenues growing from $35 million to $300 million in 17 months of operations. [...] In December 2001, the company combined operations with Raytheon Travel Air, a subsidiary of Raytheon Company, doubling the company's size.|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} because fast-growing young {{companies}} must raise money in private capital markets that contain significant financing frictions, the CEOs of such firms will {{be compensated for}} successful fundraising. Using a sample of 1585 private venture-backed U. S. firms, {{we find that the}} cash pay of entrepreneur-CEOs is increasing in both {{the quantity and quality of}} financing secured and is more sensitive to successful fundraising the more challenging and difficult is the fundraising task. Successful fundraising also increases the gap between the pay of CEOs and other executives. Finally, we show that while VC financing dilutes the CEO's <b>fractional</b> equity <b>ownership,</b> it increases the dollar value of that ownership.

2500|$|Fractional yacht / boat {{ownership}} provides marine enthusiasts with {{ownership of}} shares in yachts {{of all sizes}} and uses. Some programs sell actual equity in the watercraft and others sell [...] "membership," [...] where the members' dues provide access to the boats, but no <b>ownership.</b> <b>Fractional</b> yacht companies sell shares/membership in small motor boats, sailboats, mid-range yachts {{all the way to}} the megayachts for day-use, multi-year contracts, or charter-like arrangements.|$|R
2500|$|Another type of <b>fractional</b> <b>ownership,</b> {{not part}} of a securitized {{business}} plan is Tenancy in Common, which is grounded in the real property laws of most, if not all states. The main difference is there is no right of survivorship to the sponsor or other owners if one or more of owners were to pass away. Where there are similarities with the equal sharing of operational expenses, rental income and access, the striking difference is free transferability of the owner's interest in the property without regard to the other owners in the property.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> {{offers an}} {{individual}} or company the option to purchase a share of an aircraft. Shares from as little as 1/16 of an aircraft, which offers approximately 50 hours of flight time per year, to 1/2 of an aircraft can be purchased, depending {{on the needs of}} the operator. [...] The most common amounts purchased usually range from about 1/8 to 1/4 (approximately 200 flight hours per year) of an aircraft. [...] Though the owner takes title of the portion of their investment, they are not assigned to a dedicated aircraft for usage. [...] Instead, they are given access to a pool of similar aircraft, and therefore, theoretically, an owner may never actually fly on their titled jet.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Fractional</b> <b>ownership</b> {{simply means}} the {{division}} of any asset into portions or shares. If the “asset” is a property, the title or deed can be legally divided into shares. In certain instances this is done by creating a [...] "mezzanine structure", i.e., creating a company which owns the property then allowing multiple owners or investors to own shares in the company. Those shares can then be purchased and owned {{by more than one}} individual. The reasons for a [...] "mezzanine structure" [...] can vary. [...] Two common reasons are to allow transfer of shares without the need to reflect changes on the title or deed to the property, and for tax benefits.|$|E
50|$|PlaneSense is a <b>fractional</b> {{aircraft}} <b>ownership</b> program {{managed by}} PlaneSense, Inc. and based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States. As {{of the beginning}} of 2016, they manage a civilian fleet of 36 total program aircraft, made up of thirty-four Pilatus PC-12 aircraft and 2 Nextant 400 XTi twin-engine jet aircraft. More Nextant 400XTi jets are also on order, and six Pilatus PC-24 twin-engine jets are scheduled to be delivered between the years 2017 and 2020. The PlaneSense fractional program provides private air transportation, primarily within the United States, Canada, Mexico, The Bahamas, and the islands of the Caribbean. PlaneSense guarantees departure times as soon as 8 hours after a flight request, {{depending on the size of}} the aircraft share owned for domestic flights on non-peak days. PlaneSense, inc. is not, itself, an air charter provider or commercial air carrier, but charter flights can be arranged through its sister company, Cobalt Air.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The fleet {{management}} problem, in its simplest form, involves managing fleets of equipment to meet customer requests as they evolve over time. The equipment might be containers which hold freight (ocean containers, truck trailers, boxcars), {{equipment such as}} locomotives, truck tractors, taxicabs or business jets (companies in the <b>fractional</b> jet <b>ownership</b> business may own up to 1, 000 jets). The equipment has to serve customers (people or freight) who typically want {{to move from one}} location to the next. We make the assumption throughout that a piece of equipment can serve one request at a time. One of the challenges of {{fleet management}} is that customer requests arrive randomly over time, often requiring service within a narrow interval. Since it can take from several days to over a week to move transportation equipment over long distances, {{it is not possible to}} wait until a customer request is known before moving the equipment. As a result, it is necessary to move equipme...|$|R
