5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it {{was found to be}} in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation. After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive's <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack,</b> it was soon running smoothly.|$|E

25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was thus}} extensively modified, receiving new Salmson water-cooled aero-engines {{instead of the}} Hispano Suiza engines, along with other changes, such as the adoption of an alternative <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> configuration, a 3-degree dihedral on the mainplanes, and a tail unit more representative of production aircraft. Following these modifications, the prototype was used for several years, surviving the war and being allocated a civil registration. In August 1919, the prototype was flown from Brooklands to Amsterdam, the Netherlands as part of Vicker's exhibit at the Eerste Luchtverkeer Tentoonstelling Amsterdam.|$|E

25|$|For {{gasification}} applications, or IGCC, {{the plant}} modifications required {{to add the}} ability to capture CO2 are minimal. The syngas produced by the gasifiers needs to be treated through various processes {{for the removal of}} impurities already in the gas stream, so all that is required to remove CO2 is to add the necessary equipment, an absorber and regenerator, to this process train. In combustion applications, modifications must be done to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> and because of the lower concentrations of CO2 present in the exhaust, much larger volumes of total gas require processing, necessitating larger and more expensive equipment.|$|E
500|$|The C {{was soon}} {{absorbed into the}} United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company (1869) which itself was merged into the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1871. [...] The PRR saw the {{potential}} publicity {{to be gained by}} exhibiting such an old engine, showing it at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia; PRR workshop staff then [...] "back-dated" [...] the engine (by replacing some original parts with parts that [...] "looked" [...] old or by removing them entirely). The <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> was replaced with a straight tube of metal and the cab walls and roof were removed. The PRR then exhibited the engine in 1883 at the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in Chicago, Illinois. [...] In 1885, the Smithsonian Institution accepted the donation of the John Bull from the PRR as the Institution's first large engineering artifact.|$|E
2500|$|This {{locomotive}} {{was sold}} configured either for freight or passenger service. When configured as a passenger locomotive, it {{was equipped with}} a steam generator for heating the train; passenger versions can be identified by the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> of this generator, which protruded {{right in front of}} the windshield, between the two panes of glass. Freight units lack this stack.|$|E
50|$|Its {{distinctive}} appearance {{comes from}} the building's energy efficient specifications, making use of light wells and <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> to draw air through the building, providing natural ventilation.|$|R

2500|$|The S-1 and S-3 are {{distinguishable}} externally {{from the}} very similar S-2 and S-4 [...] switchers in {{that they have a}} smaller <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> with a round base and a smaller radiator shutter area on the nose sides. [...] The S-1/S-3 radiator shutter area is taller than it is wide, while the S-2/S-4 radiator area is wider. [...] The smaller stack is {{due to the lack of}} turbocharging.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the reasons}} for {{building}} the tunnel as a public-private partnership was that it should reduce Brisbane City Council's risks regarding construction and operation. [...] However, the public disclosure documents released by Rivercity Motorway indicate that there are still considerable uncosted risks left with Council. For example, a 10m extension was required for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> at the Woolloongabba end of the tunnel and the full cost by the council.|$|E
2500|$|As the Air Rescue service did not fly night rescue missions, the North Koreans {{soon learned}} that {{the sound of a}} {{helicopter}} at night meant only one thing: an agent insertion or extraction mission was in progress. To lower the sound of the helicopters, the aircrews of the H-19s kept the engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> {{on the left side of}} the helicopter away from the coastline as much as possible. The crews could only hope that North Koreans weren't waiting in ambush for them. [...] As dangerous as these missions were, the Air Commandos at least had the element of surprise and the safety of darkness on their side.|$|E

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} {{to determine if there}} are performance penalties associated with the installation of infrared (IR) suppressors on the T 63 -A- 700 turboshaft engine. The testing was done in a sea-level, static test cell. The same engine (A-E 402808 B) was run with the standard OH- 58 aircraft <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> and with the ejector-type IR suppressors {{in order to make a}} valid comparison. Repeatability of the test results for the two configurations was verified by rerunning the conditions over a period of days. Test results showed no measurable difference in performance between the standard <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> and the IR suppressors...|$|R
50|$|The Li'l Red Express Dakota {{was made}} to {{resemble}} the original Express, {{which was based on}} the Dodge D-Series. It featured the classic-looking step-side bed and also had dual vertical <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> just behind the cab, which were purely cosmetic (though they could be made to be functional). The Dakota Warrior {{was made to}} resemble the Warlock trucks of the late 1970s. Warriors featured the same custom bed as the Dakota Express, but lacked the vertical <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks.</b> Both the Express and Warrior Dakotas had a graphics package made to resemble those of the original Express and Warlock, respectively.|$|R
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway repowered its VO1000s with {{turbocharged}} 606SC Baldwin engines taken from its EMD-repowered fleet of Baldwin DT-6-6-2000 locomotives. The work was performed at EJ's Joliet, Illinois workshops, {{and produced a}} finished unit that featured an offset <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> and left-side turbocharger bulge, the latter being much like that found on Baldwin road switchers. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad had eight of their VO1000s repowered with EMD 567 series engines, which produced [...] The Great Northern Railway converted four VO-1000s into transfer cabooses in 1964. The units were stripped to their bare frames (the original trucks and distinctive cast steps were left in place) and fitted with -long steel cabins.|$|E
2500|$|As the SD38, SD39, SD40, and SD45 {{shared a}} common frame, so too did the SD38-2, SD40-2, and SD45-2. It was [...] longer than the {{previous}} models, giving a length of [...] over the coupler pulling faces. The SD38-2 and SD40-2 shared the same basic superstructure, since they used the same 16-645 engine (in Roots-blown and turbocharged form respectively); the long hood was [...] longer than the SD38 and SD40, but since the increase in frame length was even greater, the SD38-2 and SD40-2 had even larger front and rear [...] "porches" [...] than the earlier models. These empty areas at front and rear are spotting features to identify the Dash 2 models of both units. The SD40-2 can be distinguished from the SD38-2 by its three roof-mounted radiator fans instead of two, and a single large <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> instead of two smaller stacks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} these to appear was the 160hp Gnome-powered aircraft, {{the first of which}} had the Shorts {{construction}} number S.63 and the Royal Navy serial number 81, making its maiden flight in July 1913, piloted by Charles Rumney Samson. It had high aspect ratio wings of uneven span, which were fitted with large ailerons on the upper wings, and folded for storage on board ship. The second 160hp Folder, serial number82, followed in March 1914, and was followed by two more (89 and 90 with three-bay wings and an improved wing-folding mechanism as tested by the Short S.41. A further five Folders (119–122, 186), powered by 160hp Gnomes were delivered in 1914, with longer fuselages and larger three-bay wings of [...] span compared with [...] for the first aircraft). The twin-row Gnomes proved to be unreliable, and were fitted with a large funnel-type <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> above the cowling.|$|E
5000|$|The Bell 222 {{is powered}} by twin Lycoming/Honeywell LTS101-650 {{turboshaft}} engines, rated at 592 shp each. [...] Later 222 versions feature more powerful engines. Engine output is at 100% of rating at 9598 RPM. Two independent driveshafts deliver power from the engines to the transmission. The Bell 222's LTS engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> are located {{at the rear of}} the engines, while the 230's Allison engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> are located high on the cowling. Fuel is stored in three tanks, one in the fuselage and one in each sponson. The main rear landing gear retracts into the sponsons.|$|R
50|$|Further diversifying {{of their}} {{business}} brought them into the OEM market. Frakes Aviation is now the OEM for <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> on various newly built aircraft, including the Quest Kodiak and the Epic Dynasty.|$|R
50|$|The Missouri Pacific Railroad had a {{fleet of}} RS-3s that were rebuilt, {{receiving}} the GP12 or GP16 designation after rebuilding. These look like normal ALCo RS-3s {{with the addition of}} more <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|British {{expectations}} {{had been}} set by performance figures established by the unarmed and unarmored XP-39 prototype. The British production contract stated that a maximum speed of [...] +/- 4% was required at rated altitude. In acceptance testing, actual production aircraft {{were found to be}} capable of only 371mph at 14,090ft. To enable the aircraft to make the guarantee speed, a variety of drag-reduction modifications were developed by Bell. The areas of the elevator and rudder were reduced by 14.2% and 25.2% respectively. Modified fillets were installed in the tail area. The canopy glass was faired to its frame with putty. The gun access doors on the wing had been seen to bulge in flight, so they were replaced with thicker aluminum sheet. Similarly, the landing gear doors deflected open by as much as two inches at maximum speed, so a stronger linkage was installed to hold them flush. The cooling air exit from the oil and coolant radiators was reduced in area to match the exit velocity to the local flow. New engine exhaust stacks, deflected to match the local flow and with nozzles to increase thrust augmentation, were installed. The machine gun ports were faired over, the antenna mast was removed, a single-piece engine cowling was installed and an <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> fairing was added.|$|E
2500|$|The Roadmaster {{received}} its first major postwar restyling in 1949. Its wheelbase and overall length were reduced but its weight was actually marginally increased. The biggest change {{was a much}} larger two-piece, curved glass windshield that the sales brochure described as like an “observation car.” It was also in 1949 that Buick introduced [...] "VentiPorts." [...] Four were displayed {{on each of the}} Roadmaster's front fenders, with three on the fenders of the Super, Century, and Special. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, and possibly that was true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged. The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car’s hood wired to the distributor so as to flash on and off as each piston fired simulating the flames from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver at the controls of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief Harlow Curtice was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks, with the number of VentiPorts (three or four) corresponding to the relative displacement of the straight-eight engine installed.|$|E
2500|$|D9000 (55 022) Royal Scots Grey was {{purchased}} by the Deltic 9000 Fund and, on 7 September 1983, was handed over in fully running condition after work and a repaint by BR. Its first base was the Nene Valley Railway. It was later accommodated by Network SouthEast at Selhurst and Old Oak Common depots, from where it regularly travelled to open days around the country. In 1996 it was overhauled by Railcare at Springburn, Glasgow and received main-line certification. The Deltic 9000 Fund became a limited company (Deltic 9000 Locomotives Limited) and both D9000 and D9016 passed into its care. Its initial return to service, on the [...] "Deltic Deliverance" [...] charter, on 30 November 1996, was cut short by an <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> fire (a regular Deltic problem in service days). Following rectification work at Springburn it ran to King's Cross on an empty stock train before resuming its second main-line career on 2 January 1997 on the [...] "Deltic Reunion" [...] charter to Hull and Harrogate, during which it visited the turntable within the National Railway Museum, where it stood alongside the prototype. It continued to work main line charter trains between 1997 and 2002 and was hired by both Anglia Railways and Virgin CrossCountry to operate service trains on their behalf, as cover for their locomotives. Following the demise of Deltic 9000 Locomotives Limited in 2004 the locomotive was sold to Beaver Sports (Yorks) Ltd. It completed an 18-month overhaul and was re-certified for running on the main line in August 2006. Royal Scots Grey has been repainted into blue livery, carrying the markings of York (YK depot) and York City coat of arms crests above the numbers, as done in 1981. It is the first Class 55 to carry the York coat of arms crest since 1982. The locomotive continues to work charters and to be available for spot hire to national operators. In 2015 the locomotive was repainted with 'Finsbury Park-style' white cab window surrounds and at various times has carried the identities of scrapped sister locomotives 55 003 Meld, 55 007 Pinza and 55 018 Ballymoss ...|$|E
