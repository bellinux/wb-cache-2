40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{officials}} who conduct administrative hearings for aggrieved welfare clients. <b>Hearing</b> <b>officers</b> are charged with ensuring due process for welfare clients, called appellants in the hearing process, who believe that mistakes have been made in their cases and who wish to challenge those decisions. Administrative hearings {{are one of the few}} vehicles that afford clients the opportunity to contest welfare policies and procedures. This study explored welfare <b>hearing</b> <b>officers</b> and their perceptions of their roles in conducting hearings. The concepts of role theory, organizational climate and aspects of professional training were used to examine the role perceptions <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>officers.</b> Semi-structured interviews, intended to identify officers’ beliefs about their jobs, were conducted with 27 participants who had social services-related degrees. Findings demonstrated that officers strive to be fair and impartial, yet perceive role conflict and ambiguity as a result of several factors related to the players in the hearings process. Findings suggested that organizational climate impacted officers’ feelings about their agencies based on constant changes to agency functions. The benefits of professional training and education on officers’ roles were examined and will also be explained. The paper concludes with a discussion around the study’s findings and concludes with the study’s limitations and implications for social work research, practice, and education...|$|R

40|$|Young hearing impairers aged between 12 and 21 {{should adopt}} {{auditory}} intervention program {{to improve their}} social skills and knowledge {{in order to avoid}} the delay in personal development. However, their unwillingness to participate or low participation make auditory intervention programs useless or inefficient. The main purpose of this study is to examine how the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> impairers’ parents and hearing peers motivates young hearing impairers to participate in auditory intervention programs and enhance the effectiveness of those programs. Data was collected from (i) individual interviews to experts including social workers and activity organizers, and (ii) a questionnaire from young hearing impairers. Preliminary findings suggest that hearing impairers will be more willing to join auditory intervention program if they are accompanied by their parents and well-known peers. Their willingness will reduce if they are required not to communicate and interact with their parents and well known peers but other parents and <b>hearing</b> peers <b>of</b> other <b>hearing</b> impairers. Experts support this approach as they believe such approach will help hearing impairers become more socialized after program. Reconciliation of conflict of view between experts and hearing impairers are required. Also, the length of time of activities, number <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> peers in group and diversity <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> status <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> impairers will affect their willingness to join programs.

40|$|Before 1920, {{the deaf}} of Montreal share with their {{counterparts}} elsewhere a common experience of residential schooling {{and training in}} manual trades, which introduced them to other deaf people and led to their socialising. In countries such as France and the United States {{in the latter half}} of the nineteenth century, the deaf were encouraged to be active members of political and social movements. There was no such activism evident in the deaf of Montreal. At the end of the nineteenth century, a deaf culture was visible in the U. S. and France, but despite the presence of three schools for the deaf in Montreal, no such culture seems to have existed at that time. Deaf education in Montreal was carried out according to recognised teaching methods, and its teachers were part of a network of educators of the deaf abroad. Local influences unique to Montreal, such as religion and budding national and linguistic pride, however, changed the experience of both educators and the deaf. The bilingual character of the city, as well as the existence of two main Christian religions gave deaf life a different flavour. Historical narratives of deaf oppression at the hands <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> educators common in France and the United States do not apply to the Montreal experience. In many ways, deaf associative life in Montreal depended on the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> educators. Experiences were different for Catholics and for Protestants, as well as for men and for women. The most prominent deaf association was made up of Catholic men, who joined an alumni association, the Cercle Saint-Francois-de-Sales, and started a newspaper destined not only for deaf Catholic men and women, but also for a readership consisting <b>of</b> the <b>hearing.</b> Their association also developed support networks for those deaf who suffered from economic and social disadvantage. This association took on much of the ideological character of French-Canadian society, and was supported by the Catholic clergy. Its national and religious character was paramount and welcomed all members of the deaf family, which extended beyond audiological deafness to anyone interested in the deaf. Rather than participating in the deaf discourse in the United States or France, this association took on characteristics of the greater French-Canadian Catholic cultural group of which it was a part. This thesis examines the conditions that led to these differences in the Montreal deaf experience between 1880 and 1920. It is concerned with the emergence of deaf networks of sociability and solidarity connected with Montreal's schools for the deaf and how such networks were made possible by the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> their educators. By examining the intellectual, religious, and national elements that gave rise to these deaf networks, this work aims at understanding the social dynamics steering Quebec society at the turn of the twentieth century...|$|R

First and foremost, discursive approaches highlight the interpretive nature of any research, not only that with children.

A total of 799 of the 1, 012 public school superintendents in the state of Illinois responded to the researcher's questionnaire. A tabulation of the returned questionnaires revealed that 643 of the 799 respondents had had no involvement with tenure teachers dismissal cases.
