50|$|Inclusion and <b>exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>are</b> {{meant to}} ensure {{patients}} safety during the study, provide data (justification) of subject appropriateness for the study, to minimize withdrawal (also costs) {{and ensure that}} primary end-points of study are reached.|$|R
30|$|Between June 2001 and January 2006, we {{identified}} patients who underwent total hip arthroplasties (THA) {{performed by the}} senior author. The inclusion <b>criterion</b> <b>was</b> diagnosis of OA secondary to CHD (Crowe’s classification type I or II). The <b>exclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>was</b> revision hip surgery.|$|R

50|$|Inclusion <b>criteria</b> <b>are</b> {{characteristics}} that the prospective subjects must have {{if they are}} to be included in the study, while <b>exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>are</b> those {{characteristics that}} disqualify prospective subjects from inclusion in the study. Inclusion and <b>exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> may include factors such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, type and stage of disease, the subject’s previous treatment history, and the presence or absence (as in the case of the “healthy” or “control” subject) of other medical, psychosocial, or emotional conditions.|$|R
30|$|Patients {{and methods}} This study was {{conducted}} retrospectively from January 1 st 2011 to May 1 st 2016, in our intensive care department. All admitted ESBLe-colonized patients who develop an infection during their ICU stay {{have been included in}} the study. The only <b>exclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>was</b> an antibiotic treatment for an ESBLe infection at ICU admission.|$|R
30|$|The sample {{selection}} {{described in}} Sect.   4.2 {{will result in}} one sample of daily data. To this end, a number of filtering or <b>exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>are</b> applied to eight subperiods: the calendar years from 2003 to 2008 and two somewhat shorter periods, from February  2002 to year-end and {{from the beginning of}} 2009 to the end of September.|$|R
30|$|For a first {{screening}} of the software packages, 16 <b>exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> defined describing conditions that the packages had to fulfil {{in order to be}} eligible for the further evaluation.|$|E
30|$|Method: A {{retrospective}} case note based {{audit of}} 100 consecutive hysteroscopies performed under general anaesthesia. After <b>exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> applied the notes were audited to ascertain appropriate referral for hysteroscopy.|$|E
30|$|<b>Exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, septic arthritis, gout, diabetes, {{and mechanical}} axis deviation of the knees. Healthy volunteers {{who had no}} clinical or radiological evidence of OA {{were included in the}} control group.|$|E
30|$|From 1990 to 2012, {{data were}} {{collected}} on 485 patients who underwent SESA at the San Raffaele Hospital. The {{average age of the}} patient cohort was 11.5  ±  1.81 years (range 5.0 – 17.9  years; median 11.5  years). Inclusion <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> FFF and marked flexible hindfoot valgus, and the <b>exclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>was</b> rigid flatfoot. SESA was performed in 732 cases of FFF—bilaterally in 247 patients and monolaterally in 238 patients.|$|R
30|$|We {{identified}} 2138 {{prostate cancer}} patients from the database. From among these patients, 36 had been administered docetaxel {{during the study}} period. We excluded 15 persons who {{had been diagnosed with}} other cancers or had used docetaxel in June 2013, which was the final month of the study period. The first <b>exclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>was</b> to focus the study on prostate cancer patients, while the second <b>exclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> enabled the analysis of post-docetaxel treatments. As a result, the final sample for analysis comprised 18 CRPC patients.|$|R
30|$|<b>Exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>are</b> {{contraindication}} to SMT, spinal radiculopathy, pregnancy, {{depression and}} CSMT within the previous 12  months. Participants whom during the RCT receive any manual interventions by physiotherapists, chiropractors, osteopaths or other health professionals to treat musculoskeletal pain and disability, including massage therapy, joint mobilization and manipulation (French et al. 2011), changed their prophylactic headache medicine or pregnancy will be {{withdrawn from the}} study {{at that time and}} be regarded as drop-outs.|$|R
30|$|Once {{formulated}} {{the review}} question, the inclusion and <b>exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> defined, the search strategy {{was developed to}} locate and select the studies, the data were extracted; therefore, the results were analyzed and interpreted.|$|E
30|$|<b>Exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> passive {{shoulder}} stiffness {{with a loss}} of forward {{elevation of}} > 40 ° and a loss of external rotation of > 30 °, previous surgery, nerve palsy, and rotator cuff tears.|$|E
30|$|Patients who {{satisfied}} the inclusion and <b>exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> recruited for the study. There were 24 men and 60 {{women in the}} study. Clinical KSS, functional KSS, and radiographic evaluation were performed in all patients.|$|E
40|$|Total {{bilateral}} blindness in {{the setting}} of facial transplantation is a controversial matter. Some transplant teams exclude these candidates, while others accept them onto their facial transplant waiting list. Using 3 cases, the clinical and ethical complexity of total bilateral blindness is explored. Guidance (medical, psychological, and social) for total bilateral blindness as both an inclusion and <b>exclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>is</b> provided, with the stipulation that total bilateral blindness should not <b>be</b> an automatic <b>exclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> for facial transplantation. Additionally, guidance for corneal transplant in facial transplant candidates is discussed. Suggestions for posttransplant disability assistance for patients with total bilateral blindness are also provided...|$|R
30|$|Elective {{referrals}} {{to the hospital}} are paper-based, and referrals are triaged to the POTC by the consultants. Initial inclusion <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> restricted to normal variants and were expanded as the clinic developed to include idiopathic toe walkers, curly toes, orthopaedic gait concerns and lower limb pain of mechanical origin. <b>Exclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>are</b> as follows: low back pain, referrals from other hospital consultants, lower limb conditions with specific diagnoses such as Perthes disease, requests for surgical opinion and referrals suggestive of neuromuscular disorders, infective, inflammatory or malignant disease.|$|R
