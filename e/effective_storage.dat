5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an <b>effective</b> <b>storage</b> medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E

25|$|When a {{model of}} replicating {{molecules}} was created, it was found that, for <b>effective</b> <b>storage</b> of information, macromolecules on prebiotic Earth could not exceed a certain threshold length. This problem {{is known as the}} error threshold problem. It arises because replication is an imperfect process, and during each replication event, there is a risk of incorporating errors into a new sequence, leading {{to the creation of a}} quasispecies. In a system that is deprived of high-fidelity replicases and error-correction mechanisms, mutations occur with a high probability. As a consequence, the information stored in a sequence can be lost due to the rapid accumulation of errors, a so-called error catastrophe. Moreover, it was shown that the genome size of any organism is roughly equal to the inverse of mutation rate per site per replication. Therefore, a high mutation rate imposes a serious limitation on the length of the genome. To overcome this problem, a more specialized replication machinery that is able to copy genetic information with higher fidelity is needed. Manfred Eigen suggested that proteins are necessary to accomplish this task. However, to encode a system as complex as a protein, longer nucleotide sequences are needed, which increases the probability of a mutation even more and requires even more complex replication machinery. This vicious circle is known as Eigen's Paradox.|$|E
