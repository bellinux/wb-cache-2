[...] "Little Dude" [...] {{was the first}} entry in the series to have been storyboarded by prop and {{character}} designer DeForge. He wrote on his official Tumblr that, [...] "Cole and Adam Muto basically <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> through the whole process, and were both incredibly patient with me." [...] Starting with [...] "Love Games", Ristaino was promoted from lead character designer to storyboard artist. Guest artist Falk, creator of the animated series Untalkative Bunny, storyboarded the episodes [...] "Shh!" [...] and [...] "Root Beer Guy". The former was dedicated to Armen Mirzaian who was a storyboard artist for earlier episodes in the series. Mirzaian {{died in a car}} accident on February 21, 2013 at the age of 35. Regular storyboardist Castuera had to take off two storyboard rotations due to an art show, and so her partner, Moynihan, worked with German cartoonist Wellmann on [...] "The Suitor" [...] and [...] "Wizards Only, Fools"; the two co-operated on their storyboards via Skype and Google+ Hangout. Pearson was paired with Xayaphone for both the episodes [...] "Candy Streets" [...] and [...] "Frost & Fire"; however, this pairing was only temporary, and Xayaphone boarded {{the rest of the season}} with Kim. This season was the last to feature Page and Sugar. Page left after completing [...] "Davey" [...] to create his own series Clarence. Sugar left the series after storyboarding the episode [...] "Simon & Marcy" [...] to focus her attention on her own Cartoon Network series, Steven Universe.|$|E

When I left he <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in both his and shook it warmly. His heart was too full of emotion to speak a word. He realized that the chances were we would never see each other again. He died several years ago.” ...|$|E

[...] Harrison noted that as Heston knew it was her [...] "first big picture", he {{took it upon himself}} to coach her. Harrison was admittedly still [...] "camera-shy", so Heston [...] "taught me to favour the camera. Don't look right into it. Look off to the side, don't look too far, you know, not to turn my head this way. And he would say turn it just here. Don't go all the way back. And he <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> for a lot of things." [...] Their off-screen relationship, Harrison said, tended to reflect their on-screen relationship. Heston ...|$|E

His repertoire at this concert, which was broadcast worldwide and received enthusiastic reviews, united original ethnic music with European classics, and included a song D'Or composed specifically for the Pope in both Hebrew and Italian. He was the first Israeli singer to sing in Hebrew for the Pope. After he performed for the Pope ("He <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> and gave me his blessing", D'Or said.

The Italian press, such as Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, gave D'Or positive reviews.|$|E
2500|$|Fattouma Khefacha, {{was born}} in 1861 to Khadouja Mzali and Ahmed Khefacha. When she was very young, her parents divorced. Bourguiba, who had always criticized {{repudiation}} in Islam, stated in 1973, that the reason of the divorce was [...] "futile".

Therefore, she helped with house chores, participating in supplies preparations and wool washing, at the seaside. She had a good relationship with her sister, Aïchoucha Mzali, mother of the famous Abelaziz al-Aroui, who lived at the end of the same street. Despite that, Bourguiba stated that [...] "in reality, there wasn't much of a relationship between my family and that of mother, that it to say, that of Ahmed Khefacha, who, as I said, had remarried. However, one day, when going across a nearby square, known today as independence square, where there had been a grand café, my father, who <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> told me to go kiss my grandfather, while designating a ruddy faced old man. So I did what I was told and kissed him".|$|E
