30|$|Nanostructures are {{the most}} {{investigated}} object in solid state physics, especially quantum confinement effect in quantum dots[1], quantum wires[2], and quantum wells[3]. Moreover, different shapes of nanostructures can lead to unique physical properties of material[4]. For example, nanocones, depending on a height of structure and solid angle α at top of it, can be quantum dots, quantum wires, or quantum wells[5, 6]. The decrease of nanocone's solid angle α < 60 ° leads to fundamental changes of its properties. Quantum dot transforms into a quantum wire with gradually decreasing diameter from the base until {{the tip of the}} cone.

30|$|Many {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations exist on heterostructures of self-assembled nanocones, e.g., Ge/Si [1], InAs/GaAs [2]. Usually nanocones are considered as quantum dots (QDs)--QD quantum system, with a condition ratio diameter/height of nanocones is equal 1. If solid angle α at top is > 60 °, then the nanocone transforms into a quantum well (QW)-- 2 D quantum system, due to large diameter of nanocones {{in comparison with}} the height and quantization of energy of particles (e.g., excitons) takes place only in vertical direction [2].

30|$|In {{this work}} we study the {{mechanisms}} of laser radiation interaction with <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductors</b> such as Si and Ge and their solid solution SiGe. As {{a result of this}} investigation, {{the mechanisms of}} nanocones and microcones formation on a surface of semiconductor were proposed. We have shown the possibility to control the size and the shape of cones both by the laser. The main reason for the formation of nanocones is the mechanical compressive stresses due to the atoms’ redistribution caused by the gradient of temperature induced by strongly absorbed laser radiation. According to our investigation, the nanocone formation mechanism in semiconductors is characterized by two stages. The first stage is characterized by formation of a p-n junction for <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductors</b> or of a Ge/Si heterojunction for SiGe solid solution. The generation and redistribution of intrinsic point defects in <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductors</b> and Ge atoms concentration on the irradiated surface of SiGe solid solution in temperature gradient field take place at this stage due to the thermogradient effect which is caused by strongly absorbed laser radiation. The second stage is characterized by formation of nanocones due to mechanical plastic deformation of the compressed Ge layer on Si. Moreover, a new 1 D-graded band gap structure in <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductors</b> due to quantum confinement effect was formed. For the formation of microcones Ni/Si structure was used. The mechanism of the formation of microcones is characterized by two stages as well. The first stage is the melting of Ni film after irradiation by laser beam and formation of Ni islands due to surface tension force. The second step is the melting of Ni and subsequent manifestations of Marangoni effect with the growth of microcones.|$|R

The lack of understanding of the interaction effects of laser radiation with a semiconductor limits laser technology application in microelectronics [12].

40|$|Abstract. A {{possibility}} of magnetic-field-induced modification of structural defects in silicon crystals is studied. It is shown that magnetic field action essentially affects the structure-dependent properties of Si (mechanical and electrophysical). Investigation {{of the magnetic}} field (MF) action on solids has recently attracted particular interest. A number of phenomena involving the effect of weak MF {{on a variety of}} physical processes in crystalline solids have been discovered [1 - 7]. In theoretical models, it is proposed to interpret the influence of MF on the crystals mainly by MF action on the formation and breakage of chemical bonds [8, 9]. A growing number of publications on this subject has resulted in {{the emergence of a new}} trend in the physics of plasticity – spin micromechanics – aimed at getting knowledge of the micromechanical spin-dependent processes affecting the mechanical properties of solids. As to the class of <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductor</b> crystals, silicon crystals in particular, there are very few publications on the elucidation of the MF action on the mechanical properties of those crystals in the literature.

This feature is, we believe, another demonstration of the previously found covalent-like quasi-bonding (CLQB) where wavefunction hybridization does occur. The strength of this inter-chain CLQB is comparable with that of intra-chain covalent bonding, leading to closed stability of several Te allotropes. It also introduces a tunable bandgap varying from nearly direct 0. 31 eV (bulk) to indirect 1. 17 eV (2 L) and four (two) complex, highly anisotropic and layer-dependent hole (electron) pockets in the first Brillouin zone. It also exhibits an extraordinarily high hole mobility (~ 10 $^ 5 $ cm$^ 2 $/Vs) and strong optical absorption along the non-covalently bound direction, nearly isotropic and layer-dependent optical properties, large ideal strength over 20 %, better environmental stability than BP and unusual crossover of force constants for interlayer shear and breathing modes.

40|$|A {{possibility}} of formingquantum cones (QC) by Nd:YAG laser radiation {{on the surface}} of semiconductorssuch as Si and Ge crystals, and SiGe and CdZnTe solid solutions has been shown. A two-stage mechanism of quantum cone formation has been proposed. The first stage is generation and redistribution of point defects (impurity atoms and intrinsic point defects – vacancies and self-interstitials) in a temperature gradient field, the so-called thermogradient effect. As a result a new phase is formed on the irradiated surface, for example a Ge phase forms {{on the surface of}} a SiGe solid solution.

As a result, interstitials are concentrated at the irradiated surface of semiconductor, forming the top layer. Vacancies are concentrated under the top layer forming a buried layer with mechanical tension due to the absence of atoms. Sometimes vacancies form nanocavities [17]. At the second stage of the process, nanocones are formed on the irradiated surface of the semiconductors due to plastic deformation of the top layer {{in the same way as}} in the previous case with semiconductor solid solutions.|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{mechanism}} of nanocone formation on a surface of elementary semiconductors by Nd:YAG laser radiation. Our previous investigations of SiGe and CdZnTe solid solutions have shown that nanocone formation mechanism is characterized by two stages. The first stage is characterized by formation of heterostructure, for example, Ge/Si heterostructure from SiGe solid solutions, and the second stage is characterized by formation of nanocones by mechanical plastic deformation of the compressed Ge layer on Si due to mismatch of Si and Ge crystalline lattices. The mechanism of nanocone formation for elementary semiconductors is not clear until now. Therefore, the main goal of our investigations is to study the stages of nanocone formation in elementary semiconductors. A new mechanism of p-n junction formation by laser radiation in the <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductor</b> as a first stage of nanocone formation is proposed. We explain this effect by the following way: p-n junction is formed by generation and redistribution of intrinsic point defects in temperature gradient field – the thermogradient effect, which is caused by strongly absorbed laser radiation. According to the thermogradient effect, interstitial atoms drift towards the irradiated surface, but vacancies drift to the opposite direction – in the bulk of semiconductor. Since interstitials in Ge crystal are of n-type and vacancies {{are known to be}} of p-type, a n-p junction is formed. The mechanism is confirmed by the appearance of diode-like current–voltage characteristics after i-Ge irradiation crystal by laser radiation. The mechanism in Si is confirmed by conductivity type inversion and increased microhardness of Si crystal. The second stage of nanocone formation is laser heating up of top layer enriched by interstitial atoms with its further plastic deformation due to compressive stress caused by interstitials in the top layer and vacancies in the buried layer.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explain the {{properties}} of unusual photoluminescence spectrum of nanohills formed on a surface of Si crystal by laser radiation. Si is an <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductor</b> with indirected band structure. Therefore, quantum efficiency of photoluminescence (PL) is very low and usually maximum of spectrum is situated at 1. 12 eV. Several scientific groups have shown the possibility of shift of Si and Ge radiative IR-spectrum in visible region of spectrum using Si and Ge nanoparticles implanted into SiO 2 layer. This phenomenon is explained by Quantum Confinement Effect (QCE) in nanodots. Investigation of interaction of powerful laser radiation with Si and Ge single crystals was carried out in order to show the possibility of nanohills formation on irradiated surface, Wide PL spectrum of nanodots and nanohills was explained by size-wise non-homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles. PL spectra of SiGVSi and Si structures irradiated by Nd:YAG laser second harmonics at intensity of up to 2. 0 MW/cm 2 and non-irradiated structure have been studded experimentally. PL spectrum of the irradiated structure is asymmetric with maximum at 2. 0 eV and has a long shoulder in the red region of spectrum. Investigation of the irradiated Si surface morphology has shown formation of nanohills of "pin acacia"-like shape which led us to conclude that such properties of PL is connected with the shape of nanohills. Investigation of three shapes of nanohills' surface, i. e., square parabola rotation around symmetry axis ("dome"), triangle ("cone") and reverse parabola (''pin acacia") has shown that at the same height and base of the figures, in the last two structures QCE takes place because the relation d < RB for the presence of QCE (Bohrs’ radius for electron and hole must be bigger than the diameter of nanostructure) fulfill and it does not fulfill for Che first case. As a result PL spectrum for the three figures will be different: for the first shape it will be the same as tor the bulk semiconductor, for the second one — it will be Gaussian with "blue shift" in comparison with the previous spectrum, for the third one - wide spectrum with "blue shift" in comparison with the previous one. The last statement is confirmed by our calculation of band-gap in nanohill-nanowires with gradually change of diameter from substrate till top of nanohill.

40|$|I. INTRODUCTION P-n {{junction}} is {{the most}} important component of many semiconductor devices. Thermodiffusion, ion implantation and molecular beam epitaxy are only a few methods to form a p-n junction. The main drawback for these methods is high cost of equipment. Therefore this equipment is not available for small and medium companies. A possibility of p-n junction formation by laser radiation was shown in several semiconductors: p-Si, p-CdTe, p-InSb, p-InAs, p-PbSe and p- Ge. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the nature of inversion of conductivity type: impurities’ segregation, defects’ generation, amorphization and oxygen related donor generation. However, the proposed mechanisms have many flaws and even contradictions; therefore the mechanism of p-n junction formation by laser radiation (LR) is not clear until now. The aim of the work is to show a new possibility of p-n junction formation in intrinsic <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductor</b> by LR without any impurities and to propose the new mechanism of p-n junction formation. II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We assume that, the intrinsic defects play the main role in formation of p-n junction. For this reason i-Ge crystal was irradiated by Nd:YAG laser with different energy of quantum. In experiments i-Ge single crystals with NA = 7. 4 × 1011 cm- 3 and ND = 6. 8 × 1011 cm- 3 s were used. Samples were prepared by mechanical polishing with diamond grease followed by chemical treatment with CP- 4 etching solution. To form a p-n junction, nanosecond Nd:YAG laser with wavelengths λ 1 = 1064 nm, λ 2 = 532 nm and λ 3 = 266 was used. Measurements of I-V characteristics were done by soldering 99 % Sn and 1 % Sb alloy electrical contacts directly on the irradiated surface of i- Ge and the opposite side. I-V characteristics of i-Ge samples before and after irradiation different intensities of Nd:YAG laser with wavelength 266 nm and different laser intensities are shown in Fig. 1. Increase of rectification ratio (RR) of I-V characteristics with intensity of the laser radiation, energy of laser radiation quanta and numbers of pulses were observed in this experiment (see Fig. 2). Moreover, this process takes place in threshold manner, it means, RR is non-monotonic function on laser radiation intensity. These results are explained by damage of p-n junction at threshold intensity (Ith) due to formation of nanocones. The mechanism of this phenomenon is explained by generation and redistribution of intrinsic point defects in temperature gradient field, which causes strongly absorbed LR. The redistribution of defects takes place because interstitial atoms drift towards the irradiated surface, but vacancies drift in the opposite direction – in the bulk of semiconductor according to Thermogradient effect [1]. Since interstitials in Ge crystal are of n-type and vacancies are known to be of p-type [2], a p-n junction is formed. III. CONCLUSIONS For the first time we have proved that the mechanism of pn junction formation in semiconductor is caused by generation and redistribution of intrinsic point defects in temperature gradient field induced by LR. Increase of rectification ratio of p-n junction with the increase of LR intensity is typical for Thermogradient effect; therefore this effect has the main role in p-n junction formation. IV.

40|$|A new {{elaborated}} laser {{method for}} nanocones formation in <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductors</b> Si and Ge and their solid solutions is reported. A cone possesses unique properties: a small cone is a quantum dot {{and a long}} one is a quantum wire with the gradually decreasing diameter from the base till {{the top of the}} cone. Everywhere radius of cone is equal or less than Bohr’ radius of electron, exciton or phonon Quantum confinement effect (QCE) takes place. Properties of nanocones using AFM, SEM, photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy were studied. Unique visible PL from the surfaces with nanocones was found and is explained by QCE. A “red” shift of Raman spectra in Ge is a good evidence of this suggestion. Asymmetry of PL spectra of the irradiated SiO 2 /Si structure is explained by formation graded band gap structure due to QCE in nanocones-nanowires with a graded decrease of diameter toward the top of nanocone. Two-stage model of nanocones formation is proposed [1]: Laser Redistribution of Atoms and Selective Laser Annealing. The first stage is characterized by formation of heterostructures such as Ge/Si due to drift of Ge atoms toward the irradiated surface of the sample in the gradient of temperature, the so-called thermogradient effect [2]. New Ge phase is formed {{at the end of the}} process. Ge atoms are localized at the surface of Si like a thin film. The second stage is characterized by formation of nanocones on the irradiated surface of a semiconductor by selective laser heating of the top layer with following mechanical plastic deformation of the layer as a result of relaxation of the mechanical compressive stress arising between these layers due to mismatch of their crystal lattices and selective laser heating.

The mechanism of nanocones’ formation on the irradiated surface of Si 0. 7 Ge 0. 3 solid solutions is characterized by two stages – Laser Redistribution of Atoms (LRA) and Selective Laser Annealing (SLA). The first stage of nanocones’ growth - LRA is characterized by formation of top strained layer, enriched by Ge atoms in Si 0. 7 Ge 0. 3 due to their drift to the irradiated surface in temperature gradient field induced by laser radiation. The main role in this process has Thermogradient effect. LRA is a nonlinear optical process: concentration of Ge atoms in the top layer of SiGe solid solution increase with number of laser pulses {{and at the same time}} absorption coefficient of the top layer increases. As a result, LRA stage gradually transits to SLA stage. The second stage of nanocones’ formation on the irradiated surface of semiconductor - SLA is selective laser absorption of the light by the top stained layer with further mechanical plastic deformation of the top layer due to relaxation of the mechanical compressive stress arising between these layers due to mismatch of their crystal lattices and heating up the top layer. SLA occurs due to higher absorption of the laser radiation by the top layer than the buried layer.

The work is completed by new MC simulations, especially for material compositions, where no experimental data are available. The extraction of the saturation velocity reveals a significant difference between the saturation velocity in the bulk and the effective (saturation) velocity extracted from rf-measurements e. g. for High Electron Mobility Transistors. Since this effective value is often used for device characterization, the difference gives insight into modeling the determining quantities of HEMTs...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{analysis}} of experimental results, a two-stage mechanism of nanocones formation on the irradiated surface of semiconductors by Nd:YAG laser is proposed for <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductors</b> and solid solutions such as: Si, Ge, SiGe and CdZnTe. Properties observed are explained {{in the frame of}} Quantum confinement effect. The first stage of the mechanism is characterized by formation of a thin strained top layer, due to redistribution of point defects in temperature gradient field induced by laser radiation. The second stage is characterized by mechanical plastic deformation of the stained top layer leading to arising of nanocones, due to selective laser absorption of the top layer. The nanocones formed on the irradiated surface of semiconductors by Nd:YAG laser possessing the properties of 1 D graded band gap has been found for Si, Ge and SiGe as well, however QD structure in CdTe was observed. The model is confirmed by "blue shift" of bands in photoluminescence spectrum, "red shift" of longitudinal optimal line in Raman back scattering spectrum of Ge crystal, appearance of Ge phase in SiGe solid solution after irradiation by the laser at intensity 20 MW/cm 2 and non-monotonous dependence of Si crystal micro-hardness as function of the laser intensity...|$|R
30|$|For {{the first}} time, a new {{mechanism}} of p-n junction {{formation in the}} <b>elementary</b> intrinsic <b>semiconductor</b> by laser radiation as {{the first stage of}} nanocone formation is proposed. P-n junction is formed by generation and redistribution of intrinsic point defects in temperature gradient field - the thermogradient effect, which is caused by strongly absorbed laser radiation. The second stage of nanocone formation is laser heating up of top layer enriched by interstitial atoms with its further plastic deformation due to compressive stress caused by interstitials in the top layer and vacancies in the buried layer.|$|R

Strong change of the optical properties of the semiconductors after irradiation by Nd:YAG laser are explained by the presence of Quantum Confinement Effect (QCE) in quantum cones. “Blue shift” of photoluminescence spectra and “red shift” of phonon LO line in Raman spectrum are explained by exciton and phonon QCE in quantum cones, correspondently. Asymmetry of the photoluminescence band in the spectrum of Si quantum cones is explained by 1 D graded band gap structure. Experimental data on quantum cones formation on a surface of Si, Ge and their solid solution and CdZnTe crystal and their optical properties are presented. Two-stage mechanism of quantum cones’ formation on a surface of the semiconductors is proposed [1]. The first stage of the mechanism is characterized by the formation of a thin strained top layer, due to redistribution of point defects in temperature-gradient field induced by laser radiation.

40|$|The {{nanoscale}} {{fracture of}} a semiconductor surface under {{the action of}} nanosecond Nd:YAG laser radiation has been performed. The investigation of the surface topography, optical and mechanical properties {{has shown that the}} mechanism of the surface nanoscale fracture is relaxation of mechanical compressive stress. The experiments were carried out on semiconductor crystals such as: <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductors</b> Si and Ge; compound semiconductors GaAs and CdTe; solid solutions SiGe and CdZnTe. The nanoscale fractured surface of semiconductor possesses unique physical properties when at least one dimension of the nanoscale fracture is comparable or less than Bohr’ radius of electron, hole or exciton. The “blue shift” of the photoluminescence band maximum of the nanoscale fractured surface of Si crystal by 1. 05 eV was observed. Moreover, the band intensity increased by 106 times. The dependence of laser radiation intensity on Si crystal microhardness is characterized by non-monotonous function, which has two maximums for p-type and one maximum for n-type. Our study has shown that the nanoscale fracture mechanism consists of two stages. The first stage is formation of a mechanically strained top layer on the irradiated surface of semiconductor due to redistribution of impurity atoms and intrinsic defects (interstitials and vacancies) in temperature gradient field, the so called Thermo gradient effect [1]. At the first stage of the process microhardness of p-type Si crystal increases by 40 % and conversion to n-type conductivity takes place. Therefore, p-n homojunction is formed in <b>elementary</b> and compound <b>semiconductors</b> irradiated by the laser. This fact is explained by the opposite charge of interstitials and vacancies [2]. Whereas, the irradiation of solid solutions by the laser leads to formation of different phases, for example, Ge/Si. In this case, formation of p-n heterojunction takes place. The second stage is plastic deformation of the top layer due to relaxation of mechanical compressive stress. The stress in the top layer arises due to the difference in the lattice constants of the heterostructure layers and selective laser heating...|$|R
40|$|Melting {{and rapid}} {{solidification}} is induced in 50 -nm-thick amorphous Ge films on glass substrates by single laser pulses at 583 nm {{with a duration}} of 10 ps. The solidification process is followed by means of reflectivity measurements with ns time resolution both at the air/film (front) and the substrate/film (back) interfaces. Due to interference effects between the light reflected at the film-substrate and film-liquid interfaces, the back side reflectivity measurements turn out to be very sensitive to the melt depth induced by the laser pulse and their comparison to optical simulations enables the determination of the solidification dynamics. For low fluences, only a thin layer of the film is melted and solidification occurs interfacially leading to reamorphization of the molten material. The results provide a critical interface velocity for amorphization of ∼ 4 m/s, much slower than the one that has widely been reported for <b>elementary</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> For high fluences, the molten layer depth approaches the film thickness and the results are consistent with a bulk solidification process. In this case, recalescence effects upon solid phase nucleation become important and lead to the formation of crystallites distributed throughout the whole resolidified volume. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.
