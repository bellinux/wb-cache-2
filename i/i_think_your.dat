25|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that the system is}} {{applicable}} with certainty and efficiency to the Cornwall Railway. That a sufficient power may be obtained so as to work the trains, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> traffic will require, at an average speed of 30 miles an hour for passenger trains, and from 15 to 20 miles an hour for goods, including stoppages in both cases, and that special trains may be despatched at greater speed if necessary.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{their careers}} Drake and Minaj {{maintained}} a close personal and business relationship, and were frequent collaborators. However, while recording Nothing Was the Same, Drake {{did not work}} with Minaj or anyone from Cash Money Records, leading her to say: [...] "I'm Young Money 'til the death of me, Drake can do what Drake do, but Nicki Minaj is a whole different person. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> team is your team. Who gives a fuck about trying to be different? I'm always going to want my team {{to be a part}} of my project, no matter what, in some way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
60|$|Burr. What {{noise is}} that? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> hear <b>your</b> cousin Trice's voice.|$|R
60|$|Phil. Count Rhodophil's a fine gentleman indeed, madam; and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> deserves <b>your</b> affection.|$|R
60|$|JOHN.--Owe for it, you mean. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> tradesmen profit much by your custom, ex-Cornet Kicklebury.|$|R
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> {{attempt to}} redefine the second race at St Cloud as the first {{velocipede}} race does not hold water. Velocipedes meant boneshakers, only occasionally was there the odd tricycle or quadricycle. Boneshakers began effectively in 1867 and St Cloud {{was just one of}} several minor meetings which Duncan [...] just happened to immortalise.|$|E
2500|$|In the third-season episode [...] "One Dumb Idea", Karen {{offers her}} idea on a {{character}} based on Findlay for a sitcom idea {{he was trying}} to come up with, saying, [...] "I think if you're gonna go for reality, or, sorry, for verisimilitude, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> character should be deceitful and self-serving. Basically, pathologically ambitious and actually lacking in any real humanity." [...] In other words, a sociopath.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four years ago? Is it easier {{for you to go}} and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, Gillian-â€”keep {{yourself}} from this impatient mood. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> understand <b>your</b> unwillingness to overthrow old associations and admit a new overmastering feeling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Brissenden, [...] "I'll {{make her}} go for you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> want <b>your</b> {{assistance}} {{quite as much}} as she can want mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Mr. Kendal, 'you know <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>your</b> uncle's {{apparent}} indifference {{may be his}} {{fashion of}} being your best friend.' ...|$|R
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE. Naturally <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Your</b> Highness ought to, most decidedly.|$|E
60|$|EMPEROR. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> private ground may be {{your own}} private newspaper.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> self-command is wonderful. I've never admired {{you more}} than at this moment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{follow you}} much,' Mrs. Nettlepoint replied, 'but {{so far as}} I do <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> remarks are in very good taste.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{follow you}} closely," [...] Mrs. Nettlepoint replied, [...] "but {{so far as}} I do <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> remarks in the best taste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will think}} over what you say, Vincent, {{and tell you}} my {{decision}} in the morning. <b>I</b> certainly <b>think</b> <b>your</b> plan is a good one." ...|$|R
60|$|BENNET. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> ladyship {{must have}} been misinformed. I most {{certainly}} have seen none.|$|E
60|$|Mar. They must, {{till they}} can shake their burden off; And that's, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>your</b> aim.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> advice {{with that}} of others would be {{valuable}} {{in the selection of}} provost-marshals for Ohio.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{dress is}} all right. It's the general effect. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> {{expression}} is right. It's--it's--there's too much attack in it. You aren't meek enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} bailiff, finally, [...] "all is settled, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> about <b>your</b> coming, and I am going home-along. Good-night to ye, shepherd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sally Kittridge! Sally Kittridge!" [...] she called, [...] "come {{back this}} minute. What are you about? <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>your</b> father {{was old enough}} to know better." ...|$|R
60|$|MR MARCH. Public opinion's {{always in}} advance of the Law. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> daughter's a most pathetic little figure.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Pinch,' said Pecksniff, 'this {{is hardly}} decent. You will excuse my saying that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> conduct {{scarcely}} decent, Mr Pinch.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> solid, incisive style {{would rather}} go {{down with the}} masses. However, we shall see, we shall see.' ...|$|E
60|$|JOHN. I won't be long. You've {{waited a}} {{year more than}} you need have done, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's <b>your</b> due <b>I</b> should hurry things now.|$|R
6000|$|The surveyor's gesture was expressive. [...] "We're {{not in it}} now. Ore's turned spotty, and it's running deeper. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>your</b> {{telling me}} that Grenfell figured that the lode takes an inclination?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is that <b>your</b> trouble? <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> shares {{will rise}} in a hurry; {{but if you want}} some fun, go and talk to the French about it,' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He looked strange, sort of forlorn. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> words--what {{you said}} hurt {{him more than}} the bullet. I'm sure of that, Miss Sampson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More {{than two}} or three, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>your</b> Majesty," [...] Dartnoff answered. [...] "I will give their names to the officer {{commanding}} your escort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I'm {{quite in}} earnest. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> papa {{means to make}} up an income for you,--only you must not expect to be rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard your}} {{challenge}} to the creature you call Tars Tarkas, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> understand <b>your</b> position among these people, but what I cannot fathom is your statement {{that you are not}} of Barsoom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Nature {{had done}} that already; but I'm bound to say they {{improved}} on Nature's work. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>your</b> Cousin Percy must have felt like a plucked chicken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Ned, <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>your</b> jealousy {{would show}} out so strong," [...] {{retorted}} his comrade. [...] "Now, then, Dumsby, fire away, {{if it was}} only to aggravate him." ...|$|R
