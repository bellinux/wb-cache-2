50|$|The witness {{was unable}} to sense what {{he claimed to have}} (such as he could not see from where he was), or he lacked the {{requisite}} mental capacity. Older common law would exclude an <b>incompetent</b> <b>witness</b> from testifying. Modern rules, such as the Federal Rules of Evidence, allow the witness on the stand (in most cases) to consider competence as one of many factors that juries are to consider to determine credibility of the witness.|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{concerning}} eyewitness testimony {{given by}} people with mental retardation in court was reviewed. Despite general perceptions that people with mental retardation make <b>incompetent</b> <b>witnesses,</b> available evidence suggests that they can provide accurate accounts of witnessed events. The accounts are usually less complete than those provided by the general population and are greatly influenced by the methods of questioning. The sparse available evidence suggests that cross-examination methods may lead to memory distortion. The use of closed, complex, and leading questions {{and the absence of}} aids to recall may have a particularly adverse effect on people with mental retardation. Resulting errors could lead to a false conviction or acquittal. Future policy and research in this much neglected area were discussed...|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} 1824, the Missouri General Assembly {{passed a}} law {{providing}} a process for enslaved persons to sue for freedom and have some protections in the process. An 1825 law passed by the General Assembly declared blacks <b>incompetent</b> as <b>witnesses</b> in legal cases which involved whites, and testimonies by black witnesses were automatically invalidated. In 1847, an ordinance banning the education of blacks and mulattoes was enacted. Anyone caught teaching a black or mulatto person, whether enslaved or free, was to be fined $500 and serve six months in jail.|$|R

He was concerned by the lack of evidence either way as to whether an exception to the rule in Watson was needed or the consequences of introducing such an exception, particularly as the effect of the decision of the majority was to remove the immunity with retrospective effect, and there was [...] "no way back" [...] from this without legislation. The [...] "need for certainty" [...] made it necessary to extend the rule to all witnesses, in his view, even though some genuine claims may be barred as a result. He was particularly concerned that an [...] "incautious" [...] removal of the immunity from experts [...] "risks destabilising the protection that is given to witnesses generally", adding that the approach of Lord Phillips contained [...] "seeds...for challenging the whole concept of witness immunity." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1624 Virginia {{was made}} a crown colony. Because of the {{establishment}} of the English Church, hostility was shown to adherents of other beliefs and to Catholics in particular. Lord Baltimore attempted in vain to plant a Catholic colony in Virginia (1629-30). Stringent legislation was enacted against Catholics. In 1641 a decree declared that adherents of the pope were to be fined 1000 pounds of tobacco if they attempted to hold office. The following year all priests were given five days within which to leave the colony. In 1661 all persons were obliged to attend the Established services or pay a fine of Â£20. The governor issued orders to magistrates, sheriffs, constables, and people to be diligent in the apprehension and bringing to justice of all Catholic priests. The records of Norfolk County (1687) show Fathers Edmonds and Raymond arrested. In 1699 Catholics were deprived of their right of voting, and later a fine of 500 pounds of tobacco was imposed upon violators of the law. They were declared <b>incompetent</b> as <b>witnesses</b> in 1705, and in 1753 such incompetency was made to cover all cases.|$|R

6000|$|In {{ordinary}} cases, {{they require}} two witnesses {{to prove a}} fact; and therefore they held, [...] "that, if there be but one witness, and no probable grounds of presumption of some kind (nulla argumenta), that one witness {{is by no means}} to be heard"; and it is not inelegantly said in that case, Non jus deficit, sed probatio, [...] "The failure is not in the law, but in the proof." [...] But if other grounds of presumption appear, one witness is to be heard: [...] "for it is not necessary that one crime should be established by one sort of proof only, as by witnesses, or by documents, or by presumptions; all the modes of evidence may be so conjoined, that, where none of them alone would affect the prisoner, all the various concurrent proofs should overpower him like a storm of hail." [...] This is held particularly true in cases where crimes are secret, and detection difficult. The necessity of detecting and punishing such crimes superseded, in the soundest authors, this theoretic aim at perfection, and obliged technical science to submit to practical expedience. [...] "In re criminali," [...] said the rigorists, [...] "probationes debent esse evidentes et luce meridiana clariores": and so undoubtedly it is in offences which admit such proof. But reflection taught them that even their favorite rules of incompetence must give way to the exigencies of distributive justice. One of the best modern writers on the Imperial Criminal Law, particularly as practised in Saxony, (Carpzovius,) says,--"This alone I think it proper to remark, that even <b>incompetent</b> <b>witnesses</b> are sometimes admitted, if otherwise the truth cannot be got at; and this particularly in facts and crimes which are of difficult proof"; and for this doctrine he cites Farinacius, Mascardus, and other eminent Civilians who had written on Evidence. He proceeds afterwards,--"However, this is to be taken with a caution, that the impossibility of otherwise discovering the truth is not construed from hence, that other witnesses were not actually concerned, but that, from the nature of the crime, or from regard had to the place and time, other witnesses could not be present." [...] Many other passages from the same authority, and from others to a similar effect, might be added; we shall only remark shortly, that Gaill, a writer on the practice of that law the most frequently cited in our own courts, gives the rule more {{in the form of a}} maxim,--"that the law is contented with such proof as can be made, if the subject in its nature is difficult of proof."[48] And the same writer, in another passage, refers to another still more general maxim, (and a sound maxim it is,) that the power and means of proof ought not to be narrowed, but enlarged, that the truth may not be concealed: [...] "Probationum facultas non angustari, sed ampliari debeat, ne veritas occultetur."[49] ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess how far trial on {{indictment}} in nineteenth century England conformed to -. " the present day concept of a fair trial. What by contemporary English standards are considered the essential elements of a fair trial the thesis deduces from current statute and case law. Having identified these elements it attempts to discover how far they {{were present in the}} nineteenth century system. The analysis broadly follows the chronology of the trial itself, with particular attention paid to legal aid, the campaign to abolish the rule rendering prisoners and their spouses <b>incompetent</b> as <b>witnesses</b> in their own defence, and appellate remedies. The conclusion reached is that, although {{at the start of the}} nineteenth century the trial system fell well short of the twentieth century model, by the century's end it had (except in relation to legal aid and appellate remedies) moved much closer to it. For its analysis of the trial system the research draws upon eighteenth and nineteenth century law texts supplemented by evidence as to trial practice gleaned from contemporary reports of trials (in particular the reports in The Times, the Central Criminal Court Sessions Papers and Legal Journals), legal memoirs and biographies, and unpublished material in the Public " Record Office and elsewhere. The most important single unpublished source consulted has been the notebooks which record the reserved criminal cases which came before the Common Law judges between'* 1785 and 1828. Reports of Royal Commissions, and Select Committees, draft Bills and the Reports of Parliamentary Debates (supplemented by articles in newspapers and journals) have provided the raw material upon which the account given of the reforms made and attempted during the century is based...|$|R
