5000|$|Liquids {{are only}} very {{slightly}} compressible. This property of liquids lets metering pumps discharge liquids at high pressure. Since a liquid can be only slightly compressed during a <b>discharge</b> <b>stroke,</b> it is {{forced out of}} the pump head. Gases are much more compressible. Metering pumps are not good at pumping gases. Sometimes, a metering or similar pump has to be primed before operation, i. e. the pump head filled with the liquid to be pumped. When gas bubbles enter a pump head, the compression motion compresses the gas but has a hard time forcing it out of the pump head. The pump may stop pumping liquid with gas bubbles in the pump head even though mechanically the pump is going through the motions, repeatedly compressing and decompressing the bubbles. To prevent this type of [...] "vapor lock", chromatography solvents are often degassed before pumping.|$|E

It used four plunger pumps to deliver a pressure of up to [...] every 90 degrees of rotation to keep the fuel pressure adequately constant in the rail. Fuel delivery to individual cylinders could be shut off via valves in the injector lines. Doxford Engines used a common rail system in their opposed-piston marine engines from 1921 to 1980, where a multi-cylinder reciprocating fuel pump generated a pressure of approximately , with the fuel being stored in accumulator bottles. [...] Pressure control was achieved {{by means of an}} adjustable pump <b>discharge</b> <b>stroke</b> and a [...] "spill valve". Camshaft-operated mechanical timing valves were used to supply the spring-loaded Brice/CAV/Lucas injectors, which injected through the side of the cylinder into the chamber formed between the pistons. Early engines had a pair of timing cams, one for ahead running and one for astern. Later engines had two injectors per cylinder, and the final series of constant-pressure turbocharged engines were fitted with four injectors per cylinder. This system was used for the injection of both diesel oil and heavy fuel oil (600cSt heated to a temperature of approximately 130 °C).|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—Primary stroke centers (PSCs) are {{associated}} with greater rates of tissue plasminogen activator use and improved outcomes. The American Stroke Association has advocated for the preferential transport of stroke patients to PSCs. We investigated the impact of PSC certification on hospital <b>stroke</b> <b>discharge</b> patterns in Georgia communities with a choice between PSC and non-PSC. Methods—We analyzed data from the Georgia Discharge Data System before (2004) and after stroke certification (2009). Only Metropolitan Statistical Areas containing 1 PSC and 1 non-PSC {{were included in the}} analysis. We calculated the odds of acute <b>stroke</b> <b>discharge</b> from a PSC in 2009 compared with 2004. Results—In Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Areas with at least 1 PSC and 1 non-PSC hospital, the percent of patients discharged from a subsequently designated PSC increased from 50. 2 % to 56. 6 % between 2004 and 2009 (OR, 1. 29; P 0. 0001). In 4 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, the proportion of <b>stroke</b> <b>discharges</b> from PSCs increased, whereas in 2 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, there was no significant increase, and in 1, there was a trend toward less <b>stroke</b> <b>discharges</b> from PSCs.

This study evaluated {{the effectiveness of a}} workbook-based intervention, designed to change cognitions about control, in improving outcomes for patients and their carers. Method: At <b>discharge,</b> <b>stroke</b> patients were randomly allocated (with their carers) to a 5 -week intervention (n = 103) or control (normal care: n = 100). The main outcome (at 6 months) was recovery from disability using a performance measure, with distress and satisfaction as additional outcomes. Results: The intervention group showed significantly better disability recovery, allowing for initial levels of disability, than those in the control group, F(1, 201) = 5. 61, p = 0. 019. Groups did not differ in distress or satisfaction with care for patients or carers. The only psychological process variable improved by the intervention was Confidence in Recovery but this did not mediate the effects on recovery.

The main {{aim of the}} study presented was to gain insight into the effects of liaison nursing {{on the quality of}} the discharge process and related outcomes. After the introduction of liaison nursing, hospital nurses completed a questionnaire on satisfaction with the liaison nurse. In addition, both before and after the introduction of liaison nursing, two groups of <b>discharged</b> <b>stroke</b> patients were interviewed by telephone. The records of these patients were also studied with respect to background characteristics and duration of hospital stays. The hospital nurses were, generally, positive about the liaison nurse and the job she did (e. g. they found that home care was better organized). Further, after the introduction of liaison nursing, more patients stated that their post-discharge needs had been discussed not later than 48 hours prior to discharge, and more patients said their aftercare had been discussed with community nurses. However, the number of patients whose medication had arrived at home on time had decreased. The results also indicated that there was no significant difference in the duration of stay between the before and after group. The overall conclusion is that the liaison nurses have been moderately succesful in their jobs.

Plasmatic B-type-natriuretic peptide (NT-PBNP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) {{have been}} {{reportedly}} elevated in stroke patients; however their clinical significance remains uncertain. The {{purpose of this}} work is to investigate whether elevation of these proteins at baseline predicts CT-evidence of brain edema. METHODS. We recruited 41 consecutive patients with stroke and determined NT-PBNP and CRP at baseline (within 5 hours after onset), after 48 - 72 hours, and at <b>discharge.</b> <b>Stroke</b> severity was measured {{by means of the}} NIHS scale at baseline and at discharge. We also carried out brain CT at admittance and after 48 hours. RESULTS. There were 29 ischemic strokes and 12 hemorrhagic strokes. Evidence of brain edema on delayed scan was seen in 14 patients. Baseline levels of NT-PBNP did not predict CT-evidence of edema but CRP levels did so significantly (0. 7 mg/dl in patients without edema versus 4. 7 mg in patients with edema; p= 0. 001). Both NT-PBNP and PC levels correlated poorly to NIHSS score and increased markedly from baseline to the second determination in patients with edema. For these patients the NT-PBNP increase was 133. 6 pmol/l in comparison to 1. 58 pmol/l in patients without edema (p= 0. 002). Neither CRP nor NT-PBNP baseline levels were predictive of dependency or death. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that CRP at baseline but not NT-PBNP predicts CT evidence of brain edema in stroke patients.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{are several}} proven therapies for {{patients}} with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), including prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and initiation of antithrombotic medications within 48 h and at <b>discharge.</b> <b>Stroke</b> registries have been promoted {{as a means of}} increasing use of such interventions, which are currently underutilized. Methods From 1999 through 2003, 86 U. S. hospitals participated in Ethos, a voluntary web-based acute stroke treatment registry. Detailed data were collected on all patients admitted with a diagnosis of TIA or ischemic stroke. Rates of optimal treatment (defined as either receipt or a valid contraindication) were examined within each hospital as a function of its length of time in registry. Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for patient and hospital characteristics. Results A total of 16, 301 patients were discharged with a diagnosis of stroke or TIA from 50 hospitals that participated for more than 1 year. Rates of optimal treatment during the first 3 months of participation were as follows: 92. 5 % for antithrombotic medication within 48 h, 84. 6 % for antithrombotic medications at discharge, and 77. 1 % for DVT prophylaxis.

40|$|Background: Studies {{in human}} and animal models {{indicate}} that recovery from stroke is enhanced by exposure to enriched environments and practice. People with aphasia (PWA) after stroke need to practice language in everyday situations for optimum recovery of communication function. Objective: To establish whether opportunities to provide cost-neutral enriched environments for functional communication practice can be realised during routine stroke rehabilitation. Methods: Video was used to record routine interactions between healthcare professionals (HCPs) and people with aphasia in in-patient and Early Supported <b>Discharge</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. We conducted semi-structured interviews with staff and patients. Datasets produced: 54 video-recordings of therapy and nursing interactions in diverse rehabilitation activities; interviews with 19 HCPs; and 9 PWA. Video and interview data were analysed using Activity-based Communication Analysis and inductive thematic analysis respectively. Costs were derived from staff reports of changes to usual time taken for activities when communicating with PWA. Results: Opportunities to provide communicatively enriched environments arose in both settings between PWA and staff from all professional groups. When realised these occasions increased experiential demands cognitively and socially on PWA and provided them with functional communication practice. However, opportunities were not consistently realised. Interviews suggested that time constraints, a lack of HCP training and low confidence in working with PWA {{may have contributed to}} these effects. There were small increases in staff time demands resulting from these interactions.

Method: The study {{took place in the}} rehabilitation unit of a general medical hospital in Hong Kong. It was a longitudinal study involving 43 elderly survivors of mild to moderate stroke about to be discharged from hospital after rehabilitation and a comparison group of 43 community-dwelling elderly people. Verified clinical examination techniques and measures were used to assess dental caries, periodontal disease, oral hygiene, oral candidiasis, prosthetic status/need and functional disability (Barthel Index [BI]). Socio-demographic information was also collected. Results: Stroke survivors had significantly higher plaque and bleeding scores on hospital discharge and after six months compared with the control group (p< 0. 01). On hospital discharge, the stroke group also had a poorer periodontal condition with more 4 - 5 mm pockets. The mean BI on hospital admission was 71 and 91 on <b>discharge.</b> <b>Stroke</b> survivors with a higher BI on discharge had lower plaque scores after six months. The tooth condition, number of functional tooth pairs, prosthetic status, presence of oral candidiasis and oral yeast carriage were similar between stroke and comparison groups. Conclusions: Despite significant objective improvement in functional ability after stroke, elderly survivors returning to the community had significantly poorer periodontal health compared with community dwelling elderly without stroke, and the situation did not improve dramatically over six months.

40|$|Objective: Even though statin {{pretreatment}} {{is associated}} with better functional outcomes and lower risk of mortality in acute ischemic stroke, there are limited data evaluating this association in acute ischemic stroke due to large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), which carries the highest risk of early stroke recurrence. Methods: Consecutive patients with acute LAA were prospectively evaluated from 7 tertiary-care stroke centers during a 3 -year period. Statin pretreatment, demographics, vascular risk factors, and admission and <b>discharge</b> <b>stroke</b> severity were recorded. The outcome events of interest were neurologic improvement during hospitalization (quantified as the relative decrease in NIH Stroke Scale score at discharge in comparison to hospital admission), favorable functional outcome (FFO) (defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0 - 1), recurrent stroke, and death at 1 month. Statistical analyses were performed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models adjusting for potential confounders. All analyses were repeated following propensity score matching. Results: Statin pretreatment was documented in 192 (37. 2 %) of 516 consecutive patients with LAA (mean age: 65 ± 13 years; 60. 8 % men; median NIH Stroke Scale score: 9 points, interquartile range: 5 - 18). Statin pretreatment was associated with greater neurologic improvement during hospitalization and higher rates of 30 -day FFO in unmatched and matched (odds ratio for FFO: 2. 44; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 07 - 5. 53) analyses. It was also related to lower risk of 1 -month mortality and stroke recurrence in unmatched and matched analyses (hazard ratio for recurrent stroke: 0. 11, 95 % CI: 0. 02 - 0. 46; hazard ratio for death: 0. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 08 - 0. 75).

40|$|Stroke {{tends to}} result in a range of disabilities which have been shown to benefit from rehabilitation, in {{particular}} physiotherapy. Patients tend to have high expectations of the extent of recovery they can achieve through physiotherapy, and subsequently view discharge from physiotherapy before they have achieved that degree of recovery as disappointing and distressing. Current literature suggest that explicit discussion between physiotherapists and patients of the anticipated extent of recovery tends to be avoided during the programme of physiotherapy treatment, making discharge from physiotherapy the point at which potentially differing expectations might be expected to be confronted. This paper explores how the process of discharge is managed and experienced by patients and physiotherapists. It draws on Craib's (1994) ideas about how disappointment is managed in modern society. A qualitative longitudinal study was conducted with 16 stroke patients and their physiotherapists. These data comprise interview and observational material. The study found that the discharge of stroke patients from physiotherapy is not a point when patients' expectations and optimism about recovery are confronted. The notion of natural recovery that was raised with patients by physiotherapists at discharge and the information physiotherapists gave about exercise post-discharge had the effect of maintaining patients' high expectations and hopes about recovery. This has implications for the process of adaptation and adjustment that the patient eventually goes through in order to accommodate their altered abilities and identity. We argue that a number of factors contribute to the denial of disappointment within this interaction and that services need to be developed in ways that enable physiotherapists to engage with the possibility of disappointment about stroke outcome with patients, thereby making a positive contribution to the process of adaptation and adjustment that stroke survivors experience following <b>discharge.</b> <b>Stroke</b> Rehabilitation Physiotherapy UK...|$|E

Retrospective medical record review identified characteristics of readmission and index stroke admission. The most common readmission diagnoses were ischemic stroke, urinary tract infection, acute respiratory failure, and pneumonia. The characteristics of age 70 - 79; Caucasian; female; risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia; and frequency of complications during the index stroke contributed to a readmission in 30 days. Further evaluation of these characteristics is needed by applying the newly developed risk assessment tool to stroke patients to support the current findings.

Consequently, the neurologists try to <b>discharge</b> their <b>stroke</b> patients as soon as possible.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} access to a cardiac catheterisation laboratory and clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with suspected acute coronary syndrome. DESIGN: Prospective, multinational, observational registry. SETTING: Patients enrolled in 106 hospitals in 14 countries between April 1999 and March 2003. PARTICIPANTS: 28, 825 patients aged > or = 18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of percutaneous coronary intervention or {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery, death, infarction after <b>discharge,</b> <b>stroke,</b> or major bleeding. RESULTS: Most patients (77 %) across all regions (United States, Europe, Argentina and Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) were admitted to hospitals with catheterisation facilities. As expected, the availability of a catheterisation laboratory was associated with more frequent use of percutaneous coronary intervention (41 % v 3. 9 %, P < 0. 001) and coronary artery bypass graft (7. 1 % v 0. 7 %, P < 0. 001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, medical history, and geographical region {{there were no significant differences}} in the risk of early death between patients in hospitals with or without catheterisation facilities (odds ratio 1. 13, 95 % confidence interval 0. 98 to 1. 30, for death in hospital; hazard ratio 1. 05, 0. 93 to 1. 18, for death at 30 days).

On 21 and 25 December 1978, VENERA 11, 12 detected a large number of electromagnetic pulses, from measurements by the Groza instrument during descent and {{on the surface of the}} planet. A few days later the same phenomena were detected by the OEFD instrument of the late Professor F. Scarf, on board the PIONEER-VENUS orbiter, which registered electromagnetic pulses. The periodicity of groups of pulses detected by Groza pointed to a distant source of the electromagnetic noise. The OEFD instrument registered pulses in low frequency whistler mode. No light flashes were found. Discharges inside Earth' clouds are well visible from outside. However a search for light flashes on the night side of Venus resulted in nothing. The hypothesis of possible volcanism as an origin of the lightning was proposed. A sudden enrichment of the atmosphere of the planet by SO 2 was observed by the PV instruments and was tentatively connected with volcanic activity and electromagnetic noises. Later electromagnetic pulses coming from the atmosphere of Venus were observed by instruments of the GALILEO mission (Borucki et al., 1996). The lightning of Venus is unusual. We consider its possible similarity with high altitude discharges. Taiwanese researchers discovered recently huge lightning discharges, which rise as clusters from storm clouds to the upper layers of the atmosphere (up to 100 km). In contrast to normal lightning, these sparkling streams are propagated in rarefied air, occurring in huge clusters, having a height up to 80 km. Their duration was less than one second. It is very difficult to record these discharges. The researchers have also found that four of these streams radiated radiowaves of extremely low frequency...|$|E

METHODS In a randomized trial conducted in New South Wales, Australia, a postcard was sent monthly to participants (n[*]=[*] 100) for five-months following hospital <b>discharge</b> after <b>stroke</b> (plus usual care) and compared with usual care (n[*]=[*] 101). Ethical approval was obtained to withhold information about the intervention and primary outcome from participants during the consent process.

5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two check valves, often ball check valves, attached to the pump head, one at the inlet line and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet check valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>strokes</b> are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|R
40|$|Background: Care after <b>discharge</b> from {{inpatient}} <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation units varies across Europe. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare service delivery after discharge. Methods: A total of 532 consecutive patients after stroke were recruited from 4 European rehabilitation centres in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the UK. At 2 -month intervals, clinical assessments and structured interviews were carried out to document functional status and delivery of services after discharge. Significant factors for receiving follow-up services were analysed using a logistic generalized estimating equation model. Results: After controlling for case-mix, the results showed that Belgian patients were most likely to receive physical therapy but least likely to receive occupational therapy. German patients were least likely to receive nursing care. UK patients were less likely to receive medical care from their general practitioner compared with the other patient groups. Conclusion: Clinical characteristics did not explain the variations in service delivery after <b>discharge</b> {{from inpatient}} <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. The decision-making processes involved in the provision of follow-up services need to be better documented. To improve our understanding of events post-discharge, the influence of non-clinical factors, such as healthcare regulations, should be explored further...|$|R
40|$|PurposeStroke is {{a serious}} {{complication}} after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is closely associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the frequency, the characteristics and factors associated with in-hospital and postdischarge stroke in patients with AMI. Methods 8485 consecutive patients admitted {{in intensive care unit}} (ICU) between January 2001 and June 2010 were included. Among other major adverse cardiac events (MACE), both stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) were collected during one-year follow-up. Results 168 (1. 98 %) strokes were recorded {{during the first year of}} follow-up after AMI. In-hospital strokes (IHS) occurred in 123 patients (1. 4 %), and 87 % of them in the first five days after admission in ICU. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, IHS was independently associated with female sex (OR: 1. 73, 95 % CI: 1. 19 - 2. 51, p= 0. 004), previous stroke/TIA (OR: 2. 21, 95 % CI: 1. 28 - 3. 83, p= 0. 004), LVEF (OR: 0. 96, 95 % CI: 0. 95 - 0. 98, p< 0. 001), new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR: 1. 99, 95 % CI: 1. 25 - 3. 16, p= 0. 004) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1. 006, 95 % CI: 1, 003 - 1, 009, p< 0. 001). Patients developing an in-hospital stroke had an increased risk of death at one year after adjustment to other prognostic factors (OR: 1. 82, 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 3. 15, p= 0. 031). Among surviving patients (n= 7808), postdischarge stroke (PDS) occurred in 45 patients (0. 64 %) within one-year follow-up after AMI. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, PDS was independently associated with age (OR: 1. 04, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 07, p= 0. 003), previous stroke/TIA (OR: 3. 69, 95 % CI: 1. 83 - 7. 43, p< 0. 001) and systemic hypertension (OR: 2. 77, 95 % CI: 1. 26 - 6. 08, p= 0. 011). During the entire study period of ten years, the annual rate of stroke post-AMI remained stable. ConclusionsThe present study describes specific predictors of in-hospital and postdischarge stroke in patients with AMI, with a marked increase in the risk of death, both during hospitalization and the year after AMI. After hospital <b>discharge,</b> <b>stroke</b> remains a rare event and mostly associated with a high cardiovascular risk...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MMed.) -University of Natal, Durban, 1986. The {{outcome of}} acute stroke in 210 White adult {{patients}} admitted to Addington Hospital, Durban in 1983 and 1984 was investigated {{by means of}} retrospective case-note review. In addition, the level of functional independence of 35 people who, {{at the time of}} this study, were survivors of an initial acute stroke was assessed through household survey. The study was considered relevant and worthwhile for several reasons: 1. Stroke is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in Whites in South Africa, however, l i t t l e information is available in respect of the outcome of sufferers of stroke who were admitted to the study hospital. 2. Knowledge of the needs of survivors of acute stroke is necessary if appropriate health care is to be provided. 3. Few community studies have been done in South Africa in which the status of stroke survivors has been established. The principle aims of the study were therefore: 1. To establish the survival of patients with acute stroke who were admitted to the study hospital. 2. To determine in survivors of an initial stroke their residual functional loss and hence to identify the supportive health care needs of this group. The most important findings of the study were as follows: 1. Of the 286 stroke admissions identified through the hospital's medical record retrieval system, stroke diagnosis according to the study definition could be confirmed in only 210 (73. 4 %) cases due to misplaced files or miscoded diagnoses. The need for improvement in the method of recording, storing and retrieving of patient information is indicated by these findings. The overall hospital fatality rate for stroke was 54 %. Mortality was highest in the first week after admission (71 %). The number of males and females, in respect of whom a final diagnosis of stroke was attributed, was almost equal. A significant difference (p <. 000 2) in respect of age was noted between the sexes. The mean age of onset of stroke was 62. 9 and 70. 0 years for males and females respectively. The major diagnostic categories (haemorrhagic or occlusive) of stroke could only be ascertained in respect of 30 % of cases. This was due to incomplete recording of clinical findings, and possibly, due to the absence of resident brain-scanning facilities at the time. Analysis of the results of the household interviews indicated that:-(I) Of the 35 patients interviewed 13 (37 %) were found to be fully independent in self-care and were mobile outside of the home. (ii) The patients' potential for improvement in an appreciable number of cases had been under-estimated by the hospital staff. Patient adjustment following hospital discharge appeared adversely affected by. -(i) Inadequate preparation for discharge, especially where patients were returning to their own homes. (ii) Inadequate explanation given to patients and their families of the meaning and implications of stroke. (iii) The non-involvement of the family during the period of hospitalization. (iv) The absence of appropriate follow-up after <b>discharge.</b> <b>Stroke</b> onset was a traumatic experience in all cases. Amongst the most important reasons given for reduced life-satisfaction post stroke were confinement to the home, reduced independence and unresolved loss (eg death of spouse, forced retirement). 8. In some cases it was f e l t that social isolation, general ill-health and old age were more significant problems in the lives of patients than the stroke itself. The advent of stroke merely exaggerated these problems. 9. The advantage of administering a standardized functional assessment at intervals during the rehabilitation of the patients became increasingly clear as the study progressed. It is proposed that functional assessment be considered as important as clinical assessment in the management of stroke patients. 10. Recommendations have been submitted concerning rehabilitation and the provision of supportive services for stroke patients. As the role of the nurse in short and long-term care is central to successful stroke outcome, emphasis has been placed on her role in the team. The main conclusions formulated in the study were:- 1. Mortality from stroke is high but in survivors an appreciable proportion maintained functional independence. 2. Preparation of patients and their families is important to adjustment following discharge from hospital. 3. Supportive services are important to the maintenance of the stroke patient in the home environment. 4. A team approach, consisting of a wide range of health professionals is appropriate to the management of stroke. 5. Functional assessment is an important component of the clinical examination and should be done prior to discharge and subsequently at regular intervals to assess the patient's competence to exist in the current domestic environment...|$|E
40|$|Background. Troponin {{increment}} is {{a highly}} sensitive and specific marker of myocardial necrosis. The reason of high troponin levels in acute stroke is not clear. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the relationships between cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) level and stroke. Methods. This study recruited 868 patients who were admitted to Istanbul Medeniyet University due to acute ischemic stroke, and the diagnosis was confirmed by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The patients with the causes increasing troponin level were excluded from the study. A total of 239 patients were finally included in the study. Clinics were evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Results. Serum level of troponin was higher in ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation involvement in comparison to posterior involvement or hemorrhagic stroke (). Higher troponin levels related to increased stroke scale scores at <b>discharge</b> in ischemic <b>stroke</b> (). The level of cTnI was correlated with stroke scale scores at both admission and <b>discharge</b> in posterior <b>stroke</b> patients (). Conclusion. cTnI {{is a highly}} specific and sensitive marker of myocardial damage, and its elevation was associated with more severe neurological deficits in acute ischemic stroke...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} audit was {{to determine}} whether sitting balance ability at initial physiotherapy assessment post stroke could predict ambulation ability at discharge. Also considered were the side affected by the stroke, sensory loss, dysphasia, whether they affected outcome and whether ambulation ability determined social destination at <b>discharge.</b> Forty <b>stroke</b> patients were treated during the 12 -month study period. All patients received early physiotherapy treatment in the acute then rehabilitation wards. The average length of hospital stay was 47. 7 ± 28. 2 [SD] days. All patients achieved independent sitting balance at discharge, with a significant improvement (p < 0. 001) from initial assessment. Twenty-seven achieved independent ambulation by discharge. This was shown to have a significant (p < 0. 001) relationship to early independent sitting balance but was not significantly related to side of stroke or sensory loss...|$|R
