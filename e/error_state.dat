40|$|Embedded Navigation Filter Automatic Designer (ENFAD) is a {{computer}} program being developed to automate the most difficult tasks in designing embedded software to implement a Kalman filter in a navigation system. The most difficult tasks are selection of <b>error</b> <b>states</b> of the filter and tuning of filter parameters, which are timeconsuming trial-and-error tasks that require expertise and rarely yield optimum results. An optimum selection of <b>error</b> <b>states</b> and filter parameters depends on navigation-sensor and vehicle characteristics, and on filter processing time. ENFAD would include a simulation module that would incorporate all possible <b>error</b> <b>states</b> {{with respect to a}} given set of vehicle and sensor characteristics. The first of two iterative optimization loops would vary the selection of <b>error</b> <b>states</b> until the best filter performance was achieved in Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|Abstract. Directed model {{checking}} is {{a well-established}} technique {{to tackle the}} state explosion problem when {{the aim is to}} find <b>error</b> <b>states</b> in large systems. In this approach, the state space traversal is guided through a function that estimates the distance to nearest <b>error</b> <b>states.</b> States with lower estimates are preferably expanded during the search. Obviously, the challenge is to develop distance functions that are efficiently computable {{on the one hand and}} as informative as possible on the other hand. In this paper, we introduce the causal graph structure to the context of directed model checking. Based on causal graph analysis, we first adapt a distance estimation function from AI planning to directed model checking. Furthermore, we investigate an abstraction that is guaranteed to preserve <b>error</b> <b>states.</b> The experimental evaluation shows the practical potential of these techniques. ...|$|R

5000|$|This formula {{says that}} any {{call to the}} next (...) method must be {{immediately}} preceded by a call to hasNext (...) method that returns true. The property here is parametric in the Iterator i. Conceptually, this means {{that there will be}} one copy of the monitor for each possible Iterator in a test program, although runtime verification systems need not implement their parametric monitors this way. The monitor for this property would be set to trigger a handler when the formula is violated (equivalently when the finite state machine enters the <b>error</b> <b>state),</b> which will occur when either next (...) is called without first calling hasNext (...) , or when hasNext (...) is called before next (...) , but returned false.|$|E
5000|$|The Java Iterator {{interface}} {{requires that}} the hasNext (...) method be called and return true before the next (...) method is called. If thisdoes not occur, it is very possible that a user will iterate [...] "off the end of" [...] a Collection. The figure to the right shows a finite state machine that defines a possible monitor for checking and enforcing this property with runtime verification. From the unknown state, it is always an error to call the next (...) method because such an operation could be unsafe. If hasNext (...) is called and returns true, {{it is safe to}} call next (...) , so the monitor enters the more state. If, however, the hasNext (...) method returns false, there are no more elements, and the monitor enters the none state. In the more and none states, calling the hasNext (...) method provides no new information. It is safe to call the next (...) method from the more state, but it becomes unknown if more elements exist, so the monitor reenters the initial unknown state. Finally, calling the next (...) method from the none state results in entering the <b>error</b> <b>state.</b> What follows is a representation of this property using parametric past time linear temporal logic.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Kalman filter using a seven-component attitude state vector comprising the angular momentum components in an inertial reference frame, the angular momentum {{components in the}} body frame, and a rotation angle.

40|$|ABSTRACT: New {{users of}} high-function {{application}} systems can become frustrated and {{confused by the}} errors they make {{in the early stages}} of learning. A training interface for a commercial word processor was designed to make typical and troublesome <b>error</b> <b>states</b> "unreachable," thus eliminating the sources of some new-user learning problems. Creating a training environment from the basic function of the system itself afforded substantially faster learning coupled with better learning achievement and better performance on a comprehension post-test. A control group spent almost a quarter of their time recovering from the <b>error</b> <b>states</b> that the training interface blocked off. We speculate on how this training strategy might be refined, 1. and more generally, on how function should be organized in a user interface. Empirical characterizations of computer novices learning to use application systems paint a dreary picture of side tracks and error tangles from which recovery, or even diagnosis, is difficult (e. g., [6]). In this paper, we show that a "training wheels " interface [...] designed to block typical side tracks and <b>error</b> <b>states</b> [...] can facilitate the learning process for new users.

40|$|Finding {{quantitative}} {{aspects of}} quantum phenomena which cannot {{be explained by}} any classical model has foundational importance for understanding the boundary between classical and quantum theory. It also has practical significance for identifying information processing tasks for which those phenomena provide a quantum advantage. Using the framework of generalized noncontextuality as our notion of classicality, we find one such nonclassical feature within the phenomenology of quantum minimum <b>error</b> <b>state</b> discrimination. Namely, we identify quantitative limits on the success probability for minimum <b>error</b> <b>state</b> discrimination in any experiment described by a noncontextual ontological model. These constraints constitute noncontextuality inequalities that are violated by quantum theory, and this violation implies a quantum advantage for state discrimination relative to noncontextual models. Furthermore, our noncontextuality inequalities are robust to noise and are operationally formulated, so that any experimental violation of the inequalities is a witness of contextuality, independently {{of the validity of}} quantum theory. Along the way, we introduce new methods for analyzing noncontextuality scenarios, and demonstrate a tight connection between our minimum <b>error</b> <b>state</b> discrimination scenario and a Bell scenario.

3000|$|A Kalman filter {{can only}} {{contribute}} to a limited extend to the total accuracy of the pose estimates. The estimate can only be made more accurate when the filter model is accurate enough; that is, that the acceleration/angular speed is predictable, and that the inertia sensors are accurate enough. A bias in the sensors—for instance caused by a systematic estimation error or an unknown delay {{in the time of}} measurement—will prevent the filter from giving a more accurate result than the camera alone. We minimized the errors introduced by the Kalman filter by using robust methods to represent the orientation and time update of the orientation, and decreased the nonlinearity be using a nonadditive <b>error</b> <b>state</b> Kalman filter in which the <b>error</b> <b>state</b> is combined with the real state using a nonlinear function (see the transfer of the orientation error in Figure 8). We used Quaternions [45] for a stable differentiable representation. To make the orientation model more linear, we used an indirect Kalman filter setup where the error states are estimated instead of the actual state. Due to this choice the error-state update is independent of the real state. Effectively we created an extended kalman Filter for the <b>error</b> <b>state.</b> If the <b>error</b> <b>state</b> is kept at zero rotation by transferring the error-state estimate to the real state estimate immediately after each measurement update, the linearization process for the Extended Kalman Filter [46] becomes very simple and accurate.

The controller yields desired limb trajectory tracking while simulta-neously minimizing a cost functional that is positive in the <b>error</b> <b>states</b> and stimulation input. The development of this framework allows tradeoffs to be made between tracking performance and control effort by putting different penalties on <b>error</b> <b>states</b> and control input, depending on the clinical goal or functional task.
