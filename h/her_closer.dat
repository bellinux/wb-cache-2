5|$|Leipzig had her {{anti-aircraft}} armament modernized {{to bring}} <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> {{to the standard}} of weaponry fitted to her sister. After 1934, two additional 8.8cm guns were added, with another pair later. Starting in 1941, eight 3.7cm guns were installed, along with fourteen 2cm guns. After 1944, she only carried eight of the 2cm guns. NÃ¼rnbergs anti-aircraft battery was improved {{over the course of}} World War II. In late 1942, a pair of Army-variant 2cm Flakvierling quadruple mounts were installed, one on the navigating bridge and the other on top of the aft superfiring turret. In May 1944, the navy proposed installing several Bofors 40 mm guns, but most of these weapons were diverted to other uses, and only two guns were installed. One was mounted on the bridge and the other where the catapult had been located. Two Navy-pattern Flakvierlings were added; one replaced the Army model atop the aft superfiring turret, and the other was placed in front of the anti-aircraft fire director. The Army-pattern Flakvierlings were moved to the main deck. In December 1944, another revised anti-aircraft plan was proposed, this time incorporating the new 3.7 cm FlaK 43 gun, of which there were to be eight, along with two Flakvierlings and ten 2cm twin mounts. Germany's wartime situation by the end of 1944 prevented these changes from being made, however.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, many male transit police {{officers}} still viewed women as undesirable partners. Nevertheless, Lozada's work was noticed by her superiors {{and she was}} promoted to the Transit Police District #33 and assigned to the Plain-Clothes Anti-Crime Unit, a street crime unit. This brought <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> to her goal of becoming a detective.|$|E

25|$|In-ha {{suffers from}} the Pinocchio Syndrome, where she cannot lie without {{breaking}} into hiccups. Instead of choosing {{to withdraw from the}} world, she believes in telling it like it is. In-ha chooses to become a reporter because she believes that it might bring <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> to her mother Song Cha-ok, whom she has always idolized. Stubborn and strong-willed, In-ha believes that all news reported must be completely truthful, and goes all out in order to do so. Together with Dal-po, she unravels the truth behind a greater conspiracy, standing up to her mother in the process. Though In-ha initially treats Dal-po as family, her growing feelings towards him grow undeniable with her hiccups.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate {{authorities}} had long {{believed that the}} Navy's ironclad ships, particularly CSS Louisiana, would render the river impregnable against assaults such as they were now experiencing. Although Louisiana was not yet finished, Generals Lovell and Duncan pressed Commodore Whittle to hurry the preparation. Acceding to their wishes against his better judgment, Whittle had the ship launched prematurely and added to Commander Mitchell's fleet even while workmen were still fitting her out. On {{the second day of}} the bombardment, she was towed (too late, her owners found that her engines were not strong enough to enable her to buck the current) to a position on the left bank, upstream from Fort St. Philip, where she became in effect a floating battery. Mitchell would not move <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> because her armor would not protect her from the plunging shot of Porter's mortars. However, because her guns could not be elevated, they could not be brought to bear on the enemy so long as they remained below the forts.|$|E
25|$|She {{was lost}} off Mangalore on 26 November 1780. The British were {{at war with}} Hyder Ali, Sultan of Mysore, and Vernon wanted to destroy Hyder Ali's small navy. When the {{squadron}} arrived off Callicut Road on 24 November a distant, ineffective engagement ensued. Although the British captured one of Hyder Ali's vessels, the remainder were anchored close to shore. Vernon ordered Simonton to lighten Sartine and move <b>her</b> <b>closer.</b> Simonton, noting that Sartine was already in only three fathoms, was not enthused, but followed orders and by the afternoon she was anchored in shallow water. However, it then became apparent that she was aground. By {{the afternoon of the}} next day she was gotten off after her crew threw some of her guns overboard. When she anchored in deeper water it was found that she was taking on water. Efforts were made on the 26th to stop the leaks, but they were futile. She flooded and was irrecoverable. Some of her sails, masts, and stores were rescued. The subsequent court martial absolved Simonton of all blame.|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{turns up}} {{throughout}} the High and Late Middle Ages {{in a variety}} of roles, generally in works related to the cycles of Arthur or Charlemagne. They often feature Morgan as a lover and benefactor of various heroes, sometimes also introducing her additional offspring or alternate siblings, or connecting <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> with the figure of the Lady of the Lake. The Middle English romance Arthour and Merlin, written in 1270, casts Morgan herself {{in the role of the}} Lady of the Lake and gives her a brother named Morganor as an illegitimate son of King Urien. The Italian manuscript Tavola ritonda (The Round Table) makes Morgan a daughter of Uther Pendragon and a sister of the Lady of the Lake. The 14th-century Italian romance Pulzella Gaia (Merry Maiden) features the titular and otherwise unnamed beautiful young daughter of Morgan by Hemison. She is kidnapped by the knight Burletta of the Desert (Burletta della Diserta) and rescued by Lancelot, and later defeats Gawain (Galvan) in her giant serpent form before becoming his lover; she and her fairy army save Gawain from the jealous Guinevere (who wants Gawain dead after having been rejected by him) but she gets herself captured in her mother's castle Palaus (as Morgan wants to marry her to Tristan), until Gawain in turn frees her from a cursed dungeon.|$|E
500|$|Because of <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> {{proximity}} to Wright's column, Takanami {{was the target}} of most of the Americans' initial gunfire. [...] Takanami returned fire and launched her full load of eight torpedoes, but was quickly hit by American gunfire and, within four minutes, was set afire and incapacitated. [...] As Takanami was destroyed, the rest of Tanaka's ships, almost unnoticed by the Americans, were increasing speed, maneuvering, and preparing to respond to the American attack. [...] All of the American torpedoes missed. Historian Russell S. Crenshaw, Jr. postulates that had the twenty-four Mark 15 torpedoes fired by U.S. Navy destroyers during the battle not been fatally flawed, the outcome of the battle might have been different.|$|E
500|$|Francis tried {{a variety}} of methods to raise money, but {{concentrated}} on a lawsuit against Charles III, Duke of Bourbon. [...] The Duke of Bourbon had received the majority of his holdings through his marriage to Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, who had died shortly {{before the start of the}} war. Louise of Savoy, Suzanne's sister and the king's mother, insisted that the territories in question should pass to her because of <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> kinship to the deceased. [...] Francis was confident that seizing the disputed lands would improve his own financial position sufficiently to continue the war and began to confiscate portions of them in Louise's name. Bourbon, angered by this treatment and increasingly isolated at court, began to make overtures to Charles V to betray the French king.|$|E

The wreck was abandoned on 4 November 1816. The subsequent court martial blamed the wrecking on a strong current that had driven <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> to shore than Bremer had realized. However, the court also warned Bremer and the master, Bateman Ainsworth, {{to be more careful}} in the future, finding that they had been overconfident in their navigation and had failed to take frequent depth soundings.

2500|$|The {{case was}} heard before District Court Judge Vincent L. Broderick in late September of 1979. At the evidentiary hearing, the Rowleys {{presented}} evidence that showed Amy, despite her academic success so far, {{was not able}} to fully achieve in the classroom with the resources available. They provided test results showing that Amy understood only about 60 percent of discussion in the classroom, while an interpreter would put <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> to 100%. They further provided results from two academic achievement tests Amy took in first grade, one administered in English and the other in American Sign Language. She had average performance on the test administered in English, but performed [...] "well above average" [...] on the test administered in American Sign Language. Based upon this evidence, Judge Broderick determined that even with the existing accommodations, Amy was not achieving her full potential.|$|E

She does not take her Ghost-hunting duties as seriously as her sister Stocking, instead preferring to fulfill her personal goal {{of having sex with}} 1,000 men on Earth before returning to Heaven. She is generally rude and aggressive to the people around her (including Garterbelt, Brief, Stocking, the men she sleeps with, and most prominently Chuck), and is fond of living the celebrity lifestyle of being an Anarchy sister because it brings <b>her</b> <b>closer</b> to the men and fame she craves.
