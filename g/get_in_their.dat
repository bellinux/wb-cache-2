5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Homer remains {{oblivious to}} Ned's animosity. He {{arrives at the}} Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but Ned and his family <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> car and race off without him. Pulled over by Chief Wiggum for speeding, Ned takes a sobriety test as disapproving townspeople watch. At church, when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer, Homer inhales very loudly through his nose, causing Ned to yell at Homer. This alarms the congregation, who become even more upset with Ned. But Homer sticks up for Ned and convinces the congregation to give him another chance. The next week, everything returns to normal, as Homer once again is annoyed by Ned.|$|E
25|$|Surat al-Falaq {{mentions}} the harms people would <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> worldly matters, whereas Surat an-Nās {{mentions the}} harms people would <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> religious matter. So asking God's protection {{is a lot}} more emphasised in this an-Nās – with a lot more of God's names, in comparison to Surat al-Falaq when Rabb is mentioned only once. This shows that concerning religious matters is more important than worldly matters for mankind.|$|E

25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he {{knew where they were}} going to put their penalty in order to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} not well {{received}} in the UK, where it sold very little and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single [...] "Hush", an energetic rock track originally written by Joe South, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> early US tours and also during the 1970s. Modern reviews of the album are generally positive and consider Shades of Deep Purple an important piece {{in the history of}} Deep Purple.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} {{prominent}} aspects of Nikita's character development {{since the beginning of}} the series is her relationship with Michael, and has been dubbed by fans as [...] "Mikita". Unlike other works on film and television, Silverstein did not play the traditional [...] "Will They/Won't They?" [...] game between the two characters. Co-star Shane West stated [...] "It's not hard to bring Michael and Nikita together," [...] but it is [...] "really hard to keep them apart...We're barely into the season yet, so why not keep teasing?" [...] When the first season started airing, West also expected that their romance would come, citing Michael and Nikita's past relationship while she was working with Division. Now that the two are together by the end of the first season, in the second season Silverstein wanted something to happen to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> way, saying that no new tension would make the relationship boring, adding [...] "I don't think you can just have them happy and in love, kicking ass together forever." ...|$|E

500|$|The glowing {{audience}} {{response to}} a rough cut of the film at two test screenings in Dallas on March 26, 1975, and one in Long Beach, on March 28, along {{with the success of}} Benchley's novel and the early stages of Universal's marketing campaign, generated great interest among theater owners, facilitating the studio's plan to debut Jaws at hundreds of cinemas simultaneously. A third and final preview screening, of a cut incorporating changes inspired by the previous presentations, was held in Hollywood on April 24. After Universal chairman Lew Wasserman attended one of the screenings, he ordered the film's initial release—planned for a massive total of as many as 900 theaters—to be cut down, declaring, [...] "I want this picture to run all summer long. I don't want people in Palm Springs to see the picture in Palm Springs. I want them to have to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> cars and drive to see it in Hollywood." [...] Nonetheless, the several hundred theaters that were still booked for the opening represented what was then an unusually wide release. At the time, wide openings were associated with movies of doubtful quality; not uncommon on the exploitation side of the industry, they were customarily employed to diminish the effect of negative reviews and word of mouth. There had been some recent exceptions, including the rerelease of Billy Jack and the original release of its sequel The Trial of Billy Jack, the Dirty Harry sequel Magnum Force, and the latest installments in the James Bond series. Still, the typical major studio film release at the time involved opening at a few big-city theaters, which allowed for a series of premieres. Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country, capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response. The outsized success of The Godfather in 1972 had sparked a trend toward wider releases, but even that film had debuted in just five theaters, before going wide in its second weekend.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{tells the}} story of Kurt Hectic, a janitor who reluctantly must attempt to save Earth from an alien {{invasion}} of gigantic strip mining city-sized vehicles named [...] "Minecrawlers". These Minecrawlers are removing all of earth's natural resources, and crushing any people and cities that <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> way. Aided by his boss, the possibly insane inventor and scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and a robotic two-legged/four-armed dog named Bones, Kurt must infiltrate each Minecrawler, and fight his way to the pilot, whom he must then kill before returning to Hawkins' in-orbit space station, the Jim Dandy.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{designated}} start time, a pre-race invocation is given, {{followed by the}} singing of the national anthem. Once the anthem is complete, drivers have exactly five minutes to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> cars with all the safety equipment fastened and ready to go. At the end of those five minutes, the grand marshal for the race will deliver the command [...] "Drivers, start your engines!", at which point each car must start its engine. With the engines running, the cars sit on pit road for approximately three minutes before heading on the track for some warm-up laps before the pace car. The average number of pace laps is three, but there can {{be more or less}} depending {{on a wide variety of}} circumstances and conditions, including but not limited to track length, track drying efforts after rain, or if a car has a problem and stops on the track during those pace laps. At the end of the pace laps, the field will partake in a rolling start.|$|E

2500|$|Marine {{pollution}} is both directly harmful to sea turtles {{as well as}} indirectly, through the deterioration of their natural habitats. [...] Some {{of the most dangerous}} ocean pollutants include toxic metals, PCBs, fertilizers, untreated waste, chemicals, and a variety of petroleum products. Oil spills are particularly dangerous to sea turtles. [...] Although oil does not tend to stick to them as it does to other marine life, sea turtles are still at risk when they surface for air, where oil can <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> eyes, skin, and lungs which can lead to significant health problems. [...] Even if they are not directly in contact with marine pollution, sea turtles can still ingest harmful chemicals through the food they eat. [...] Oil is also a cause for the death of seagrass, which is a large staple in the diet of the green turtle. [...] The diets of the hawksbill sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, and Kemp's ridley sea turtle species have also been affected by the oil’s role in the reduction of certain sponges and invertebrates. [...] Extended exposure has been found to deteriorate the health of a sea turtle in general, making it more weak and vulnerable to a variety of other threats.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two {{look at each other}} in growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result {{was one of the most}} suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script. MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: [...] "...When I... turned the key I remember I was doing it fast and Billy kept saying, 'Make it longer, make it longer,' and finally I yelled, 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not going to hold that long,' and he said, 'Make it longer,' and he was right." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{tradition}} was {{brought by the}} Spanish to Mexico after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire; [...] In Mexico this veneration has taken on indigenous elements, and {{is considered to be}} one of the most deeply rooted Catholic traditions in Mexico. [...] Part of the reason for this was that native Mexicans already had traditions of representing deities in painting or sculpture with rites dedicated to that incarnation, including dramatizations. One of the oldest traditions related to the Child Jesus in Mexico is the “pastorela,” a dramatization based on the birth of Jesus. The “Adoración de los Reyes Magos” (The Adoration of the Magi) was probably the first “pastorela” in Mexico which was organized by Friar Andrés de Olmos. It was written in Nahuatl and there were adaptations to indigenous culture in the script as well. The tradition of reenacting scenes from the birth of Christ was recognized by Juan de Zumárraga, the first bishop of New Spain who ordered that this practice be widespread for evangelization. Very early on, these reenactments began to vary by local custom and region and were most frequently done by the lower classes. The main theme of these works is the journey of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem, but demons try to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> way. In most versions, the demons are vanquished by the Archangel Michael or another angel and the Wise Men arrive to their destination. Characters most often include shepherds, demons, angels and the Wise Men. Other characters sometimes appear such as Mary and Joseph, Indians, ranchers and monks. At the end of the play, all kiss the image of the infant Jesus.|$|E
