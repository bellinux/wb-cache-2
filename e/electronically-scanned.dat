5|$|Discussions {{over the}} sale of the Su-35 proved {{protracted}} due to concerns over intellectual property rights. Since China had reverse engineered the Su-27SK and Su-33 to create the J-11B and J-15, respectively, there were concerns that China would copy the airframe and offer the copied design on the export market. At one stage Rosoboronexport demanded that China provided a legally-binding guarantee against copying. However, industry sources believed that Chinese industry was interested in the AL-41FS1 engine and Irbis-E radar. According to The Diplomat, China was specifically interested in the engine of the Su-35, as the country was already test flying the J-11D. While the aircraft reportedly has less range, payload and manoeuvrability than the Su-35, the J-11D has an active <b>electronically-scanned</b> array radar, instead of the less-advanced PESA radar as found on the Su-35. Various reports have drawn attention to the need for Chinese industry to close the technological gap between its engine industry and those of the US, Europe and Russia.|$|E

These modifications included a large increase in the number of calibration points which would allow a critical examination of the calibration curve-fit process, and a subsequent post-test reduction of the pressure data. Evaluation of these data has resulted in an improved functional representation of the pressure-voltage signature for <b>electronically-scanned</b> pressures sensors, which can reduce the errors due to calibration curve fit to under 0. 10 percent of reading compared to the manufacturer specified 0. 10 percent of full scale. Application of the improved calibration function allows a more rational selection of the calibration set-point pressures. These pressures should be adjusted to achieve a voltage output which matches the physical shape of the pressure-voltage signature of the sensor. This process is conducted in lieu of the more traditional approach where a calibration pressure is specified and the resulting sensor voltage is recorded. The fifteen calibrations acquired over the two-week duration of the wind tunnel test were further used to perform a preliminary, statistical assessment of the variation in the calibration process. The results allowed the estimation of the bias uncertainty for a single instrument calibration; and, they form the precursor for more extensive and more controlled studies in the laboratory...|$|E

40|$|Weather {{monitoring}} and forecasting systems have witnessed rapid advancement in recent years. However, {{one of the}} main challenges faced by these systems is poor coverage in lower atmospheric regions due to earth 2 ̆ 7 s curvature. The Engineering Research Center for the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) has developed a dense network of small low-power radars to improve the coverage of weather sensing systems. Traditional, mechanically-scanned antennas used in these radars are now being replaced with high-performance <b>electronically-scanned</b> phased-arrays. Phased-Array radars, however, require large number of active microwave components to scan electronically in both the azimuth and elevation planes, thus significantly increasing the cost of the entire radar system. To address this issue, CASA has designed a 2 ̆ 2 Phase-Tilt 2 ̆ 2 radar, that scans electronically in azimuth and mechanically in elevation. One of the core components of this system is the Phased-Array controller or the Array Formatter. The Array Formatter is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) -based master controller that translates user commands from a computer to control and timing signals for the radar system.

Optical flow measurement and flow visualization techniques were used that featured pressure sensitive paint (PSP), laser vapor screen (LVS), and schlieren, These techniques were combined with conventional <b>electronically-scanned</b> pressure (ESP) and six-component force and moment measurements to quantify and to visualize the effects of flow-through porosity applied to a wing leading edge extension (LEX) and the placement of centerline and twin vertical tails on the vortex-dominated flow field of a 65 cropped delta wing model. Test results were obtained at free-stream Mach numbers of 1. 6, 1. 8, and 2. 1 and a Reynolds number per foot of 2. 0 million. LEX porosity promoted a wing vortex-dominated flow field as a result of a diffusion and weakening of the LEX vortex. The redistribution of the vortex-induced suction pressures contributed to large nose-down pitching moment increments but did not significantly affect the vortex-induced lift. The trends associated with LEX porosity were unaffected by vertical tail placement. The centerline tail configuration generally provided more stable rolling moments and yawing moments compared to the twin wing-mounted vertical tails. The strength of a complex system of shock waves between the twin tails was reduced by LEX porosity...|$|E
40|$|The National Resource Councils Earth Science Decadal Survey (NRCDS) has {{identified}} the Aerosol/Climate/Ecosystems (ACE) Mission {{as a priority}} mission for NASA Earth science. The NRC recommended the inclusion of "a cross-track scanning cloud radar with channels at 94 GHz and possibly 34 GHz for measurement of cloud droplet size, glaciation height, and cloud height". Several radar concepts have been proposed that {{meet some of the}} requirements of the proposed ACE mission but none have provided scanning capability at both 34 and 94 GHz due to the challenge of constructing scanning antennas at 94 GHz. In this paper, we will describe a radar design that leverages new developments in microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMICs) and micro-machining to enable an <b>electronically-scanned</b> radar with both Ka-band (35 GHz) and W-band (94 -GHz) channels. This system uses a dual-frequency linear active electronically-steered array (AESA) combined with a parabolic cylindrical reflector. This configuration provides a large aperture (3 m x 5 m) with electronic-steering but is much simpler than a two-dimension AESA of similar size. Still, the W-band frequency requires element spacing of approximately 2. 5 mm, presenting significant challenges for signal routing and incorporation of MMICs. By combining (Gallium Nitride) GaN MMIC technology with micro-machined radiators and interconnects and silicon-germanium (SiGe) beamforming MMICs, we are able to meet all the performance and packaging requirements of the linear array feed and enable simultaneous scanning of Ka-band and W-band radars over swath of up to 100 km...|$|E

Global calibrations of the PSP were obtained at M = 0. 50, 0. 70, 0. 85, 0. 95, and 1. 20, a Reynolds number per unit length of 2. 0 million, and angles of attack from 10 degrees to 30 degrees using an in-situ method featuring the simultaneous acquisition of <b>electronically-scanned</b> pressures (ESP) at discrete locations on the model. The mean error in the PSP measurements relative to the ESP data was approximately 2 percent or less at M = 0. 50 to 0. 85 but increased to several percent at M = 0. 95 and 1. 20. The PSP pressure distributions and pseudo-colored planform view pressure maps clearly revealed the vortex-induced pressure signatures at all Mach numbers and angles of attack. Small fillets having a parabolic or diamond planform situated at the strake-wing intersection were designed to manipulate the vortical flows by, respectively, removing the leading-edge discontinuity or introducing additional discontinuities. The fillets caused global changes in the vortex-dominated surface pressure field that were effectively captured in the PSP measurements. The vortex surface pressure signatures were compared to available off-surface vortex cross-flow structures obtained using a laser vapor screen (LVS) flow visualization technique.

40|$|Packer and the Seven Network are {{fighting}} over his name, but was John Logie Baird really the Father of Television? Jock Given sets the record straight. Australia 2 ̆ 7 s two major magazine publishers {{are at war}} about the “Logies”. It’s a big enough fight for the NSW Supreme Court to have granted an expedited hearing in a case brought by PBL’s Australian Consolidated Press against the Seven Network 2 ̆ 7 s Pacific Publications. The court has also restrained both parties from using the name “Logie” and related trademarks until the case is determined. At stake is the ownership of trademarks relating to Australia’s major annual TV awards. These are almost as old as Australian television itself. They got their name when the first “TV Star of the Year”, Graham Kennedy (he shared the award with “Panda”, a GTV 9 barrel girl), suggested they be named after the man who “converted the theory of television into reality”. The man Kennedy was thinking of was a Scot, John Logie Baird. But Baird’s claims as the Father of Television are a matter of considerable dispute. He formed a company called Television Limited in June 1925 and developed a mechanical scanning system for “seeing by wireless” which eventually delivered a picture comprising 30 lines of resolution - very low definition even {{by the standards of}} a casual human observer in the 1920 s. The current analogue TV standard used in Australia comprises 625 lines and high definition systems can deliver over 1000 lines. Baird’s experimental transmissions, especially those over 400 miles of cable from London to Glasgow in 1927, and then from London to New York, attracted a good deal of attention. He hustled both the very young British Broadcasting Corporation and the British Post Office to establish permanent television services. The BBC’s engineering staff, however, were scathing about the technical limitations of Baird’s mechanical system. At 30 lines of resolution, what the viewer saw by wireless simply wasn’t worth watching. Nevertheless, the corporation eventually agreed to allow Baird to undertake test broadcasts using its facilities during non-broadcast hours in 1929. TV sets called ”televisors” were being offered for sale at 25 guineas in 1930 and the BBC began serious development of television that year. Baird’s main problem was that other organisations and individuals were also investing in television research and using different techniques. Some were much better resourced than he was. Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI) had responded to the devastation which radio had wreaked on its recorded music business by investing heavily in television research. Around a quarter of its stock was controlled by the dominant US broadcasting company RCA, which was also deeply involved in television research. Baird and his supporters tried to exploit this connection, writing to the Prince of Wales in 1933 suggesting the BBC was “wasting a pioneer British industry” and “giving secret encouragement to alien interests”. Crucially, EMI, RCA and others concentrated their research on electronic scanning systems, using cathode ray tubes, rather than the mechanical scanning techniques with which Baird persevered. EMI demonstrated an <b>electronically-scanned</b> television system to the BBC in late 1932. Comparative tests in April 1933 revealed EMI’s system to be “immeasurably superior” to Baird 2 ̆ 7 s. But still the “Father of Television” stuck at his task. When the BBC commenced a regular TV service in November 1936, it was with both systems: a 405 -line EMI electronic standard and an upgraded Baird 240 -line mechanical system. Three months later, after a further test revealed Baird‘s television system to be still ”distinctly inferior” in key respects, it was announced that transmissions using this technology would cease. This made redundant the Baird system TV sets sold to that point. Baird’s defeat is often cited as a defining example of the modern supremacy of well-funded, co-operative corporate research teams over isolated inventors with ingenious ideas. But in the US, another “lone inventor”, Philo Farnsworth, was granted the first patent for an all-electronic TV system, which was eventually licensed to RCA. Brian Winston suggests bluntly that “Baird seems to have just had a thing about [electrical cathode ray] tubes and an obsession that his first thought was the best Baird failed not because he was alone, but rather because he was simply wrong”. Mechanical scanning produced something, but you couldn’t really call it television. Yet {{more than half a century}} later, John Logie Baird’s contribution is secure enough for an Australian court to restrain two media giants from uttering his name. His idiosyncratic engineering may have been no match for global corporate capitalism at the time, but the “Father of Television”’s controversial legacy has squared up more than adequately in the end.
