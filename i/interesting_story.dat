5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an <b>interesting</b> <b>story</b> and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Archer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, played by Nigel Havers. The character was created and introduced as a love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). Executive producer Kim Crowther revealed the team wanted {{an actor who}} was slightly younger than Audrey and who was very charming. Various actors were considered for the part, but the casting director suggested Havers as {{she knew he was}} a big fan of the show. The actor said he could not turn down a chance to appear in Coronation Street as his character had an <b>interesting</b> <b>story</b> arc. Havers was contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut as Lewis in the episode broadcast on 18 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Sera Chöding Hermitage (Se ra chos sdings ri khrod) was a tantric college (rgyud smad grwa tshang) {{before the}} 1959 Cultural Revolution. Located close to Sera and facing south, {{it has a}} yellow retreat house which was built first for the Tsongkhapa. The <b>interesting</b> <b>story</b> of this house is that a local 'site-spirit' (gzhi bdag) used to visit Tsongkhapa through a narrow window in the house. Tsong kha pa’s mural image is seen here on the wall, which is {{credited}} with special powers as an “image that speaks” or known as speaking-statue (gsung byon ma). It was Tsongkhapa's favourite hermitage where he spent substantial time and composed his magnamopus, the “Great Commentary on the Prajñāmūla (Rtsa shes Dīk chen). He also taught here. It {{is also known as}} the hermitage where Tsongkhapa assigned his Tantric teachings to Rje shes rab seng ge (1383–1445), the founder of the Tantric Colleges.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} {{required}} {{to create a new}} name to sign up to Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed. The answer to that problem came as the members looked for good names in their local phone book. When they stumbled upon Lake Bodom, they realized that it was a name with impact and one which had an <b>interesting</b> <b>story</b> behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.|$|E
25|$|Dyson {{also did}} {{work in a}} variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and random matrices. There is an <b>interesting</b> <b>story</b> {{involving}} random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist Hugh Montgomery was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his pair correlation conjecture concerning the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. He showed his formula to the mathematician Atle Selberg who said it looked like something in mathematical physics and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the pair correlation function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the distribution of primes 2,3,5,7,11,... and the energy levels in the nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium.|$|E

500|$|On 14 October 2009, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{announced}} Havers {{had joined}} the cast of Coronation Street as Lewis, a potential love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). A writer for What's on TV said Havers {{was to make a}} one-off appearance in December before continuing in the role throughout 2010. The show's executive producer, Kim Crowther, told Gareth McLean of the Radio Times that while the team was planning the Audrey and Lewis storyline, they decided they wanted to introduce someone who was very charming, and slightly younger than Audrey. Casting director June West considered various actors for the part, including Anthony Head, but she suggested Havers for the role as she knew he was a big fan of the show. Crowther quipped, [...] "When you think of Nigel, you think of someone suave enough to charm you out of your high heels. Half the work is done." [...] Havers said he could not refuse the part because his character was fascinating and had an <b>interesting</b> <b>story</b> arc, and that being on the show had always been his ambition. Havers was initially contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut screen appearance as Lewis on 18 December 2009. In March 2010, Havers stated that he was keen to renew his contract, as he was enjoying his time with the soap.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Vulture, Scott Meslow gave [...] "Laws of Nature" [...] 4 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "as the Marvel Cinematic Universe {{has gotten}} bigger and weirder, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gotten bigger and better, and [...] "Laws of Nature" [...] {{is a strong}} premiere that shows off just how much this TV series has evolved." [...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, with his {{highlights}} the reveal that Simmons is on another planet, which would allow the series <b>interesting</b> <b>story</b> opportunities. Conversely, Sava felt elements of the episode were too procedural and [...] "a surplus of infodumps that drag the pacing," [...] and, unlike Goldman, felt leaving out May and Ward was [...] "a big reason why this premiere is an underwhelming reintroduction to this world." [...] He concluded, [...] "There’s lots of potential for this season to address the moral complications of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s mission, and hopefully the writers will use the themes of Civil War to explore the murky ethics of capturing and holding superpowered people against their will ... the transition into the age of Inhumanity {{may be a little}} rocky, but there’s enough substance in this premiere to suggest a promising season ahead." [...] Meslow and Sava both indicated their pleasure in the introduction of Joey Gutierrez, who Meslow noted appeared to be the first openly gay character in the MCU.|$|E
