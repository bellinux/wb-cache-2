500|$|Larter {{promotes}} natural beauty. At the 2007 Emmy Awards, Larter styled her {{own hair}} {{as opposed to}} using her hair-styling team. This {{was part of the}} Dove Hair's [...] "Real Beauty" [...] challenge which required her to use Dove's new moisturizing shampoos, conditioners and treatments. She also states that she refuses to conform to the idea of the perfect Hollywood body. In an interview with Allure, Larter revealed she once was asked by producers, by faxes sent out to her agent and manager, to lose weight. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> sitting in my trailer hysterically crying from the embarrassment I felt about myself, my body – and that no one could talk to me directly." ...|$|E

They noticed that the song had accumulated around 20 million plays on Spotify, which Clark initially presumed to be a mistake. Previously, [...] "Check Yes Juliet" [...] was the group's most popular song, selling 2,000 copies per week. [...] "Sad Song", however, was selling 3,000 copies per week. Clark called it [...] "so strange. [...] I <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> finding out that it happened and just being so blown away that for once in our career, we let our fans choose, kind of accidentally, which song {{we were going to}} go with." ...|$|E
500|$|Bughouse chess is {{controversial}} among chess teachers. While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse, most {{do not consider}} it {{to have a positive}} effect, especially for novice chess players. According to Susan Polgar, [...] "If your children want to play bughouse for fun, it is OK. But <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> that it is not chess and it has no positive value for chess. In fact, I absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament." [...] Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy. It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general, potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one's opponent will be moving quickly.|$|E

500|$|... "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] {{includes}} {{references to}} numerology in the lyrics [...] "If man is five/then the Devil is six/and God is seven". Francis later expanded on {{the significance of}} the lyrics in an interview to Alternative Press, saying [...] "It's a reference from what I understand to be Hebrew numerology, and I don't know a lot about it or any of it really. I <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> someone telling me of the supposed fact that in the Hebrew language, especially in the Bible, you can find lots of references to man in the 5th and Satan in the 6th and God in the 7th. [...] I didn't go to the library and figure it out". The song's numerology is alluded to on the single's cover, which features figures of five, six and seven, and also a monkey with a halo.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, in the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} released by HBO for [...] "The Door", David Benioff and D. B. Weiss {{revealed that the}} closing scene involving Hodor's name origin and subsequent death was an idea that was presented to them directly from George R. R. Martin. Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was going to happen in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just thought that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? <b>Just</b> <b>remember</b> not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. <b>Just</b> <b>remember</b> that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Julie Fernandez, {{who later}} {{appeared}} in BBC television programmes Eldorado and The Office, {{was invited to}} a BBC studio to appear on Jim'll Fix It. She recalled her experience in a radio interview: [...] "I was in my wheelchair, but I <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> [...] hands being everywhere and just lingering those two, three, four seconds slightly too long in places they shouldn't [...] It was in a busy room full {{of people in a}} studio so it was quite discreetly done and you don't kind of realise what's happening at the time, especially when you're 14 and it's the first time you've ever been in a studio and you're very excited. But I do remember feeling uncomfortable and he had these huge rings on his fingers." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 20 November 1968, {{two days}} before the release of The Beatles, McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an {{exclusive}} interview, in which he commented on several of the album's songs. Speaking of [...] "Helter Skelter", he said: [...] "Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' And I <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great – really screaming record.' And then I heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' And I had this song called 'Helter Skelter,' which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} years of their marriage, as {{described}} by Loretta Lynn in her autobiography Still Woman Enough:I married Doo when I wasn't but a child, and he was my life from that day on. But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special {{than anyone else in the}} world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And <b>just</b> <b>remember,</b> I'm explainin', not excusin'. (Still Woman Enough xvii) ... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through. He was also a womanizer. Cheating husbands have been all over the news talk shows for a few years now. Lots of women say they don't understand why women stay with them dogs. My story is about one who did—me.(Still Woman Enough, p. xiii).|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E

2500|$|Hansen {{intended}} {{to record the}} album in late 2001, but due to the September 11 attacks, [...] "it {{took a while for}} people to line up." [...] Before working with Godrich, Beck recorded tracks with Dan [...] "The Automator" [...] Nakamura in January 2002 in preparation for the new record, but no songs from those sessions were used for Sea Change. Many songs, such as [...] "Lost Cause", were performed live prior to the album's recording. Another new song, [...] "Evil Things", was also performed and demoed but ultimately not recorded for the album, due to loss of time. Regarding the performances of more personal tracks in the days before Sea Change, Beck explained in a 2008 interview that [...] "Those were the kinds of songs I would play {{in the middle of the}} show. I'd try to throw a couple of them in. I <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> the audience kind of disregarding them, or moshing, or throwing things. Just because those were the kinds of persons that came out." ...|$|E
2500|$|R singer-songwriter Frank Ocean {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] for the album. Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track.

Frank Tyson saw [...] "a spare, stooped old man, dressed immaculately in a pin-stripe suit" [...] telling the Cowdrey [...] "When you reach Australia, <b>just</b> <b>remember</b> one thing – Hate the Bastards!". He spoke with such vehemence that Tyson asked George Duckworth who the old gent was, [...] "That was Douglas Jardine", a fellow Oxford University man who had come down {{especially}} to see Cowdrey. Soon after the voyage began Cowdrey and Tyson were warned by the captain Len Hutton that they were secondary players who were expected to play little part in the Test matches, but in the end their efforts would prove decisive in England's victory. They traveled first-class on the Orsova which took six weeks to arrive in Western Australia, after stopping for a one-day game against , where Cowdrey made 66 not out. On their arrival in Perth Cowdrey received a telegram that his father had died, [...] "but soldiered on, thanks to the advice and encouragement of his young teammate Peter May and father figure and captain Len Hutton". Hutton made a small bet that Vic Wilson, a strapping Yorkshire farmer who could hit the ball many a mile, would score more Test runs than Cowdrey on the tour (a wager he lost).|$|E

2500|$|The MCC team {{gathered}} at Lord's for an eve of departure dinner {{during which the}} [...] "Success of the Team" [...] was toasted. In those days the MCC saw tours {{as a means of}} encouraging overseas cricket and strengthening the ties that bound the Commonwealth. Lord Cobham gave a speech in which he reminded the team that it was more important to not disgrace the face of English cricket even at the cost of series, though several young players had other ideas about this. The party was a large one of 18 players, Denis Compton suffered a recurrence of his knee trouble which had plagued him on the 1950-51 tour and required remedial surgery.
