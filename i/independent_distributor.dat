500|$|Paramount's {{revenues}} were {{much smaller than}} those of a true television network, and gradually Paramount began losing program sponsors or ended production on formerly-popular television series. American Vitamin Corporation, Paramount's sponsor for both The Spade Cooley Show and Frosty Frolics, pulled its $25,000 weekly sponsorship in October 1951. In June 1953, {{it was announced that}} Time For Beany and Paramount Television Productions were [...] "calling it a day". Paramount ended production of its flagship series in October 1953; rival Los Angeles station KTTV and <b>independent</b> <b>distributor</b> Consolidated Television respectively took over production and distribution of Time For Beany. <b>Independent</b> <b>distributor</b> Cinema-Vue took over Hollywood Wrestling. By late 1955, Billboard reported the Paramount Network consisted of just 15 stations airing Bandstand Revue. Billboard called this a [...] "sort of" [...] network. Management changes at KTLA, coupled with low local ratings, caused the cancellation of Bandstand Revue in October 1956. Klaus Landsberg, who had produced many of the series for KTLA, died in September 1956 and the new station manager made what Billboard called [...] "sweeping changes" [...] at the station.|$|E

2500|$|David Zucker, {{who was a}} fan of Cannibal!, {{contacted}} the duo to produce a 15-minute short film for Seagram to show at a party for their acquisition of Universal Studios. Due to a misunderstanding, Parker and Stone improvised much of the film an hour before it was shot, creating it as a spoof of 1950s instructional videos. The result, Your Studio and You, features numerous celebrities, including Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, and Steven Spielberg. [...] "You could probably make a feature film out {{of the experience of}} making that movie because it was just two dudes from college suddenly directing Steven Spielberg", Parker later remarked, noting that the experience was difficult for the two. During the time between shooting the pilots for Time Warped, Parker penned the script for a film titled Orgazmo, which later entered production. Half of the budget for the picture came from a Japanese porn company called Kuki, who wanted to feature its performers in mainstream Western media. <b>Independent</b> <b>distributor</b> October Films purchased the rights to the film for one million dollars after its screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, which resulted in the poor box office performance of the film. Parker and Stone attempted to negotiate with the organization on what to delete from the final print, but the MPAA would not give specific notes. The duo later theorized that the organization cared less because it was an <b>independent</b> <b>distributor</b> which would bring it significantly less money.|$|E

The release reached No. 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries, {{but it did not}} prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing The Gold Experience, fearing poor sales and citing [...] "market saturation" [...] as a defense. When released in September 1995, The Gold Experience reached the top 10 of the Billboard 200 initially. The album is now out of print.|$|E
