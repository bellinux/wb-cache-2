2500|$|A {{site was}} chosen in the Salt Wells Valley. The {{cost of the}} plant and its {{equipment}} were estimated at $13 million.

The firm of Holmes and Narver were chosen as architect-engineers, and Haddock Engineers as the construction contractor.

50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>pressing</b> is {{a popular}} method for obtaining {{densified}} UHTC materials that relies upon both high temperatures and pressures to produce densified materials. Powder compacts are heated externally and pressure is applied hydraulitically. In order to improve densification during <b>hot</b> <b>pressing,</b> diboride powders can undergo milling by attrition to obtain powders of <2μm. Milling also allows for more uniform dispersion of the additive SiC. <b>Hot</b> <b>pressing</b> temperature, pressure, heating rate, reaction atmosphere, and holding times are all factors that affect the density and microstructure of UHTC pellets obtained from this method. In order to achieve >99% densification from <b>hot</b> <b>pressing,</b> temperatures of 1800-2000 °C and pressures of 30 MPa or greater are required. UHTC materials with 20vol.% SiC and toughened with 5% carbon black as additives exhibit increased densification above 1500 °C, but these materials still require temperatures of 1900 °C and a pressure of 30 MPa {{in order to obtain}} near theoretical densities. Other additives such as Al2O3 and Y2O3 have also been used during the <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> of ZrB2-SiC composites at 1800 °C. These additives react with impurities to form a transient liquid phase and promote sintering of the diboride composites. The addition of rare earth oxides such as Y2O3, Yb2O3, La2O3 and Nd2O3 can lower densification temperatures and can react with surface oxides to promote densification. <b>Hot</b> <b>pressing</b> may result in improved densities for UHTCs, but it is an expensive technique that relies on high temperatures and pressures to provide useful materials.|$|E

50|$|Latest {{research}} {{suggests that there is}} no basic difference between sintering with pulsed or unpulsed current (SPS or FAST DHP). In principle the same improved sinter results (compared to conventional <b>hot</b> <b>pressing)</b> can be achieved by all direct <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> techniques, if the improvement is only due to the in-situ heating of the powder. If additional physical effects are present, which are associated to the electrical current density itself (which is highly dependent on the powder type), a pulsed current frequently has additional beneficial effects, because during each pulse the electrical current density peaks to a value significantly higher than a DC current with comparable heating power.|$|E
