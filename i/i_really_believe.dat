500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Ten started as {{instrumental}} compositions that Vedder added lyrics to after he joined the band. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in is this fucking moment, like right now. And that, actually, is what the whole album talks about." [...] Vedder's lyrics for Ten deal with subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. The album also tackles social concerns such as homelessness ("Even Flow") {{and the use of}} psychiatric hospitals ("Why Go").

500|$|The {{story of}} Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was {{inspired}} by Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman the Potters employed {{over the course of}} eleven summers at Dalguise House on the River Tay in Perthshire, writes Leslie Linder. Potter was 26 when, in 1892, she visited MacDonald while staying at Heath Park, Birnam. She wrote in her journal: [...] "Went out with the pony... to see Kitty MacDonald, our old washerwoman... Kitty is eighty-three but waken, and delightfully merry... She is a comical, round little woman, as brown as a berry and wears a multitude of petticoats and a white mutch. Her memory goes back for seventy years, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> she is prepared to enumerate the articles of her first wash in the year '71".|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "The first album with Rick {{was also the first}} album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water.

And it's only gonna better; <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that. So I'm super-excited." [...] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.

My only official recommendations are US Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton's Salt, and the C.R. Lawrence fine two inch style oscillating knife blade." [...] That line {{was written by}} Schur, and the scene used in the episode was Nick Offerman's first take, with no mistakes made with the complicated dialogue. Immediately after [...] "The Fight" [...] first aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC.com website. It included an additional four minutes of material, that include a previously-unaired cold open in which Ron sternly demands to know which employee has broken the parks department's coffee machine; this prompts a fight as the staff make accusations against each other. Ron secretly reveals to the camera that he broke the machine himself, but questioned the other employees anyway to deliberately start the arguments.|$|E

She later has a relationship with businessman Ji Min Kim (Eric Steinberg), who became her fiancé, however, he was murdered before {{they were able to}} marry. Jill's most recent relationship was with Cane Ashby's (Daniel Goddard) father, Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers). He had a criminal past, angering Katherine, who was protective of Jill. Allison Waldman of AOL TV wrote: [...] "Is he sincere, or is Colin just using Jill to get to Cane?" [...] Jill accepted his [...] "insane marriage offer" [...] and considered eloping. Walton said that Colin was a [...] "good match" [...] for Jill and she hoped that she could [...] "reform" [...] him. Amid everyone telling Jill that she should stay away from Colin, Walton said: [...] "She's only seeing the good in him. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> there's a real love between those two, and we're playing it like there is." [...] Their marriage was later declared invalid after Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis) revealed that she and Colin were still married.|$|E
500|$|Bégin's {{father taught}} his son that his {{best chance of}} making a career in hockey was as a {{defensive}} specialist and impressed on him {{the need for a}} strong work ethic. [...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL. [...] I always admired the way that he played. I look at the spirit, the leadership. Pretty amazing what he’s done for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, at the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, Hynek {{presented}} his thoughts {{in his speech}} [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Believe</b> About UFOs". [...] "I do believe", he said, [...] "that the UFO phenomenon {{as a whole is}} real, but I do not mean necessarily that it's just one thing. We must ask whether the diversity of observed UFOs ... all spring from the same basic source, as do weather phenomena, which all originate in the atmosphere", or whether they differ [...] "as a rain shower differs from a meteor, which in turn differs from a cosmic-ray shower." [...] We must not ask, Hynek said, simply which hypothesis can explain the most facts, but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.|$|E
2500|$|Yet Orwell [...] "had felt what {{socialism}} {{could be}} like" [...] and, according to Bowker, unlike the writer John Dos Passos for example, [...] "who {{also had a}} friend killed in custody by the SIM (Servicio de Investigación Militar/Spanish Secret Police) in Spain, and reacted by deserting the Communists and shifting decidedly to the right, Orwell never did abandon his socialism: if anything, his Spanish experience strengthened it." [...] In a letter to Cyril Connolly, written on 8 June 1937, Orwell said, [...] "At last <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in Socialism which I never did before". A decade later he wrote: [...] "Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, as I understand it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, Marquis {{completed}} a three-hit shutout against the Pittsburgh Pirates, defeating them 1–0. He {{had a perfect}} game going into the 6th inning, retiring the first 16 batters he faced, but Pirates shortstop Don Kelly broke {{it up with a}} single. The game took only 2hours and 6minutes. Marquis struck out 5, and needed only 109 pitches to complete the game. [...] "His ball was diving and darting. He was awesome", said teammate Jacque Jones. [...] The win improved Marquis' record to 5–1, and dropped his ERA to 1.70, 3rd-best in the NL. After the game, Marquis highlighted his consistency as being the key to his turnaround. [...] "My delivery is as consistent as it's ever been. I feel like I'm repeating the same delivery over and over again and that's the reason, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe,</b> for the success." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lynch {{has said}} that he is [...] "not a {{political}} person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan. Describing his political philosophy, he stated, [...] "at that time, I thought of myself as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I {{think a lot of the}} Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E

It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. Because when I write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines. But for the most part it comes to me, it comes in and I can hear the whole thing finished with harmonies and everything." [...] Graeham Goble (2001) ...|$|E
2500|$|During [...] "The Callas Debate", Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated, [...] "The timbre of Callas's voice, {{considered}} purely as sound, {{was essentially}} ugly: {{it was a}} thick sound, which {{gave the impression of}} dryness, of aridity. It lacked those elements which, in a singer's jargon, are described as velvet and varnish... yet <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that part of her appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish, velvet and richness, this voice could acquire such distinctive colours and timbres as to be unforgettable." [...] However, in his review of Callas's 1951 live recording of I vespri siciliani, Ira Siff writes, [...] "Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed, even early on, a flawed voice, unattractive by conventional standards—an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich, spinning sound, ravishing by any standard, capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble, chest tones unforced, and the middle register displays none of the [...] "bottled" [...] quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E
