5000|$|Both {{general purpose}} {{shotguns}} and more specialized target-type shotguns {{are used in}} trapshooting. Examples of trap guns are single-barreled shotgun (such as the Browning BT-99, Perazzi MX-series, Krieghoff K-80, Kolar T/A) or a <b>double</b> <b>barreled</b> <b>shotgun</b> such as the Beretta DT-10, Browning XT Trap, Beretta 682 Gold E and SKB'S. Shooters who shoot all sub-events will often buy a combination-set of a single and double barrel for shooting both singles and double targets respectively. Self-loading (semi-automatic shotguns) are popular for recreational shooting due to the lower perceived recoil and versatility {{because they can be}} used for singles, handicap, and doubles. Shotguns used in trapshooting can differ from field and skeet guns in several ways and normally are designed with a higher [...] "point of impact" [...] as the targets are intended to be shot as they rise.|$|E
5000|$|McNally, Cordona, and Shasta go to Rio Lobo, {{where they}} {{discover}} graft and corruption. Hendricks arrests Tuscarora on trumped up charges.

When the three sneak into Ketcham's ranch, McNally learns that Ketcham is really Sergeant Major Ike Gorman (Victor French), the traitor. McNally punches him around and forces him to sign the title deeds of the ranches back to their rightful owners. Philips then wires the triggers back, forming a dead-man's trap, on his <b>double</b> <b>barreled</b> <b>shotgun</b> so they can order Hendricks and his men out of the jail [...] They take over the town jail for cover, freeing Tuscarora, while Cordona goes for the Cavalry. Meanwhile, Tuscarora's girlfriend Maria Carmen (Susana Dosamantes) and her friend Amelita (Sherry Lansing) lend assistance. For that, Hendricks slashes Amelita's face, and Amelita swears to McNally that she will kill Hendricks.|$|E

50|$|Donald {{manages to}} sight the beavers chewing {{on a tree}} nearby to Old Sequoia, grabs his <b>double</b> <b>barreled</b> <b>shotgun,</b> and runs down {{the steps of the}} lookout post, only to trip and fall down the steps and get hit through his hat by his gun which was dropped on the way.

One beaver tries to get away, but Donald is {{standing}} on his tail. When the beaver orders Donald to get off, Donald flatly refuses, so the beaver uses his tail to throw Donald against the tree, which makes it fall over.

2500|$|Ithaca {{became famous}} for {{building}} firearms based on expired patents owned by Remington Arms. They also purchased patents from other firearm designers.

Ithaca bought the patent in 1907 and upgraded the design to allow for mass production. With the Flues designed Ithaca double, which became the best selling American double of all time with more than 223,000 produced between 1908 and 1926, Ithaca effectively drove Remington out of the double gun market.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the time}} needed to reload (even experts needed 15 seconds to reload a smooth-bore, muzzle-loading musket), flintlocks were {{sometimes}} produced with two, three, four or more barrels for multiple shots.

While weapons like <b>double</b> <b>barreled</b> <b>shotguns</b> were reasonably safe, weapons like the pepperbox revolver would sometimes fire all barrels simultaneously, or would sometimes just explode in the user's hand. It was often less expensive, safer, and more reliable to carry several single-shot weapons instead.|$|R
