(1996) {{mentioned}} that <b>dimethoxybenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{and many of}} its derivative compounds can play a role against post-harvest disease in strawberry caused by Botrytis cinerea. Avis (2007) reported that fatty acids in the form of phospholipids are important components of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane of all cells. The cell membrane has an essential general role of maintaining cell order and integrity, and a number of disease control mechanisms involve the compounds that directly affect by partitioning into the membrane and inducing disorders or indirectly affect by inhibiting fatty acid biosynthetic pathways that target the phospholipids of the cell membrane. Recent research has also shown that 2 -hexadecynoic acid, a 2 -alkynoic fatty acid, had antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and that linoleic acid (18 : 2), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, has antifungal activity against several plant pathogenic fungi (Liu et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|The {{cytochrome}} P 450 enzyme CYP 199 A 4, from Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain HaA 2, can efficiently demethylate 4 -methoxybenzoic acid via hemiacetal {{formation and}} subsequent elimination of formaldehyde. Oxidative demethylation of a methoxy group para to the carboxyl moiety is strongly favoured over reaction at {{one in the}} ortho or meta positions. <b>Dimethoxybenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> containing a para-methoxy group were also efficiently demethylated exclusively at the para position. The presence of additional methoxy substituents reduces the substrate binding affinity and the activity compared to 4 -methoxybenzoic acid. The addition of the smaller hydroxy group to the ortho or meta positions or of a nitrogen heteroatom in the aromatic ring of the 4 -methoxybenzoate skeleton was better tolerated by the enzyme and these analogues were also readily demethylated. There {{was no evidence of}} methylenedioxy ring formation with 3 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxybenzoic acid, an activity which is observed with certain plant CYP enzymes with analogous substrates. CYP 199 A 4 is also able to deprotect the methylenedioxy group of 3, 4 -(methylenedioxy) benzoic acid to yield 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and formic acid. This study defines the substrate range of CYP 199 A 4 and reveals that substrates without a para substituent are not oxidised with any significant activity. Therefore para-substituted benzoic acids are ideal substrate scaffolds for the CYP 199 A 4 enzyme and will aid in the design of optimised probes to investigate the mechanism of this class of enzymes. They also allow an assessment of the potential of CYP 199 A 4 for synthetic biocatalytic processes involving selective oxidative demethylation or demethenylation. Tom Coleman, Rebecca R.
