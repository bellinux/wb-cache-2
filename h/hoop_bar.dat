6000|$|Next day, {{the moment}} {{there was enough}} of light {{to enable them to}} resume the search, the Eskimos hurried on board the ship and began to ransack every hole and corner, and they found much that caused their eyes to glitter with the delight of men who have {{unexpectedly}} discovered a mine of gold. Among other things, they found in a small room which had been used as a blacksmith's forge, large quantities of <b>hoop,</b> <b>bar,</b> and rod-iron. While Cheenbuk and Oolalik were rejoicing over this find, Anteek rushed in upon them in a state of considerable excitement with something in his hand. It was a large watch of the double-cased [...] "warming-pan" [...] tribe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, seismic {{behavior}} of the frame-shear wall structure, which are respectively composed of the concrete filled steel tubular (CFST) and of the reinforced concrete (RC) column, have been studied under the conventional earthquake. Dynamic behaviors and earthquake responses including deformation and forcing of the CFST and RC structures are analyzed. Comparing the calculation results, the earthquake resistant {{behavior of}} the CFST structure has been evaluated synthetically, which may be referential for structure design. Introductions CFST structure has a better seismic behavior comparing to the RC structures. As the steel tube has longitudinal bars {{as well as the}} <b>hoop</b> <b>bars,</b> the reinforcement ratio is more than 4. 6 %, which exceeds the least reinforcement ratio in the seismic Codes far away; as far as the axial compressing ratio, the CFST structure has a better deformation capability and compressive strength. Because of the abov...|$|R

40|$|The North Tank Farm (NTF) and the South Tank Farm (STF) {{located at}} ORNL {{contains}} 8 underground waste storage tanks which were built around 1943. The tanks {{were used to}} collect and store the liquid portion of the radioactive and/or hazardous chemical wastes produced as part of normal facility operations at ORNL, but are no longer part of the active Low Level Liquid Waste system of the Laboratory. The tanks were constructed of gunite. The six STF tanks are 50 ft in diameter, and have a 12 ft sidewall, and an arched dome rising another 6. 25 ft. The sidewall are 6 in. thick and have an additional 1. 5 in. gunite liner on the inside. There is a thickened ring at the wall-dome juncture. The dome consists of two 5 in. layers of gunite. The two tanks in the NTF are similar, but smaller, having a 25 ft diameter, no inner liner, and a dome thickness of 3. 5 in. Both sets of tanks have welded wire mesh and vertical rebars in the walls, welded wire mesh in the domes, and horizontal reinforcing <b>hoop</b> <b>bars</b> pre-tensioned to 35 to 40 ksi stress in the walls and thickened ring. The eight tanks are entirely buried under a 6 ft layer of soil cover. The present condition of the tanks is not accurately known, since access to them is extremely limited. In order to evaluate the structural capability of the tanks, a finite element analysis of each size tank was performed. Both static and seismic loads were considered. Three sludge levels, empty, half-full, and full were evaluated. In the STF analysis, the effects of wall deterioration and group spacing were evaluated. These analyses found that the weakest element in the tanks is the steel resisting the circumferential (or hoop) forces in the dome ring, a fact verified separately by an independent reviewer. However, the hoop steel has an adequate demand/capacity ratio. Buckling of the dome and the tank walls is not a concern...|$|R
50|$|Island Challenge - In {{the heart}} of the Island, there was a huge ravine with 2 crossings. Lower down was a flimsy bridge which 4 team members will stand holding {{coloured}} nets. More than 3 storeys high is a precarious cable, and the captains will have to make their way across this with <b>hoops</b> and monkey <b>bars</b> for balance. Strapped to edge of the wobbly platform are 4 coloured cogs which the captains have to detach one at a time and drop them to the matching coloured net as quickly as possible. If a cog misses a net or otherwise lost, the captain has {{to go back to the}} end platform where there are 2 spares of each colour. The team that catches the right cogs in all four of their nets, and then gets their captain to the end the quickest, wins.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper {{the focus is on}} the {{compressive}} response of short high strength reinforced concrete members having circular transverse cross-sections and reinforced with longitudinal steel bars and transverse spirals or hoops. An analytical model is proposed which allows one to estimate the confinement pressures exerted by transverse steel and by longitudinal bars during the loading process, taking into account the interaction of the hoops or spirals with the inner core both in the plane of the transverse steel and in the space between two successive hoops. Yielding of steel spirals or <b>hoops</b> and longitudinal <b>bars</b> including buckling phenomena and damage to the concrete core are also considered by means of variation in the elastic modulus and in the Poisson's coefficient. The proposed mechanical model is able to reproduce the load-shortening curves of compressed members; it gives good agreement with several experimental data and with analytical results obtained by using other recent models available in the literature. © 2011...|$|R
40|$|Six column specimens, {{representing}} the boundary elements {{at the ends}} of walls, were constructed and tested under pure axial load. This series included: a specimen without any confinement; a specimen with closed ties; a specimen with seismic hoops and crossties; a specimen with closed <b>hoops</b> and headed <b>bars</b> replacing the crossties; and two specimens that had all of the transverse reinforcement replaced by headed bars at two different spacings. Two additional specimens were tested to investigate the effectiveness of headed bars used to retrofit specimens that had no transverse reinforcement. In the retrofit procedure the first step involved drilling horizontal holes through the specimens. Headed bars with one end having a fixed head and the other end having a threaded head were then placed in the holes. After seating the heads on a thin layer of epoxy, the headed bars were slightly prestressed using the turn-of-the-nut method. Using small access holes drilled {{at the end of each}} headed bar, the horizontal holes were filled with structural epoxy. Behavioural comparisons were made for the boundary elements utilizing conventional reinforcement and those with headed bars. It was found that headed bars not only provided a viable solution when used as crossties, but they also offer improved confinement compared to the seismic hoops and crossties used in seismic design. It was also found that headed bars can be used to replace entirely the hoops and crossties with improved confinement. The retrofit procedure using added headed bars resulted in significant improvement to the confinement of the boundary elements...|$|R
60|$|From Rancocus Island the Martha sailed for the group, {{which was}} visited and {{inspected}} {{in all its}} settlements by the governor and council. The policy adopted {{by the government of}} the colony was very much unlike that resorted to in America, in connection with the extension of the settlements. Here a vast extent of surface is loosely overrun, rendering the progress of civilization rapid, but very imperfect. Were the people of the United States confined to one-half the territory they now occupy, there can be little question that they would be happier, more powerful, more civilized, and less rude in manners and feelings; although it may be high treason to insinuate that they are not all, men, women and children, already at the ne plus ultra of each of those attainments. But there is a just medium in the density of human population, as well as in other things; and that has not yet been reached, perhaps, even in the most thickly peopled of any one of the Old Thirteen. Now, Mark Woolston had seen enough of the fruits of a concentrated physical force, in Europe, to comprehend their value; and he early set his face against the purely skimming process. He was resolved that the settlements should not extend faster than was necessary, and that as much of civilization should go with them as was attainable. In consequence of this policy, the country soon obtained a polished aspect, as far as the settlements reached. There were four or five distinct points that formed exceptions to this rule, it having been considered convenient to make establishments there, principally on account of the whalers. One, and the largest of these isolated settlements, was in the Whaling Bight, quite near to Blubber Islano, where a village had sprung up, containing the houses and shops of coopers, rope-makers, boat-builders, carpenters, blacksmiths, &c.; men employed in making casks, whaling gear, and boats. There also were the dwellings of three or four masters and mates of vessels, as well as of sundry boat-steerers. In the whole, there might have been fifty habitations at this particular point; of which about two-thirds were in a straggling village, while the remainder composed so many farm-houses. Everything at this place denoted activity and a prosperous business; the merchants taking the oil as fast as it was ready, and returning for it, <b>hoops,</b> iron in <b>bars,</b> hemp, and such other articles as were wanted for the trade.|$|R
