The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E

However, the USMC considered the need for naval gunfire support to be a greater priority than additional platforms for carrier operations, while the cost and delay associated with such elaborate conversions was significant, and the concept was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about the biogeography of the spinosaurids. Since Suchomimus was {{more closely related to}} Baryonyx (from Europe) than to Spinosaurus—although that genus also lived in Africa—the distribution of spinosaurids cannot be explained as vicariance resulting from continental rifting. Sereno et al. proposed that spinosaurids were initially distributed across the supercontinent Pangea, but split {{with the opening of the}} Tethys Sea. Spinosaurines would then have evolved in the south (Africa and South America: in Gondwanaland) and baryonychines in the north (Europe: in Laurasia), with Suchomimus the result of a single north-to-south dispersal event. It has also been suggested that baryonychines could be the ancestors of spinosaurines, which appear to <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> former in Africa. In 2006, it was demonstrated that Iberia was near northern Africa during the Early Cretaceous; some researchers have argued that the Iberian region was a stepping stone between Europe and Africa, which is supported by the presence of baryonychines in Iberia. The direction of the dispersal between Europe and Africa is still unknown, and subsequent discoveries of spinosaurid remains in Asia and Australia indicate that it may have been complex.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E

5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E
