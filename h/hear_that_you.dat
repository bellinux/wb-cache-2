500|$|On {{the night}} of Wednesday 30 November 2005, three armed men broke into Harvey's home, confronting him and his two {{roommates}} and demanding money. The intruders said [...] "We <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are gay" [...] and while the two room mates denied this, Harvey [...] who was openly gay [...] remained silent. The two room mates were bound and gagged while Harvey was forced to carry valuables to the criminal's car. At gunpoint, they forced him {{into the car and}} abducted him.|$|E

His Royal Highness desires me to express his earnest hope that you health may be restored and that your friends may {{soon be able to}} welcome you back to The Oval. Yours faithfully, Arthur Bigge." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his {{month in}} jail, Brown {{was allowed to}} send and receive correspondence. One of the letters was from Mahala Doyle, wife and mother of three of Brown's Kansas victims. She wrote [...] "Altho' vengeance is not mine, I confess that I do feel gratified to <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were stopped in your fiendish career at Harper's Ferry ..." [...] In a {{postscript}} she added [...] "My son John Doyle whose life I beged of you is now grown up and is very desirous to be in Charlestown {{on the day of}} your execution." ...|$|E
5000|$|... loosely: Though I have {{no reason}} for regret, upon <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are headed to Shikasuga I am not {{completely}} indifferent.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Mr. Barton," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "your {{patient is}} {{doing very well}} indeed. She will be crazy with delight when she <b>hears</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have called." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly, sir,' said Pinch; {{not doing}} so, however, but holding it rather wider open than before, and beckoning nervously to {{somebody}} without: 'Mr Westlock, sir, <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were come home--' ...|$|R
2500|$|Wallace, {{responding}} to Darwin's 1 May letter, discussed his own theorising. Darwin replied on 22 December {{that he was}} [...] "extremely glad to <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are attending to distribution in accordance with theoretical ideas. I am a firm believer, that without speculation {{there is no good}} & original observation", and added that [...] "I believe I go much further than you; but it is too long a subject to enter on my speculative notions." [...] He also said [...] "You ask whether I shall discuss 'man';—I think I shall avoid whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest & most interesting problem for the naturalist." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu (孫布) {{secretly}} sent {{a messenger}} to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey {{his desire to}} defect to Wei. Sun Bu also said in his message: [...] "As we are too far apart from each other, I cannot come to you. You will need to send troops to escort me over." [...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious. I think you should secretly make plans for yourself first and act accordingly when the time comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have been}} putting down your carriage. I {{do not give}} you money to hoard in a bank, but I {{give it to you}} that you may keep up a fitting {{appearance}} with it. Let me hear that your carriage is back in the coach-house when I return to Paris. Junot, you rascal, I <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have been gambling and losing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we must {{drop your}} mother for the time;--that's all. When my aunt <b>hears</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are to be}} married from the Duke's, she will be quite willing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should remain with her till you go down to Mistletoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{called in}} Goswell Street,' resumed Mr. Jackson, 'and <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were here, from the slavey, took a coach and came on. Our people want you {{down in the}} city directly, Mrs. Bardell.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An old soldier can't {{be better}} {{employed}} than in teaching a young one {{the use of}} his sword," [...] answered the Major, gallantly. [...] "I remember in old times <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could use yours pretty well, Captain Costigan." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> go {{even to the}} Lukanga River, a moon's journey {{beyond the}} Manica country. Is this so also, 'Macumazahn?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{housekeeper}} smiled sadly. [...] "At least let me <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't {{disapprove of}} my conduct under trying circumstances," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't father laugh," [...] he said, [...] "when he <b>hears</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought I was a franc tireur. We haven't seen any, about Colmar. I don't {{think you}} need be afraid of them, if they ain't bigger or older than I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, sir, {{for taking the}} liberty. If I had known <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were about, I would have sent: but <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were gone home, I thought {{you would not be}} offended, if I gave thanks for them myself. They are my own, sir, as it were--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does <b>that</b> seem to <b>you</b> to be right? Can you do {{yourself}} any good by that? Will she {{be more likely}} to listen to <b>you</b> when she <b>hears</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have got drunk, and have assaulted me in the street? Have I done you any harm?" ...|$|R
6000|$|On this {{occasion}} Mr. Greenwood sat down without being asked. [...] "I {{am sorry to}} <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are so unwell, Lady Kingsbury." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{will tell}} them, Mistress Nellie, and trust that you will take them entirely into your confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am glad, indeed, to <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have caught}} that scoundrel, Mr. Gilmore, but I hardly {{think she can}} be worth towing in.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Sammy, Sammy," [...] I said, [...] "you {{see what}} comes of cowardice? On the hill with us {{you would not}} have been scorched, and it is only by the merest chance of owing to Hans's quick <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were not left to perish miserably in that hole." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is very dangerous, Miss Dove. I {{know all}} about it; it is she whom Dingaan was after. When he <b>hears</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have {{sheltered}} her he will send and kill you all. Take my advice and turn her out at once. I say it is most dangerous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{they are almost}} well; but still, if you don't want to hear Jean's story of all your adventures, by all means go round. I am sure that the tenants will be gratified at <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> rode over to see them, the very first evening you came home." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then he added, [...] "I grieved to <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{and your}} {{household}} {{were so much}} exposed to the witchcrafts of that same woman, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} will be quite as much surprised," [...] said Ethel, {{somewhat}} exasperated, [...] "when you <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> lacerated her feelings yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No great {{witchcraft}} to <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{speak as}} we do at home in Bedfordshire, not like these northern boors, that {{might as well be}} Scots!' ...|$|E
50|$|The eccentricities Berners {{displayed}} started {{early in}} life. Once, upon <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could teach {{a dog to}} swim by throwing him into water, the young Gerald promptly decided that by throwing his mother's dog out the window, he could teach it to fly. The dog was unharmed, though the act earned Berners a beating.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me {{give you}} some,' He caught by chance her glance {{immediately}} withdrawn; yet it was a glance not only of beauty, but of feeling and thought. She added, in a hushed and hurried tone, dividing very nervously some grapes, 'I hardly know whether Oswald will be most pleased or grieved when he <b>hears</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have been here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR SIR,--I {{appreciate}} your kindness in offering me the situation [...] mentioned in your {{letter of the}} 4th, and especially your remarks in [...] reference to my late father, who was indeed worthy of esteem. I shall [...] have pleasure in calling on <b>you</b> on <b>hearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are satisfied with [...] the testimonials herewith enclosed.--I am, etcetera." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Slow told me. I {{was with}} Mr Slow about {{business}} of yours. I'm afraid from what I <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> find your brother very ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do, Lord Minster?" [...] said Mildred, cordially. [...] "I <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{went to the}} Convent yesterday; {{what did}} you think of the view?" ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{delighted to}} <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have {{your eye on}} her in the students' room. You will really, pictorially, make the little woman whom I love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> There's {{my voice}} over there, and here I am here! What {{do you make}} of it?" [...] whispered Sticky-toes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{has heard}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> went away under a cloud, having {{surrendered}} your estate. <b>That</b> was against <b>you.</b> Well;--you have come back, and she <b>hears</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have brought some money with you. She {{does not care}} very much about money; but she does care about regularity and fixed habits. If Hess is to be married at all she would especially wish that her husband should be a religious man. Perhaps you are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> mother? <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> this comedy <b>that</b> these slaves {{have been}} playing under your nose? Send them both to the {{whipping}} post." ...|$|R
