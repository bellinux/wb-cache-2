5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{not to go}} {{into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{where he was}} from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what work {{he wanted}} done. He wanted two warts (moles) removed {{on the right}} lower {{forehead}} between the eyes and one at the left angle, outer angle of the left eye; wanted a depression of the nose filled in; a scar; a large one {{to the left of}} the median line of the upper lip excised, wanted his dimples removed and wanted the angle of the mouth drawn up. He didn't say anything about the fingers that day to me.|$|E
25|$|Scates' {{interest}} in volleyball began when his college football coach required his players {{to try out}} for a volleyball team to stay in shape during the off season. Scates did not make the team roster, but a teammate of his on the basketball team not only made the team, but was the best player on the floor. “So <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> where he learned to play,” Scates said. “He told me State Beach in Santa Monica. So I decided to learn how to play.” Scates was soon a regular at State Beach.|$|E
25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft's {{anger and}} {{frustration}} over the secondary status afforded women compels her to define herself in antithesis to conventional images of femininity. In the first letter she proudly announces [...] "at supper my host told me bluntly that I was a woman of observation, for <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> men's questions" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's).|$|E
500|$|The Times {{followed}} with {{essentially the same}} story on 4 October 1994, adding that the burning [...] " [...] left many on the island bewildered, incredulous and angry". £1,500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to Islay police: [...] "Sergeant Lachlan Maclean checked the money with both banks on Islay and with Customs and Excise, who pronounced it genuine. 'I telephoned Mr Drummond in London and told him the money had been found. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if it was his. He said he would {{get in touch with}} his partner, Mr Cauty. So far he has not telephoned back.|$|E
500|$|After Shishakli {{came into}} {{conflict}} with the Ba'athists that year {{as a result of}} the former's authoritarian manner of governance, Atrash moved to Homs, a hotbed of opposition to Shishakli's rule, where he helped coordinate the supply of arms to insurgents in Jabal al-Druze. He was arrested by the authorities for a second time in May, during the peak of the unrest. He had been released both times because of his father's popularity at the national level; by releasing Atrash, Shishakli attempted to gain the appeasement of Sultan. In response to Atrash's second release from prison, Sultan said [...] "I didn't ask Shishakli for the freedom of my son. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> for the freedom of my country." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Ragtime was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was {{immediately}} at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe. Howard Rollins, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, said, [...] "I was frightened to meet Mr. Cagney. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> how to die {{in front of the}} camera. He said 'Just die!' It worked. Who would know more about dying than him?" [...] Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, Joan Leslie, and Lemmon. As filming progressed, Cagney's sciatica worsened, but he finished the nine-week filming, and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help the other actors with their dialogue.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of Arjen and Bernadien's first meeting {{have been reported}} by his former youth coach, Barend Beltman: [...] "Arjen was driven and determined at a young age. He was always on time, never late. But one Friday afternoon he showed up 15 minutes past the start of practice. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what was going on. 'We were at the market square, having fun,' he said. There were some girls {{with him and his}} friends, so I asked, 'Was she worth it?' 'Yes, trainer, she was,' he told me. I told him to get his gear and join the training session. At his wedding, I heard the woman he met that day was now his wife and mother of his children. Bernadien is her name." ...|$|E
500|$|By autumn 1974, Drake's weekly {{retainer}} from Island had ceased, and {{his illness}} meant {{he remained in}} contact {{with only a few}} close friends. He had tried {{to stay in touch with}} Sophia Ryde, whom he had first met in London in 1968. Ryde has been described by Drake's biographers as [...] "the nearest thing" [...] to a girlfriend in his life, but she now prefers the description [...] "best (girl) friend". In a 2005 interview, Ryde revealed that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: [...] "I couldn't cope with it. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> for some time. And I never saw him again." [...] As with the relationship he had earlier shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, Drake's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.|$|E
60|$|Not to make Joe uneasy {{by talking}} too much, even if I {{had been able}} to talk much, <b>I</b> {{deferred}} <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> about Miss Havisham until next day. He shook his head when <b>I</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if she had recovered.|$|R

500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E
500|$|... “There was {{a fitting}} celebration. Porter Ashe, Ned Hamilton and others {{recalled}} {{the good old}} days when “The Roseleaves ” fluttered about in madcap merriment. [...] And then the tablet was left to Mother Nature and to the silence which is only broken by the soughing of the breeze through the branches and the music of the bee and the katydid [...] Only the wanderer in the hills or the devout pilgrim seeking out shrines of song will find the tablet on the oak. “Dan O ’Connell loved God ’s out-of-doors, ” said Peters when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> about the memorial [...] “He delighted in life in the open [...] He was an excellent shot, a skilled fly fisher and an expert yachtsman [...] So it seemed right to commemorate him in the hills and among the trees.” ...|$|E
500|$|MSR Studios was {{the final}} New York City-based studio used, and where most of 4 was {{recorded}}—only [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "I Was Here" [...] were recorded entirely at other studios. At MSR, Beyoncé emphasized the use of live instruments on songs such as [...] "I Care" [...] and [...] "End of Time". Consequently, most of the instruments, including drums, keyboards, guitar and bass work, were recorded there and performed by Jeff Bhasker and Shea Taylor. Beyoncé asked Frank Ocean to write and record [...] "I Miss You" [...] at MSR, saying to Complex, [...] " [...] had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the next morning. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to fly to New York and work on my record." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think he}} knows her. She knows him—which is very different. When <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about her he merely tells me she’s fascinating. She is fascinating,” said her ladyship with inimitable dryness.|$|R
6000|$|... "To tell Sir Percival Glyde {{the truth}} {{with my own}} lips," [...] she answered, [...] "and to let him release me, if he will, not because <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> but because he knows all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why?' I says. 'Never you mind,' says he. 'Well, who is he?' <b>I</b> <b>asks.</b> What do {{you think}} happens then? He thinks hard for a spell, rolls his eyes, and says: 'Search me. I've forgotten.' 'Know where he lives?' <b>I</b> <b>asks</b> <b>him.</b> 'Nope,' he says.|$|R
500|$|The {{first year}} Lightning Bar stood as a {{breeding}} stallion his stud fee, the amount charged to breed a mare to him, was $250 (approximately $ as of [...] ) but only nine mares were bred to him. The next year, he bred 11mares, but in 1956, he bred 102 mares at $500 (approximately $ as of [...] ) each. One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting {{one of his}} ranch hands take the horse to a local jackpot roping. Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that [...] "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his face. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> how the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used. He replied, 'The stud.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Beyoncé sat for an {{interview}} with Gabriel Alvarez of Complex magazine, where she elaborated on how she came to know about Ocean: [...] "Jay had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the next morning. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to fly to New York and work on my record." [...] In this way, Ocean ended up co-writing [...] "I Miss You". Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyoncé's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and an insightful quote.

500|$|While Lopez and Anthony were {{recording}} the song, Lopez {{came up with}} the video concept. Lopez recalled the events by stating: [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> [...] if he liked it. And I actually explained it to Tommy and him at the same time another day in the studio after the song was recorded and they both loved it." [...] The music video for [...] "No Me Ames" [...] was directed by Kevin Bray in Los Angeles, California, the day after she shot the music video for [...] "If You Had My Love".
