5000|$|In recent times, Eurostat {{publishes the}} [...] "business {{investment}} rate" [...] (also called the [...] "gross investment rate of non-financial corporations") in its quarterly sector {{accounts for the}} EU27. This ratio is defined as gross fixed capital formation divided by gross value added, in other words the share of GFCF in gross product. It provides {{an indication of how}} much of the total factor income is reinvested in new <b>fixed</b> <b>assets.</b> Normally that ratio is about 20-23% of gross value-added. However, calling it the [...] "business investment rate" [...] or the [...] "gross investment rate" [...] is somewhat deceptive, since this indicator refers only to fixed investment, and more specifically, the net <b>fixed</b> investment (<b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> bought, less <b>disposals</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets).</b> The actual total funds which are spent by enterprises on investments, in gross terms, are much larger, both because enterprises invest in far more than <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> only (they also buy intermediate goods and services, and some financial assets), and because the total money they spend on buying <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> is larger than the same sum netted <b>of</b> asset <b>disposals.</b> The main reason why this Eurostat indicator is published is that it shows something about the longer-term expectations of enterprises. If business confidence is low, enterprises are less likely to tie up new earnings in additional <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> which are usually held for a number of years. If, on the other hand, business confidence is buoyant, {{it is more likely that}} enterprises will spend more of their current earnings on longer-term investments in <b>fixed</b> <b>assets.</b> In turn, the rate at which enterprises invest earnings in longer-term assets is an indicator of business expansion - if the rate declines, then this typically lowers the rate of cumulative business expansion. For example, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the ratio dropped to slightly below 20% in Q1 2010 from a high of 23% in Q2 2008. Although this 3% drop in the ratio may not seem so large, in reality it signifies a very large amount of money that was no longer spent. The reason is that the total gross investment and gross value-added for the European Union amount to trillions of euro's, while the total gross value-added also fell significantly in 2008-2010.|$|R
