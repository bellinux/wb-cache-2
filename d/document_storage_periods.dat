40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of strains of local hens and egg <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> at temperature (25 °C) on egg quality traits. Twenty chickens of each genotype were kept in family pens and randomly distributed into two replicates. Nine eggs from each line were evaluated for external and internal egg quality. The correlations between external and internal egg quality traits were calculated; as well the regression of the traits on <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> was computed. The overall mean of egg weight (EW), egg index (EI), haugh unit (HU), albumin (AP) and yolk (YP) percentages were 58. 44 (g), 1. 31 %, 77. 67 %, 55. 22 % and 29. 26 % respectively. The differences between lines were significant (P< 0. 01) in EW and EI, while the differences in HU were significant due to <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> only. Differences in EW and EI due to the interaction between lines and <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> were significant, while the differences in HU were significant only between line (3) and (4) at <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> (1 day). It was shown that the differences between lines in albumin (AP) and yolk (YP) percentages were significant. <b>Storage</b> <b>period</b> {{has no effect on}} AP, whereas the differences were significant in YP. Also the differences in AP and YP due to the interaction between lines and <b>storage</b> <b>periods</b> were significant. Values of correlation ranged between - 0. 61 (P< 0. 01) between EI and AP and 0. 44 (P< 0. 01) between EW and AP. A non-significant regressions on <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> for all lines were - 0. 09, - 0. 01, - 0. 47, - 0. 16 and 0. 07 for EW, EI, HU, AP and YP respectively. Values of the regression on <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> calculated for each line were not significant except of AP in line 3 (- 0. 62) which indicated that the increase in <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> will decrease AP significantly (P< 0. 01).

The study was based on collecting thirty six samples of mozzarella cheese, eighteen from each factory. The chemical composition (fat, protein, total solid, ash and titratable acidity) and microbial quality total bacterial count, proteolytic bacterial count, lipolytic bacterial and psychrotrophic bacterial count) of the cheese were evaluated. The results showed that protein, total solids and ash content were high in the factory located in Khartoum, while fat content and titratable acidity were high in the factory located in Khartoum North. During the storage of 75 days the fat content of cheese gradually (P< 0. 01) increased from day zero to a maximum at day 60, and then decreased there after.
