25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. <b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E
500|$|Tytell {{writes that}} Pound {{was in his}} element in Chestnut Ward. He was at last {{provided}} for, and was allowed to read, write and receive visitors, including Dorothy for several hours a day. He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, {{and turned it into}} his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of Sophocles's Women of Trachis and Electra, and continued work on The Cantos. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release. She wrote to a friend: [...] "E.P. has—as he had before—bats in the belfry but <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> that he has fewer not more than before his incarceration." ...|$|E
500|$|The fair {{organizers}} did not await {{congressional approval}} to begin planning the coin. [...] According to Swiatek and Breen, the fair's director general Frank B. Davison {{came up with}} the concept for the designs. On December7, 1922, Commission of Fine Arts chairman Charles Moore wrote to Buffalo nickel designer and sculptor member of the commission James Earle Fraser, [...] "The Los Angeles people are planning to celebrate the Monroe Doctrine Centennial. [...] They {{are going to have a}} 50-cent piece and have decided that on the obverse shall be the heads of President Monroe and John Quincy Adams... On the reverse will be the western continents from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn with some dots for the West Indies and some indication of the Panama Canal... <b>It</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> that the designs having been settled upon, the [...] models could be worked out quite readily and that a pretty swell thing could be made." ...|$|E

2500|$|Greiner was {{a member}} of the Thursday Club of the Buffalo area. The Thursday Club is an {{exclusively}} male club of about 60 notable men, mostly educators and attorneys. The Club has been in existence for more than 130 years, and was originally established as a type of literary club that included notable men. In 1998, the Thursday Club held a dinner meeting at UB, prompting a woman to write a letter to Greiner and other SUNY administrators regarding the possible violation of a private club that discriminates against women holding a meeting at a state-run institution. The Buffalo News quoted the letter, stating, [...] "I do not know if it is a violation of state law or university policy to use university facilities to support the activities of a private club that discriminates against women, but <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me,</b> at the very least, as a wildly inappropriate violation of judgment and good taste." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. How would they show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as a very silly argument. We could just as easily apply it to [...] poker players. We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could say this about anything and everything. We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} do. At this point, the reader will appreciate the vacuity of the EMH argument.|$|E
2500|$|Typical scripts for {{an average}} one-hour {{television}} show run 60 pages, but those for Moonlighting were nearly twice as long due to the fast talking overlapping dialogue of the main characters. While the average television show would take seven days to shoot, Moonlighting would take from 12–14 days to complete with episodes and dialogue frequently being written by Caron the same day they were shot. This attention to detail contributed to Moonlighting as {{being one of the}} most expensive television shows being produced at the time. Where most episodes would cost around $900,000 to produce, Moonlighting was running nearly double that. [...] The season 2 episode [...] "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice" [...] could have been filmed much more cheaply by being shot in color and then decolorized, but Caron insisted on the authentic look of black-and-white film which took 16 days to shoot, bringing the cost of the episode to the then-unheard-of sum of two million dollars. Caron often defended his filming practices in the name of giving the audience what they wanted and producing a quality product. He used the following analogy to illustrate the point, [...] "The thinking in television which makes no damn sense to me, is that a half hour of television costs X, and an hour of television costs Y, no matter what that television is, <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as an insane hypothesis. The parallel is, you're hungry, whether you go to McDonald's or whether you go to '21,' it should cost the same; they both fill your stomach. It's nonsense." ...|$|E
