40|$|In this work, wave type of {{interfacial}} instabilities occurring {{during the}} coextrusion process {{have been investigated}} by using different <b>feedblock</b> geometries and polymers. It {{has been found that}} the onset of interfacial instabilities can be captured by the quantification of the stretching discontinuity occurring on the interface between different polymers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a case study}} dealing {{with the development of}} a three-layer product on a <b>feedblock</b> coextrusion system. The problems or phenomena that occurred during the product development experiments are explained via flow simulation and the rheological properties of the materials used. The results of the study are compared with real film samples produced during the development...|$|E
