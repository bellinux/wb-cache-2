His family called him “Schani,” derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> “Gianni,” a nickname.|$|E

The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E

5|$|A {{creative}} offensive playmaker {{renowned for}} his vision, technique, and goalscoring ability, Totti {{is considered to}} be one of the greatest Italian players of all time, one of the most talented players of his generation, and Roma's greatest ever player.

Totti is the fifth-highest scoring Italian in all competitions, with 316 goals.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{remained}} aloof <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> conflict, however. Over {{the spring}} and summer of 307AD, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil; now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308AD, he raided the territory of the Bructeri, and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium (Cologne). In 310AD, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people, and strengthened his power base in the West. Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–308AD, but soon fell out with his son. In early 308AD, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.|$|E

5|$|HMS Greyhound was a G-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the 1930s. Greyhound participated in the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940, the Dunkirk evacuation in May and the Battle of Dakar in September before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in November. The ship generally escorted the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they protected convoys against attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> Fleet. She sank two Italian submarines while escorting convoys herself in early 1941. Greyhound was sunk by German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers north-west of Crete on 22 May 1941 as she escorted the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet attempting to intercept the German sea-borne invasion forces destined for Crete.|$|E
5|$|HMS Griffin (H31) was a G-class destroyer, {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s.

She generally escorted larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they protected convoys against attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> Fleet. Griffin took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 and the evacuations of Greece and Crete in April–May 1941. In June she took part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign and was escorting convoys and the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet until she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in March 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E
25|$|Many {{industrial}} investments {{were done}} by <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> in <b>the</b> area of Asmara and Massawa, but {{the beginning of}} World War II stopped the blossoming industrialization of Eritrea. When the British army conquered Eritrea <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> in spring 1941, most of the infrastructure and the industrial areas were extremely damaged.|$|R

5|$|In the Byzantine {{period the}} {{evolution}} of the port is halted due to the frequent invasions by the migratory people, the trade was fading and the traders were looking for other more secure markets like Venice or Genoa but many constructions in the port maintain the name genovese in the memory of the merchants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> city. After a brief period when the port was under Romanian rule, the Dobruja region was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. In 1857, the Turkish authorities leased the port and the Cernavodă–Constanța Railway to the British company Danube and Black Sea Railway and Kustendge Harbour Company Ltd.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{cumulative}} 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn. In 2001, Boeing dropped {{plans for a}} longer-range model, the 767-400ERX, {{in favor of the}} proposed Sonic Cruiser, a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 767. The following year, Boeing announced the KC-767 Tanker Transport, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER. Launched with an order in October 2002 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo. The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003. In May 2003, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging KC-135 tankers. The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal, resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including Philip Condit, the company's chief executive officer, and chief financial officer Michael Sears. The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.|$|E
5|$|Maynard Solomon summarises the Italian {{journeys}} {{as a great}} triumph, but {{suggests that}} from Leopold's standpoint they also incorporated a great failure. The Mozarts had certainly profited financially, and Wolfgang had developed artistically, into a recognised composer. Although the Mozarts' reception had not been uniformly cordial—they had been cold-shouldered by the Neapolitan court and the Prince of Thurn and Taxis had snubbed them—the Italians had generally responded with enthusiasm. Wolfgang had been received and knighted by the Pope; he had been granted membership in leading philharmonic societies and had studied with Italy's greatest music scholar, Giovanni Martini. Above all, he had been accepted as a practitioner of Italian opera by a leading opera house, completing three commissions that resulted in acclaimed performances. Other compositions resulted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> experience, including a full-scale oratorio, several symphonies, string quartets, and numerous minor works.|$|E

After <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> capitulation, <b>the</b> Germans recovered the former Yugoslav torpedo boat T7 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> and handed it over to the RMNDH under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came under the influence of the Yugoslav Partisans, and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened. Two more former Yugoslav vessels were captured <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> and handed over to the RMNDH by the Germans; the light cruiser Dalmacija (renamed Zniam), and the Malinska-class mining tender Mosor. Croatian crews also served on German-operated vessels, for example twenty Croats served aboard the minelayer Kiebitz, ex-Italian auxiliary cruiser Ramb III.|$|R
