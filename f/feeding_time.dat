5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not <b>feeding</b> <b>time.</b> Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E
5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon <b>feeding</b> <b>time.</b> About three to ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top of}} a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the quake, and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the quake. During the quake, some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and stared at the walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the quake.|$|E

40|$|We {{present data}} on feeding {{patterns}} in Avahi laniger and compare these data to temporal variations in leaf chemistry. Because A. laniger {{is one of}} the smallest folivorous primates and has a monogastric stomach, we hypothesized that this lemur would dis-play behavioural adaptations to a leaf-based diet by scheduling <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> when leaves were of highest quality. Data were collected from May to August 2004 at the Va-toharanana site in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. A. laniger fed during diff er-ent time periods despite leaf carbohydrate and protein concentrations exhibiting little variation throughout the night. Although tannin concentrations exhibited temporal fl uctuations, they did not covary with A. laniger <b>feeding</b> <b>times.</b> We suggest that A. laniger <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> cannot be explained entirely by variations in leaf chemistry.

40|$|Sixty growing rabbits {{of mixed}} breeds and sexes {{were used for}} 10 wk in a 4 x 3 {{factorial}} experimental design to test for the effect of different <b>feed</b> access <b>times</b> (2, 4, 6 and 24 h) and different restriction durations (2, 4 and 6 wk) on the performance, haematological parameters and cost benefits of growing rabbits. Data obtained were subject to a 2 �way analysis of variance. Results showed significantly higher (p 0. 05) across the <b>feed</b> access <b>time</b> and restriction duration. White blood cell was higher in growing rabbits on 2 -h <b>feed</b> access <b>time</b> for 6 -wk duration of restriction while all other parameters measured for haematology were not significantly affected by the <b>feed</b> access <b>time</b> and restriction duration.

25|$|Like all fish, {{goldfish}} do {{not like}} to be petted. In fact, touching a goldfish can endanger its health, because it can cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed, exposing the fish’s skin to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites. However, goldfish respond to people by surfacing at <b>feeding</b> <b>time,</b> and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers. The reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care. The lifespan of goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years.|$|E

500|$|The silky sifaka's diet {{is similar}} to that of other eastern {{rainforest}} sifakas, consisting primarily of leaves (folivory) and seeds (seed predation). [...] It is highly varied and includes many plant species. [...] A two-month study from the mid-2000s showed that the silky sifaka can feed on as many as 76species of plant from 42families. [...] Its favorites included primarily tree species, but also some lianas. [...] The most prominent plant families in the diet were Moraceae (20.30%), Fabaceae (12.87%), Myrtaceae (12.65%), Clusiaceae (10.13%) and Apocynaceae (9.49%). [...] In the study, feeding upon these four plant families took up as much as 37.06% of the total <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> for the silky sifaka: 16.09% on the fruit of Pachytrophe dimepate, 8.43% on the seeds of Senna spp., 6.52% on the young leaves of Plectaneia thouarsii, and 6.02% on the fruit of Eugenia spp. [...] In sum, folivory accounted for 52% of the <b>feeding</b> <b>time,</b> while fruit-eating accounted for 34%, and seed predation made up 11%. The consumption of flowers, as well as soil (geophagy), was rarely observed in this study. [...] Prior to this, preliminary studies had reported that folivory accounted for 75% of the diet, while fruits and 15% was seed predation, 7% was flower consumption, and bark and soil made up the remainder.|$|E

2500|$|Velvet worms are ambush predators, hunting only by night, and {{are able}} to capture animals at least their own size, {{although}} it may take almost all of their slime-secreting capacity to capture a large prey item. They feed on almost any small invertebrates, including woodlice (Isopoda), termites (Isoptera), crickets (Gryllidae), book/bark lice (Psocoptera), cockroaches (Blattidae), millipedes and centipedes (Myriapoda), spiders (Araneae), various worms, and even large snails (Gastropoda). Depending on their size, they eat on average every one to four weeks. They are considered to be ecologically equivalent to centipedes (Chilopoda). The most energetically favourable prey are two-fifths the size of the hunting onychophoran. Ninety percent of the time involved in eating prey is spent ingesting it; re-ingestion of the slime used to trap the insect is performed while the onychophoran locates a suitable place to puncture the prey, and this phase accounts for around 8% of the <b>feeding</b> <b>time,</b> with the remaining time evenly split between examining, squirting, and injecting the prey. [...] In some cases, chunks of the prey item are bitten off and swallowed; undigestable components take around 18 hours to pass through the digestive tract. Onychophora probably do not primarily use vision to detect their prey; although their tiny eyes do have a good image-forming capacity, their forward vision is obscured by their antennae; their nocturnal habit also limits the utility of eyesight. Air currents, formed by prey motion, are thought to be the primary mode of locating prey; the role of scent, if any, is unclear. Because it takes so long to ingest a prey item, hunting mainly happens around dusk; the onychophorans will abandon their prey at sunrise. This predatory way of life is probably a consequence of the velvet worm's need to remain moist. Due to the continual risk of desiccation, often only a few hours per day are available for finding food. This leads to a strong selection for a low cost-benefit ratio, which cannot be achieved with a herbivorous diet.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{interference}} competition have shown an asymmetric effect on intake rate of foragers on clumped resources, with only subordinate individuals suffering. However, the food distributions {{in these studies}} were uniform or highly clumped, whereas in many field situations, food aggregation is intermediate. Here we investigated whether food distribution (i. e., uniform, slightly clumped, and highly clumped) affects the behavioral response of mallards foraging alone or competing with another. Although {{the amount of food}} was the same in all distributions, the mallards reached higher intake rates, visited fewer patches, and showed longer average <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> in the highly clumped distribution. Competing mallards had lower intake rates on the slightly clumped than on the uniform or highly clumped food distributions. Subordinates generally visited more patches and had shorter <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> per patch, but their intake rates were not significantly lower than those of dominants. Therefore, we propose that subordinates do not necessarily suffer from interference competition in terms of intake rate, but do suffer higher search costs. In addition, although dominants had significantly higher average <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> on the best quality patches of the highly clumped food distribution, such an effect was not found in the slightly clumped distribution. These findings indicate that in environments where food is aggregated to a lesser extent, monopolization is not the best strategy for dominants. Our results suggest that interference experiments should use food distributions that resemble the natural situation animals are faced with in the field. ...|$|R
