40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} <b>energy</b> <b>balanced</b> data collection in wireless sensor networks, aiming to <b>balance</b> <b>energy</b> consumption among all sensor nodes during the data propagation process. <b>Energy</b> <b>balanced</b> data collection can potentially save energy consumption and prolong network lifetime, and hence, it has many practical implications for sensor network design and deployment. The traditional hop-by-hop transmission model allows a sensor node to propagate its packets in a hop-by-hop manner toward the sink, resulting in poor <b>energy</b> <b>balancing</b> for the entire network. To address the problem, we apply a slice-based energy model, and divide the problem into inter-slice and intra-slice <b>energy</b> <b>balancing</b> problems. We then propose a probability-based strategy named inter-slice mixed transmission protocol and an intra-slice forwarding technique to address each of the problems. We propose an energy-balanced transmission protocol by combining both techniques to achieve total <b>energy</b> <b>balancing.</b> In addition, we study the condition of switching between inter-slice transmission and intra-slice transmission, and the limitation of hops in an intra-slice transmission. Through our extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed protocols achieve <b>energy</b> <b>balancing,</b> prolong network lifespan, and decrease network delay, compared with the hop-by-hop transmission and a cluster-based routing protocol under various parameter settings...|$|R
40|$|Energy aware routing {{protocols}} {{can be classified}} into energy saver and energy manager. Energy saver protocols decrease energy consumption totally. Most of them {{try to find the}} shortest path between source and destination to reduce energy consumption. But <b>energy</b> manager protocols <b>balance</b> <b>energy</b> consumption in network to avoid network partitioning. Finding best route only based on <b>energy</b> <b>balancing</b> consideration may lead to long path with high delay and decreases network lifetime. On the other hand, finding best route only with the shortest distance consideration may lead to network partitioning. This paper improves SEER [1] routing protocol.

5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E
5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E
40|$|Many energy-aware routing {{protocols}} {{have been proposed}} for wireless sensor networks. Most of them are only energy savers and do not take care about <b>energy</b> <b>balancing.</b> The <b>energy</b> saver protocols try to decrease the energy consumption of the network as a whole; however the <b>energy</b> manager protocols <b>balance</b> the <b>energy</b> consumption in the network to avoid network partitioning. This means that energy saver protocols are not necessarily <b>energy</b> <b>balancing</b> and vice versa. However, the lifetime of wireless sensor network is strictly depending on energy consumption; therefore, energy management is an essential task to be considered. This paper proposes an energy aware routing protocol, named FEAR, which considers <b>energy</b> <b>balancing</b> and <b>energy</b> saving. It finds a fair trade-off between <b>energy</b> <b>balancing</b> and <b>energy</b> saving by fuzzy set concept. FEAR routing protocol is simulated and evaluated by Glomosim simulator...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} natural and {{man-made}} mechanisms can affect the global <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> and force changes in Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases are one such mechanism. Greenhouse gases absorb and emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere. As explained above, some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect Earth's <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> over a long period. Radiative forcing quantifies the effect of factors that influence Earth's <b>energy</b> <b>balance,</b> including changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases.
