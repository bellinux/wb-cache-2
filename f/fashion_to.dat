5|$|In December 2016, Sony Pictures {{announced}} a sequel for Spider-Man: Homecoming, {{scheduled to be}} released on July 5, 2019. In June 2017, Feige stated that the film would be titled in a similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> Homecoming, using a subtitle, {{and would not have}} a number in the title.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Station was {{designed}} in a piecemeal <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> help {{address this problem}} for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB) and the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC). It consisted of two adjacent main line railway stations which, {{from the viewpoint of}} passengers, were unconnected.|$|E
5|$|Given that Ganymede is {{completely}} differentiated {{and has a}} metallic core, its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated in a similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> the Earth's: {{as a result of}} conducting material moving in the interior. The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core, if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, 2007, Kariya {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} worth $18 million with the St. Louis Blues. In similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> his signing with Nashville, his arrival in St. Louis marked one of the team's first notable free agent acquisitions in a while (arguably since the team signed Brendan Shanahan in 1991). While the Predators were a team on the rise when he joined them, the Blues had contrastingly missed the playoffs in the previous two seasons.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, 2017, ABC {{announced}} that it planned to air a special broadcast of the film, The Wonderful World of Disney: The Little Mermaid Live, on October 3, 2017. The special was to feature a presentation of the film intertwined with live performances of its songs by guest musicians, in a similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> the Hollywood Bowl concerts. However, on August 3, 2017, it was {{announced that}} the special was postponed due to budget constraints.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, in a similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an exceptional add-on.|$|E

5|$|The GO system {{map shows}} seven train lines (or corridors), all departing from Toronto's Union Station and mostly named {{respectively}} after the outer terminus of train service. Although colours are assigned in a consistent <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> each line in all official media, in colloquial parlance lines are only ever {{referred to by}} their names. Buses are numbered in blocks of 10, corresponding to the nearest train line, with the 40s and 50s reserved for express services along the 407 ETR corridor which {{does not have a}} corresponding train line.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away in a similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track {{was considered to be}} an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was also filmed for the So So Def remix. Directed by Diane Martel, it {{was shot in}} a grainy <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> {{simulate}} a home video. The video features cameo appearances by Dupri, Tariq and Gunz. It begins with scenes of Carey and Dupri at a small in-home gathering, lounging and enjoying each other's company. As the video progresses, the other two featured hip-hop musicians appear at the house, alongside various other guests. They begin to dance to music, while sipping on cocktails by the pool. As the video reaches its climax, scenes of Carey singing in an outdoor garden are shown, while the others join her on the pool deck.|$|E

5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> {{the way that the}} Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E
5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E

5|$|Bangladesh's second innings {{started in}} similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> their first; {{they lost the}} early wicket of Imrul Kayes, and Tamim scored a quick half-century. The latter was dropped three times before being caught by Broad for 52 runs. Junaid and Jahurul both made good starts for Bangladesh, but were out for 34 and 43 respectively, which along with low scores for Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur left Bangladesh on 172 for six {{at the end of}} the fourth day. On the final morning, Shakib batted {{resiliently}} with the lower-order batsmen and narrowly missed out on a century; he was the last man out, stumped attempting to score a boundary to reach the landmark. His batting had helped establish a 208 run lead for Bangladesh, which resulted in England requiring just under four runs per over to reach the total.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> hoardings.|$|E
5|$|Both sides made changes {{going into}} the second ODI; for England, Sidebottom made way as England opted to hand a debut to Tredwell in order to play two spinners, while Bangladesh called on Shuvo and Rubel Hossain, {{dropping}} Siddique and Mortaza. For the second consecutive match, England won the toss and chose to field. The match began in similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> the first ODI, with two quick wickets in the 10th and 11th overs taking Bangladesh from 46/0 to 56/2. However, a third-wicket partnership of 90 between Kayes and Rahim steadied the innings and helped Bangladesh to gain confidence. After Imrul Kayes' dismissal, Rahim increased his scoring-rate {{with a series of}} boundaries to take the score past 200, and was dismissed by a slower ball from Bresnan with the score at 211/5. Some late swinging from the tail saw Bangladesh finish on 260/6, their highest total in ODIs against England.|$|E

5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> knock enemies off-screen, slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most enemies, whom serve to deter Crash's progress. Enemies with deadly topsides cannot be jumped on, while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam. Enemies with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash slides into them.|$|E
5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar <b>fashion</b> <b>to</b> her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E

Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E
