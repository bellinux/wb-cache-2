5000|$|The Suunto Global Needle System {{acquired}} from Recta as the Turbo-20 needle design, the conventional magnetized compass needle is not used. [...] Instead, the compass needle and magnet are built as separate units functioning independently from each other. The needle itself is fixed at its pivot {{by means of}} a <b>double</b> <b>bearing,</b> while the magnet rotates on a pivot with its own jeweled bearing. When attracted by the earth's magnetic field, the separate compass magnet absorbs the vertical force of the magnetic field, so that the inclination angle of the magnetic field (magnetic dip) cannot tilt the needle, and the needle can no longer move in a vertical plane. This provides accurate readings of magnetic north in all magnetic zones of the world. The design also permits accurate readings with the compass tilted at angles of up to 20 degrees, while the use of a strong magnet causes the needle to settle extremely quickly, facilitating fast and accurate bearing/course measurements. This allows a user to obtain fairly accurate compass bearings even when moving, such as when hiking or traveling in a canoe.|$|E

The drive train is an important component in realizing reliable and robust wind turbines. This paper investigates a geared wind turbine. In this type a gearbox is used to convert the low rotor speed to the required high generator speed. In the market several solutions are available to constrain the gearbox in the nacelle. The used configuration significantly determines the gearbox response to rotor loads and the transmission of gearbox vibrations to the turbine. This paper investigates the effectivity of three configurations: the three point mounting, the <b>double</b> <b>bearing</b> configuration and the hydraulic damper system. The fexible multibody modeling technique can be used to accurately characterize gearbox dynamics.

The double row {{angular contact ball bearing}} supports combined axial and radial loads, provides high shaft stiffness and limits {{the movement of}} the pump impeller, shaft, and seal. Recent studies, tests, and analysis of <b>double</b> row ball <b>bearings</b> operating in various conditions have both confirmed and contradicted some long held opinions, regarding the application of these bearings in centrifugal pumps. The studies indicate the Conrad type (e. g., without filling slot) double row angular contact ball bearings operate at lower temperatures than the maximum capacity failing slot type <b>double</b> row <b>bearings</b> at 3, 600 rpm rotational speed. These lower operating temperatures result in longer bearing and lubricant life and greater pump reliability.
