40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the usefulness of monitoring streams in Hawaii for FRNA coliphages as a reliable indicator of sewage contamination. This study was undertaken as a result of our previous findings that monitoring streams in Hawaii for traditional <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria (faecal coliform, Escherichia coli, enterococci) was not useful in determining when streams are contaminated with sewage, because environmental (soil) sources rather than sewage accounted for the high concentrations of faecal bacteria in streams. Two perennial streams, sewage and soil samples were monitored for traditional <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria (faecal coliform, E. coli, enterococci) and FRNA coliphages. The results showed that sewage treatment processes and disinfection drastically reduced the concentrations of traditional <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria but FRNA coliphages were still present in significant concentrations in the treated sewage effluents. These results indicate that monitoring sewage effluents and environmental waters for only traditional <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria may not be adequately protective of human health effects.

This paper focuses on the relationships between land use and <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> organism concentrations in surface waters within this very large drainage basin (1583 km 2) containing some extensive urban areas. A geographical information system comprising readily available digital elevation, remotely sensed land cover and digital map data was used to generate the land use variables for subcatchments draining to 41 locations across the study area. Presumptive concentrations of coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci (colony forming unit (cfu) 100 ml? 1) were measured at each location on at least 20 occasions over a 44 -day period within the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme targeted hydrograph events. Hydrometric records were used to allocate results as either base flow or high flow. At each site, geometric mean <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> organism concentrations were significantly elevated at high flow compared to base flow.

Sponsorship: European Union Interreg IIIBAs {{the requirements of}} the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the US Clean Water Act (USCWA) for the maintenance of microbiological water quality in ?protected areas? highlight, there is a growing recognition that integrated management of point and diffuse sources of microbial pollution is essential. New information on catchment microbial dynamics and, in particular, the sources of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria found in bathing and shellfish harvesting waters is a pre-requisite for the design of any ?programme of measures? at the drainage basin scale to secure and maintain compliance with existing and new health-based microbiological standards. This paper reports on a catchment-scale microbial source tracking (MST) study in the Leven Estuary drainage basin, northwest England, an area for which quantitative <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> source apportionment empirical data and land use information were also collected. Since previous MST studies have been based on laboratory trials using ?manufactured? samples or analyses of spot environmental samples without the contextual microbial flux data (under high and low flow conditions) and source information, such background data are needed to evaluate the utility of MST in USCWA total maximum daily load (TMDL) assessments or WFD ?Programmes of Measures?. Thus, the operational utility of MST remains in some doubt. The results of this investigation, using genotyping of Bacteroidetes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and male-specific ribonucleic acid coliphage (F + RNA coliphage) using hybridisation, suggest some discrimination is possible between livestock- and human-derived <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> concentrations but, in inter-grade areas, {{the degree to which the}} tracer picture reflected the land use pattern and probable <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> loading were less distinct.

Campylobacters show a strong seasonality. They are generally absent {{in the summer}} months but are consistently present in the winter. The main Campylobacter species isolated were C. lari and urease-positive thermophilic campylobacters (UPTC), {{both of which are}} associated with avian hosts. C. jejuni and C. coli and Salmonella were not isolated from the sediments. Faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci were isolated throughout the year with no obvious seasonal trends in their numbers. Higher numbers were found at Morecambe North and South than at Heysham.

In this study, the impact of climate change and land-use change on the presence of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria in freshwater was evaluated, {{through the use of a}} recently-developed catchment-scale pathogen model. The River Conwy in Wales has been used as a case-study, because of the large presence of livestock in the catchment and the importance of the shellfish harvesting activities in its estuary. The INCA-Pathogens catchment model has been calibrated through the use of a Monte-Carlo-based technique, based on <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria measurements, and then driven by an ensemble of climate projections obtained from the HadRM 3 -PPE model (Future Flow Climate) plus four land-use scenarios (current land use, managed ecosystem, abandonment and agricultural intensification). The results show that climate change is not expected to have a very large impact on average river flow, although it might alter its seasonality. The abundance of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria is expected to decrease in response to climate change, especially during the summer months, due to reduced precipitation, causing reduced runoff, and increased temperature, which enhances the bacterial die-off processes. Land-use change can also have a potentially large impact on pathogens.

This obvious change in water quality, which was proved by investigations done {{on the basis of the}} European Directive 2000 / 60 /EC framework for Community action in the field of water policy, made people consider using the rivers for recreation or irrigation. In the present study a Central European River was investigated from hygienic perspectives (<b>faecal</b> <b>indicators),</b> and its toxicological status was examined — both of which are parameters which are not included in the Directive 2000 / 60 /EC.

The {{aim of this study}} was to combine and apply several tools to investigate the raw water quality and determine the risk for waterborne infections in a drinking water source for the cities of Mölndal and Gothenburg in Sweden, Lake Rådasjön. To identify the major contamination sources around the lake and their contribution to the faecal contamination at the water intakes of DWTPs, monitoring of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> and pathogens was combined with microbial source tracking and water quality modelling. The microbial source tracking was performed to determine the human or ruminant origin of faecal contamination using host-specific Bacteroidales genetic markers. The decay of these genetic markers in relation to the decay of traditional <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> in water environment was investigated in outdoor microcosm trials performed in different seasons. Using measured concentrations of Bacteroidales genetic markers the pathogen (norovirus and Cryptosporidium) concentrations in faecal contamination sources around the lake were estimated for endemic and epidemic conditions. Afterwards, the fate and transport of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> and pathogens within the lake were simulated using a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and microbiological model, which was calibrated based on the decay data from the microcosm trials. Based on the obtained results a microbial risk assessment of a conventional DWTP was conducted using two different approaches – optimal disinfection practices (ODP) and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The results showed that the on-site sewers were the source that contributed the most to the pathogen concentrations at the water intakes under both endemic and epidemic conditions. The results from both the ODP and QMRA risk assessments indicated that the barrier efficiency against Cryptosporidium and possibly viruses may be too low at a conventional DWTP.

30|$|In many {{unplanned}} {{settlements in}} the metropolis, {{it was observed that}} distribution lines were competing with open drains and waste materials for space. Pipeline leak events provide potential for entry of open drains into the treated water; and permits <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> and microbial pathogens present in the soil and water exterior to enter the distribution system (LeChevallier et al. 2003). However, if the levels of chlorine in treated water pumped from head works are maintained in the distribution lines, it would markedly prevent bacteria regrowth and entry.|$|R
40|$|Giardia and Cryptosporidium are {{the most}} {{frequent}} enteric protozoa causing gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. Intense recreational activity at Portuguese river beaches triggered {{the opportunity for a}} 2 -year seasonal survey of 19 large river basin beaches. A total of 74 samples were collected and processed according to USEPA Method 1623 to detect Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo) cysts. <b>Faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> (thermotolerant/total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci) and physicochemical parameters were also analysed according to the EU Bath Water Directive (BWD). Results pointed to a widespread presence of these protozoa at Portuguese river beaches. The percentage of samples testing positive for Giardia and Cryptosporidium were 85 and 82 % respectively, with no significant differences between wet and dry seasons (p > 0. 05). Although Portuguese river beaches present a very low exposure risk for infection with Giardia and Cryptosporidium (under 10 (- 3)), a few particular cases revealed values over 0. 2 %, and were related to stormy wet events. The correlation between levels of Giardia and thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli and enterococci, was high (r ≥ 0. 87, p < 0. 001), suggesting the need to carry out specific procedures for the detection of Giardia and Cryptosporidium whenever the values of those <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> approach the maximum allowed level of the EU BWD...|$|R
40|$|This project {{assessed}} {{the potential impact}} of untreated sewage release in a near-shore marine environment of Antarctica through the distribution and characterisation of the <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria Enterococcus. Antibiotic resistance and genome sequencing analyses revealed that enterococci resistant to multiple antibiotics closely related to clinical pathogens were introduced to the pristine Antarctic environment by Australia's Davis station...|$|E
30|$|The {{concentrations}} of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria in untreated sewage are 8 log 10 CFU/ 100  mL for TC, 7.48 log 10 CFU/ 100  mL for FC and 6.6 log 10 CFU/ 100  mL for enterococci (Wilén et al. 2012). The conventional treatment processes for sewage (primary and secondary processes) remove 95 – 99 % of most microorganisms (Koivunen et al. 2003). However, their {{numbers in the}} sewage effluent usually remain higher than 4 log 10  CFU/ 100  mL (Luczkiewicz et al. 2010). The stabilization pond was reported to reduce 84 % of total coliform, 96 % of faecal coliform and 89 % of enterococci (Reinosoa et al. 2008). The reduction efficacies of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria by the septic tank and oxidation pond were reported to be 15 and 38 % for FC and 11 and 16 % for FS, respectively (Samhan et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the levels of some physico-chemical parameters as well as faecal pollution in the Mooi River system as a function of a changed environment. It also investigated occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in this river system. Eight sites along the Mooi River system were selected and monitored monthly for 1 year. Three samples per site were collected from the pre-determined sites along the Mooi River system from the Klerkskraal Dam to the North (site 1) and several points along Mooi River passing through Potchefstroom to points on the southern side of Potchefstroom before Mooi River enters the Vaal River. These water samples were subjected to physico-chemical analyses and <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacterial levels were determined. Faecal coliforms to enteroccoci levels were used to determine the ratio between these groups. Results indicated seasonal and locational variation in most of the physico-chemical parameters and faecal indicators studied. Rainfall was an important factor which strongly influenced the characteristics of these parameters. Also temperature, pH and rainfall influenced the elevated levels of the microbiological indicators observed. High levels of the <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria were observed in the Potchefstroom urban area when compared to upstream and downstream river segments. Similar observation were made for antibiotic resistant indicator bacteria. Results of faecal coliform to enteroccoci ratio suggested that non-human sources contributed greater towards faecal pollution. Furthermore, an urban-rural gradient was recognized in terms of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria levels an...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} the circulation of the viruses and to determine a correlation between <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> and viruses. Raw wastewater and effluent samples were collected from three wastewater treatment plants, during three sampling periods, and analysed, using cultural and molecular methods, to determine bacteria and virus presence. The results show a removal of bacterial indicators, but a limited reduction of the phages. The viral analysis displays the circulation of cultivable enteroviruses and differences in the seasonal-geographical distribution. Hepatitis A virus was found with only two genotypes: IA-IB. Rotavirus was present in 11. 11 %, 24. 14 %, 2. 78 % of the samples in the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd sampling periods; Astrovirus in 33. 33 %, 6. 9 %, 25 %; Adenovirus in 7. 41 %, 3. 45 %, 2. 78 %; Norovirus in 7. 41 %, 10. 34 %, 5. 56 % respectively. Adenovirus was never identified in plants B and C as Rotavirus in plant C. The presence of <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> was not predictive of the enteric virus presence, whereas a different circulation of Enteroviruses {{was found in the}} wastewater treatment plants. The study shows the importance and the usefulness of molecular methods to evaluate the virus circulation and the genetic variability of Enteroviruses...|$|R
30|$|The {{data were}} {{statistically}} analysed using the IBM SPSS Software (v. 22) and Microsoft Excel 2010. The bacterial counts {{of the river}} water and riverbed sediment samples were assessed for differences by using a two-way ANOVA with a 95 % confidence interval. Spearman’s rank correlation (a non-parametric test of correlation) was used to analyse differences or correlations in the datasets for <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> between water and sediment samples. A Student’s t {{test was used to}} investigate any statistically significant differences between the mean values of the microbial loads.|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of waterborne cryptosporidiosis affecting 27 persons, diagnosed stool positive, occurred in Ayrshire in April 1988. Twenty-one in 27 confirmed cases required {{some form of}} fluid replacement therapy. Local general practitioners indicated a two- to fivefold increase in diarrhoeal disease during the outbreak, and following enquiries made by Environmental Health Officers {{it became apparent that}} many hundreds of people had suffered a diarrhoeal illness at that time. Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in the treated chlorinated water supply system, in the absence of <b>faecal</b> bacterial <b>indicators.</b> Oocyst contamination of a break-pressure tank containing final water for distribution was the cause of this waterborne outbreak. An irregular seepage of oocyst-containing water, which increased during heavy rains, was the cause of the break-pressure tank contamination, rather than a failure of the water-treatment processes. The waterborne route should be considered when clusters of cryptosporidiosis-associated with potable water occur. Waterborne cryptosporidiosis can occur in the absence of other <b>faecal</b> <b>indicators</b> of contamination...|$|R
