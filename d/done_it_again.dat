500|$|In 2007 Bob Green {{counted the}} {{campaign}} and its aftermath as factors in strengthening his faith. The breakdown of the marriage he attributed on the pressures put on Bryant, and blamed gays and lesbians for his emotional devastation after the divorce: [...] "Their goal was to put (Bryant) out of business and destroy her career. And that's what they did. It's unfair." [...] However, Green {{said he would not}} have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> if he had to: [...] "It just wasn't worth it... The trauma, the battling we all got caught up in. I don't want to ever go back to that." ...|$|E

500|$|Later that year, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that the September 18 show in Honolulu {{would be the last}} performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Reznor told the newspaper [...] "at this point, I want to switch things around a bit. [...] Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> [...] I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. [...] I don't want it to go stale". [...] In the same article, Reznor also admitted that [...] "the idea of five guys playing loud music [...] two hours ... has got to change once finances come into play, especially performing in markets outside of the mainland U.S. I want to whittle things down".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on March 29, 1910 and was met with some positive reviews. The film was known to have an alternate or working title of The Liar and the Thief, which is credited by Bowers and appears in an index in the Moving Picture World. Another reference for the film instead shortens the name to <b>Done</b> <b>it</b> <b>Again.</b> Two reviews for the film would appear in Moving Picture World, with the first praising the release and using a testimonial by Ray Norton to support {{that it is a}} good comedy. The second review was more nuanced and descriptive by highlighting the original plot and stating, [...] "The acting is sympathetic - one almost wants to say vigorous, and the photographer has performed his part satisfactorily. The combination of these elements has contributed {{to the success of the}} picture." ...|$|E
500|$|Edge {{compared}} the game favorably to System Shock {{due to its}} balanced combination of action and strategy, stating that {{in just two years}} Looking Glass [...] "has metamorphosed from one of the industry's secret technology powerhouses to a hugely respected developer in its own right." [...] John Payne of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depending on your point of view, Terra Nova is either a stripped-down Mechwarrior or a souped-up Doom." [...] However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as [...] "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be [...] "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game [...] "requires more practice than action fans are used to" [...] but provides [...] "a nice payoff". Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with Terra Nova". The magazine considered the game to be [...] "an all around stunning effort".|$|E

500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E
