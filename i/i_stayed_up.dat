[...] The Breeders re-recorded [...] "Son of Three" [...] in July 2002 for its release as Title TKs third single; this version is faster than the album track, and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year. The lyrics of both [...] "Son of Three" [...] and [...] "The She" [...] suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, [...] "Put on a Side", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's [...] "voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain," [...] as she repeats twelve words {{over the course of the}} song: [...] "Better I better <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> / Better mono, put on a side." ...|$|E
500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him. <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{they went}} on talking, but of what Lennan no longer knew, lost in this sudden feeling of sick fear. In the {{presence}} of these 'English Grundys,' so superior to all vulgar sensations, he could not give vent to his alarm; already they viewed him as unsound for having fainted. Then he grasped that there had begun all round him a sort of luxurious speculation on what might have happened to the Stormers. The descent was very nasty; there was a particularly bad traverse. The 'Grundy,' whose collar was not now crumpled, said he did not believe in women climbing. It was one of the signs of the times that he most deplored. The mother of the young 'Grundys' countered him at once: In practice she agreed that they were out of place, but theoretically she could not see why they should not climb. An American standing near threw all into confusion by saying he guessed that it might be liable to develop their understandings. Lennan made for the front door. The moon had just come up over in the South, and exactly under it he could see their mountain. What visions he had then! He saw her lying dead, saw himself climbing down in the moonlight and raising her still-living, but half-frozen, form from some perilous ledge. Even that was almost better than this actuality of not knowing where she was, or what had happened. People passed out into the moonlight, looking curiously at his set face staring so fixedly. One or two asked him if he were anxious, and he answered: [...] "Oh no, thanks!" [...] Soon {{there would have to be}} a search party. How soon? He would, he must be, of it! They should not stop him this time. And suddenly he thought: Ah, it is all because <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> there this afternoon talking to that girl, all because I forgot HER! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> <b>up</b> here, like an air-bubble in the sky, I shall {{certainly}} go crazy. I suppose there's {{nothing but}} water {{to look at}} down below, but if I could only sight a ship, or even see a fish jump, it would do me no end of good." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head both lightly and mournfully enough at his not understanding. [...] "Not even for people in Veronese costumes. I mean that the {{positive}} beauty is that one needn't go down. I don't move in fact," [...] she added--"now. I've not been out, you know. <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> <b>up.</b> That's how you happily found me." ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{was in my}} flat in {{the suburbs}} of London before I was a {{professional}} musician, and Id been up for thirty-six hours. I was actually listening to another inductees record, the Clashs first album. When I first put it on, I thought it was just terrible. Then I played it again and I liked it better. By the end, <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> all night listening to it on headphones, and I thought it was great. Then I wrote [...] "Watching the Detectives".|$|E

Later Mac Davis recalled to Billboard: [...] "They had asked for a song about looking back over the years, and oddly enough, I had to write it in one night. <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> all night at Billy Strange's house in Los Angeles. He had a little office set up in his garage. I wrote it right there." ...|$|E

[...] After the race, Myers said, [...] "It was a phenomenal race. <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> there and led a little bit, then stayed behind just to see how much I could be behind and still catch up. Everyone's bikes were really fast but mine was too.|$|E
5000|$|Amadee Wohlschlaeger had {{the longest}} tenure as Weatherbird artist, {{just short of}} fifty years. Wohlschlaeger was also the Post-Dispatch sports page {{cartoonist}} and drew for the Sporting News. Wohlschlaeger recalled that when barely out of his teens [...] "I was doing sports art for the Post and when Carlisle died, <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> all night and drew 12 Weatherbirds so I could {{put them on the}} feature editor's desk the next morning. The feature editor grabbed me later in the day and said, 'You've got the job'". Wohlschlaeger retired in 1981 and lived until age 102, in 2014.|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>staying</b> <b>up</b> late at night, {{listening to}} CHEZ 106 from Ottawa.

5000|$|On [...] "Mr Damage", John Brewster {{explained}} that it was [...] "in part inspired by a head banger at the infamous Comb and Cutter at Blacktown called Brain Damage. Fans used {{to come to the}} shows with banners saying, 'Mr Damage, please play it!'" [...] Rick Brewster added: [...] "After meeting 'Brain Damage' backstage I drove home to Ashfield singing a verse melody all the way. <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> all night and finished the first draft of 'Mr Damage' some time in the afternoon. I then played it to the guys in the dressing room that night at the Stagedoor Tavern." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dave Cockrum {{originally}} created Nightcrawler {{while he}} was in the United States Navy, stationed at Guam. He recounted: [...] "I sat up one night in the middle of a typhoon because it was too noisy to sleep, so <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> and thought up this character. Originally, Nightcrawler was a demon from Hell who had flubbed a mission, and rather than go back and face punishment, he decided to stay up here in the human world. He was supposed to be the sidekick of another superhero character that I had created named The Intruder." [...] At this point Nightcrawler wore trunks instead of a full costume, but otherwise looked identical to his final version.|$|E
5000|$|The {{night before}} I {{was going to}} record at Folsom prison, I got to the motel and a preacher friend of mine brought me a tape of a song called [...] "Greystone Chapel." [...] He said a convict had written it about the chapel at Folsom. I listened to it one time and I said, [...] "I've {{got to do this}} in the show tomorrow." [...] So <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> and learned it, and the next day the preacher had him in the front row. I announced, [...] "This song was written by Glen Sherley." [...] It was a terrible, terrible thing to point him out among all those cons, but I didn't think about that then. Everybody just had a fit, {{screaming}} and carrying on.|$|E
6000|$|His voice grew hoarse. [...] "After that it didn't seem {{to matter}} what became of me, but I kept the trail somehow, and found <b>I</b> couldn't <b>stay</b> <b>up</b> yonder. That's why I started south {{with some of them}} before the summer came. Now I'm here--talking English--talking with white men--but it doesn't seem the same as it should have been--without the others." ...|$|R

50|$|So hang on I did, and whistled {{down the}} next {{mountain}} {{and got to}} the last climb and <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> with Bernard Hinault; there was one rider, a Belgian rider, Lucien Van Impe rode away, an excellent climber, he rode away and so we came {{in a couple of}} minutes later, but I had enough time from some good days previously, that I climbed into the yellow jersey, and I had no idea of what the sort of yellow jersey represented, because I mean there's so much history to it, and for me it was just like, 'Oh yes, great, I don't have to wash my old jersey tonight, you know, get a new one'. But really, you're sort of at the highest level of the sport.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, {{he spoke about}} his {{favorite}} song on the album, saying: [...] "Man...to keep it real, without sounding wack, all of them. But you know, each for different reasons. There’s a song on there called “Black Bentley,” that I can say I’m proud of for writing. I’m proud that <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> until 6:30 {{in the morning to}} do it to get it all out. It’s probably my favorite song I’ve ever written. It might not be my favorite Dom Kennedy song ever, but it’s definitely the best song I’ve ever written. A lot of it is more like poetry to melodic and hard Rap beats. And I feel like, in the context of that, the writing on there is great. It’s great quality writing. I would compare it more to a book, an audio book, than an album, you know? It’s more traditional. I’m talking more about my life than the Rap you’re hearing nowadays." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{weather has}} knocked me out. My cold came back, got worse and [...] worse. Three days ago I had a chill {{that lasted for}} fifteen minutes. [...] I shook like a leaf. It left me, and then I got a terrible pain in [...] my side. But I didn't give in, which I feel now was a mistake. <b>I</b> [...] <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> till <b>I</b> dropped.|$|R
6000|$|He {{spread his}} hands out, and his voice grew hoarse.

Was not that fine reasoning? Dear, dear, if they only thought of it, all the world would do like me; and you would let your flowers alone, just as <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> <b>up</b> here in the mountains.' Suddenly he broke off sharp. 'By the Lord!' he cried.

5000|$|In January 1991, an {{interview}} in the Philadelphia Magazine spoke of how Fiorillo came to work with Prince, where Fiorillo spoke {{about the idea of}} the album's sound and Prince, stating [...] "I wanted to take the Philadelphia soul sound and add it to the Minneapolis funk and make myself a really soulful little white girl. So last year I called up David Z. at Prince's Paisley Park Studios in Minneapolis and said I wanted to record there. One day I came back from the bathroom and Prince was sitting there. He looked up and, [...] "You're a good singer. Why don't you go in there and sing for me?" [...] I was always taught to be confident. So I went in and started singing. He said, [...] "Do you write?" [...] I said, [...] "Yeah." [...] He said, [...] "Go home and write some lyrics and we'll work on them tomorrow." [...] Then he walked out. <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> until 4am writing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Interviewed by Placebo's Brian Molko for Les Inrockuptibles magazine, Smith {{said that}} Trey Parker and Matt Stone sent him the script, but {{deliberately}} left some portions blank [...] "to keep the surprise. They didn't {{want anybody to}} know, they wanted to shock. When I saw myself, I found it surrealistic." [...] In another interview set up by Entertainment Weekly, Smith described the process to Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy: [...] <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> all night and went into this radio station and recorded my words down a phone line. I {{had no idea what}} it was all about. I had one of them {{on the other end of}} the line directing me, saying, [...] "Please sound more like Robert Smith. Come on!" [...] About six months later I saw it and I was completely thrown by what they had done with it. [...] He told Wentz that the [...] "Disintegration is the best album ever!" [...] scene was [...] "one of my greatest moments in life".|$|E
5000|$|Nicky Forster was {{appointed}} caretaker manager of League One side Brentford in February 2011 and named Warburton as first team coach. Warburton had previously worked with Brentford owner Matthew Benham on the NextGen Series {{and explained that}} he [...] "got {{a call from the}} owner at 1:30 in the morning, asking if I would come in to assist Nicky. I didn't know a lot about Brentford or know any of the players, so <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> {{for the rest of the}} night looking at player profiles". Following a successful interim period, Forster was given the role on a permanent basis until the end of the 2010-11 season. Warburton assisted Forster until the end of the season. After the departure of Rösler to Championship side Wigan Athletic on 7 December 2013, assistant manager Alan Kernaghan took charge of the team for that day's 3-2 FA Cup second round defeat away to Carlisle United. Warburton was included as part of the coaching team, alongside first team coach Peter Farrell.|$|E
