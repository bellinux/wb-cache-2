50|$|The Searle {{research}} group found the two appropriately substituted aromatic rings must reside on adjacent positions about the central ring for adequate COX-2 inhibition. Various modifications {{can be made}} to the 1,5-diarylpyrazole moiety to deduce the structure-activity relationship of celecoxib. A para-sulfamoylphenyl at position 1 of the pyrazole was found to have a higher potency for COX-2 selective inhibition than a para-methoxyphenyl (see structures 1 and 2, below). In addition, a 4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl or 4-sulfamoylphenyl is known to be necessary for COX-2 inhibition. For instance, replacing either of these entities with a -SO2NHCH3 substituent diminishes COX-2 inhibitory activity as noted with a very high inhibitory concentration-50 (see structures 3 - 5). At the 3-position of the pyrazole, a trifluoromethyl or difluoromethyl provides superior selectivity and potency compared to a <b>fluoromethyl</b> or methyl substitution (see structures 6 - 9).|$|E

The involvement of caspases in these processes can be demonstrated by their irreversible inhibition with <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketone and chloromethyl ketone derivatives of peptides resembling the cleavage site of known caspase substrates. These inhibitors irreversibly alkylate the cysteine residue in the active site of caspases. In this study we show that a biotinylated <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketone peptide inhibitor of caspases (z-VAD. fmk) also efficiently affinity-labeled cathepsin B and cathepsin H.

40|$|Ab initio" {{calculations}} {{have been}} carried out on the states of BH(X^ 1 Σ^+, a^ 3 ∏, A^ 1 ∏, and ^ 3 Σ^+) which dissociate to the ground states of B and H. The application of the G 1 method (which is a special case of the GI method) was extended to handle five- and six-electron systems, and this method along with SOGI, CI and the GVB method was used to investigate the BH states. The effect of restricting the orbitals of the wave- function to be basis functions for the irreducible representations of the spatial symmetry group leads to noncontinuous changes in the orbitals as a function of internuclear distance. And further it is noted that the removal of this restriction on the atomic wavefunction of boron leads to simple predictions of the forms of the wavefunctions, geometries of the molecules and characteristics of the potential curves for the BH_N molecules. On the basis of this the potential curves for the a^ 3 ∏ and A^ 1 ∏ states are correctly predicted to have humps and the ^ 2 A_ 1 and ^ 2 B_ 1 states of BH_ 2 are predicted to be bent and linear, respectively. Molecular properties for many of these wavefunctions have been calculated and correlated with changes in the orbitals as a function of internuclear distance. Gas phase reactions and properties of <b>fluoromethyl</b> cations have been investigated using the techniques of ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy (icr). Fluoride transfer reactions between substituted methyl cations are observed to be rapid and permit the determination of relative fluoride ion affinities, defined as the negative of the enthalpy change for the reactionCH_NF^_(3 -N) + F^- → CH_NF_(4 -N). By combining available ther-mochemical data and our experimental results the following order for the fluoride affinities of the methyl cations is constructed: CF^+_ 3 (256. 3 kcal/mole) > CH^+_ 3 (252. 0 kcal/mole) > CH_ 2 F^+ (243. 6 kcal mole) > CF_ 2 H^+ (242. 8 kcal/mole). A measurement of the equilibrium constant for the reaction (CF_ 2 H^+ + CH_ 2 F_ 2 ↔ CH_ 2 F^+ + CF_ 3 H) between the latter two ions has permitted their relative fluoride ion affinities to be accurately determined. Fluoride ion affinities are a means of determining carbonium ion stabilities. With the general goal of understanding reactions involving electrophillic addition to π-systems the reactions of the <b>fluoromethyl</b> cations with ethylene, ethylene-d_ 4 and benzene-d_ 6 were investigated. The important process in each case involves addition of the <b>fluoromethyl</b> cation to the substrate to form a chemically activated intermediate which decomposes with loss of HF or H_ 2. Rate constants for the reactions of the <b>fluoromethyl</b> cations with ethylene were determined using icr trapped ion techniques. In conjunction with ion ejection double resonance, product distributions for the reactions involving ethylene-d_ 4 and benzene-d_ 6 have been determined. Only {{in the case of the}} reactions of <b>fluoromethyl</b> cations with benzene-d_ 6 is the possibility of a distinctive reaction mechanism revealed from the isotopic product distributions. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two main areas: the {{synthesis}} of novel anti-metabolites of 1 -deoxy- D-xyulose- 5 -phosphate (DXP) and the stereoelectronics which influence the conformation of <b>fluoromethyl</b> groups in organic compounds. DXP, a sugar phosphate, has recently been established as a key biosynthetic intermediate {{to a number of}} plant and bacterial co-enzymes and vitamins. Chapter 1 describes the role of DXP in three biosynthetic pathways; {{in the formation of the}} isoprenoid building block isopentenyl pyrophosphate, and the vitamins B(_ 1) and B(_ 6). A new strategy to novel antibiotics and / or herbicides is proposed by the inhibition of DXP metabolism. A description of phosphonates as hydrolytically stable phosphate mimics is presented, including fluorine phosphonates that enable fine tuning of these mimics. Synthetic targets are designed as inhibitors of the DXP reductoisomerase catalysed reaction from DXP to 2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol- 4 -phosphate (MEP). In Chapter 2 the successful synthesis of the CH(_ 2) phosphonate analogues of DXP and MEP is described. The DXP analogue was initially approached via the diethyl phosphonate ester, however it proved necessary in the end to prepare the dibenzyl ester followed by hydrogenation. Synthesis towards the CF 2, and the a-fluorinated ketone, phosphonate analogues of DXP were incomplete due to low yields. Further syntheses is described towards the reduced form of the CH 2 phosphonate analogue of DXP, and to a compound related to fosmidomycin. Chapter 3 describes fluorine's stereoelectronic influence in determining the conformations of <b>fluoromethyl</b> containing organic compounds through n/π-σ* conjugation and gauche effects.

40|$|The major {{proteolytic}} {{activity of}} Trypanosoma cruzi is a cathepsin L-like cysteine protease expressed in {{all stages of}} the parasite. As an initial step in identifying possible functions of this enzyme in {{the life cycle of}} T. cruzi, and examining its potential as a target for rational drug design, two <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketone-derivatized cysteine protease inhibitors were studied for their effects on T. cruzi infection of mammalian cells. Both inhibitors are irreversible substrate analogues with high specificity for cysteine proteases and minimal toxicity to mammalian cells. While micromolar concentrations of inhibitors had some effect on replication of all parasite stages, the most dramatic arrest of parasite replication occurred at the transformation of trypomastigote to amastigote, and also from amastigote to trypomastigote. It is therefore proposed that the enzyme functions in intracellular protein degradation in some stages of T. cruzi, but also in remodeling of the parasite during transformation between stages. Concentrations of inhibitors necessary to interrupt the parasite life cycle had no observable toxicity to macrophages, fibroblasts or epithelial cells in culture. Differential susceptibility of T. cruzi versus host cysteine proteases to <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketone protease inhibitors suggests that inhibition of the T. cruzi cysteine protease is a potential lead for new chemotherapy of Chagas' disease...|$|E

40|$|Background: Chondrocyte {{death has}} been linked to injury-induced {{oxidative}} damage, suggesting that antioxidants could substantially improve viability. However, since reactive oxygen species play roles in normal physiology, there are concerns that antioxidants may have deleterious side effects. To address these issues, we studied the effects of N-acetylcysteine, a potent free radical scavenger, on chondrocyte viability and cartilage proteoglycan content in an in vitro cartilage injury model. We hypothesized that treatment with N-acetylcysteine soon after an impact injury would have significant chondrocyte-sparing effects and would prevent injury-induced proteoglycan losses. Methods: Bovine osteochondral explants were subjected to a single impact load with use of a drop-tower device. Chondrocyte viability was measured at multiple time points post-impact with use of fluorescent probes and confocal microscopy. Forty-eight hours after impact, the effects on viability of immediate post-impact treatment with N-acetylcysteine were compared with the effects of the caspase inhibitor N-CBZ-Val-Ala-Asp(O-Me) <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketone and those of the cell-membrane-stabilizing surfactant poloxamer 188. The effect of N-acetylcysteine on proteoglycan content was determined at seven and fourteen days post-impact. Results: Chondrocyte viability declined sharply within an hour and reached a steady state within six to twelve hours after impact.

This chromatin cleavage in rat liver nuclei was further characterised and studies described in this thesis showed that the DNA was initially cleaved into 700 kbp, 200 - 250 kbp and 30 - 50 kbp fragments via a Mg 2 + dependent process which was potentiated by Ca 2 +. Further investigations of the DNA cleavage processes were carried out in primary hepatocytes using TGF- 1 to induce apoptosis. The studies showed {{for the first time}} that treatment of hepatocytes with TGF- 1 resulted in multi-step DNA cleavage as seen in rat nuclei.

During apoptosis there was a time dependent increase in CPP 32 -like proteolytic activity in lysates isolated from TGF- 1 treated hepatocytes, which was detected with the fluorogenic assay using Z-DEVD-amino-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (Z-DEVD.

40|$|Two {{irreversible}} calpain inhibitors, benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) -Leu-Leu-Tyr-Ch 2 F and Cbz-Leu-Leu-Tyr-CHN 2, {{were shown}} earlier [Anagli, Hagmann and Shaw (1991) Biochem. J. 274, 497 - 502] to penetrate intact platelets and to inactivate calpain. This permitted {{an evaluation of}} certain functions attributed to this proteinase. For example, in platelets pretreated with these inhibitors, talin and actin-binding protein were protected from subsequent degradation when the Ca 2 + level was raised. On the other hand, additional properties of stimulated platelets attributed to calpain remained unaffected by this treatment, and such hypotheses may be dismissed. Radioiodinated inhibitors permitted confirmation of the labelling of calpain by the procedures used. Although Cbz-Leu-Leu-Tyr-CHN 2 is more effective in vitro than the corresponding <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketone, we now show that the latter penetrates more readily. These two inhibitors, and two additional ones, t-butyloxycarbonyl-Val-Lys(Cbz) -Leu-Tyr- CHN 2 and Cbz-Leu-Tyr-CH 2 F, have been radioiodinated to permit a comparison of their intracellular labelling patterns in activated platelets. Calpain is the major target of all four inhibitors. Although they are closely related peptide structures, variations {{with respect to the}} labelling of additional proteins were observed. These were minor {{in the case of the}} peptidyl diazomethyl ketones, but were major in the case of the <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketones. However, in contrast to calpain, this labelling was neither time-dependent nor Ca(2 +) -dependent.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The fluoroacetate-producing {{bacterium}} Strepto-myces cattleya {{has evolved}} a fluoroacetyl-CoA thioesterase (FlK) that exhibits a remarkably {{high level of}} discrimination for its cognate substrate compared to the cellularly abundant analogue acetyl-CoA, which differs only {{by the absence of}} the fluorine substitution. A major determinant of FlK specificity derives from its ability {{to take advantage of the}} unique properties of fluorine to enhance the reaction rate, allowing fluorine discrimination under physiological conditions where both substrates are likely to be present at saturating concentrations. Using a combination of pH−rate profiles, pre-steady-state kinetic experiments, and Taft analysis of wild-type and mutant FlKs with a set of substrate analogues, we explore the role of fluorine in controlling the enzyme acylation and deacylation steps. Further analysis of chiral (R) - and (S) -[2 H 1]fluoroacetyl-CoA substrates demonstrates that a kinetic isotope effect (1. 7 ± 0. 2) is observed for only the (R) - 2 H 1 isomer, indicating that deacylation requires recognition of the prochiral <b>fluoromethyl</b> group to position the α-carbon for proton abstraction. Taken together, the selectivity for the fluoroacetyl-CoA substrate appears to rely not only on the enhanced polarization provided by the electronegative fluorine substitution but also on molecular recognition o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{death of}} poliovirus-infected cells may occur in two forms: {{canonical}} cytopathic effect (CPE) (on productive infections) or apoptosis (when the viral reproduction is hindered by certain drugs {{or some other}} restrictive conditions). Morphological manifestations of the CPE and apoptosis, being distinct, share some traits (e. g., chromatin condensation and nuclear deformation). It was shown here that a permeable caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe) <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketone (zVAD. fmk), prevented {{the development of the}} poliovirus-induced apoptosis on abortive infection. The apoptotic pathway could be dissected by an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), which prevented the cleavage of DNA to oligonucleosome-sized pieces and nuclear fragmentation but did not suppress cellular shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing, and partial chromatin condensation. These results demonstrate that caspase activation is involved in the execution phase of the viral apoptosis and suggest that a nuclear subset of the apoptotic program is under a separate control, involving a TPCK-sensitive event. Neither zVAD. fmk nor TPCK, at the concentrations affecting the apoptotic response, exerted appreciable influence on the virus growth or cellular pathological changes on productive infection, indicating that the pathways leading to the poliovirus-evoked CPE and apoptosis are different...|$|E
40|$|DNA-dependent {{protein kinase}} (DNA-PK) is a DNA repair enzyme {{composed}} of a DNA-binding component called Ku 70 / 80 and a catalytic subunit called DNA-PKcs. Many investigators have utilized DNA-PKcs-deficient cells and cell lines derived from severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mice to study DNA repair and apoptosis. However, {{little is known about}} the CNS of these mice. This study was carried out using primary neuronal cultures derived from the cerebral hemispheres of new-born wild-type and scid mice to investigate the effects of loss of DNA-PK function on neuronal maturation and survival. Purified neuronal cultures developed comparably in terms of neurite formation and expression of neuronal markers, but scid cultures showed a significant increase in the percentage of dying cells. Furthermore, when apoptosis was induced by staurosporine, scid neurons died more rapidly and in higher numbers. Apoptotic scid neurons exhibited nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and caspase- 3 activation, but treatment with the general caspase inhibitor, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl) <b>fluoromethyl</b> ketone did not prevent staurosporine-induced apoptosis. We conclude that a DNA-PK deficiency in cultured scid neurons may cause an accumulation of DNA damage and increased susceptibility to caspase-independent forms of programmed cell death...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} for new {{antifungal}} compounds and to explore structure activity relationships, a series of 24 chiral benzyl amine type antifungals was synthesised and characterised. In vitro testing against the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans revealed that several derivatives had MIC 50 values {{similar to that of}} the commercial drug Butenafine. All of these contained a bulky group in the para position of the benzyl fragment. Eighteen compounds were also tested for activity against the dermatophytes Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum. Of these (R) -N-(4 -tert-butylbenzyl) -N-methyl- 1 -(naphthalen- 1 -yl) ethanamine (MIC 50 : 0. 06 μg/mL) and a para-benzyloxy substituted derivative (MIC 50 : 0. 125 μg/mL) possessed high activity. Testing of derivatives with a stereocentre at the benzylic carbon, revealed that (S) -stereochemistry was required for potency: a MIC 50 value of 1 μg/mL was obtained for (S) - 1 -(4 -tert-butylphenyl) -N-methyl-N-(naphthalen- 1 -ylmethyl) ethanamine. Preparation of the corresponding <b>fluoromethyl</b> compound was achieved employing lipase B from Candida antarctica as catalyst in the key step. A low antifungal activity was observed for the fluorinated derivative indicating the importance of the amine basicity for the antifungal potency of these compounds...|$|E
