25|$|Furtwängler resumed conducting. On April 25, 1935, he {{returned}} to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On May 3, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that he ripped the wooden panelling off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that he keep his baton in his right hand all the time. When he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: he sat down and the concert went on.|$|E

We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, but I think it is great." ...|$|E
500|$|On 16 December 1784, St. James's Chronicle stated Hawkins and Boswell {{were both}} writing biographies. However, Thomas Tyers {{published}} before them when his A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson, the first postmortem biographical work on Johnson {{but not a}} full-length biography, ran in the December 1784 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine. This did not deter Hawkins and by 21 December 1784, he began advertising his [...] "authentick" [...] life of Johnson. This provoked an anonymous articles in St. James's Chronicle started attacking Hawkins: [...] "It {{is evident from the}} Conduct of the late Dr. Johnson, that he designed Mr. Boswell for the sole Writer of his Life. Why else did he furnish him with such Materials for it as were withheld from every other Friend ... Little indeed did he suppose that a Person whom he had made one of his Executors would have instantly claimed the Office of his Biographer. Still less could he <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> this Self-Appointment would have been precipitately confirmed by the Booksellers." ...|$|E

500|$|On 8 December, the Austro-Hungarians {{fell back}} against Užice and Valjevo. The Serbs {{anticipated}} that their opponents would entrench themselves {{and attempt to}} block the Serbian Army's advance, but the Austro-Hungarians had failed to construct any defensive networks and, as such, were {{in no position to}} block the Serbian offensive. The Austro-Hungarians had ensured that Valjevo's defenses were fortified and had laid down artillery plans for the town's defense, but their lack of prior preparation meant that the hills surrounding the town were devoid of any significant defensive positions. The Serbs exploited this weakness by manoeuvring around the hills and encircling the Austro-Hungarians, suffering minimal casualties. The Serbian 3rd Army then broke through the defenses of the 6th Army at Mount Suvobor and stormed Valjevo. In Niš, the Bulgarian ambassador to Serbia reported: [...] "The most improbable news from the battleground, sweet to the Serb ear, has been going around since this morning." [...] He wrote that, in the last three to four days, the Serbian Army had captured one Austro-Hungarian General, 49 officers and more than 20,000 troops, as well as 40 cannon and [...] "huge quantities of war matériel". By 9 December, the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive around Belgrade lost its momentum and the Austro-Hungarians began to retreat back towards the city centre. One Austro-Hungarian soldier wrote: [...] "We could not <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the Serbs were on our heels, after all we had recently been victorious." [...] On 10 December, the Serbian Army captured the lower reaches of the Drina, forcing the majority of surviving Austro-Hungarian troops to flee across the river. They did not stop until they had crossed the Sava and the Danube and entered the Banat. Very few Austro-Hungarian soldiers made it back into Bosnia.|$|E
500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, a Canadian {{electronic}} music group Skinny Puppy sent the Defense Intelligence Agency a symbolic bill of $666,000, after {{finding out that}} the Agency had used their music in Guantanamo during enhanced interrogation sessions. Their music was originally heard at GTMO by a guard, {{who happened to be}} a fan of Skinny Puppy and could not understand how his favorite music was being used in such a manner: [...] " [...] songs are characterized by ... lyrics that call out corporate wrongdoing.

Even so, I would never <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> Skinny Puppy's music would, or could, be used for enhanced interrogation". The officer conducting interrogation sessions allegedly stated that the Canadian group's songs—which are [...] "characterized by relentless drumbeats, panicked, convulsive riffs, synth samples"—were very effective for enhanced interrogation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{research}} paper [...] "Gentileschi, padre e figlia" [...] (1916) by Roberto Longhi, an important Italian critic, described Artemisia as [...] "the {{only woman in}} Italy who ever knew about painting, coloring, doughing, and other fundamentals". Longhi also wrote of Judith Slaying Holofernes: [...] "There are about fifty-seven works by Artemisia Gentileschi and 94% (forty-nine works) feature women as protagonists or equal to men". These include her works of Jael and Sisera, Judith and her Maidservant, and Esther. These characters intentionally lacked the stereotypical 'feminine' traits—sensitivity, timidness, and weakness—and were courageous, rebellious, and powerful personalities. A nineteenth-century personality commented on Artemisia's Magdalene stating, [...] "no one would <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> it {{was the work of}} a woman. The brush work was bold and certain, and {{there was no sign of}} timidness". In Ward Bissell's view, she was well aware of how women and female artists were viewed by men, therefore explaining why her works in the beginning of her career were so bold and defiant.|$|E

2500|$|Most historians {{take the}} view that Hitler was the {{opposite}} of a pragmatist: his overriding obsession was hatred of the Jews, and he showed {{on a number of}} occasions that he was willing to risk losing the war to achieve their destruction. There is no [...] "smoking gun" [...] in the form of a document which shows Hitler ordering the Final Solution. Hitler did not have a bureaucratic mind and many of his most important instructions were given orally. There is ample documentary evidence however, that Hitler desired to eradicate Jewry and that the order to do originated from him, including the authorization for mass deportations of the Jews to the east beginning in October 1941. He cannot <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> these hundreds of thousands of Jews would be housed, clothed, and fed by the authorities of the Government-General, and in fact Hans Frank frequently complained that he could not cope with the influx.|$|E
2500|$|In Russia, Savchenko {{is portrayed}} {{extremely}} negatively in the media; according to BBC News [...] "Crude, {{and at times}} sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko". The Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Savchenko {{is known as a}} [...] "killing machine in a skirt", and Tvoy Den called her [...] "Satan's daughter". Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee. In March 2016, Russian composer Vladimir Nazarov wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that [...] "not even in my worst nightmare could I <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> I would have to ask you not to kill a woman." [...] In March 2016, Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny stated about Savchenko's trial, [...] "However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia". Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko [...] "a trophy prisoner" [...] had miscalculated. He described the trial as such an [...] "obvious stitch-up" [...] you could [...] "see the threads".|$|E

Along with Leeds City Council, {{he called for a}} public inquiry into the deaths at Armley, but the {{incumbent}} Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher rejected the request, {{on the grounds that it}} [...] "would cause needless concern, that it was impossible to discover what had happened at Roberts, and that no one could then <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the dust could have harmed residents." [...] Battle submitted to the House: [...] "I cannot believe that those who owned and ran Roberts can have gone in and out without seeing the dust everywhere on the surrounding streets and pavements. If they knew that their workers within had to be protected from the asbestos dust, how could they have ignored the position of their neighbours who lived with that dust outside? It was not rendered neutral or innocuous as it left their premises. If they knew, why did they knowingly continue to ask not only their employees but local residents for a generation to pay the price with their lives for the profits of continued asbestos production? ...Should not the company be responsible for that deadly legacy? The Armley asbestos tragedy cannot remain private and hidden because it is not yet over." ...|$|E
