Microemulsions of methyl and ethylene glycol esters of <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> developed by Mycogen Corporation (San Diego, CA) were tested for nematicidal activity against root-knot and soybean cyst nematodes. All treamaents were compared to a deionized water control and a microemulsion "blank" (minus active ingredient). Methyl pelargonate reduced gall numbers at concentrations ≥ 0. 8 μl a. i. /liter, and ethylene glycol pelargonate reduced gall numbers at ≥ 6. 4 μl a. i. /liter in a laboratory bioassay of Meloidogyne javanica on roots of tomato seedlings. Microscopic observation of treated M. javanica second-stage juveniles suggested that methyl pelargonate was toxic to nematodes at concentrations as low as 0. 2 μl a. i. /liter. Cysts of Heterodera glycines per gram of root were significantly reduced by weekly soil drenches of methyl pelargonate at 6. 4, 3. 2, and 1. 6 μl a. i. /liter compared to controls in one greenhouse experiment.

Soil drenches with microemulsions of methyl pelargonate at 3. 2 μl a. i. /liter applied weekly, or as two initial applications, were effective as a nematicide for root-knot and soybean cyst nematodes with negligible effects on plant vigor...|$|R

40|$|Sarmentine, 1 -(1 -pyrrolidinyl) -(2 E, 4 E) - 2, 4 -decadien- 1 -one, is {{a natural}} amide {{isolated}} from the fruits of Piper species. The compound {{has a number of}} interesting biological properties, including its broad-spectrum activity on weeds as a contact herbicide. Initial studies highlighted a similarity in response between plants treated with sarmentine and herbicidal soaps such as <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> (nonanoic acid). However, little was known about the mechanism of action leading to the rapid desiccation of foliage treated by sarmentine. In cucumber cotyledon disc-assays, sarmentine induced rapid light-independent loss of membrane integrity at 100 µM or higher concentration, whereas 3 mM <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> was required for a similar effect. Sarmentine was between 10 and 30 times more active than <b>pelargonic</b> <b>acid</b> on wild mustard, velvetleaf, redroot pigweed and crabgrass. Additionally, the potency of 30 µM sarmentine was greatly stimulated by light, suggesting that this natural product may also interfere with photosynthetic processes. This was confirmed by observing a complete inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport at that concentration. Sarmentine also acted as an inhibitor of photosystem II on isolated thylakoid membranes by competing for the binding site of plastoquinone. This can be attributed in part to structural similarities between herbicides like sarmentine and diuron. While this mechanism of action accounts for the light stimulation of the activity of sarmentine, it does not account for its ability to destabilize membranes in darkness. In this respect, sarmentine has some structural similarity to crotonoyl-CoA, the substrate of enoyl-ACP reductase, a key enzyme in the early steps of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis. Inhibitors of this enzyme, such as triclosan, cause rapid loss of membrane integrity in the dark. Sarmentine inhibited the activity of enoyl-ACP reductase, with an I 50 app of 18. 3 µM.

40|$|Aurantiochytrium is an {{important}} docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) producer containing two kinds of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis pathways, that is, the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthase pathway (FAS) for saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis and the polyketide synthase pathway (PKS) for polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis. To understand the regulation mechanism between the two pathways, the impacts of six short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis of Aurantiochytrium sp. SD 116 were studied. All short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> showed {{little effect on the}} cell growth, but some of them significantly affected lipid accumulation and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition. Pentanoic acid and isovaleric acid greatly inhibited the synthesis of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> whereas the polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis was not affected. Analysis of malic enzyme activity, which supplied NADPH for saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> biosynthesis, indicated that the two <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis pathways can utilize different substrates and possess independent sources of NADPH. </p...|$|R

40|$|Two {{strains of}} Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and two strains of Bacteroides fragilis were {{analyzed}} for total <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> total lipid <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> and total bound <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profiles. Extracted lipids and defatted cell residues {{were subjected to}} sequential alkaline and acid methanolyses to distinguish ester- and amide-linked <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in each fraction. In the lipid fractions, all the ester-linked <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were nonhydroxylated, whereas all of the amide-linked <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were hydroxylated. In the nonextractable fractions, both hydroxy and nonhydroxy <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were found in both ester and amide linkage, although hydroxy <b>acids</b> predominated.

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{chemical}} composition for 3 types of animal fats (pork fat, beef tallow and buffalo tallow), following the variation of saturated and unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> proportion during freezing storage was studied. Determination of chemical composition of animal fats {{is important in}} establishing organoleptic and physico-chemical parameters, the variation of them in time, nature and proportion of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> conferring specific characteristics to them. For pork fat was determined the following chemical composition: saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> 48. 32 %, monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> 36. 78 %, polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> 14. 89 %. After 4 months of storage under freezing there was a change in <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> proportion, saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> content increased slightly to 48. 83 %, due to installation of hydrolysis leading to release of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from triglycerides, monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> content decreased to 35. 99 %, and polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> content increased to 15. 18 %. In the case of beef tallow there was an increasing in saturated and monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> content and a decreasing in polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> content. Buffalo tallow presented a higher concentration of saturated and monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> than beef tallow and a lower concentration of polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R
