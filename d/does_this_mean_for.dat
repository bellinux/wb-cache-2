500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E

Because {{their love}} of fighting, their desire for glory, their shame of being branded as dastards, their {{instinct}} to test themselves in terrible trials, their fear of being killed or enslaved by the enemy, their belief that they are defending their hearths and homes, overcome their natural cowardice, and make them willing not only to risk their own lives but to kill everyone who refuses to take that risk. But if war continues too long, {{there comes a time}} when the soldiers, and also the taxpayers who are supporting and munitioning them, reach a condition which they describe as being fed up.

5000|$|Hosking {{noticed that}} {{citizenship}} was [...] "relatively narrowly distributed" [...] and excluded all women, all minors, all slaves, all immigrants, and most colonials, that is, citizens who left their city to start another usually lost their rights from their city-state of origin. Many historians felt this exclusiveness was a weakness in Athenian society, according to Hosking, but {{he noted that}} there were perhaps 50,000 Athenian citizens overall, and that at most, a tenth of these ever took part in an actual assembly at any one time. Hosking argued that if citizenship had been spread more widely, it would have hurt solidarity. Pocock expresses a similar sentiment and noted that citizenship requires a certain distance from the day-to-day drudgery of daily living. Greek males solved this problem to some extent with the subjugation of {{women as well as}} the institution of slavery which freed their schedules so they could participate in the assembly. Pocock asked: for citizenship to happen, was it necessary to prevent free people from becoming [...] "too much involved in the world of things"?

While Webber (2015) estimated labor supply elasticities for individual firms, he did not examine the relationship to gender differences. Other studies examined elasticity and earnings gaps for specific markets but do not include comparisons to other markets (Falch 2010; Ransom and Sims 2010; Depew and Sorensen 2011).

A parcel in a logistic process would no longer be a simple item to be transported from A to B. Instead it exerts direct influence on its own path. Based on the approach of the “Internet of Things”, the parcel is equipped with “intelligence”. By using e.g. RFID-labels, it recognizes its destination within the logistic system by itself. All means of transportation integrated into a logistic process are equipped with RFID-Readers 1 and are thus able to read out the parcel’s label. The information stored on the RFID-label can now be used to control the logistic process. The decision on the exact path of the parcel is no longer made by a central control system or a human being but by the means of transport in cooperation with the parcel.|$|R
