5|$|The {{current crest}} of the club {{is based on the}} {{official}} emblem of the city of Maribor, which is in turn based on a 14th-century seal with minor differences. The badge is <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> of a shield, and shows the former Piramida Castle that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished {{at the end of the}} 18th century. A violet blossom forms the backdrop. Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor, the current badge of the club does not represent a white dove facing downwards to the castle, but an athlete. At the top of the shield the name of the club and the year of its foundation is inscribed. The entire badge uses only two colours, purple and yellow. Previous versions of the crest included the colour white, one of the traditional colours of the club, in the form of a white castle in the centre and a white ball that was on top of the shield. Since May 2012 the official badge includes a yellow star above the crest, which indicates the first ten domestic titles won by the club.|$|E

Lawton soon got his warriors into the saddle; and leaving them {{to the charge of}} Hollister, he rode himself along the line of foot, who, in varied dresses, and imperfectly armed, were <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> that in some degree resembled a martial array. A scornful smile lowered about the lip of the trooper as he guided Roanoke with a skillful hand through the windings of their ranks; and when the word was given to march, he turned the flank of the regiment, and followed close in the rear. The Americans had to descend into a little hollow, and rise a hill on its opposite side, to approach the enemy.|$|E

50|$|The stone head, sculpted {{from local}} {{cretaceous}} limestone has a maximum height of 234mm and width of 174mm. The sculpture was broken into {{at least five}} pieces sometime in antiquity. Four pieces {{have been found in}} fairly good condition. However, the missing fragment or possibly fragments, a right-hand side of the head including upper part of the ear, have not yet been found. The heavily stylized facial features are projected on an almost flat surface surrounded by a braid-like shaped hair. The most prominent are the bulging oval eyes, contoured by a curvilinear eyebrow matching a similarly imposing curvilinear moustache. The mouth is suggested by a mere downward bending line. The ears are not naturalistic but rather represented as lotus buds, a stylistic form representative of La Tène art. The neck is <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> of a torc, a traditional Celtic necklace. A similar torc can be seen on the second-century B.C. sculpture of a Dying Gaul from Pergamon.|$|E

40|$|In {{a broader}} {{sense of the}} word the {{landscape}} park Velika planina includes Velika, Mala and Gojška planina. With its 5, 2 square kilometers it is the biggest highland pasture in Slovenia. However, in a stricter meaning of the word Velika planina as an independent mountain covers 545 hectares, with its highest peak Gradišče, also called Njivice, of 1666 meter height above sea level. Due to its natural and cultural sights, particularly rich pastoral heritage, Velika planina attracts numerous visitors. The first part of my diploma work contains a short introduction of Velika planina {{as well as of the}} highest peak Gradišče with various accesses, either on pathways or by cable car. Then, natural and cultural sights, with the emphasis on those accessible to and interesting for children. Furthermore, I did some research work on shepherd's life on the mountain, some famous tales and mountain songs praising Velika planina, and on tourism. The didactic part of the diploma was carried out within two class periods at the primary school in Stranje. The teaching theme I chose from the curriculum was People in space and time, laying stress on the natural and cultural heritage and trying to show as many things in live as possible to the pupils. Therefore, I invited into the class a shepherd, dressed in traditional shepherd's clothes and showed them 'trniči' as well as different writings for them. ('Trnič' is a special salted cheese, <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> of an onion and decorated with writings – wooden patterns. Each shepherd had his own writing pattern to make it clear who made the cheese.) Each pupil made their own 'trnič' as the 8 th March gift to their mothers. Also, I made crosswords, whereas the pupils drew the visiting shepherd into their notebooks. In the last, empirical part I tried to find out how well the primary school teachers of Kamnik area are familiar with Velika planina and its educational values. ...|$|E

The bipolar plate is formed from a base material. The central area comprises a conducting element. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The bipolar plate for a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer for the electrolysis of water, comprises a central area that has a flow field (3) reciprocally at the surface with channels (4), an end area enclosing the central area, and an inlet (5) and an outlet for the flow field arranged in the end area. The central area is area-wisely formed in an electrically conductive manner so that a current flow is provided from the flow field to the flow field (3 ') present on other side. The bipolar plate is formed from a base material. The central area comprises a conducting element. The bipolar plate is producible by a press fit of the conductive element in the central area and by spray-casting of the conductive element with the base material. The conductive element is sealed by an O-ring (25 a, 25 b) and consists of a contact pin (2) and/or a shaped-metal sheet. The metal sheet is <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> of a repetitive trapezoid or corrugated sheet. The central area or the total bipolar plate is partially formed from a conductive polymer. The bipolar plate contains fillers, corrosion resistant metallic powders or fibers, reinforcement materials, glass fibers, antioxidants and/or pigments. The central area comprises a recess on both sides. The end area comprises a sealing groove for receiving an O-ring sealing on a side, and guiding holes for the admission of threaded rods. A polymer seal directly applied by two-component injection molding is arranged in the end area. USE - Bipolar plate for a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer for the electrolysis of water and/or for a fuel cell (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The bipolar plate can be simply and economically manufactured...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to determine the}} shape of steady state solidification interfaces formed when liquid above its freezing point circulates over a cold surface. The solidification interface, which is at uniform temperature, will <b>form</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> such that the non-uniform energy convected to it is locally balanced by conduction into the solid. The interface shape is of interest relative to the crystal structure formed during solidification; regulating the crystal structure has application in casting naturally strengthened metallic composites. The results also pertain to phase-change energy storage devices, where the solidified configuration and overall heat transfer are needed. The analysis uses a conformal mapping technique to relate the desired interface coordinates to {{the components of the}} temperature gradient at the interface.
