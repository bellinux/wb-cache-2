5|$|Petilius Cerialis took {{a number}} of reconstituted Batavi units with him to Britain, and the Batavi regiments {{continued}} to serve with special distinction in Britain and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} 1st century and beyond. Even as late as 395, units with the Batavi name, although long since composed of recruits from all over the empire, were still classified as elite palatini, e.g. the equites Batavi seniores (cavalry) and auxilium Batavi seniores (infantry).|$|E
5|$|Prometheus was {{considered}} a financial success overall. After a strong start in North America, the film {{failed to meet the}} studio's expectations, but it continued to perform strongly in other territories until the end of its theatrical run. Prometheus earned $126,477,084 (31.4%) in North America and $276,877,385 (68.6%) <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> a worldwide total of $403,354,469, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of 2012, and the 159th highest-grossing film worldwide unadjusted for inflation.|$|E
5|$|After Crawford graduated, Professor A. J. Herbertson {{offered him}} {{a job as a}} junior {{demonstrator}} in the university's geography department. Crawford agreed, and served in the teaching position over the ensuing year. Through Herbertson, Crawford was introduced to the geographer Patrick Geddes. Crawford then decided to focus his attentions on archaeology rather than geography even though few professional positions in the field existed in Britain at the time. Looking <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> archaeological employment, he unsuccessfully applied for a Craven Fellowship and for a post at Bombay Museum.|$|E

5|$|Goldfingers $3 {{million budget}} was recouped in two weeks, and it broke box office records in {{multiple}} {{countries around the}} world. The Guinness Book of World Records went on to list Goldfinger as the fastest grossing film of all time. Demand for the film was so high that the DeMille cinema in New York City had to stay open twenty-four hours a day. The film closed its original box office run having grossed $23 million in the United States and $46 million worldwide. After reissues, the first being as a double feature with Dr. No in 1966, Goldfinger grossed a total of $51,081,062 in the United States and $73,800,000 <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>for</b> a total worldwide gross of $124,900,000.|$|E
5|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in June 1978 and lasted {{for almost a}} year. The {{sessions}} took place at Spirit of Ranachan Studios in Scotland, Lympne Castle in Kent, London's Abbey Road Studios, and Replica Studio – the last of which McCartney built as an exact replica of Abbey Road's Studio Two when the latter became unavailable. Wings returned to Abbey Road in March 1979 to complete the album, before filming a series of promotional videos in Lympne and <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>for</b> what became the Back to the Egg TV special.|$|E
5|$|Testimony was {{presented}} that in October 2002, Mme M'Barek had convinced the peer {{that she was}} pregnant with his child, and as a result, Shaftesbury married her on 5 November 2002. Shaftesbury made out a new will leaving his new wife properties in Ireland and France. Two years later, with no child forthcoming, he began looking <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> affection. When Shaftesbury initiated divorce proceedings, his wife feared losing her valuable inheritance and began to take steps to secure her financial future.|$|E

5|$|The loss of Gibraltar {{led to the}} {{deposition}} of the Nasrid sultan of Granada by his brother Nasr, who quickly reversed policy, abandoned the rebels in Ceuta and gave Algeciras (and thus the claim on Gibraltar) to the Marinids in 1310, {{as part of a}} new treaty, hoping they might recover it. But too busy <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> any entanglements in Spain, the Marinids gave Algeciras back to Granada almost immediately after. The Granadans launched an attempt to recover Gibraltar by themselves in 1315, but without Marinid support, the Second Siege of Gibraltar faltered and failed.|$|E
5|$|The slate {{deposits}} of Wales belong to three geological series: Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian. The Cambrian deposits run south-west from Conwy to near Criccieth; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries {{and in the}} Nantlle Valley. There are smaller outcrops <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>for</b> example on Anglesey. The Ordovician deposits run south-west from Betws-y-Coed to Porthmadog; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of Ordovician slate further south, running from Llangynnog to Aberdyfi, quarried mainly in the Corris area, with a few outcrops in south-west Wales, notably Pembrokeshire. The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the Dee valley and around Machynlleth.|$|E
5|$|Users {{must have}} either found {{decryption}} keys themselves or obtained them <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> most versions of BackupHDDVD to work. The utility reads a text file containing volume or title keys {{and attempts to}} find a set of corresponding keys for the inserted disc. Through a standard AES library, it then decrypts each video file on the disc using the appropriate keys and writes the results to a location specified by the user. Direct file decryption allows the utility's functionality to remain unaffected by device key revocation and its performance unencumbered with AACS overhead.|$|E

5|$|Anthony Anthony {{has been}} {{identified}} as the compiler of the information and the artist behind the illustrations through his signature, which has been compared with holograph letters among the State Papers. Anthony's father was William Anthony (died 1535) a Fleming from Middelburg in Zeeland who migrated to England in 1503. William was a supplier of beer to the army, and Anthony followed in his father's footsteps. He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to the navy. In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the Tower of London, a position he retained nominally until his death. He rose to the rank of overseer of the Ordnance Office, the government body responsible for supplying the armed forces with artillery, and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll. In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower, Calais, Boulogne, and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> life. He continued the work of supplying arms to English forces, and was active in the last month of his life supplying guns for an expedition against Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s {{a series}} of new palaces were {{constructed}} <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> the king's use; these included the more modern Dusit Palace, constructed in 1903, and Phaya Thai Palace in 1909. These other Bangkok residences began to replace the Grand Palace as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court. By 1925 this gradual {{move out of the}} palace was complete. The growth and centralization of the Siamese state also meant that the various government ministries have grown in size and were finally moved out of the Grand Palace to their own premises. Despite this the Grand Palace remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the stage set for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy. The end of the absolute monarchy came in 1932, when a revolution overthrew the ancient system of government and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic National Convention {{opened in}} San Francisco on June 28, 1920, under a shadow cast by Woodrow Wilson, {{who wished to}} be {{nominated}} for a third term. Delegates were convinced Wilson's health would not permit him to serve, and looked <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> a candidate. Former Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo was a major contender, but he was Wilson's son-in-law, and refused to consider a nomination {{so long as the}} president wanted it. Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway, and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. On the 44thballot, the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president, with his running mate Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. As Cox was, when not in politics, a newspaper owner and editor, this placed two Ohio editors against each other for the presidency, and some complained there was no real political choice. Both Cox and Harding were economic conservatives, and were reluctant progressives at best.|$|E

5|$|The {{birds were}} a food and fuel source for early European settlers, {{and are now}} farmed, in Australia and <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>for</b> their meat, oil and leather. Commercial emu farming started in Western Australia around 1970. The {{commercial}} industry {{in the country is}} based on stock bred in captivity, and all states except Tasmania have licensing requirements to protect wild emus. Outside Australia, emus are farmed on a large scale in North America, with about 1million birds in the US, Peru, and China, {{and to a lesser extent}} in some other countries. Emus breed well in captivity, and are kept in large open pens to avoid the leg and digestive problems that arise from inactivity. They are typically fed on grain supplemented by grazing, and are slaughtered at 15 to 18months.|$|E
5|$|With George of Hanover out of {{contention}} {{as a potential}} suitor for Anne, King Charles looked <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> an eligible prince who would be welcomed as a groom by his Protestant subjects but also acceptable to his Catholic ally, Louis XIV of France. The Danes were Protestant allies of the French, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain {{the power of the}} Dutch. A marriage treaty between Anne and Prince George of Denmark, younger brother of King Christian V, and Anne's second cousin once removed, was negotiated by Anne's uncle Laurence Hyde, who had been made Earl of Rochester, and the English Secretary of State for the Northern Department, Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland. Anne's father consented to the marriage eagerly because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, William of Orange, who was naturally unhappy at the match.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} Australian pioneer battalions, it spent the longest {{period of time}} in the {{infantry}} role, spending more days in combat, standing-to and in the line than any of the others. After the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion's strength dwindled as personnel were sent to England and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>for</b> educational courses to prepare them to return to civilian life. The first batch of around 100 personnel left for Australia for demobilisation in February 1919, and the battalion was formally disbanded the following month. During the war, a total of 1,964 men served in the 3rd Pioneer Battalion; this includes the original enlistments and eight batches of reinforcements. Of these, 140 were killed or died of wounds, 19 died from illness or from accident, 208 were gassed, and 619 were wounded in action. Including Peeler's VC, a total of 129 honours and awards were bestowed upon members of the battalion: one VC, four Distinguished Service Orders, 16 Military Crosses, 10 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 73 Military Medals, nine Meritorious Service Medals, and three Mentions in Despatches. In addition, three members of the battalion were invested as Members of the Order of the British Empire and one was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
