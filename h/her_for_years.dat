500|$|Marta Hoelsher of Technorati Media said: [...] "The biggest news {{of season}} two, though, is the {{appearance}} of Donna Mills as Abby Cunningham, the blonde bombshell who wreaks havoc all through the neighborhood. With {{the appearance of}} Abby, things really started to heat up and get interesting. No marriage is off limits when Abby sets her eyes on it. Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough to keep us loving and hating <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Abby's clashes with Karen MacKenzie and Val were legendary, and season two gets things rolling. After a fairly peaceful start to the season, we start to see {{the beginnings of the}} rivalry that defines the show for years: [...] Karen vs. Abby. [...] It's fun watching their early friendship evolve into a bitter rivalry." ...|$|E
500|$|Stone hired a nursemaid to help {{care for}} her daughter, who was in poor health for several years, but she didn't trust her ability to provide proper care when Stone was absent. Stone {{eventually}} withdrew from most public work {{to stay at home}} with her child. [...] She resigned from the Central Committee, which organized the annual women's rights conventions. She began to suffer from self-doubt and a lack of drive in addition to the debilitating headaches that had plagued <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> [...] She made only two public appearances during the Civil War (1861—1865): to attend the founding convention of the Women's Loyal National League and the celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, both in 1863.

500|$|Following {{her second}} year, she gained {{a job as}} a summer {{associate}} with the prominent New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. By her own later evaluation, her performance there was lacking. She did not receive an offer for a full-time position, an experience that she later described as a [...] "kick in the teeth" [...] and one that would bother <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> In her third year, she filed a formal complaint against the established Washington, D.C., law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge for suggesting during a recruiting dinner that she was at Yale only via affirmative action. Sotomayor refused to be interviewed by the firm further and filed her complaint with a faculty–student tribunal, which ruled in her favor. Her action triggered a campus-wide debate, and news of the firm's subsequent December 1978 apology made the Washington Post.|$|E

500|$|While on {{tour for}} her 1990 album, McEntire lost eight {{members of her}} band; (Chris Austin, Kirk Cappello, Joey Cigainero, Paula Kaye Evans, Jim Hammon, Terry Jackson, Anthony Saputo, and Michael Thomas), plus pilot Donald Holmes and {{co-pilot}} Chris Hollinger, when their charter jet plane crashed near San Diego, California, {{in the early morning}} of March 16, 1991. The accident occurred after McEntire's private performance for IBM executives the night before. The first plane was a Hawker Siddeley DH-125-1A/522 charter jet, believed to have taken off around 1:45 AM from the Brown Field Municipal Airport, located near the border of Mexico. After reaching an altitude of about 3,572 feet (1,089 m) above sea level, the [...] aircraft crashed on the side of Otay Mountain, located ten miles east of the airport, while the second plane (carrying her other band members) did not crash. The accident was believed to have occurred due to poor visibility near the mountain, which was not considered [...] "prohibitive" [...] for flying. The news was reported nearly immediately to McEntire and her husband, who were sleeping at a nearby hotel. A spokeswoman for McEntire at the time stated in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "she was very close to all of them. Some of them had been with <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Reba is totally devastated by this. It's like losing part of your family. Right now she just wants to get back to Nashville." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the days}} before May 20, 1988, Laurie Dann {{prepared}} rice cereal snacks and juice boxes poisoned with the diluted arsenic she had stolen in Madison. She mailed them to a former female friend, ex-babysitting clients, her psychiatrist, Russell Dann, and others. In the early morning of May 20, she personally delivered snacks and juice [...] "samples" [...] to other friends, acquaintances, and families for whom she had babysat, {{some of whom had}} not seen <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Other snacks were delivered to Alpha Tau Omega, Psi Upsilon, and Kappa Sigma fraternity houses and Leverone Hall at Northwestern University in Evanston. Notes were attached to some of the deliveries. The drinks were often leaking and the squares unpleasant tasting, so few were actually consumed. In addition, the arsenic was highly diluted so nobody became seriously ill.|$|E
2500|$|Parton was a {{co-owner}} of Sandollar Productions, with Sandy Gallin, her former manager. A film-and-television-production company, it produced the [...] (1989), which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Feature); the television series Babes (1990–91) and Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003); and the feature films Father of the Bride (1991), [...] (1995) Straight Talk (1992) (in which Parton starred), and Sabrina (1995), among other shows. In a 2009 interview, singer Connie Francis revealed that Dolly had been contacting <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> {{in an attempt}} to film the singer's life story. Francis turned down Parton's offers, as she was already in negotiations with singer Gloria Estefan to produce the film, a collaboration now ended.

2500|$|Luce López-Baralt further explores this {{association}} of images, tracing the parallel to a 9th-century Islamic mystic of Baghdad, Abu-l-Hasan al-Nuri (died 907), whose Maqamat al-qulub [...] describes seven castles, one inside the other, {{through which the}} soul travels toward God. After quoting a passage in which Sta. Teresa describes her spontaneous acquaintance with the castle image, López-Baralt infers that Sta. Teresa's acquisition of the Islamic parallel was indirect, probably from a popular allusion that lay dormant within <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> resurfacing later to help her communicate her mystical experiences. Following other similar studies, Catherine Swietlicki took a new but related direction, discussing Saint Teresa's Jewish heritage, and her mysticism as filtered through the mutual presence of three faiths. The Catholic writings of Santa Teresa de Ávila, widely recognized and revered, may accordingly be understood to reflect as well a generality of shared values among the Judaic, Christian, and Islamic faiths during those blessed periods of convivencia in medieval Spain.|$|E
2500|$|She later {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident, and said it had been an overstatement. She went on to say following the incident, [...] "what really hurt was that he was not sensitive to me as a woman and his attempt at reconciliation had come too late" [...] suggesting that his actions were a deliberate attempt at reconciliation or compensation for his lack of sexual interest in Priscilla which had been a source of hurt and discontent for <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Priscilla states in her book [...] "He had mentioned to me before we were married that he {{had never been able to}} make love to a woman who had a child" [...] and she later expressed the personal repercussions of their sexual dysfunction [...] "I am beginning to doubt my own sexuality as a woman. My physical and emotional needs were unfulfilled." [...] After this incident, Priscilla summarized [...] "this was not the gentle, understanding man I grew to love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amelia, called Emmy, is good-natured but {{passive and}} naïve. Not very beautiful, she is {{frequently}} ignored {{by men and}} women but is well-liked by most men who get to know her because of her personality. This popularity is then resented by other women. She begins the work as its heroine ("selected for the very reason that she was the best-natured of all") and marries the dashing George Osborne against his father's wishes, but the narrator is soon forced to admit [...] "she wasn't a heroine" [...] after all as she remains soppily devoted to him despite his neglect of her and his flirtation with Becky. After George dies in the Battle of Waterloo, she brings up little George alone while living with her parents. She is completely dominated by her spendthrift father, who, it is revealed, sells the annuity Jos had provided to finance one of failing investment schemes and by her increasingly peevish mother. Amelia becomes obsessed with her son and the memory of her husband. She ignores William Dobbin, who courts <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> and treats him shabbily until he leaves. Only when Becky shows her George's letter to her is Amelia able to move on, though she informs Becky that she has already written to Dobbin to ask him to come back. She eventually marries Dobbin.|$|E
