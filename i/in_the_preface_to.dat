5|$|On November 29, 1963, Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson {{appointed}} Ford to the Warren Commission, {{a special}} task force {{set up to}} investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin. According to a 1963 FBI memo released in 2008, Ford was {{in contact with the}} FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, Cartha DeLoach, about the panel's activities. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> his book, A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission, Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{also had}} correspondents who {{supplied}} him with material. Albinus, the abbot {{of the monastery}} in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and {{with the assistance of}} Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great's correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission. Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the Historia Ecclesiastica; he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, for information {{about the history of the}} church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey.|$|E
5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} Joan of Arc with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan of Arc {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject of the poem appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines of the poem written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book poem that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{its central}} {{significance}} for the Christian faith, Bible translation tends {{to be subject to}} very stringent demands on quality. These demands focus on two major areas: a) accuracy in meaning and b) ease of understanding. They are reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> many contemporary Scripture translations...|$|R
50|$|Government {{departments}} sent Gowers {{many examples}} of officialese so extreme as to be amusing; a small committee of senior officials formed to help him and comment on his proposals. The colleague on whom Gowers most relied was Llewelyn Wyn Griffith of the Inland Revenue, whose contribution Gowers acknowledged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> Plain Words and its two successors.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} features of Justinian's reign was the recovery of large stretches of land around the Western Mediterranean basin that had slipped out of Imperial control <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5th century. As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the Roman Empire to its ancient boundaries. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> his laws and had them commemorated <b>in</b> art. <b>The</b> re-conquests were <b>in</b> large part carried out by his general Belisarius.|$|R
25|$|Hilaire Belloc {{mentions}} Shiremark Mill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> The Four Men.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{responded to}} criticisms of her prose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> her 1999 book, Gender Trouble.|$|E
25|$|Boileau {{introduced}} the sublime into modern critical discourse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Preface</b> <b>to</b> his translation of Longinus: Traite du Sublime de Longin (1674).|$|E
50|$|Antoniotto {{traveled}} {{frequently to}} England {{and it was}} there that in 1760 he published his book L’arte armonica, written in Italian but translated and published <b>in</b> English. <b>The</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> this book was translated by Samuel Pegge.|$|R
25|$|Looking at the Edwardian ordinal, Dix found {{sufficient}} {{mention of}} <b>the</b> priesthood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> service, the actual formula at the laying on of hands being concerned {{not only with}} the priestly act of forgiving sins but also with administering the sacraments and sufficient mention of intention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ordination rites, to make it impossible to believe that the priesthood was not being conferred and the traditional ministry continued. Nevertheless, he concluded by arguing that, if Anglican authority committed itself to unity schemes that equated Anglican orders with those of Methodists and other Protestants, their action would justify Leo XIII and declare Apostolicae curae to be right.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} poems {{were published}} by Cantarini; they are nearly all occasional: Pi Sefarim (Mouth of Books), festal songs written when {{the teachers of}} the yeshivah decided to include {{the study of the}} treatise of Chullin (Venice, 1669). A poem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a psalm, on the delivery of the community from the hands of the populace August 20, 1684, is printed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pachad Yitzchaq (p.51b), which was formerly read every year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> synagogue on the anniversary of the attack (10 Elul). Other poems are printed in his works ‘Eqeb Rab and ‘Et Qetz (see below), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kebunnat Abraham of Abraham Cohen, and the Ma'aseh Tobiah of Tobias Cohen.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> his {{collection}} of German songs, Lassus states that he had composed Dutch songs. However, no Dutch song has been preserved.|$|E
25|$|Also, a {{compositional}} treatise by Kapsberger, Il Kapsperger della musica, {{was announced}} in 1640 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> Libro quarto d'intavolatura di chitarrone, but is now lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} taken up again by Apollinaire, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> his play Les Mamelles de Tirésias, which was written in 1903 and first {{performed}} in 1917.|$|E
2500|$|Marx {{summarized}} the materialistic {{aspect of his}} theory of history, otherwise known as historical materialism (this term was coined by Engels and popularised by Karl Kautsky and Georgi Plekhanov), <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1859 <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy: ...|$|R
2500|$|Rudolf Steiner, {{referring}} to Hartmann's Critical Establishment of transcendental Realism (Kritische Grundlegung des transzendentalen Realismus, [...] 2nd Edition Berlin, 1875) gave his opinion, [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> his own book Truth and Knowledge (1892), that Hartmann's [...] world-view was [...] "the most significant philosophical work of our time".|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> ironic <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> {{this small}} artist's book, Olson states that his {{convenient}} reference manuals are authoritative {{sources of information}} for modern individuals with the reference habit. This volume consists of a twelve page list of names (people, domestic products, television shows, corporations, etc.) taken from the World Wide Web...|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> all his books, and {{on many of}} his tapes, Miller {{stated that}} {{everything}} that is un-sourced should be considered the teachings of Rabbi Sher, whom he considered his primary rabbi.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} {{expanded}} from an article {{first published in}} the Antioch Review in 1950, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the first edition, Gardner thanks the Review for allowing him to develop the article {{as the starting point}} of his book.|$|E
25|$|The Prophetiæ is in {{some ways}} {{dependent}} on the De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniæ of Gildas. From Gildas and Nennius Geoffrey took the figure of Ambrosius Aurelianus, who figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the prophecies (under a variant name): there is then a confusion made between Ambrosius and Merlin, deliberately done.|$|E
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> ironic <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> {{this small}} artist's book, Olson states that his {{convenient}} reference manuals are authoritative {{sources of information}} for modern individuals with the reference habit.

500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{consist of}} [...] "Strange fits of passion have I known", [...] "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", [...] "I {{travelled}} among unknown men", [...] "Three years she grew in sun and shower", and [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal". Although they {{are presented as}} a series in modern anthologies, Wordsworth did not conceive {{of them as a}} group, nor did he seek to publish <b>the</b> poems <b>in</b> sequence. He described the works as [...] "experimental" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> 1798 and 1800 editions of Lyrical Ballads, and revised the poems significantly—shifting their thematic emphasis—between 1798 and 1799. Only after his death in 1850 did publishers and critics begin to treat the poems as a fixed group; anthologies since have generally presented them as a series.|$|R
40|$|Notes": xviii p. at end. Earlier editions were {{published}} under title: Poems; or under title: Love, Forest flowers, and Sea shells. The Library of Congress describes {{this as the}} " 4 th ed.

Mode of access: Internet...|$|R
25|$|Despite standardization, some nonstandard {{forms are}} {{commonly}} used, especially in handwriting. In older sources, even authoritative ones, variant characters are commonplace. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the Imperial Dictionary, there are 30 variant characters {{which are not}} found in the dictionary itself. A few of these are reproduced at right.|$|E
25|$|Unlike her elder sisters, Anne Brontë did {{not follow}} the Romantic style in her two novels, opting instead for Realism. Many critics, {{including}} Anne's sister Charlotte, considered her depiction of alcoholism and adultery overly graphic and disturbing. In defence, Anne openly stated her writer’s intentions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the second edition of the novel.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> the Groundwork Kant motivates {{the need}} for pure moral {{philosophy}} and makes some preliminary remarks to situate his project and explain his method of investigation. Kant opens the preface with an affirmation of the ancient Greek idea of a threefold division of philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics.|$|E
500|$|After {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, Shaw {{increasingly}} propagated his ideas through the medium of his plays. An early critic, writing in 1904, observed that Shaw's dramas provided [...] "a pleasant means" [...] of proselytising his socialism, adding that [...] "Mr Shaw's views are to be sought especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> his plays". After loosening his ties with <b>the</b> Fabian movement <b>in</b> 1911, Shaw's writings were more personal and often provocative; his response to the furore following the issue of Common Sense About <b>the</b> War <b>in</b> 1914, was to prepare a sequel, More Common Sense About <b>the</b> War. <b>In</b> this, he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders, and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence. On the advice of Beatrice Webb, this pamphlet remained unpublished.|$|R

40|$|Though already famous, wealthy, and {{squarely}} {{established as}} a popular chronicler of the early twentieth century, humorist Ring Lardner’s foray into a serious literary career with Charles Scribner’s Sons Publishing Company is best characterized {{as an act of}} authorial resistance. Rather than evolve into the “serious” author the firm had hoped for, Lardner chose to lampoon himself, authorship, publishing, and serious writers with a series of prefaces written for his Scribner’s titles. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> How to Write Short Stories (with Samples) (1924) and The Love Nest and Other Stories (1926), Lardner resisted overtures to rebrand and remarket himself by reminding the public of his strengths: satire, comedy, and manipulation. The result: pieces as textually nonsensical and arbitrary as many of his writings on the surface, yet carefully constructed to expose the underside of socio-cultural mores, the publishing industry, and the fraternity of “serious” writers he never intended to join...|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> {{the first}} issue of An-Nafa'is, Beidas {{explained}} that he considered novels {{to be one of the}} great pillars of civilisation in the enlightenment of the mind and his aim was to draw readers' attention to the significance of narrative art from the intellectual, social and moral point of view.|$|E
25|$|His observatory, {{instruments}} and books {{were destroyed by}} fire on 26 September 1679. The catastrophe is described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> his Annus climactericus (1685). He promptly repaired the damage enough to enable him to observe the great comet of December 1680. He named the constellation Sextans in memory of these lost instruments.|$|E
25|$|Jordanes says <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> Getica that he {{obtained}} {{them from the}} librarian for three days in order to read them again (relegi). The times and places of these readings have been the concern of many scholars, as this information possibly bears on how much of Getica is based on Cassiodorus.|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt {{also contributed}} three letters to William Cobbett's Weekly Political Register at this time, all scathing critiques of Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population (1798 and later editions). Here he {{replaced}} the dense, abstruse manner of his philosophical {{work with the}} trenchant prose style {{that was to be}} the hallmark of his later essays. Hazlitt's philippic, dismissing Malthus's argument on population limits as sycophantic rhetoric to flatter the rich, since large swathes of uncultivated land lay all round England, has been hailed as [...] "the most substantial, comprehensive, and brilliant of the Romantic ripostes to Malthus". Also in 1807 Hazlitt undertook a compilation of parliamentary speeches, published that year as The Eloquence of <b>the</b> British Senate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> speeches, he began to show a skill he would later develop to perfection, the art of the pithy character sketch. He was able to get more work as a portrait painter as well.|$|R
50|$|Balasubramaniam {{translated}} Manikkavacakar’s Thiruvasagam into English {{and published}} it in 1958, {{which made him}} know widely as Thiruvachakamani. Of the 500 copies that he published, half were sold <b>in</b> South Africa. <b>The</b> <b>preface</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book was writted by the then Home Minister Bhaktavatsalam.|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> {{concluding}} <b>the</b> <b>Preface</b> <b>to</b> La communauté désoeuvrée, Jean-Luc Nancy laments {{the possibility}} (or likelihood) that {{as human beings}} we will soon be deprived of our finite existence, {{the experience of the}} finitude at the essence of our being. The myth of much contemporary discourse, the myth Nancy hopes to interrupt with “literary communism,” is the sublation or overcoming of finitude. In articulating a discourse of “singularity” Nancy disrupts the narrative flow of subjectivity. He does not pr [...] ...|$|R
