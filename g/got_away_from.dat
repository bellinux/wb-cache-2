5|$|Luton {{came close}} to scoring their second goal of the match when Harford <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Caesar and ran towards the left byline. His cross into the penalty area was met by Brian Stein's head, but Lukic made a crucial save, tipping the ball wide. Both {{managers}} brought on substitutes after the hour mark – Mark Stein came on for Harford, while Martin Hayes replaced Groves. The latter substitution worked to Arsenal's advantage, as it brought about their equaliser in the 72nd minute. Davis' free kick delivered in was only half cleared by Foster and amongst the scramble, Hayes drove {{the ball in the}} net. Arsenal continued to pile on pressure, and took the lead three minutes later, when Smith received a pass from Thomas to score.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{arrived at}} Abaco Island on March 1, 1776. The force {{captured}} two sloops owned by Loyalists, {{one of whom}} was Captain Gideon Lowe of Green Turtle Cay, and pressed their owners to serve as pilots. George Dorsett, a local ship's captain, <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Abaco and alerted Browne to the presence of the rebel fleet. The landing force was transferred to the two captured sloops and Providence the next day, and plans were formulated for the assault. While the main fleet held back, the three ships carrying the landing force were to enter the port at daybreak on March 3, and gain control of the town before the alarm could be raised.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{kicked off}} the second half, but it was Chelsea who had the first attack. Chelsea defender Ashley Cole had space in the Liverpool penalty area, but his pass to Juan Mata was intercepted by the Liverpool defence. They {{subsequently}} went on the attack and won a corner, but {{the ball into the}} Chelsea penalty area by Bellamy was cleared. Liverpool continued to attack, but were denied a penalty in the 50th minute, when Gerrard went down in the Chelsea penalty area. The ball was subsequently put back into the Chelsea penalty area by Downing, but Henderson could only head the ball to Chelsea players. Liverpool were made to rue their missed chances, as two minutes later Chelsea had extended their lead. Lampard <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Spearing and passed to Drogba {{on the edge of the}} Liverpool penalty area, he advanced past Liverpool defender Martin Škrtel and shot through the legs of Reina and into the Liverpool goal to make the score 2–0. Liverpool went on the offensive after the Chelsea goal. A Suárez shot was saved by Čech and manager Kenny Dalglish replaced midfielder Spearing with striker Andy Carroll. The substation worked, as in the 64th minute Carroll had scored. Downing won a tackle on the left hand side of the pitch, which resulted in the ball breaking to Carroll. His subsequent shot beat Čech in the Chelsea goal to reduce the deficit to 2–1.|$|E

5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E

25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, moving too fast for the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, but the wind had died away, and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. Three feet of water had washed aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E
25|$|Jérôme Pineau {{concentrated}} {{mainly on}} finishing {{first in the}} climbs, which won him the polka dot jersey. Towards the end, most riders were expecting Jens Voigt {{to try to get}} away on his own, but he never did. Instead, Christophe Laurent twice got away, but was caught by the chasing four. Then, José Luis Arrieta <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the others, but during the last climb of the day, the Cauberg, the peloton passed by him. The most important event of this stage was the loss of Alejandro Valverde, the leader in the ProTour, who broke his collarbone. Erik Dekker and Fred Rodriguez also crashed, and both suffered serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{earthquake}} hit the entire island of Jamaica, {{the citizens of}} Port Royal were at {{a greater risk of}} death due to the perilous sand, falling buildings, and the tsunami that followed. Though the local authorities tried to remove or sink all of the corpses from the water, they were unsuccessful; some simply <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them, while others were trapped in places that were inaccessible. Improper housing, a lack of medicine or clean water, and {{the fact that most of}} the survivors were homeless led to many people dying of malignant fevers. The earthquake and tsunami killed between 1,000 and 3,000 people combined, nearly half the city's population. Disease ran rampant in the next several months, claiming an estimated 2,000 additional lives.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the stage, many riders were trying to break away from the peloton {{to be part of the}} daily group of leaders, but in contrast to most earlier stages, it took a long time before finally a group <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the peloton and was allowed to gain some time and distance. After the only categorized climb of the day, it's Giuseppe Guerini and David López who are just riding a few seconds in front of the peloton, followed by Jérôme Pineau, the holder of the polka dot jersey who successfully tried to enhance his lead in the king of the mountains classification. But the two leaders don't get away and at the first intermediate sprint in Villedieu-lès-Bailleul, new names pass the line first. Most important to remember is Benoit Vaugrenard winning the sprint and therefore taking 6 bonus seconds which move him past Markus Fothen in the classification for best young rider.|$|E
25|$|However, the arguable {{climax of}} the season {{occurred}} during the season's final doubleheader at the Highlanders’ home stadium, Hilltop Park. In order to win the pennant, New York needed to take both games from Boston. With Jack Chesbro, the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, New York {{seemed to have a}} good chance of winning the first game. However, in the top of the ninth inning with the score tied 2–2 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Chesbro allowing Boston's Lou Criger to score the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history. Unfortunately the NL champion New York Giants had previously declined to play any postseason series, fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led to the two leagues immediately turning the World Series into a permanent championship, starting in 1905.|$|E

The first cyclists abandoned after around [...] At 23:00, Garin and Emile Pagie, leading the race, reached the control point in Nevers. Garin expected {{at that point that}} they would finish at 8:00 the next morning. During the night, Garin's main rival, Aucouturier, had stomach cramps, and was unable to finish the stage. Also during that first stage, the first breach of the rules occurred: Jean Fischer had used a car as pacer, which was illegal. Pagie fell down, but got up again; he and Garin kept leading the race during the night. Around 9:00 in the morning, both reached Lyon. Garin <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Pagie, and finished one minute ahead.|$|E
500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one.

[...] The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus, but come back again during the next bridge. As Madonna sings the verse [...] "Oh father I have sinned", the violins change their pitch to a higher one. After the second chorus, there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away. The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E

The Mariners began talking about Humber's dominance in the fifth inning as they sought to break up the perfect game. Humber recorded the final out on a full-count check-swing strikeout of Brendan Ryan. The ball <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> catcher Pierzynski, but home plate umpire Runge ruled that Ryan had failed to check his swing. Ryan took steps toward first base but, when he saw that Pierzynski had successfully gathered the ball and thrown to first, he argued the call with Runge. The FOX Sports broadcast never showed any angle which definitively proved whether Ryan had successfully checked his swing, but many fans and media members felt the call was incorrect. Ryan himself refused to discuss the play after the game and offered nothing but praise for Humber.|$|E

500|$|For the 1884 season, he feasted on {{the upstart}} Union Association's lack of talent, {{pitching}} for the Chicago Browns (which became the Pittsburgh Stogies), {{and for the}} Washington Nationals later in the season.
