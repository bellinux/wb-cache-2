A mercury thermometer should be inserted for 3 to 5 minutes; a <b>digital</b> <b>thermometer</b> should remain inserted until it beeps. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 °C (96.8 to 100.4 °F) and is about 0.5 °C (1 °F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1 °C (2 °F) above axilla (armpit) temperature.|$|E

50|$|Levels {{of stress}} can be measured. One way {{is through the}} use of {{psychological}} testing: The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is used to rate stressful life events, while the DASS contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in blood pressure and galvanic skin response can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels. A <b>digital</b> <b>thermometer</b> can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the fight-or-flight response drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual. This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic.|$|E

50|$|Pork chops are {{suitable}} for roasting, grilling, or frying, {{but there are also}} stuffed pork chop recipes. They can be used boneless or bone-in. Pork chops are usually cut between 1/2 inch and 2 inches thick. Improved breeding techniques for hogs have made it possible to cook pork to a lower temperature, helping the meat to remain juicy, while still being safe to eat. Guidelines have recently been refined to recommend the safe internal pork cooking temperature for pork chops to 145° F. In order to ensure the chop is properly cooked, a <b>digital</b> <b>thermometer</b> should be used to measure the chop at its thickest part avoiding the bone. Once the chop reaches the recommended internal temperature, it can be removed from the heat to rest for approximately three minutes.|$|E

50|$|The {{power of}} {{connotation}} {{is that it}} enables the addresser to more easily consider abstract concepts and to introduce subtlety into the discourse. For example, a <b>digital</b> <b>thermometer</b> produces a numerical value that indicates {{the current state of}} a specific operational parameter. This technology provides an indexical sign of heat (adopting the classification of Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), an indexical sign by real connection between the signifier and the signified). The number is a denotative value, i.e. it speaks only for itself. The doctor, nurse or patient will relate to the number as a visual trope, in this case a metaphor, for the health of the body. Such information adds to other data forming a symptomology for the patient, a summation that takes place at a connotative cognitive level. Hence, the meanings as to health or illness are selected from the connotational framework which the interpreter has constructed through training and experience given that each possible state of well-being is represented by a cluster of symbolic attributes, one of which is the patient's temperature.|$|E
