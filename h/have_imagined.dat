5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E
5|$|We {{could never}} <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> (had we not seen it fall out in experience) {{that a man}} raised up by ourself and {{extraordinarily}} favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour... And therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to do in our name. Whereof fail you not, as you will answer the contrary at your utmost peril.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{achievement of the}} IPP was the introduction to Irish society of a parliamentary constitutional tradition and all that went with it– a fully up and running local government administration with its diverse institutions, which had rooted itself more deeply than anyone could <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> {{into the life of}} the country. The party had above all (in the era prior to 1914) contributed in its prime to the political maturity of the nation and to the transformation of its society.|$|E
25|$|In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the {{first of}} which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim {{situation}} of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy. Asimov, who {{described himself as a}} claustrophile, mentioned that a reader asked him how he could <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> such an existence with no sunlight, and related that it had not struck him until then that living perpetually indoors might be construed as unpleasant.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not {{actually}} all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could <b>have</b> <b>imagined.</b> In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie {{there is only a}} gate opening.|$|E

25|$|With another World War looming, 1939 was the {{beginning}} of a difficult period, not just for Pinchon and other artists, but for the vast majority of the world's nations. Pinchon was deeply saddened by the human folly that would lead to such a turn of events. Neither he nor anyone else could <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> the human loss and destruction that would be unleashed on Rouen. Yet despite the carnage that followed, hope and optimism had not entirely vanished. The 30th Salon des artistes rouennais went ahead as scheduled, with its opening on 19 May 1940; however, due to the gravity of the situation, it was closed two days later. The first bombardment of the city began on June 5, followed by a mass exodus. On June 8 at 10:00p.m. the first German tanks rolled in on la route de Neufchatel, very close to the Pinchon residence.|$|E
25|$|Furtwängler resumed conducting. On April 25, 1935, he {{returned}} to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On May 3, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that he ripped the wooden panelling off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that he keep his baton in his right hand all the time. When he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> that such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: he sat down and the concert went on.|$|E
500|$|After {{success in}} {{domestic}} cricket and promise shown in his Test appearances previously, Key {{was selected as}} part of the squad to play Australia. Despite playing well in a limited overs match against an ACB Chairman's XI; hitting 68, he was not selected to play in the first Test, instead acting as twelfth man. He ended up fielding {{to a greater extent than}} he would <b>have</b> <b>imagined,</b> after Simon Jones ruptured knee ligaments while fielding, and took no further part in the match [...]|$|E

[...] Rebecca Davies from Digital Spy reported the actor had already filmed his final scenes, while TV Week said the way in which Miles leaves the Bay was being kept secret. Miles departed on 23 November 2011.|$|E
500|$|Prince Alfred (22 September 1780 [...] 20 August 1782) was {{a member}} of the British Royal Family as the 14th child and 9th son of King George III and his queen consort Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Alfred became ill after his {{inoculation}} against the smallpox virus; his early death at the age of nearly two, along with the demise of his brother Prince Octavius six months later, was a shock to their parents. In his later bouts of madness King George would <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> conversations with both of his youngest sons.|$|E
500|$|As part of {{promotion}} for {{the video}} games release, Lewis recorded a promotional advert for Square Enix (the video game's developer and publisher) and spoke {{about how she}} was happy to have been approached {{about the use of}} [...] "My Hands" [...] on the trailer and that it had some personal meaning. She said [...] "I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game. I never would <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> 'My Hands' as such a perfect fit for Final Fantasy XIII, but the strong female protagonist struck a chord with me and I can't wait to see Lightning do her thing." ...|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked [...] "How can we tell whether someone <b>has</b> relaxed or <b>imagined</b> something, or just thinks that he or she <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> it?" [...] In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented [...] "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he <b>has</b> <b>imagined</b> something while we know that he has not." ...|$|R

500|$|According to Barrales, {{beyond the}} name, Bonded by Blood {{borrowed}} from Exodus for inspiration everything. [...] "From the guitars being razor-sharp to the drums, the speed. We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> that all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, but I think it is great." ...|$|E
500|$|Pepper {{said that}} he regretted not having {{been invited to the}} Razzies and blamed the film's failure on [...] "a weak script and poor {{production}} values". Writer J. D. Shapiro received his Worst Screenplay award from Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson during a radio program; he commented that Travolta had called the script [...] "the Schindler's List of science fiction". Shapiro also made an appearance to pick up the Worst Picture of the Decade award at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards, giving a speech quoting negative reviews, and thanking both the studio for firing him and Corey Mandell for [...] "rewriting my script in a way I never, ever, ever — could <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> or conceived of myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Garrick's altered {{version of}} the play was very popular, and ran for nearly a century. Not until 1845 did Shakespeare's {{original}} return to the stage in the United States with the sisters Susan and Charlotte Cushman as Juliet and Romeo, respectively, and then in 1847 in Britain with Samuel Phelps at Sadler's Wells Theatre. Cushman adhered to Shakespeare's version, beginning a string of eighty-four performances. Her portrayal of Romeo was considered genius by many. The Times wrote: [...] "For a long time Romeo has been a convention. Miss Cushman's Romeo is a creative, a living, breathing, animated, ardent human being." [...] Queen Victoria wrote in her journal that [...] "no-one would ever <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> she was a woman". Cushman's success broke the Garrick tradition and {{paved the way for}} later performances to return to the original storyline.|$|E

500|$|Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters was {{critical}} of the opening pages to the story, believing that the illustrations in it were among Hergé's worst and stating, [...] "One couldn't <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> a less remarkable debut for a work destined for such greatness". He believed that Tintin was an existentialist [...] "Sartre-esque character" [...] who existed only through his actions, operating simply as a narrative vehicle throughout the book. Where Hergé showed his talent, Peeters thought, was in conveying movement, and in utilising language in a [...] "constantly imaginative" [...] way. He considered the story's [...] "absurdity" [...] to be its best feature, rejecting plausible scenarios in favour of the [...] "joyously bizarre", such as Tintin being frozen solid and then thawing, or Snowy dressing in a tiger skin to scare away a real tiger. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline described the comic writer's image of the Soviet Union as being [...] "a Dantesque vision of poverty, famine, terror, and repression".|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could <b>have</b> <b>imagined.</b> Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Spain's first match during {{qualification}} for the 2010 World Cup {{was against}} Bosnia and Herzegovina where Villa scored the only {{goal of the}} game. He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, I really want to see it on TV. The record is very nice. I would never <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> in years that I would be able to obtain it. I am very proud and I hope I can continue breaking records." ...|$|E
