25|$|Wankel engines {{generally}} {{are able to}} reach much higher <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> than reciprocating engines of similar power output. This {{is due to the}} smoothness inherent in circular motion, and the absence of highly stressed parts such as crankshafts, camshafts or connecting rods. Eccentric shafts do not have the stress related contours of crankshafts. The maximum revolutions of a rotary engine is limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears. Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above 7000 or 8000rpm. Mazda Wankel engines in auto racing are operated above 10,000rpm. In aircraft they are used conservatively, up to 6500 or 7500rpm. However, as gas pressure participates in seal efficiency, racing a Wankel engine at high rpm under no load conditions can destroy the engine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} machine gun of the Austro-Hungarian {{armed forces in}} 1914 was the Schwarzlose gun, which operated on a [...] "delayed blow back" [...] system and was not ideally suited to synchronization. Unlike the French and Italians, who were eventually able to acquire supplies of Vickers guns, the Austrians were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of [...] "Spandaus" [...] from their German allies and were forced to use the Schwarzlose in an application {{for which it was}} not really suited. Although the problem of synchronizing the Schwarzlose was eventually partially solved, it was not until late 1916 that gears were available. Even then, at high <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> Austrian synchronizer gears tended to behave very erratically. Austrian fighters were fitted with large tachometers to ensure that a pilot could check that his [...] "revs" [...] were within the required range before firing his guns, and propeller blades were fitted with an electrical warning system that alerted a pilot if his propeller was being hit. There were never enough gears available, due to a chronic shortage of precision tools; so that production fighters, even the excellent Austrian versions of the Albatros D.III, often had to be sent to the front in an unarmed state, for squadron armourers to fit such guns and gears as could be scrounged, salvaged or improvised.|$|E

3000|$|In this study, strains {{that are}} caused by wood-based panels on {{horizontal}} milling machines and other cutting devices were examined.

The strains that milling machines and planer head with reversible knives suffered were measured by an amperemeter using an experimental mechanism with six different wood-based panels, three different <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speeds (rev/min), and three drive forward speeds (m/min).

As a consequence, the utmost strains observed on machinery during planing were caused by okoume plywood, followed by MDF, OSB, particleboard, blockboard, and poplar plywood in decreasing order of intensity. It was also observed that the spent current values (A) increased during planing in which <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed and drive forward speed are always kept high.
