40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a simple and rapid method for {{monitoring}} bisphenol A (BPA) and its biodegradation in environmental water using a <b>fluorescent</b> molecularly <b>imprinted</b> polymer chemosensor (fMIPcs). A <b>fluorescent</b> molecularly <b>imprinted</b> polymer (fMIP) was first synthesized by precipitation polymerization method using BPA as template, dansyl methacrylate as functional monomer. Then a fMIPcs was constructed by combining the fMIP with a fluorescent microplate reader. The fMIPcs displayed selective, concentration-dependent fluorescence quenching in response to BPA in water even {{in the existence of}} interferences, thereby allowing reliable high through-put quantification of BPA via simple fluorescence measurements. The fMIPcs was able to directly quantify BPA (from 10 to 2000 μgL(- 1)) in different environmental water samples (distilled water, distilled water containing heavy metals and humic acid, tap water, and river water) with high accuracy, and to monitor BPA biodegradation in real-time. Using the fMIPcs, it was possible to achieve fast analytical results with lower limit of detection for BPA (3 μgL(- 1)) from smaller sample volume (250 μL), which are superior to many relevant methods reported in the literature. Moreover, BPA levels and biodegradation rates measured by fMIPcs are comparable to the instrument-based method (HPLC). The fMIPcs developed in this work offers a new solution for simple, rapid, accurate and high through-put BPA quantification, and makes it possible to monitor BPA biodegradation in real time...|$|R

A selection of functional monomers based on different aminoacids and coumarin allowed isolation of polymers with very good rebinding properties and sensitivities. The direct detection of sunitinib in human plasma was successfully demonstrated by fluorescence quenching of the coumarin-based nanogels. The plasma sample simply diluted in DMSO allowed the recovery of various amounts of sunitib, as determined by an averaged calibration curve. The LOD was 400 nM, with within-run variability < 9 %, day to day variability < 5 %, and good accuracy in the recovery of sunitinib from spiked samples...|$|R
40|$|A <b>fluorescent</b> molecularly <b>imprinted</b> {{nanosensor}} {{was obtained}} by grafting imprinted polymer {{onto the surface of}} multi-wall carbon nanotubes and post-imprinting treatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The fluorescence of lysozyme-imprinted polymer (Lys-MIP) was quenched more strongly by Lys than that of nonimprinted polymer (NIP), which indicated that the Lys-MIP could recognize Lys. The resulted imprinted material has the ability to selectively sense a target protein, and an imprinting factor of 3. 34 was achieved. The Lys-MIP also showed selective detection for Lys among other proteins such as cytochrome C (Cyt C), hemoglobin (HB) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) due to the imprinted sites in the Lys-MIP. This approach combines the high selectivity of surface molecular imprinting technology and fluorescence, and converts binding events into detectable signals by monitoring fluorescence spectra. Therefore, it will have further applications for Lys sensing...|$|R

Three formats of the polymer were produced: a traditional bulk monolith ground into particles, a flexible, but highly cross-linked plasticiser-modified free standing membrane, and a hybrid material consisting of particles {{embedded in a}} poly(acrylonitrile) phase inversed film. Within all materials, a clearly defined imprinting effect was observed upon exposure to DNT vapour at room temperature. In all cases, preferential rebinding of DNT to the molecularly imprinted materials (3 – 5 times) over their non-imprinted (NIP) equivalents was evident within < 10 min of contact with the DNT vapour stream. Fluorographic images of the fluorescent polymers showed the DNT binding-induced quenching to be significantly higher in the MIP material than in the non-imprinted control polymer...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> {{polymers}} <b>imprinted</b> {{with various}} N 1 -benzylidene pyridine- 2 -carboxamidrazones were evaluated for their {{recognition of the}} original template and cross-reactivity to similar molecules. Dramatic quenching of fluorescence approaching background levels was observed for most cases where the "empty" MIP was re-exposed to its template. Molecules too large to enter the imprinted cavities gave no reduction of fluorescence. Other compounds were found to quench the fluorescence and are assumed to have entered the imprinted cavities. There is also evidence for partial responses which may give some measure of partial binding. The fluorescence response profiles of substrates containing polycyclic aromatics {{were found to be}} quite different from those containing flexible substituents. In order to make this approach more suitable for high-throughput screening a method has been validated wherein the extent of substrate-induced fluorescence quenching may be obtained without having to know how much polymer is present. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

50|$|Polysaccharides are {{polymerized}} monosaccharides, or complex carbohydrates. They {{have multiple}} simple sugars. Examples are starch, cellulose, and glycogen. They are generally large and {{often have a}} complex branched connectivity.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a fluorescent chemosensor for cAMP by creating recognition sites for cAMP, that contain a fluorescent molecule, in a polymer matrix by molecular <b>imprinting.</b> Such a <b>fluorescent</b> molecularly <b>imprinted</b> polymer may, therefore, serve as both the recognition element and the measuring element for the fluorescent detection of cAMP in aqueous media. Two new fluorescent molecules, known as 4 -(p-dimethylaminostyryl) pyridinium salts or dyes, were synthesized as possible fluorescent components of a chemosensor. Upon excitation at 469 run, dye 1, trans- 4 -(p-N,N-dimethylaminostyryl) -N-vinylbenzyl-pyridinium chloride, displays a dramatic quantum yield enhancement in an emission band centered at ∼ 600 nm, with concomitant slight red shift of the emission maximum, in the presence of the cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, in aqueous solution. Other purine nucleotides (AMP, ADP and ATP) and adenosine induce fluorescence quantum yield enhancements of lesser magnitude than those observed for cyclic nucleotides. The pyrimidine nucleotides, CMP and UMP, have almost no effect on the fluorescence of 1, suggesting a specificity of 1 for purine over pyrimidine analytes. Equilibrium association constants for 1 with the purine analytes, in aqueous solution (pH 7. 2) range from 13. 9 M [...] 1 for cAMP to 0. 15 M [...] 1 for adenine. We conclude that the interaction of 1 with these analytes requires the presence of a purine base, and is enhanced by the presence of ribose and phosphate moieties. Dye 1 and a structurally-similar dye 2, trans- 4 -(p-N,N-dimethylaminostryl) -N-phenethylpyridinium bromide, also display dramatic fluorescence enhancements in the presence of DNA and proteins, suggesting that they also interact with these biomolecules. The environmentally-sensitive fluorescence of dyes 1 and 2 suggests that such compounds may be useful for developing fluorescent chemosensors for purine nucleotides, especially cAMP, and for the fluorescence detection or staining of DNA and proteins. To increase the recognition ability of 1 for cAMP, we prepared recognition sites for cAMP that contain fluorescent dye 1 in a polymer matrix by molecular imprinting. This is a novel design for such template-selective sites, since dye 1 forms an integral part of the recognition cavity, thereby serving as both the recognition element and the measuring element for the fluorescence detection of cAMP in aqueous media. The polymer displays a concentration-dependent decrease in fluorescence in the presence of aqueous cAMP, whereas almost no effect is observed in the presence of the structurally-similar molecule, cGMP. An association constant of ∼ 105 M [...] 1 was calculated for cAMP binding. Such <b>fluorescent</b> molecularly <b>imprinted</b> polymers could serve as a starting point in the development of highly effective synthetic fluorescent sensors for cAMP as well as other important biological molecules...|$|R
40|$|Molecularly {{imprinted}} polymers (MIPs) are crosslinked polymers containing bespoke functionalised cavities {{arising from}} the inclusion of template molecules in the polymerisation mixture and their later extraction. When the polymers are prepared functional polymerisable monomers are included which {{become part of the}} polymer matrix and serve to decorate the cavities with functionality appropriate to the template molecules. Overall, binding sites are created which have a memory for the template both in terms of shape and matching functionality. <b>Fluorescent</b> molecularly <b>imprinted</b> polymers have the benefit of a fluorophore in their cavities that may respond to the presence of bound test compound by a change in their fluorescence output. The work presented falls into three main areas. A series of fluorescent MIPs was prepared with a view to generating material capable of mimicking the binding characteristics of the metabolically important cytochrome isoform CYP 2 D 6. The MIPs re-bound their templates and various cross-reactivities were encountered for test compound/drug recognition. One MIP in particular exhibited a rational discrimination amongst the related synthetic templates and was reasonably successful in recognising CYP 2 D 6 substrates from the drug set tested. In order to give some insights into binding modes in MIPs, attempts were made to produce functional monomers containing two or more fluorophores that could be interrogated independently. A model compound was prepared which fitted the dual-fluorophore criteria and which will be the basis for future incorporation into MIPs. A further strand to this thesis is the deliberate incorporation of hydrophobic moieties into fluorescent functional monomers so that the resulting imprinted cavities might be biomimetic in their impersonation of enzyme active sites. Thus the imprinted cavities had specific hydrophobic regions as well as the usual polar functionality with which to interact with binding test compounds.

40|$|General methodologies are {{elaborated}} for the {{modification of}} residual vinyl groups {{resulting from the}} polymerization of technical grade divinylbenzene to obtain polymer supported reagents, catalysts, protecting groups, separation media and chemosensors. These residual vinyl groups undergo anti-Markovnikov addition reactions via free-radical mechanisms to give polymer supported halides, sulfides, phosphines, phophonates, amines, silanes, carboxylic acid derivatives such as amides, amidines, esters and also b -diketones, crown ethers or acetals. Reaction of these pendant styryl units via electrophilic or nucleophilc mechanisms also give useful polymeric products. Diels-Alder reactions of the pendant styryl units are also investigated, showing that these may react as dienophiles or, with {{the participation of the}} aromatic group, as a diene. Thus, one mole of diene such as hexachlorocyclopentadiene or 3, 6 -dipyridyl- 1, 2, 4, 5 tetrazine add per mole of alkene, or two moles of dienophile such as maleic acid derivatives add in a fashion analogous to the Wagner-Jauregg reaction. Transition metal catalysed hydrosilylation of the substrate (vinyl) polystyrene using Co 2 (CO) 8 gives exclusively dimethylene linked polymer supported dialkylchlorosilanes. These may be used to selectively protect primary hydroxyls in the presence of secondary or tertiary hydroxyls. Cleavage of the silyl ethers can be effected with aqueous acid, base or more conveniently with fluoride ions which then could be regenerated back to the polymeric silylchlorides using BCl 3 /CH 2 Cl 2. Resins bearing amino acid functionalities, obtained by free-radical addition of cysteine, may be converted to polymer supported azlactones which smoothly immobilize enzymes such as lipase, and retain their hydrolytic activity. Functional polymer particles of nanometer dimensions bearing <b>fluorescent</b> molecular <b>imprinted</b> sites are obtained using a core-shell polymerization approach in conjunction with technique described above. The resulting clear particle dispersions show some ability to distinguish between molecules and even between enantiomers through weak interactions, as shown by fluorescence spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of materials with molecular recognition properties {{has become a}} topic of great technological and scientific interest. Molecular imprinting {{is one of the}} most effective strategies in preparing highly selective synthetic receptors. The technique of molecular imprinting involves the copolymerization of functional and cross-linking monomers in the presence of a molecular template. Following polymerization and subsequent removal of the template, the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) retains a “molecular memory” of the template. During rebinding, the resultant polymer shows higher affinity and selectivity towards the molecular template when compared to other structural analogs. Ease of preparation and high thermal and chemical stability of this class of materials offers a broad range of potential applications. Promising areas of application include separation, chromatography, catalysis, sensors, antibody mimics, and drug delivery etc. The thesis entitled “Molecularly Imprinted Polymers based on Fluorescent and Template binding Cross-linker” deals with the design and {{synthesis of}} several molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) using different functional and cross-linking monomers, the main focus being use of preformed template-monomer complex, use of fluorescent cross-linker and development of functional group containing cross-linker. Chapter 1 : An Introduction to Molecularly Imprinted Polymers. The first chapter provides an introduction to the field of molecularly imprinted polymers. It presents an overview of molecular imprinting process including a brief history of its discovery and its evolution to the present form. This chapter further elaborates on the principle of molecular imprinting with an emphasis on different parameters that directly affect their performance. It also provides a brief review of the applications of molecularly imprinted polymers. Chapter 2 : Highly Cross-linked Metal Ion Imprinted Polymers. The second chapter deals with the synthesis of series of highly cross-linked metal-ion imprinted polymers. The process of metal ion-imprinting usually involves carrying out the polymerization and cross-linking directly in presence of the appropriate metal ion. In the present study, chemical-immobilization method was adopted which involves the use of preformed metal complexes with polymerizable group for the imprinting. Acrylate complexes of various metal-ions, such as Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, Pb 2 + and Cr 3 +, were synthesized prior to polymerization. These pre-assembled complexes were then used to prepare MIPs, in the anticipation that this would lead to enhanced selectivity. Ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was used as the cross-linking monomer. As a control, the respective non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) were also made in absence of the template metal ion. Following polymerization, the template metal ion was extracted from the resultant metal ion-imprinted polymer. The selectivity of the metal ion-imprinted polymers was examined by a batch process using analytical tools, such as, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICP). The spectroscopic studies revealed significant selectivity of all the MIPs towards the template metal ion. Among all six metal ion-imprinted polymers, Pb 2 + and Cr 3 + ion-imprinted polymer showed remarkable selectivity, followed by Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + ion-imprinted polymers. The Co 2 + and Ni 2 + ion-imprinted polymers exhibited comparatively poor selectivity. Representative plots depicting the selectivity exhibited by Pb 2 + and Cr 3 + ion-imprinted polymers are shown in Figure 1. These observations were rationalized based on the size and geometric preferences imposed by the imprinted site on the ion that binds to it. Figure 1. Selectivity study for (a) Pb 2 + ion-imprinted polymer, (b) Cr 3 + ion-imprinted polymer. Chapter 3. Molecularly <b>Imprinted</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> Chemosensor for Copper (II). Cu(II) is a source of important pollutant and therefore, the development of sensors that can detect Cu(II) selectively as well as remove Cu(II) from contaminated samples is an important objective. The use of molecular imprinting technique is an appealing approach in this regard. For this, a fluorophore containing cross-linker, namely 9, 10 -bis-(acryloyloxymethyl) anthracene (BAMA) was synthesized. This fluorescent cross-linker was used along with the standard cross-linker, EGDMA, for preparing Cu 2 + ion-imprinted polymer. The complex of copper methacrylate (Cu-MAA) was prepared prior to polymerization used for the preparation of MIP. The resultant imprinted polymer exhibited quenching of the fluorescence in presence of Cu 2 + ion, both in organic and aqueous medium. The efficiency of quenching of NIP (prepared in absence of Cu 2 + ion) was significantly lower than that of MIP. A typical stack spectra showing the quenching process, along with a comparison of the quenching efficiency of MIP and NIP is shown in Figure 2. The imprinted polymers showed significant selectivity over other non-template metal ions, thereby reaffirming the importance of the imprinting process. The sensitivity of the fluorescence detection could be enhanced by increasing the level of the fluorophore incorporation. The increased sensitivity in detecting Cu 2 + ion, demonstrated by the MIP suggests that a statistically random incorporation of the fluorophore into MIP matrices could be a useful approach for imparting a sensing element to MIPs. Figure 2. Fluorescence spectra of the (a) imprinted (MIP- 1) and (b) non-imprinted (NIP- 1) polymers in the presence of various concentration of Cu(OAc) 2 in methanol. (c) Comparison of quenching efficiency of MIP- 1 and NIP- 1. Data were collected 3 h after addition of copper solution. I 0 and I are the fluorescence intensities at 399 nm of the polymers in the absence presence of copper respectively. Two individual runs are presented in (c). Chapter 4. Molecularly Imprinted Turn-Off-On Sensor. This chapter describes the design and synthesis of molecularly <b>imprinted</b> <b>fluorescent</b> turn-off-on sensor utilizing the same fluorescent cross-linker, BAMA. Combining the process of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with molecular imprinting technique, a novel turn-off-on sensor was developed. A molecularly imprinted polymer was prepared using a fluorescent template Coumarin- 30 (C- 30). C- 30 was chosen as the template to ensure a significant overlap of the emission spectra of BAMA and the absorption spectra of C- 30, thereby optimizing for FRET. Figure 3. Structures of relevant molecules. The C- 30 imprinted polymer exhibited simultaneous quenching in fluorescence (turn-off) of BAMA and enhancement in fluorescence (turn-on) of C- 30 (Figure 4). The imprinted polymer showed significantly better performance over the non-imprinted polymer (NIP). Figure 4. Fluorescence spectra of the (a) imprinted (MIP) and (b) non-imprinted (NIP) polymers with increasing concentration of the template Coumarine- 30 in methanol. The UV-vis studies revealed that the more effective quenching is indeed due to the affinity for C- 30 exhibited by the higher binding imprinted polymer. The imprinted polymer also showed significant selectivity over structurally analogous molecules. Therefore, both high sensitivity and selectivity were realized in such novel off-on sensor. Extension of this concept to other biologically relevant fluorescent templates could lead to potentially useful applications. Chapter 5. Design of New Template Binding Cross-linker. In molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP), high cross-linking density (~ 80 to 90 mole percent) is essential to ensure high selectivity, which limits the functional (binding) monomer to about 10 - 20 mole percent. Methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) are the most common combination of functional monomer and cross-linker, respectively, used in molecular imprinting. Generally a molecularly imprinted polymer made with this combination, contains only 10 - 20 % binding sites. This limitation of binding site density is an aspect that has largely been overlooked. In order to improve the efficiency of MIP materials by enhancing the number of binding sites, a new cross-linking monomer (CYDI, 1) with two carboxylic acid groups was designed and synthesized by coupling itaconic anhydride with cyclohexane dimethanol (Figure 5). Figure 5. Structures of relevant molecules. The new functional group bearing cross-linking monomer (1) Itaconate ester of cyclohexanedimethanol (CYDI), the template (2) theophylline (Theop) and the structural analogue of template (3) caffeine (Caff). This new cross-linking monomer was then employed for preparing molecularly imprinted polymer using a drug molecule, theophylline (Theop 2, a bronchodilator) as the template. Seven molecularly imprinted polymers were synthesized with different ratios of CYDI and EGDMA, keeping the cross-linking density constant. The binding efficiency and the selectivity of these imprinted polymers were thoroughly investigated. It was seen that while saturation binding values for theophylline increased continuously with functional cross-linker (CYDI) content, the optimum selectivity with respect to analogous substrate, caffeine, was attained at 40 mol% CYDI. These studies suggest that the approach of using functional group containing cross-linkers could lead to improved MIP performance...|$|R
