5|$|Paralleling along Interstate 44, {{the tornado}} moved into McClain County, where it crossed the highway twice at F4 intensity, killing {{a woman as}} she was blown out from an {{underpass}} where she was attempting to seek shelter, after being dragged down the embankment by the intense channeling winds; her 11-year-old son − with whom the woman vacated their stalled car nearby − survived, staying <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> onto the steel girders of the overpass. A man who helped the mother and son up the overpass suffered severe injuries to his leg, which was partially sliced by a highway sign thrown by the winds. At 7:10p.m. CDT, a satellite tornado touched down over an open field north of Newcastle; it was rated as an F0 {{due to lack of}} damage. 38 homes and two businesses were destroyed in McClain County, and 40 homes were flattened; some of these homes were leveled at F4 intensity, and 17 people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E
25|$|The looting of the city's {{treasury}} {{could not}} have happened {{without the help of}} {{the most powerful man in}} San Francisco, David Broderick, who was a state senator and <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> control over San Francisco from 1851 until his death in 1859. Broderick's corruption was such that no man could be elected to public office unless he made a deal with Broderick to share half the profits from his office. As a result of these backroom deals, Broderick accumulated a large amount of wealth which further strengthened his position as a powerful city boss. As news of the treasury's financial crisis became known, another even larger uprising of enraged citizenry would occur.|$|E
60|$|I earnestly {{expressed}} my {{hope that}} he wouldn't, and <b>held</b> <b>tighter</b> to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying.|$|R
60|$|She {{stretched}} forth {{a hand to}} me. I took it and <b>held</b> it <b>tight,</b> {{looking up}} into her eyes.|$|R
60|$|I <b>held</b> him <b>tighter,</b> for at {{that moment}} a great wave had broken over us. I dreaded nothing but separation.|$|R
500|$|Sometime later, {{they learn}} {{of the death of}} Daigo's father. A {{reluctant}} Daigo goes with Mika to another village to see the body. Daigo is at first unable to recognize him, but takes offence when local funeral workers are careless with the body. He insists on dressing it himself, and while doing so finds a stone-letter which he had given to his father, <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> in the dead man's hands. [...] The childhood memory of his father's face returns to him, and after he finishes the ceremony, Daigo gently presses the stone-letter to Mika's pregnant belly.|$|E
2500|$|The co-main event then {{occurred}} with heavyweights Frank Mir fighting Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira. [...] During the first round, Nogueira hit Mir with a punch that staggered Mir. [...] Nogueira furthered his attack {{by attempting to}} take Mir's back and apply a choke submission. [...] After some ground and pound Mir got out from under Nogueira, grabbed Nogueira's right arm and attempted a kimura lock. [...] The pair rolled over several times as Nogueira attempted to escape the submission hold, but Mir <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> onto Nogueira's arm. [...] Nogueira refused to tap out to the submission attempt until Mir broke his arm and Nogueira finally tapped. [...] The official decision was that Frank Mir defeated Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira by technical submission due to the kimura at 3:38 of the first round. [...] As {{a result of this}} fight, Mir was awarded the event's [...] "Submission of the Night" [...] and earned the distinction of not only being the first man to ever knock out Nogueira, but to also be the first man to ever submit him.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} a bit of {{revisionism}} in some Cowboy memories concerning the game. [...] Frank Clarke thought the Packer final drive was [...] "lucky football," [...] though Chuck Howley acknowledged that the Cowboy double coverage on the wide receivers left the backs open underneath. [...] Cornell Green even claimed that a bad pass interference call, [...] "the worst call I've seen in history," [...] on Dave Edwards aided the Packer final drive: [...] "That was the game." [...] In reality, the play Green recalled in which Starr threw a pass behind Donny Anderson happened back in the first quarter; but the call was [...] defensive holding (Willie Townes <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> end Marv Fleming), a 5-yard penalty, and the infraction occurred before Starr threw the pass. [...] There were no penalties called on either team during the final Packer drive. [...] Even Tom Landry in the NFL Film of the Ice Bowl stated that if he had realized the field was frozen, the Cowboys would have switched to a zone defense.|$|E
60|$|But saddest, darkest was the sight, When {{the cold}} grasp of leaden Night Dashed him to earth, and <b>held</b> him <b>tight.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I am mighty {{glad to know}} it hasn't {{made any}} difference," [...] he {{returned}} quickly; and then caught and <b>held</b> her <b>tight</b> once more.|$|R
50|$|Also, as {{producer}} {{she took}} steps to make the productions more dramatic. Actors in Taiwanese Opera traditionally {{had a lot of}} leeway in how they presented their characters, but Yang <b>held</b> <b>tighter</b> control. In addition to having script outlines made, she also hired Ti Shan to write new pieces and Chen Tsung-ming to direct. She created stronger parts for actors playing male roles. She also had people search for lost Taiwanese Opera plays, write new melodies, and develop new singing styles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I was {{a little}} scared," [...] said Dora primly, [...] "but I <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> to Anne's hand and said my prayers over and over again." ...|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes after}} that they were board and board, the Jongvrow <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> in the {{clutches}} of La Foudre's grapnels, and the buccaneers pouring noisily into her waist.|$|E
60|$|All gave yells, {{for they}} were {{thoroughly}} frightened. They were pitched together in a heap, and <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> to one another as they went down, first a distance of fifteen or twenty feet and then twice further.|$|E
60|$|Again {{he tried}} to pull it away, but the strange man <b>held</b> it <b>tighter.</b> Still further, he bent his head over it and kissed it.|$|R
60|$|Nostromo's heart {{seemed to}} force itself into his throat. His head swam. Hirsch! The man was Hirsch! He <b>held</b> on <b>tight</b> {{to the edge}} of the table.|$|R
60|$|She paused, {{struggling}} for breath. He {{did not answer}} her. He only <b>held</b> her <b>tighter,</b> and whispered her name lovingly. In a moment she re-opened her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Laughing, she {{floated in}} closer yet, till her {{beautiful}} eyes were looking {{up into his}} bony and wrinkled face. Then with a sudden spring he thrust his hand deep into the silken mesh of her hair and <b>held</b> <b>tight.</b>|$|E
60|$|LADD, Lash, Thorne, Mercedes, {{they were}} all <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> in Belding's arms. Then he ran to Blanco Diablo. For once the great horse was gentle, quiet, glad. He remembered this kindest of masters and reached for him with warm, wet muzzle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay back, Crusoe, {{and watch}} my rifle, pup," [...] he cried, and, raising his heavy switch {{he brought it}} down with a sharp cut across the horse's flank, {{at the same time}} {{loosening}} the rein which hitherto he had <b>held</b> <b>tight.</b>|$|E
60|$|I <b>held</b> him <b>tighter</b> than ever, {{and ordered}} him more resolutely than ever to go on. Oscar {{resigned}} himself to a halt (foreign fashion) on the high road.|$|R
50|$|The {{proprioceptive}} system {{concerns a}} person's joints and muscles. It tells the brain if {{a part of}} the body is moving without actually having to see it. It also controls eating, writing, and using utensils. This sense enables a person to understand the amount of pressure used to carry out routine tasks, such as eating and writing. Bodily pressure is part of this as well; for example, a child may enjoy being <b>held</b> <b>tighter</b> by someone or leaning into things such as walls, desks, and potentially other people.|$|R
6000|$|The {{children}} {{both said}} [...] "Yes" [...] {{in a very}} small whisper, and cowered down almost under the clothing, and <b>held</b> on <b>tight,</b> so as to keep from stirring.|$|R
60|$|O Heavens, it {{had come}} at last! He would find it was weak, he {{would say it was}} weak, and I was lost! I <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> to the leg of the table under the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, dear. 'Put [...] "The cord {{which is}} <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> {{is the easiest}} to snap." [...] That will be all right. The cord of which I speak is never held at all. The moment it is {{necessary}} to hold it, it is of no value. It must be voluntary, natural, unavoidable.' ...|$|E
60|$|Straining every nerve I aimed as before, only {{a little}} in advance, <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> and pulled at the same instant. The bear doubled up in a ball and began to roll down the slide. He {{scattered}} the leaves. Then into the thicket he crashed, knocking the oaks, and cracking the brush.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned to}} run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran full {{into the arms}} of a second, who for his part closed upon and <b>held</b> me <b>tight.</b>|$|R
60|$|Davy {{buried his}} face in Anne's {{shoulder}} and cried stormily. Anne, in a sudden glad flash of understanding, <b>held</b> him <b>tight</b> and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla.|$|R
6000|$|But the Tin Woodman {{caught the}} dog {{in his arms and}} <b>held</b> him <b>tight,</b> while he called to the mice, [...] "Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt you." ...|$|R
60|$|Even while I raged {{against my}} ill-fortune, that same fortune was reserving {{me for a}} far higher task than to carry a message to Grouchy--a task which {{could not have been}} mine had I not been <b>held</b> <b>tight</b> in that little inn {{on the edge of the}} Forest of Paris.|$|E
6000|$|While echoes ran, a wagon old, [...] Under stout {{guard of}} Corporal Chew Came up; a lame horse, dingy white, With clouted harness; ropes in hand, [...] Cringed the humped driver, black in hue; [...] By him (for Mosby's band a sight) [...] A sister-rebel sat, her veil <b>held</b> <b>tight.</b>|$|E
60|$|He reached {{forth and}} at the same time the tree began to slide down the hollow, {{directly}} in Allen's pathway. Allen had Slavin in his arms by this time. He made a leap and got on top of the tree, and just as the trunk went down Watson caught him and <b>held</b> <b>tight.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{said the}} priest, with an indescribable long, {{trembling}} sigh. He caught {{her hand in}} his <b>held</b> it <b>tight,</b> and then pressed it for an instant against his breast.|$|R
5000|$|Attention: {{standing}} straight, eyes forward, heels together, feet at a 30-degree angle (540 mils). The {{hands are}} <b>held</b> in <b>tight</b> fists with the thumbs {{aligned with the}} seam of the trousers.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Twas weel eno' {{the night}} we met,When I'd be oot and on my way,Ye held me close, ye <b>held</b> me <b>tight,</b> [...] "Just ane mair time ere the break o' day!" ...|$|R
