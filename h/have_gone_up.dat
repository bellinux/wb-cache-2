5|$|Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed {{during the}} 1970s and early 1980s when a {{collection}} of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate610 West. Uptown {{became one of the}} most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, -tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, Uptown had more than 23million square feet (2,100,000m²) of office space with 16million square feet (1,500,000m²) of class A office space.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} the export sector has been booming, {{acting as the}} main engine for {{economic}} growth. Swedish exports also {{have proven to be}} surprisingly robust. A marked shift {{in the structure of the}} exports, where services, the IT industry, and telecommunications have taken over from traditional industries such as steel, paper and pulp, has made the Swedish export sector less vulnerable to international fluctuations. However, at the same time the Swedish industry has received less money for its exports while the import prices <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>up.</b> During the period 1995–2003 the export prices were reduced by 4% at the same time as the import prices climbed by 11%. The net effect is that the Swedish terms-of-trade fell 13%.|$|E

Had the team won a point in their final game of the season at Leyton Orient, they would <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> automatically, but they lost the game 2–1. An emphatic 7–2 (on aggregate) victory over Scarborough in the semi-final, including 4 goals from star striker Rodney Jack, resulted in Torquay United's third appearance at Wembley. However, United lost 1–0 to Colchester United in the Wembley final (played on a Friday night due an England game the following day meaning that thousands of fans were unable to get to the game). Kevin Hodges left the club to return to his former club Plymouth Argyle after the season ended, and Wes Saunders (who had previously been caretaker manager for much of the 1991–92 season) returned as manager.|$|E
25|$|Buildings <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> {{and been}} torn down rapidly across the region. Some city blocks have been {{demolished}} {{six or seven}} times since the mid-19th century, and will undoubtedly reach an eighth or ninth cycle in short order. No single architectural style dominates the region. Instead, the cities have a mish-mash of different designs, although structures from a few eras stand out. There were once a great many stone buildings constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style (or at least Romanesque-inspired variants). Minneapolis City Hall is one prominent example of this, though buildings of all types—including personal residences such as the James J. Hill House—were similarly designed. A few decades later, Art Deco brought several structures that survive today, including St. Paul City Hall, the Foshay Tower, and the Minneapolis Post Office. The style of buildings in the two cities varies greatly. In Minneapolis, the trend has been buildings with sleek lines and modern glass facades while St. Paul tends to follow a more traditional style of buildings so as to better accompany its older structures.|$|E
25|$|Some pros {{always had}} {{problems}} with how the ABA decided its number one pros for the year {{going back to the}} 1979 season. The biggest complaint that it was canted to have the points work out so that the number one pro would almost certainly be decided going into the ABA's Grand National in November with the lion's share of the points being doled out then (the points that were earned was {{the amount of money that}} was earned through the year. At that time the ABA AA pro who won the most money was declared No. 1 pro). The pros claimed that this benefited the ABA since it meant an exciting finish to the season, but it was detrimental to the pros in that a season of consistent wins and near wins could be undone by having an off day and/or a normally inconsistent rider having a great day and capturing the number one plate. Other issues like a bigger pro purse and that the purse be spread out over eight places instead of the top four at ABA Nationals which would ensure anyone making the pro main would get a share of the winnings were also a factor. The claim was while NBL, NBA and independent promotional races' purses <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> over the years, the ABA's purses had remained relatively stagnant.|$|E

Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii." [...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time."
