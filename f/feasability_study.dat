40|$|This {{dissertation}} is theoretical {{in nature}} and can be separated into two main areas: 1) single- and multiphoton ionization studies of a novel photoelectron effect, and 2) single-photon ionization studies of simple clusters as models for adsorbate photoemission. The first area centers on the phenomenon of circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions (CDAD). CDAD is shown to exist from oriented linear molecules, adsorbed atoms, and aligned atoms and molecules in the gas phase. The calculations presented here {{are the first to}} demonstrate the experimental <b>feasability</b> of CDAD <b>studies.</b> CDAD is shown to be a measurable effect which exists because the photoelectron collection direction can break the symmetry of these otherwise highly symmetric systems. As {{a direct result of the}} work presented here, CDAD has now been observed experimentally. Coupled with resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI), CDAD is shown to be a powerful probe of unknown alignment in gas phase atomic and molecular samples. The second area of research focuses on the simple oriented molecules NiCO and NiN_ 2 as models for the corresponding adsorbate systems. These simple models provide insight into features observed in the experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectra...|$|R
40|$|The mesencephalic {{dopamine}} (DA) {{system is}} strongly {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD), where symptoms occur after {{the loss of the}} vast majority of DA neurons. An involvement of this system also in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disease (BD) is suggested by the fact that DA receptor antagonists are among the most potent drugs in clinical use for the treatment of these conditions. Basic science of the past years has provided several clues for how DA cells develop and under which conditions they thrive. Different approaches include research on neurotrophic factors (providing target-derived support for DA cells), neuropeptides (modulators of neurotransmission), transcription factors (activating a large number of "downstream" genes important for development and maintenance of the cell) and endogenous as well as environmental neurotoxins. This thesis describes an effort to link basic science knowledge of the type described above to clinical samples employing the candidate gene approach. Analyzing genes encoding the above-mentioned proteins in material from patients suffering from PD, SZ and BD aims at establishing direct links between mutations in such genes and susceptibility for die disorders. The CALCA locus {{is one of the first}} and by now most well-characterized examples of alternative splicing of genes in humans. While the calcitonin protein is localized to C-cells of the thyroid gland, the alternatively spliced protein CGRP is a neuropeptide with multiple functions within the brain. We identified several new polymorphisms in this locus and investigated association within available materials from PD, SZ and BD patients. No significant associations were found with these disorders. However, the report of the sequence variations identified in the gene may still be valuable markers, since CGRP has been strongly implicated both in hypertension and migraine. NURR 1 is a nuclear receptor being absolutely essential for the development of mesencephalic dopamine neurons. Three different unique missense mutations were identified in patients suffering from psychosis (two in SZ, one in BD). All three mutations were located within 78 bp from each other in a region of exon 3 and disturbed NURR 1 -mediated transcription similarly when modeled in vitro. Since the NURR 1 gene is highly conserved between humans and rodents, introduction of the identified mutations in transgenic animals may lead to a valid model for psychosis susceptibility The ADH 4 gene codes for in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) that converts retinol to retinal and also acts upon a wealth of other alcohols and aldehydes, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD as endogenous or exogenous neurotoxins. We found significant association between one of several polymorphisms identified in this gene and idiopathic PD. In a follow-up study of a larger material several genes within the ADH cluster including ADH 4 were analyzed. The previously found association of ADH 4 with PD remained significant, while other polymorphisms did not show significant association. A nonsense mutation in ADH 1 C was identified in three (of 123) PD patients but none of 127 control individuals. An effort was also made to characterize the usefulness of available postmortem material for immunohistochemistry Using a plethora of different antibodies, we could confirm the <b>feasability</b> of postmortem <b>studies</b> on the protein level and found a new marker for corpora amylacea, namely nestin. Since bodies made of aggregated proteins play roles in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, we went on to characterize corpora amylacea further with antibodies against alpha- synuclein, PGP 9. 5 and other (vimentin, NF) neurofilaments, Expression of different alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases was also studied in postmortem human brain tissue using in situ hybridization. High and specific expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH 1) was found in human DA cells. Furthermore, ALDH 1 mRNA levels were found to be strongly decreased in remaining dopamine neurons of substantia nigra of PD patients as compared to controls. Other DA neurons (of the ventral tegmental area) showed normal levels of expression, indicating a selective decrease of ALDH 1 mRNA levels in neurons degenerating in PD. To summarize, evidence for the involvement of alcohol- and aldehyde dehydrogenases as wed as the nuclear transcription factor NURR 1 in the pathogenesis of the diseases of interest was found in the available material. Further studies along these lines using larger materials employing more markers and probes are warranted...|$|R

The operation of a neuronal circuit formed of electronic neurons based on Hindmarsh-Rose neuron dynamics and first order chemical synapses ls modeled. The controller {{is based on a}} standard CMOS process with 2 V supply voltage. In order to achieve low power consumption, CMOS subthreshold circuit techniques are used. The controller generates an excellent replica of the walking motor program and allows switching between walking in different directions in response to different command inputs. The simulated power consumption is 4. 8 mW and die size including I/O pads is 2. 2 mm by 2. 2 mm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design can generate adaptive walking motor programs to control the legs of autonomous robots.

40|$|A <b>feasability</b> <b>study</b> was {{conducted}} {{within the confines}} of the DELOS Network of Excellence with the aim of investigating possible approaches to extend The European Library (TEL) with multilingual information access, i. e. the ability to use queries in one language to retrieve items in different languages. While the academic community has in recent years made substantial progress in the two related fields of multilingual information access and cross-language information retrieval, the TEL system poses some specific challenges which force adaptation of the mechanisms which have originally been developed for more general settings. Specifically, TEL uses a loose coupling of different search systems, and deals with very short information items. We address these two characteristics with two different approaches: the “isolated query translation” approach, and the “pseudo-translated expanded records ” approach. The former approach has been studied together with its implications on the user interface, while the latter approach has been evaulated using a test collection of over 150, 000 records from the TEL central index. We find that both approaches address the specific characteristics of TEL well, and that there is considerable potential for a combination of the two alternatives...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} a <b>feasability</b> <b>study</b> in which the modelling and simulation of distributed computing systems were investigated {{in the context of}} high-energy physics experiments. The concept of distributed storage and computing resources has proven to be scalable to and flexible for CERN’s current data processing needs. The continuous evolution of CERN’s central computing services and the ever increasing demands of physics experiments require well-conceived methodologies for the planning and design of distributed computing architectures. A modelling and simulation mechanism is thus of particular interest to developers of future high-energy physics experiments. Typically, the computing infrastructure that is required for these experiments cannot be derived from straight enhancements and updates to currently existing production systems. Computation and storage demands that grow by orders of magnitude need considerable advancements in technology, data organisation and management. A mechanism for performance prediction on the basis of an abstract scenario of a distributed computing infrastructure is thus necessary. The “Simulation of Distributed Architectures”, known as SoDA, refers to a set of concepts, software tools and documents which support designers of distributed computing systems. The roots of SoDA came from a simulation of the NA 48 Central Data Recording system that I developed in early 1997. A...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} <b>feasability</b> <b>study</b> {{was performed}} on the integral performance of dual function catalyst particles in a packed bed reactor equipped with a porous membrane for distributive feeding of oxygen. The exothermic oxidative coupling and the endothermic steam reforming of methane (for simultaneous production of ethylene and synthesis gas) are integrated at the level of a porous catalyst particle with distributed activity, where the presence of the intraparticle heat-sink strongly reduces the total reaction heat and the temperature gradients in the reactor, eliminating the need for expensive conventional cooling of the reactor. Numerical simulations, with reaction kinetics taken from the literature, revealed that with distributive oxygen feeding via membranes indeed the local oxygen concentration in the packed bed membrane reactor can be kept low, which combined with a high Thiele modulus for oxidative coupling makes dual function catalysis possible. Using a reforming core diameter of approximately 15 - 40 micrometer, the steam reforming and oxidative coupling reaction rates could be effectively tuned to achieve autothermal operation, while the methane conversion was enhanced from 34 to 48 % at optimum C 2 production rates. In addition, it was shown that the temperature profiles in the reactor can be strongly reduced by employing the dual function catalyst and that the use of axial oxygen membrane flux profiles enables the use of a singele particle configuration to approach autothermal operation in the entire reactor...|$|E
40|$|An optimal {{technology}} can be determined, among various choices, for manufacturing phytopharmaceutical products by using the model of project profile and risk analysis of investment (comparative analysis of the project value). This technology takes into account different targets: marketing natural and social ones. The production is desirable for producers in Serbia to increase the accumulation of capital. The realization of profit {{in the production of}} these products also has ethical reasons because the income is distributed among research, development and social activities. This paper presents some results of research and practice regarding the manufacture of phytotherapy products, which can be useful for managers working on problems of technological restructuring as follows: 1. The <b>feasability</b> <b>study</b> for this production shows that the profit margin is between 10 and 25 %. 2. The know-how for the production of phytotherapy products ranges from 12. 5 to 25. 5 % of the total investment in new technology, which can be a great advantage in the development of original (domestic) technology and its export to other countries (example Hemofarm). 3. The development of these products and realized profit improve research for new indication and initiate the production of other equipment (machines for packing, transport etc) Furthermore, some extremely passive regions could be incorporated into such production. The production of phytopharmacy products has a social target supplying the market with cheap medical compounds obtained from plants without any undesired side effects in the treatment...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose the}} {{determination}} of the CKM matrix element |Vub | by the measurement of the spectrum of B → D + s Xu, dominated by the spectator quark model mechanism ¯b → D (∗) + s ū. The interest of considering B → D + s Xu versus the semileptonic decay is that more than 50 % of the spectrum for B → D + s Xu occurs above the kinematical limit for B → D + s Xc, while most of the spectrum B → lνXu occurs below the B → lνXc one. Furthermore, the measure of the hadronic mass MX is easier in the presence of an identified Ds than when a ν has been produced. As a consistency check, we point out that the rate ¯b → D (∗) + s ¯c (including QCD corrections that we present elsewhere) is consistent with the measured BR(B → D ± s X) by CLEO. Although the hadronic complications may be more severe in the mode that we propose than in the semileptonic inclusive decay, the end of the spectrum in B → lνXu is not well understood on theoretical grounds. We argue that, in our case, the excited D∗ ∗ s, decaying into DK, do not contribute and, if there is tagging of the B meson, the other mechanisms to produce a Ds of the right sign are presumably small, of O(10 − 2) relative to the spectator amplitude, or can be controlled by kinematical cuts. In the absence of tagging, other hadronic backgrounds deserve careful study. We present a <b>feasability</b> <b>study</b> with the BaBar detector...|$|E

RMs for NO 2 were prepared by exposure to gas mixtures in a chamber while the RMs for SO 2 were prepared by liquid spiking. Certification of RMs for NO 2 was found feasible with a certified uncertainty of 5. 8 % and a proposed shelf life of 5 years. The uncertainty was calculated with contribution from the homogeneity of preparation, stability and transport of the CRMs and from an external verification of the certified value. To reach 5. 8 % of uncertainty, the contribution {{of the differences between the}} results of analysis by ion chromatography and colorimetry must be eliminated. It is proposed to solve this by pre-extracting the samplers with water before analysis. The results of this study indicate that the samplers are stable for at least two years before and after exposure when stored in refrigerator. On the opposite, the certification of RMs for SO 2 was found not feasible due to instability problems. This instability was attributed to reaction of sulfate on the walls of the samplers. Alternatively, the preparation of RMs by simultaneous exposure to SO 2 and NO 2 have been tested. Satisfying homogeneities has been reached both for NO 2 and SO 2. JRC.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{in this thesis}} has been to develop an {{algorithm}} that robustly identifies the Carotid artery wall boundaries throughout a heart cycle in an ultrasound image. An existing automatic vessel detection algorithm (AVDA) uses tissue velocity imaging(TVI) and B-mode data to score candidate points from various criteria. The candidate pair with the lowest score gets selected. AVDA was extended by implementing two alternative criteria to the existing external cost criterion. The first by combining the information on gradient and standard deviation in the intensity signatures; the GradTrans criterion (GTC). The second by exploiting {{the shape of the}} intensity signature across the vessel wall in the detection of the intima-lumen interfaces and using a Model Matching criterion with 1. 5 Gaussian curves (MMC 1. 5). An edge criteria modeling tool (ECMT) was developed for the purpose of studying the intensity signatures across the vessel wall to find out how the various cost criteria score the signatures of different datasets. In addition, the ECMT was used for parameter tuning. The implemented criteria were verified by comparing automatically detected edges with manual detected edges on 22 datasets. In addition automatically detected vessel diameter was compared against manually detected diameter on 49 datasets. The verification indicated that the GTC is not a good criterion for detecting the intima-lumen interface. The GTC either completely failed to detect the wall or detected the media-adventitia boundary instead of the intima-lumen boundary. The MMC 1. 5 criterion, on the other hand, seems promising. The criterion seems to often detect the wall correctly or with a small deviation. Compared with manual diameter measurement, MMC 1. 5 had a bias of 0. 014 mm and std of the error was 1. 056. In some images the criterion failed completely in correct detection of the wall. The reason being that a similar structure in the wall or an artifact in the lumen was detected instead. After removing these outlays, the diameter detection by MMC 1. 5 had a bias of 0. 146 mm and std of 0. 347 mm. The criterion has to be developed further to be more robust and less time consuming, and to overcome the problems of complete failure. A <b>feasability</b> <b>study</b> was done to see whether the AVDA can be used on Brachialis recordings to increase the efficiency of the Flow Mediated Dilation measures. The study seems promising when using the Gradient criterion. This makes it possible to automatically measure diameter changes throughout a heart cycle as well as measuring the differences in diameter between recordings...|$|E
