500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop <b>egg</b> <b>nog</b> and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1800s, {{a typical}} saloon would serve basic spirits, such as whiskey, brandy, or gin. For a sweet variation, a little sugar might be added.

After a few potations, the waggish pair persuaded the exhilarated Frenchman that there was an inexcusable partiality in offering to one lady, and not extending a similar courtesy to another. Consequently, about nine, Monsieur Le Quoi sallied forth to the rectory, on a similar mission to Miss Grant, which proved as successful as his first effort in love.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional {{homemade}} eggnog {{is made of}} milk or cream, sugar, raw eggs, one or more alcoholic spirits, and spices, often vanilla or nutmeg and in some recipes, cloves.

[...] Homemade recipes may use vanilla ice cream blended into the beverage, particularly when {{the goal is to}} create a chilled drink.

Various sweeteners are used, such as white sugar, brown sugar and maple syrup.|$|E
