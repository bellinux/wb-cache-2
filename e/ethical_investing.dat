40|$|This essay aims to {{critically}} {{assess the}} later Foucault's ethical turn by using Levinas's ethical metaphysics as critical yardstick. Foucault's notion of ethical subjectivity constitutes {{a site of}} resistance against externally imposed subjugating subject identities. Apart from a practice of freedom, Foucault also insists that it engenders the subject with a generous responsiveness towards others. Despite Foucault's other-aspirations, it seems probable that care of the self would fall short ethically when compared to Levinas's insistence upon an unconditional openness towards the Other. Upon closer investigation, however, we find that Levinas's ethical metaphysics is founded upon phenomenological analyses of our immanent ‘economic’ existence here and now in the world. Although he maintains that metaphysics or ‘transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same’ (Levinas, 1979 : 43 / 13) is primary, the immanent process of the subject's ‘auto-personification’ (ibid., p. 147 / 120) serves as {{a necessary condition for}} the possibility of becoming ethical, of welcoming the Other. Moreover, contrary to Foucault's self-caring subject, who actively partakes in its own ethical self-formation, Levinas's existent has no educable ethical sensibility. It is powerless against the gravitational pull of its egoism, condemned to a hopeless amorality unless the Other intervenes and saves it from itself. I shall therefore argue that Foucault's account of <b>ethical</b> self-becoming <b>invests</b> the subject with a meta-physical potential, which it is denied by Levinas's ethical metaphysics...|$|R

40|$|The terms socially-responsible {{investing}} (SRI), mission-related investing, {{impact investing}} and environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing [...] all frequently grouped {{under the heading}} of responsible investing [...] have become a familiar part of the vocabulary of institutional and retail investors. Just what these terms mean in practice, however, and how their practitioners' claims can be impartially assessed, has been less clear. Responsible investing can be broken into three main categories: Socially-responsible investing (SRI) A portfolio construction process that attempts to avoid investments in certain stocks or industries through negative screening according to defined <b>ethical</b> guidelines. Impact <b>investing</b> Investing in projects, companies, fund or organizations with the express goal of generating and measuring effecting mission-related social, environmental or economic change alongside financial returns. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing Integrating the three ESG factors into fundamental investment analysis {{to the extent that they}} are material to investment performance. While these terms may all be gathered under the term responsible investing, these approaches serve very different purposes. SRI and impact investing use funding and investment activities to express institutional values or advance the institution's mission. In contrast, ESG investing aims to improve investment performance, thereby making additional resources available for mission support. For a long time, SRI was by far the most widely-used of the three approaches. In recent years, however, it has been argued that, although negative screening can be a useful tool for institutions desiring to express ethical, religious or moral values through their investment portfolio, for many it may prove too restrictive. ESG analysis, on the other hand, takes a broader view, examining whether environmental, social and governance issues may be material to a company's performance, and therefore to the investment performance of a long-term portfolio. Thus, while not every institution will choose to engage in SRI or impact investing, fiduciaries of long-term institutional investors should seek to develop a well-reasoned view on their institution's approach to ES...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the deep changes and <b>ethical</b> {{solicitations}} that <b>invest</b> our social and cultural life, also the law appears more sensitive and careful to the needs, vulnerability and even lacks of those who, because of several occurrences in their lives, are exposed to other people's, and also to one’s own fragility. According to this view, the law on shared custody, promoting a different ethical undertaking of public authorities, increases the value of each parent’s responsibility and capability of curing and taking care of their children’s emotional and moral needs, in the difficult situation of couple conflict. The principle of double parenthood is the proposed tool to achieve a model of cooperation not to be intended as the continuity of a family after all its ties have been broken, but as a way to restore and requalify children’s relationships with both their parents. According to the new connotations that the introduction of shared custody has imposed to the management of parents’ responsibility, also a technical advice in the civil procedures of separation and divorce, is aimed at new and dynamic configurations able to solicit to radically rethink all their procedural and methodological finalities. In this new context of double parenthood a technical advice assumes, in fact, the function of mediation and planning of the most suitable interventions to accompany and sustain the transformative run of the family, safeguarding its fondness and emotional resources. Over passing the traditional request to choose the most suitable parent, the 40 • abstract expert investigation is aimed at individualizing and searching the affective, pedagogical and relational resources that all family components are able to provide to promote a harmonic psychophysical development of minors during their developmental transitions. According to this new point of view, which wants to stop making a pathology of separation, the new technical advise is intended to draw functional profiles of parenthood, aimed at promoting a balanced relationship between parents and children, without neglecting the conflictual and emotional context where the expert investigation is sometimes carried out, that, if it is not adequately evaluated in all its specific connotations, can increase tensions and even produce further problems. Furthermore, a better evaluation of intersubjectivity and relational aspects of minors, solicits a more and more complete analysis of the family system as a whole, without neglecting the role of minors, of their interactions, backgrounds and needs as children. Therefore, it is much more necessary than in the past, a full cooperation and interaction among judges, attorneys at law and, still, among all professional bodies involved in the delicate task of the defence of children, finalized to favour parents’ involvement in the educational process and to allow new models of love expression between parents and children. 4...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} examines {{psychological factors}} that motivate and impede {{different types of}} investors to integrate social and environmental considerations when investing. Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) may cover several associated concepts such as ethical investments, sustainable investments, responsible investments and any other investment processes that combine investors´ financial objectives with concerns about environmental and social issues. The main bulk of research on SRI {{has been focused on}} comparing the financial aspects of SRI to conventional investments, as concern about the financial return on SRI have been regarded as the major obstacle toward SRI. This dissertation, however, also considers psychological factors that in previous research have been shown to explain altruistic and environmental behaviour. First and foremost we have adopted factors from the Value-Belief-Norm theory (VBN-theory) by Stern and colleagues. In the first study a sample of professional investors (n= 58) working at different Swedish investment institutions such as banks and fund companies, either as conventional investors (n= 31) or as SRI investors (n= 27), were recruited to participate in a survey study. The aim was to test if self-transcendent (altruistic) values, a positive attitude toward SRI and financial beliefs about SRI would promote SRI among professional investors. In accordance with VBN-theory we hypothesize that the influence of values and attitudes on investment behaviour would be mediated by norms. Results showed, surprisingly, that self-enhancement values such as ambition and success drive SRI investors to increase their SRI investments. Among non-SRI investors no such value influence was established. Contrary to what the VBN theory posits, the intention to promote SRI among SRI investors is not a value-expressive behaviour. Rather, egoistic values and beliefs about market and long-term financial benefits support SRI. It was also found that both groups of investors had similar beliefs about the financial performance of SRI funds, that SRI is not financially beneficial in the short term but probably financially sound in the longer term. To further examine what promotes SRI among professional investors, study II investigated professional investors own views on what promotes SRI, while comparing if SRI and non-SRI investors attached different importance to different types of drivers. Results indicated that non-SRI investors attach more importance factors associated with market regulation while SRI investors perceive the examples of others as a more important driver of SRI. To understand what influence different types of investors SRI intentions, In the third study, professional investors (n= 60), private investors (n= 457) and institutional investors (n= 71) were recruited to participate in a comparative study of motives to engage in SRI. Result revealed that while socially responsible investment (SRI) among private and institutional investors was guided by altruistic values, {{this was not the case}} among professional investors. Rather, professional investors were motivated by beliefs about financial return. Private investors were, in addition, also highly influenced by beliefs about return, while institutional asset owners were motivated by an effort to reduce financial risks. Finally, it was shown that professional investors overrated the importance of financial returns and underestimated the importance beneficiaries (private and institutional investors) attach to social, environmental and <b>ethical</b> issues when <b>investing.</b> This indicates that investment institutions could underestimate the market for socially responsible products. In the final study, the aim was to investigate socially responsible investments among active stock- investors. A sample of member representatives (n= 724) of the Swedish association for shareholders (Aktiespararna) was recruited to participate in a survey study to test if the VBN-theory could explain socially responsible investments in this group of active investors. Results showed that the model could account for the mixed motive of egoistic financial beliefs and altruistic concerns that motivate SRI among active private stock-investors. Taken together, the four studies enrich the understanding of motives that guide different groups of investors to become socially responsible investors...|$|R

They are all good stories; many of them focus on the unintended consequences of the ideas of their creators, specifically Thomas Malthus and John Maynard Keynes, who have both become known as measurers, but were really more interested in unmeasurable concepts. It all starts with eccentric Jeremy Bentham who tried to measure happiness, then progresses to his utilitarian followers John Stuart Mill and Thomas Malthus. One problem with counting that became evident from this era was that it gave no solutions or causality, just data. Next he describes the political self-esteem movement started by California politician John Vasconcellos in consultation with his friend Jack Canfield, author of the popular self-esteem self-help book Chicken Soup for the Soul. A lot of Vasconcellous' ideas came from the Esalen Institute in the mountains near Big Sur, where Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of human needs theory was popularized.

40|$|The article {{concerns}} the theorization of shareholder responsibility and <b>ethical</b> <b>investing.</b> The article develops the following arguments, among others: If public corporations pursue stockholder profits “pathologically,” as claimed by some critical scholars, {{it is not}} because of any obligation arising under corporate law, but because the pursuit of stockholder profits is congenial to the stockholders. For this reason (and others discussed in the article), shareholders have an ethical stake in the conduct of corporate business, quite apart from any notion that shareholders “own” the corporation. A phenomenon which the article terms “bounded empathy,” analogous to “bounded rationality”, can help to explain why, in practice, shareholders’ sense of ethical engagement is more limited than one might wish. Although unimpeachable {{from the standpoint of the}} “nexus of contracts” conception of the corporation, the concept of <b>ethical</b> <b>investing</b> is awkward for corporate law theorists who advocate a rule of exclusive profit-maximization. These theorists respond by characterizing <b>ethical</b> <b>investing</b> as either irrational and aberrant, or else rational and pernicious, both of which characterizations are misguided. The article also considers the implications of the foregoing for two concrete questions arising under corporate law in connection with <b>ethical</b> <b>investing,</b> specifically (a) whether the law should filter out ethically-motivated shareholder proposals; and (b) whether disclosure of matters relevant to ethical analysis of corporate conduct should be mandatory...|$|E

While arguments exist that <b>ethical</b> <b>investing</b> can inßuence a Þrm’s cost of capital, and so affect investment, no equilibrium model has been presented to do so. We show that exclusionary <b>ethical</b> <b>investing</b> leads to ”polluting ” Þrms being held by fewer investors since ”green ” investors eschew polluting Þrms ’ stock. This lack of risk-sharing among ”non-green” investors leads to lower stock prices for polluting Þrms, thus raising their cost of capital. If the higher cost of capital more than overcomes a cost of reforming (i. e., a polluting Þrm cleaning up its activities), then polluting Þrms will become socially responsible because of exclusionary <b>ethical</b> <b>investing.</b> A key determinant of the incentive of polluting Þrms to reform is the fraction of funds controlled by green investors.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of 'ethical' and 'socially responsible' investment (SRI) {{have become increasingly}} popular {{in recent years and}} funds which offer this kind of investment have attracted many individual investors. The present book addresses the issue of 'How ought one to invest?' by critically engaging with the ideas of the proponents of this movement about what makes 'ethical' investing ethical. The standard suggestion that <b>ethical</b> <b>investing</b> simply consists in refraining from investing in certain 'morally unacceptable companies' is criticised for being both too rigid (often resting on absolute moral rules which lead to an austere conclusion) and too ineffective for individual investors (investors who after all control {{only a small part of}} the investment universe). Furthermore, the idea that <b>ethical</b> <b>investing</b> could consist in engaging more actively with the companies one invests in, in order to make them change their ways and become more socially responsible, is criticised for being just as ineffective for individual investors. Some more radical alternatives are elaborated on and defended - for instance, the suggestion that investors should make as much money from their investments as possible and then donate the proceeds to socially worthwhile charities. From similar suggestions, the common idea that there is no conflict between morality and profitability, or that genuinely <b>ethical</b> <b>investing</b> can be just as profitable as mainstream investing, is criticised for being too naïve. Making a difference may indeed require personal sacrifice of investors, but it is argued that the needs of the possible recipients of philanthropy are morally more important than the luxury of investment returns...|$|E

30|$|There is much {{heterogeneity}} in {{the current}} academic literature concerning agreed-upon terminology for the above-mentioned movements. While Cowton (1999) summarizes the discussion on how to refer to these investment types as a “matter of taste,” Dorfleitner and Utz (2012) {{do not see the}} need for a general definition of SRI, stating that sustainability means something different for every individual investor, and that sustainable investments sufficiently summarize every desirable non-financial impact an investment may have. Nevertheless, scholars have sought to find an appropriate terminology. Typical terms used are SRI, <b>ethical</b> <b>investing,</b> or value-based investing (Sandberg et al. 2009). <b>Ethical</b> <b>investing</b> is the oldest phrase, which is slowly being replaced by SRI (Sparkes 2001). Although the terms are inconsistent in the academic literature, Sandberg et al. (2009) find that definitions of SRI are consistent in that it means the “integration of certain non-financial concerns, such as ethical, social or environmental, into the investment process.” This paper follows the broader majority of research and uses the term SRI. While this term defines the active task of investing in a SR manner, the term corporate social responsibility (CSR) is used in the academic literature to describe a company’s ethical and responsible behavior. It describes companies that integrate social and ecological topics into their corporate governance (Pinner 2003 : 87). By implementing CSR, the companies establish a basis for SR investors, to consider their company as a potential investment. Or vice versa, the shareholders use their voting rights to move the company’s management in a more SR direction (Sparkes and Cowton 2004).|$|E

30|$|In {{traditional}} finance, it {{is assumed}} that individuals make their investment decisions only on the basis of financial considerations such as return, risk and liquidity (e.g., Markowitz 1952; Tobin 1958; Sharpe 1964; Lintner 1965). During the last decades, a new investment behavior, known as sustainable, ethical or socially responsible investing (SRI), has emerged and increasingly attracts attention both in the practitioner and academic literature. In this article, the terms sustainable, ethical and socially responsible are used as synonyms. SRI is generally considered as the inclusion of personal values and other non-financial concerns—often structured into social, environmental, ethical and corporate governance issues—in the investment process. While <b>ethical</b> <b>investing</b> has ancient origins in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, the roots of the modern SRI development {{can be found in the}} political climate of the 1960 s (Renneboog et al. 2008). A comprehensive overview of the existing literature on SRI is provided by von Wallis and Klein (2014).|$|E
