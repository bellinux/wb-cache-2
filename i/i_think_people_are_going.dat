500|$|On {{the quality}} of 3-D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, [...] "I think it's good, actually. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the {{work has been done}} very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really {{impressed}} with it, actually." [...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Not really, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{with the}} radio {{thing you have to}} be really careful; {{at the end of the}} day Feeder's not a typical daytime radio band, but what we've done is that we've proved that a guitar band - a British guitar band, and a band that doesn't have the profile of U2 or someone can still get into the top ten. It is possible!, it just seems to be that it's always the big American bands who sort of {{dominate}} the top ten; a Limp Bizkit or whatever, but saying that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the whole Travis and Coldplay thing has been really good as sort of a stepping stone, and also <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> getting fed up of just seeing Westlife or Steps on the TV. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> finding rock, and real bands again - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that the market is currently so bombarded with pop stuff that we're just quite refreshing.

Commenting on her role, Turner said [...] "I was speechless when I found out that I had been cast as Stacey Slater especially as I knew I would be working with Jessie Wallace who is my favourite actress. I've watched the show since I was about four years old, and I used to live in a house that backed onto the EastEnders set so I used to watch them filming all the time. I always dreamt of being on the show and so I can't believe that I've fulfilled my greatest ambition!" [...] She added, [...] "I'm not like Stacey at all although I love playing her!

There's a couple of up-tempo tunes, but mostly the rhythm of the heartbeat kind of takes precedence on this record. Medium-tempo tunes; which I love. It feels more like the pace of life.
