5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} <b>field</b> <b>test</b> program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Field</b> <b>testing</b> of {{software}} {{is necessary to}} find potential user problems before market deployment. The large number of users involved in <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> along with the variety of problems reported by them increases the complexity of managing the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> process. However, most <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> processes are monitored using ad-hoc techniques and simple metrics (e. g., the number of reported problems). Deeper analysis and tracking of <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results is needed. This paper introduces visualization techniques which provide a global view of the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results. The techniques focus on the relation between users and their reported problems. The visualizations help identify general patterns to locate the problems. For example, the technique identifies groups of users with similar problem profiles. Such knowledge helps {{reduce the number of}} needed users since we can pick representative users. We demonstrate our proposed techniques using the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results for four releases of a large scale enterprise application used by millions of users worldwide...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Field</b> <b>testing</b> {{is always}} less {{controlled}} than laboratory testing. This increases {{the variability of}} the types and magnitudes of stress in <b>field</b> <b>testing.</b> The resulting data, therefore, are more varied: larger standard deviation, less precision and accuracy, etc. This leads {{to the use of}} larger sample sizes for <b>field</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>testing</b> of {{software}} applications developed for mobile devices {{is a challenge}} due to unique features of mobile devices. Unreliability of wireless networks, limited bandwidth, changing context, phasing network disturbance or noises problems and different data transfer time for different applications. Methodologies used in testing of desktop applications cannot be directly applicable to a mobile context. The large number of users involved in <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> along with the variety of problems reported by them increases the complexity of managing the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> process. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to propose a generic framework, detecting noise and estimation of time for different applications to conduct <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> for mobile applications with focus on <b>field</b> <b>testing,</b> detecting network disturbance and estimation of time for different mobile applications...|$|R

40|$|In general, <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> of {{concrete}} dams {{has not been}} widely embraced by dam owners {{and it is not}} typically regarded as an essential component in the process of evaluating the seismic performance of these massive structures. Over the years, proponents of <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> and the use of measured response behavior to validate numerical models have had difficulty convincing the broader consulting community of the added value associated with the costs of <b>field</b> <b>testing.</b> This is not to say, however, that the importance of <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> is not fully appreciated or understood. This paper is intended to present a current viewpoint associated with the state of <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> {{of concrete}} dams and the potential benefits derived from the availability of test data in evaluating seismic performance. A brief description of a recently completed seismic evaluation is discussed and presented as a case study to investigate the role played by the associated <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> and inspection program...|$|R
40|$|Leg muscle {{strength}} (LMS) and leg muscle power (LMP) are determinants of aspects of functional status and important parameters for measuring intervention effects in older adults. <b>Field</b> <b>tests</b> {{are often used}} {{for the evaluation of}} LMS and LMP in older persons. However, criteria important for the application of strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> in older adults have not been systematically taken into account and are not yet fully listed and described in a single publication. Therefore, this paper describes criteria important for the application of strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> in older adults. In addition, strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> commonly used in older adults are evaluated by using the described criteria. Based on this evaluation, this paper provides a perspective on the further development of <b>field</b> <b>tests.</b> Criteria important for strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> are: adequate accuracy, precision, concurrent validity, clinical validity, practical feasibility and pure strength or power outcomes. Commonly used strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> do not meet all the aforementioned criteria. Therefore, further development of <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> is necessary. Mobile sensing systems are potentially useful for the evaluation of LMS and LMP in older adults. Mobile sensing systems do not have the limitations of commonly used <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> and provide important additional advantages. In particular, mobile sensing systems offer the opportunity of continuous monitoring during free-movement in the home-environment, thereby reducing the need of standardized assessments by health-care professionals. Future studies should examine the clinical validity of mobile sensing systems and evaluate the application of sensor technology in exercise-based interventions...|$|R

30|$|When {{evaluating}} HCI, <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> aim at ecologically valid conditions by embedding {{the actual}} usage in an authentic daily situation.

In contrast to experiments, which reduce or control potential influence factors, results from <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> are typically much harder to interpret because of unknown or uncontrolled variables, and do not allow for causal inferences (Bernsen and Dybkjær 2009; Dix et al. 2003).|$|R

25|$|After {{the massacres}} perpetrated by the Mark I robots, Judge Stich {{was unable to}} bear {{his share of the}} {{responsibility}} for the disaster and he went insane. He was committed to a psychiatric ward, from where he would persistently escape and search the sewers for the rogue Number Five. It was therefore generally assumed that McGruder had learned her lesson and that the project had been discontinued. It suited McGruder to allow people to think so. However, she still authorised the development of Mark IIs, this time under the purview of Tek-Judge Quiggley. After another year of work, Quiggley almost had the improved robots ready for a second <b>field</b> <b>test</b> when Number Five re-emerged from the sewer and began a third campaign of murder. This time Number Five had learned to go to ground after each attack, and all efforts to locate it failed. Taking personal charge of the search, McGruder brought forward the new robots' <b>field</b> <b>test</b> and deployed them on the streets, reasoning (wrongly as it transpired) {{that the best way to}} anticipate the next move of a robot was to use other robots to hunt it.|$|E
