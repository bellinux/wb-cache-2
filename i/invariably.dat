5|$|Image {{filters are}} linear filters and are <b>invariably</b> also passive in implementation.|$|E
5|$|A {{decreased}} {{level of}} cultural repression {{has taken place}} in the Turkish Republic, however non-mainstream Turkic origin place names have <b>invariably</b> been officially renamed over the course of time.|$|E
5|$|Relative to {{most other}} elements, {{commercial}} applications for europium {{are few and}} rather specialized. Almost <b>invariably,</b> its phosphorescence is exploited, either in the +2 or +3 oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{spread quickly}} to cover several cantons, whereas {{previous}} uprisings in the Confederacy had <b>invariably</b> been local affairs.|$|E
5|$|Although in the English {{language}} borscht refers almost <b>invariably</b> to a beet-based soup, in some culinary cultures {{there exist}} soups {{with the same}} or similar names where beetroots are absent or merely optional. The principal common trait among them is a tart flavor obtained by adding various sour-tasting ingredients.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, {{although there is}} <b>invariably</b> a wind shift.|$|E
5|$|If the {{designated}} hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each {{team has a}} tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH {{takes the place of}} another player—almost <b>invariably</b> the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.|$|E
5|$|In a {{great many}} —indeed in most— localities there are wild horses to be found, which, {{although}} <b>invariably</b> of domestic descent, being either themselves runaways from some ranch or Indian outfit, or else claiming such for their sires and dams, yet are quite as wild as the antelope on whose domain they have intruded.|$|E
5|$|My {{object in}} the present work is to paint the rich Jew in his true colors, as the enemy of society; {{to show that the}} Jew who steals millions, can, in Europe, at any rate, defy the laws with impunity, and that he almost <b>invariably</b> escapes {{punishment}} owing to improper occult influences, and the mighty power of Israelitish gold.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is {{considered}} to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur, or basal to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The stegosaur classification has fallen out of favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. Cladistic analyses have <b>invariably</b> recovered a basal position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the medieval}} Germanic languages, elf {{was one of}} the nouns that was used in {{personal}} names, almost <b>invariably</b> as a first element. These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in Albio- such as Albiorix.|$|E
5|$|A Kentucky {{governor}} is elected under our constitution {{for four years}} without legal opportunity, regardless of how acceptable his program has been, to put it before the public for approval or rejection. In practical application he must successfully run the legislative gauntlet during the first hurried ninety days he is in office {{if he is to}} adopt a program and have an administration worthy of history's harsh pen. The remaining general assembly two years hence is <b>invariably</b> plagued with vicissitudes common to 'lame duck' tenures.|$|E
5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process <b>invariably</b> leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; <b>invariably,</b> the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{existed in}} China from about 1st century AD {{and in the}} West from the High Middle Ages. They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was <b>invariably</b> charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot blast), patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{supported}} British {{involvement in}} the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured. While the pace of research was easing as the war entered its final phase, these scientists were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise {{them away from the}} wartime projects in which they were <b>invariably</b> engaged.|$|E
5|$|Colbert dropped {{hints of}} a {{potential}} presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, I Am America (And So Can You!), which was rumored (<b>invariably</b> by Colbert himself) to {{be a sign that}} he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating he had not yet made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E
5|$|Delacroix's figure wears a pileus, and Bartholdi {{at first}} {{considered}} placing {{one on his}} figure as well. Instead, he used a diadem, or crown, to top its head. In so doing, he avoided a reference to Marianne, who <b>invariably</b> wears a pileus. The seven rays form a halo or aureole. They evoke the sun, the seven seas, and the seven continents, and represent another means, besides the torch, whereby Liberty enlightens the world.|$|E
5|$|Designing the in-game propaganda, {{they studied}} {{its use in}} history, finding {{the same pattern of}} {{elements}} reappearing throughout the centuries. In place of the militarily inspired propaganda of the first game, Dishonored 2 would employ a subtler approach; lavish posters for <b>invariably</b> canceled enterprises meant to aid the people of Serkonos were made to exhibit the nature of tyranny as practised by the Duke of Serkonos and his government. To further detail the world, the narration team would come up with fictitious products and brand names and make advertisements of them.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} <b>invariably</b> laid on plants. Each species of {{butterfly}} {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in the bridges and the water tower, the structures are built in brick or stone. The stone is almost <b>invariably</b> red sandstone, obtained from local quarries in the Runcorn, Weston, and Halton areas. Unless stated otherwise, the buildings (except the bridges and the water tower) are constructed in local red sandstone with slate roofs. Their locations {{can be found on}} the map of all coordinates.|$|E
5|$|Few Privy Counsellors are {{required}} to attend regularly. The settled practice is that day-to-day meetings of the Council are attended by four Privy Counsellors, usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining. The Cabinet Minister holding the office of Lord President of the Council, currently the Rt Hon. Andrea Leadsom , <b>invariably</b> presides. Under Britain's modern conventions of parliamentary government and constitutional monarchy, every order made in Council is drafted by a Government Department and has already {{been approved by the}} Minister responsible—thus actions taken by the Queen-in-Council are formalities required for validation of each measure.|$|E
5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was <b>invariably</b> alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|From its {{founding}} in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{is believed to have}} been little more than a scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked Manchester to York. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, Oldham does appear in legal documents from the Middle Ages, <b>invariably</b> recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is not surprising given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would <b>invariably</b> descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|In order, therefore, to {{establish}} an important point of theory, {{and at the same}} time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors, whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor, whom they <b>invariably</b> try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self-conceit, I submit the following variations which at any rate possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} during the 18thcentury copper boom, it was {{customary}} throughout the Cornish mining industry to use bal maidens purely as casual labour. There are no records of bal maidens being contracted to a particular mine or paid a piece-rate {{for the amount of}} work done. Instead, mine accounts <b>invariably</b> show them being paid a fixed daily rate and employed only as and when they were needed. When poor weather conditions made surface-level work impossible, water shortages meant water-powered machinery could not operate, or accidents in the mines caused a temporary closure, the bal maidens would be suspended.|$|E
5|$|It mostly breeds in acacia and {{tamarisk}} scrub {{and tall}} grass, <b>invariably</b> near rivers or other wetlands. The construction {{and expansion of}} irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.|$|E
5|$|Kei Iwasaki of {{the band}} Sekaiichi, writing for Musica, felt that Ichiro Yamaguchi's dual love of 1990s pop music and {{electronic}} musicians such as Daft Punk and Cornelius strongly expressed itself throughout the album. He lauded Sakanaction's efforts to mix electronica and pop, but felt that mixing these two genres was a double-edged sword that <b>invariably</b> influenced the composition of songs. Because of this, he felt that Night Fishing might be more successful musically if the songs were re-recorded.|$|E
5|$|Llanbadarn Fawr was {{the focus}} of the English forces {{assembled}} in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By this time the rector was <b>invariably</b> an absentee cleric; John de Camera, Rector 1329–1334 was also canon of St David's, Hereford and Abergwili, and was a government clerk. Then, as now, such a large and remote charge invited pluralism and non-residence. There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the rector was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.|$|E
5|$|Many half-tracks, jeeps {{and trucks}} foundered in deep water; those {{that made it}} ashore soon became jammed up on the {{narrowing}} beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, <b>invariably</b> needed cleaning before they could be used.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost <b>invariably</b> started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of players have been called in top-class matches — Test matches, One Day Internationals and {{domestic}} first-class matches — <b>invariably</b> creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers. Often the player {{has been able to}} modify his action to appease his critics and the umpires, but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called on more than one occasion, his career in international cricket is effectively ended.|$|E
5|$|P. rebeli pupae prey {{upon their}} broodmates, while {{producing}} sugar-rich secretions which worker ants imbibe. In one experiment, P. rebeli specimens which consumed ant larvae developed {{more quickly than}} those who did not. However, despite their nourishing offering to the community, they <b>invariably</b> imposed a net loss in the survival rates of workers and broodmates, demonstrating that the species is parasitic (rather than mutualistic) at all stages in its host colony.|$|E
5|$|PD <b>invariably</b> {{progresses}} with time. A severity rating method {{known as}} the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) is {{the most commonly used}} metric for clinical study. A modified version {{known as the}} MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the Hoehn and Yahr scale (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{transmission}} of Bob & Rose, Davies was approached by Abbott to write for his new BBC show Linda Green. He accepted the offer and wrote an episode where the titular character (portrayed by Liza Tarbuck) and her friends attend a schoolmate's funeral and become psychologically haunted by the deceased woman's solitary life. His first work for the BBC in eight years prompted them to approach him with additional concepts for period dramas, which he <b>invariably</b> declined as his sole intent was to revive Doctor Who, which had then been on hiatus for over a decade.|$|E
