Dr.Dre also told Scratch {{magazine}} in a 2004 interview that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying</b> piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying</b> {{a freeway}} upgrade for US131 through St. Joseph County for several years. In late 2005, MDOT {{decided not to}} pursue an upgrade of the highway, but {{rescinded}} that decision in April 2006 under political pressure in the state. The department began building a two-lane bypass west of Constantine. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which {{is in charge of}} US Highway numbering assignments and routings, approved the relocation of the US 131 designation out of Constantine on November 16, 2012. The group's Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering also approved the creation of a business route for the old highway through town. The bypass opened on October 30, 2013, and the business route designation was put into service that day.|$|E

During his career, Italian striker Roberto Baggio had two occurrences where his shot hit the upper bar, bounced downwards, rebounded off the keeper and passed the goal line for a goal.|$|E
25|$|Environmental stress {{may have}} been {{reflected}} by changes in the social structure, leading to conflict and warfare. Near Kayenta, Arizona, Jonathan Haas of the Field Museum in Chicago <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying</b> a group of Ancestral Puebloan villages that relocated from the canyons to the high mesa tops during the late 13th century. Haas believes that the reason to move so far from water and arable land was defense against enemies.

The cranium, he says, shows evidence of a first shot with a small gun, like a pistol, and then, a second shot from a larger weapon—like an AK-47—which could mean that Allende was shot and killed, then shot a second time with his own gun, {{to make it look like}} suicide.|$|E
