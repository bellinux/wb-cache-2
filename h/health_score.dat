40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} a Norwegian version of the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire (ERI-Q). Methods One thousand eight-hundred and three employees in a medium-sized Norwegian municipality replied to the ERI-Q, and health-related variables such as self-reported general health, psychological distress, musculoskeletal complaints, and work-related burnout were examined. Results Sound psychometric properties were found for this Norwegian version of the ERI-Q. When the two dimensions of ERI and overcommitment were analyzed in four types of employees, the results showed that employees characterized by a combination of high values on ERI and overcommitment had more unfavorable <b>health</b> <b>scores</b> than others. Employees with low effort-reward and overcommitment scores had more favorable <b>health</b> <b>scores.</b> Employees with scores on the overcommitment and the effort-reward scales that are supposed to have opposite effects on health (that is, the combination of low overcommitment with a high effort-reward score and vice versa), had <b>health</b> <b>scores</b> somewhere in between the two other groups. Conclusion Satisfactory psychometric properties were found for most of the latent factors in the ERI-Q. The findings also indicate that it may be fruitful to explore health conditions among employees with different combinations of effort-reward and overcommitment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death in adults in both the United States and Argentina. The {{scientific}} literature has consistently shown the effects of behaviors and risk factors on cardiovascular health; however, most studies of modifiable behaviors and CVD risk factors examine older adults and elderly, and few have investigated behaviors and CVD risk factors in early adulthood. We assessed the associations between main cardiovascular behaviors and cardiovascular risk factors among 1, 000 young adults in a cross-cultural analysis between the United States and Argentina. Methods: A web-based survey assessed student development in the areas of demographic information, current medical information, personal health history, family health history, personal habits, and knowledge of cardiovascular health. We organized our survey and vital statistics measurements into eight variables: Body Mass Index (BMI), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), Resting Pulse, Country, Gender, <b>Health</b> History <b>Score,</b> <b>Health</b> Knowledge <b>Score,</b> <b>Health</b> Habit <b>Score.</b> We tested our data through principle component analysis, bivariate correlations, and independent sample T-tests. Results: Overall correlations showed that MAP is significantly negatively correlated with <b>health</b> history <b>score</b> and <b>health</b> knowledge <b>score.</b> In addition, MAP is significantly positively correlated with BMI. We also analyzed correlations by gender and country and found significant correlations there as well. By means of T-tests, we found significant differences between the means of MAP, <b>health</b> history <b>score,</b> <b>health</b> habit <b>score,</b> and knowledge score between both the female populations of Argentina and the US and the male populations of Argentina and the US. Conclusions: In conclusion, young adults with low prevalence of cardiovascular health behaviors have low prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors. After thorough analysis we saw that, cross culturally, correlations exist between CVD risk factors and CV behaviors that are consistent in both populations. Health habit, health knowledge, health history and BMI are all significantly correlated with mean arterial pressure. T-tests showed that population groups with higher CVD risk factor means also had lower behavior means, indicating that populations with poor CVD behavior correlate with an accumulation of CVD risk factors...|$|R

Using original survey data from diabetic patients receiving treatment at Vancouver’s Mid-Main Community Health Centre, the study shows that almost 60 per cent of Mid-Main’s diabetic patients self-rate their health as Very Good or Good.

Nonetheless, a study with long-term data suggested that albeit quality of life of patients 15 years after sex reassignment surgery is similar to controls, their scores in the domains of physical and personal limitations were significantly lower. On the other hand, research has found that quality of life of transsexual patients could be enhanced by other variables. For instance, trans men obtained a higher self-perceived <b>health</b> <b>score</b> than women because they had a higher level of testosterone than them.

Method: A cross-sectional design was used for this study. Children with CP, without other identified disease, aged 2 to 6 years, who drool (n = 33) or did not drool (n = 14), were included. The dependent variables were the physical <b>health</b> summary <b>scores</b> and the psychosocial <b>health</b> summary <b>scores</b> of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4. 0.
