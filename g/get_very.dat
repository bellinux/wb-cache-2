5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who <b>get</b> <b>very</b> ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E

25|$|Austro-Daimler were at {{that time}} {{developing}} a lightweight electric motor for aircraft use, but would take several years to develop one {{able to handle the}} electrical power required.

25|$|According to the Koppen Climate Classification Austria has the {{following}} climate types: Oceanic (Cfb), Cool/Warm-summer humid continental (Dfb), Subarctic/Subalpine (Dfc), Tundra/Alpine (ET) and Ice-Cap (EF). Its {{important to note}} though that Austria in general does not <b>get</b> <b>very</b> cold in winter but rather cool in summer at higher altitudes. The subarctic and tundra climates seen around the Alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere {{due in part to}} the Oceanic influence on this part of Europe.|$|E
25|$|The tiny islets {{this species}} inhabits around Dinagat provide {{striking}} micro-habitats, often having near-vertical rock walls and highly vegetated tops. Here, N.viridis plants occasionally grow lithophytically, their roots anchored in fissures. Where present, surrounding vegetation provides {{support for the}} plants' scrambling vines, though these may overhang the sheer rock faces, dangling only a few metres from the water. Exposed to direct sunlight, the dark rock walls can <b>get</b> <b>very</b> hot, and during particularly dry periods any N.viridis plants in close proximity will largely wither, leaving only a few green shoots.|$|E

Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies.This requires the use of a lid to cover the hole in the floor when not in use. However, in practice, such a lid is not commonly used as it is easy to lose it or for the lid to <b>get</b> <b>very</b> filthy.|$|E

25|$|While Larry and Jennifer's romance blossomed, Balki and Mary Anne's {{relationship}} {{moved more}} slowly: the pair would <b>get</b> <b>very</b> close, but then back off after fleeting moments of passion, then drift back into affection. Many viewers' predictions came true {{in the spring}} of 1991 when Larry proposed to Jennifer, after feeling competition from her old flame who was trying to woo her back. Jennifer accepted, and they started planning a wedding. As the 1990–91 season closed, it was clear that despite Larry's impending marriage, he and Balki's relationship would somehow remain a focal point of the show.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide {{slavery is}} a {{criminal}} offense but slave owners can <b>get</b> <b>very</b> high returns for their risk. According to researcher Siddharth Kara, the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were $91.2 billion. That {{is second only to}} drug trafficking in terms of global criminal enterprises. The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labour and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave. Approximately 40% of slave profits each year are generated by trafficked sex slaves, representing slightly more than 4% of the world's 29 million slaves.|$|E
25|$|Around Ukiah, in {{the center}} of the large Mendocino AVA to the east of the Mendocino Ranges, the climate can <b>get</b> <b>very</b> hot warm during the growing season with mean July {{temperatures}} during the peak ripening month often in excess of 73°F (23°C). The average annual rainfall of 38 inches (964mm) is mostly consolidated in the winter months, which means that drought is a common viticultural hazard that often requires supplemental irrigation. The warm allows this part of the county develop full bodied and very ripe red wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel.|$|E

25|$|Karnaugh {{maps are}} used to simplify {{real-world}} logic requirements {{so that they can}} be implemented using a minimum number of physical logic gates. A sum-of-products expression can always be implemented using AND gates feeding into an OR gate, and a product-of-sums expression leads to OR gates feeding an AND gate. Karnaugh maps can also be used to simplify logic expressions in software design. Boolean conditions, as used for example in conditional statements, can <b>get</b> <b>very</b> complicated, which makes the code difficult to read and to maintain. Once minimised, canonical sum-of-products and product-of-sums expressions can be implemented directly using AND and OR logic operators.|$|E
25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something {{if they can get}} something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers <b>get</b> <b>very</b> little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E
25|$|San Antonio International Airport uses {{a system}} for its evening arrival {{aircraft}} using the terminals. Once all flights that are classified as passenger departures have departed, The airport would usually <b>get</b> <b>very</b> crowded in the terminal area, thus having no room for other aircraft. The San Antonio Airport Authority figured that a plan was needed to be placed into action. The plan was to have an arriving passenger aircraft park at a gate that is operated by their airline. Once all the passengers and crew are deplaned, and all servicing is completed on that aircraft, The plane will then be towed by a tug to the West Cargo area to sit parked overnight and give room for other aircraft.|$|E
