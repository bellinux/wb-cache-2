5|$|The United States Forest Service made {{it their}} highest {{priority}} {{fire at the}} time because of the threat to local communities and its proximity to Yosemite National Park. Though Giant Sequoia trees, {{some of the biggest}} and oldest living things on Earth, are very <b>fire-tolerant</b> and need fire to reproduce, concerns rose as the fire approached them. Park officials set sprinklers to help protect nearby Sequoia trees, but the sprinklers were later removed and careful low-intensity prescribed burns were used. Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the fire perimeter where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area. Smoke from the fire caused unhealthy air conditions in Reno, Nevada, and the Lake Tahoe area {{during the first week of}} the fire, forcing the cancellation of several outdoor events. School children were sent home due to smoky conditions as well. From Yosemite to the San Joaquin Valley, air quality reached unhealthy levels several times according to the National Weather Service. Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, a family camp operated by the city of Berkeley, established in 1922, was burned to the ground. Nearby Camp Tawonga suffered some damage, including the loss of three buildings. Camp Mather, operated by the city of San Francisco, suffered minor damage, as did the San Jose Camp run by the city of San Jose.|$|E
25|$|The current superdominance of Eucalyptus in Australia {{may be an}} {{artefact}} {{of human}} influence on its ecology. In more recent sediments, numerous findings of {{a dramatic increase in}} the abundance of Eucalyptus pollen are associated with increased charcoal levels. Though this occurs at different rates throughout Australia, it is compelling evidence for a relationship between the artificial increase of fire frequency with the arrival of Aboriginals and increased prevalence of this exceptionally <b>fire-tolerant</b> genus.|$|E
500|$|In the Wheatbelt {{and east}} of the Stirling Range, it is a stunted tree. Tree forms have a solid trunk, {{generally}} wavy or bent, with [...] thick crumbly orange-grey bark which is a red-brown underneath. It regenerates from fire via lignotuber or epicormic buds from its <b>fire-tolerant</b> trunk. It has long narrow shiny green linear leaves [...] long and [...] wide. The leaf margins have v- or u-shaped serrations along their length. The new growth is a pale grey-green, and occurs mainly in the late spring and summer, often after flowering. The brilliant yellow inflorescences (flower spikes) occur from spring into summer and are up [...] wide and up to [...] tall. They {{are made up of}} many small individual flowers; a study at Mount Adams [...] north of Perth revealed a count of 1933 (± a standard error of 88) flowers per inflorescence, and another in the Fitzgerald River National Park yielded a count of 1720 (± 76) flowers. Anthesis proceeds up the flower spike over about 10 to 20 days, and is asynchronous. That is, a plant produces flower spikes over a several week period and will thus have spikes at different stages of development over the flowering season.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Fire-tolerant</b> {{species are}} able to {{withstand}} a degree of burning and continue growing despite damage from fire. These plants are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "resprouters." [...] Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire. For example, after an Australian bushfire, the Mountain Grey Gum tree (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa) starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves {{from the base of the}} tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves.|$|E
2500|$|The rare Santa Lucia fir (Abies bracteata) {{is found}} only in the Santa Lucia mountains. [...] A common [...] "foreign" [...] species is the Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), which was {{uncommon}} in Big Sur until the late nineteenth century, though its major native habitat {{is only a few}} miles upwind on the Monterey Peninsula, when many homeowners began to plant the quick-growing tree as a windbreak. There are many broadleaved trees as well, such as the tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), and California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica). [...] In the rain shadow, the forests disappear and the vegetation becomes open oak woodland, then transitions into the more familiar <b>fire-tolerant</b> California chaparral scrub.|$|E
2500|$|In {{chaparral}} {{communities in}} Southern California, for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire [...] This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) {{and the young}} plants can then capitalize {{on the lack of}} competition in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds. Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves. Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, <b>fire-tolerant</b> or fire-resistant.|$|E

50|$|Verticordia densiflora var. cespitosa is a shrub which {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 20-70 cm and has a <b>fire-tolerant</b> lignotuber. The leaves vary in shape from linear to egg-shaped and those near the flowers are 0.8-1.5 mm wide.|$|E
50|$|The bur oak {{is among}} the most <b>fire-tolerant</b> tree species. One of its most common habitats, {{especially}} in Midwestern United States, is the oak savanna, where fires often occurred in early spring or late fall, especially in hill country.|$|E
50|$|This plant usually {{grows in}} dry, rocky habitat types in forests and fields, but it {{sometimes}} occurs in moist {{areas such as}} bogs and swamps. It grows in acidic, well-drained soils. It is wildfire-adapted and associated with <b>fire-tolerant</b> vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Verticordia huegelii var. decumbens is a shrub {{which usually}} grows to 5-20 cm high, 30-50 cm wide, has a <b>fire-tolerant</b> {{lignotuber}} {{and sometimes a}} suckering habit. Its leaves are linear to club-shaped, semi-circular in cross-section, 3-6 mm long and about 0.5 mm thick.|$|E
50|$|Vaccinium myrtilloides grows best in open {{coniferous}} {{woods with}} dry loose acidic soils; {{it is also}} found in forested bogs and rocky areas.

50|$|Plants {{have evolved}} {{a variety of}} {{strategies}} to survive (or even require) bushfires, (possessing epicormic shoots or lignotubers that sprout after a fire, or developing fire-resistant or fire-triggered seeds) or even encourage fire (eucalypts contain flammable oils in the leaves) {{as a way to}} eliminate competition from less <b>fire-tolerant</b> species.|$|E
50|$|Over 40% of the Zayante sandhills {{region has}} been lost to human {{activity}} such as development and sand mining.

Fire suppression {{has led to an}} alteration of the normal flora of the area, with <b>fire-tolerant</b> plants being replaced by other species.|$|E
5000|$|The Vaccinium angustifolium {{plant is}} <b>fire-tolerant</b> and its numbers often {{increase}} {{in an area}} following a forest fire. Traditionally, blueberry growers burn their fields every few years {{to get rid of}} shrubs and fertilize the soil.

50|$|Pollen {{analysis}} in a peat deposit in the Canada del Gitano basin {{high in the}} Sierra de Baza suggests that the Argaric exhausted precious natural resources, helping bring about its own ruin. The deciduous oak forest that covered the region's slopes were burned off, leaving a tell-tale carbon layer, and replaced by the <b>fire-tolerant,</b> and fire-prone, Mediterranean scrub familiar under the names garrigue and maquis.|$|E

50|$|This {{subspecies}} is the shrubby, <b>fire-tolerant</b> form of B. ashbyi. It grows as {{a sprawling}} shrub {{up to about}} two metres high, with a lignotuber. This {{is in contrast to}} the autonymic subspecies, B. ashbyi subsp. ashbyi, which lacks a lignotuber, and grows as a tree up to seven metres in height. In addition, the leaves of B. ashbyi subsp. boreoscaia are consistently grey-green in colour, whereas those of B. ashbyi subsp. ashbyi are usually deep green.|$|E
50|$|This common willow can {{be found}} growing along streams and in other moist areas in the Arctic and above the timberline. It also grows in spruce forests and {{woodlands}} and areas that have recently burned. It grows on floodplains and other habitats that flood periodically. It grows on pingos and the open tundra. This species stabilizes eroding streambanks, and it can easily colonize disturbed areas and bare sites where debris has been cleared. It is <b>fire-tolerant,</b> resprouting easily after much of its aboveground mass has been burned.|$|E
5000|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from ash deposits in the Coral Sea indicates that fire {{was already a}} significant part of the Australian landscape over 100,000 years ago. [...] Over the last 70,000 years it became more frequent with one explanation being the use by hunter-gatherers as a tool to drive game, to produce a green flush of new growth to attract animals, and to open up impenetrable forest. Gammage claims that dense forest became more open sclerophyll forest, open forest became grassland and <b>fire-tolerant</b> species became more predominant: in particular, eucalyptus, acacia, banksia, casuarina and grasses.|$|E
5000|$|This regular firing favoured {{not only}} <b>fire-tolerant</b> or {{fire-resistant}} plants, but also encouraged those animals which were favoured by more open country. On this basis, {{it is clear}} that Aboriginal burning, in many areas at least, did affect the [...] "natural" [...] ecosystem, producing a range of vegetation associations which would maximise productivity in terms of the food requirements of the Aborigines. Jones {{goes so far as to}} say that [...] "through firing over thousands of years, Aboriginal man has managed to extend his natural habitat zone" [...] (Jones, 1969).|$|E

50|$|Douglas-firs are seral {{trees in}} {{temperate}} rainforest, and possess thicker bark and a somewhat faster growth rate {{than most other}} climax trees of the area, such as the western hemlock and western redcedar. This quality often gives Douglas-firs a competitive advantage when the forest experiences a major disturbance such as fire. Periodically, portions of a Pacific Northwest lowland forest may be burned by wildfire, may be logged, or may be blown down by a wind-storm. These types of disturbances allow Douglas-fir to regenerate in openings, and low-intensity fires often leave Douglas-fir trees standing on drier sites, while less drought- and <b>fire-tolerant</b> species are unable to get established.|$|E
50|$|This species {{grows in}} a wide variety of habitat types, {{including}} Ponderosa Pine forests, sagebrush, chaparral, pinyon-juniper woodland, and many types of grassland and prairie. It is drought-tolerant because of its deep roots, though it does become less abundant in times of drought. It is also <b>fire-tolerant,</b> able to resprout from its rhizome and disperse its wind-carried seeds to soil cleared of litter by fire. On plains and prairies it grows with many types of grasses, such as Scribner's panic grass (Panicum scribnerianum) and tumble grass (Schedonnardus paniculatus), and wildflowers such as heath aster (Symphyotrichum ericoides), tick-trefoil (Desmodium sessilifolium), and oldfield goldenrod (Solidago nemoralis). It is a host plant for the hemiparasitic wholeleaf Indian paintbrush (Castilleja integra).|$|E

50|$|The main {{threat to}} the plant is {{probably}} fire. In 1996 a fire at the Yakima Training Center traveled out to the ridge and burned the population. About 800 plants, or 15% of the population, died. It is not a <b>fire-tolerant</b> species. The plant appears {{to be sensitive to}} heat, and even unburned, merely singed plants died. In addition, the species apparently does not respond positively to fire events as some plants do, by resprouting from the woody base or producing an abundance of new seedlings. Fire also increases the spread of introduced species of plants such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and the cover of cheatgrass then increases the likelihood and severity of fire. Firefighting activity may damage the plants.|$|E
50|$|Plants in wildfire-prone {{ecosystems}} often survive through {{adaptations to}} their local fire regime. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate competition. For example, plants of the genus Eucalyptus contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less <b>fire-tolerant</b> species. Dense bark, shedding lower branches, and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures. Fire-resistant seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation, as embodied by pioneer species. Smoke, charred wood, and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds in a process called serotiny. Exposure to smoke from burning plants promotes germination in other types of plants by inducing {{the production of the}} orange butenolide.|$|E
50|$|These {{forests are}} limited to areas of high {{rainfall}} and good soils. In waterlogged soils, the rainforest flora gives way to Melaleuca thickets, and on poor soils and in drier areas Eucalyptus becomes dominant. The rainforest flora is intolerant of fire, and where periods of drought have allowed devastating fires, the rainforest flora has retreated, allowing <b>fire-tolerant</b> Eucalyptus to become established. If a relatively wet period persists, the rainforest flora may reestablish itself. It is thought that the land management practices of the aboriginal Australians, which involve setting regular fires to keep the eucalyptus woodlands open, may have encouraged the expansion of eucalyptus forests {{at the expense of}} the rainforest flora. These rainforests seem to have retreated considerably since the arrival of the aboriginals' ancestors 50,000 years ago, and are presently limited to isolated pockets comprising less than 2% of the continent's area.|$|E
5000|$|In {{chaparral}} {{communities in}} Southern California, for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire [...] This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) {{and the young}} plants can then capitalize {{on the lack of}} competition in a burnt landscape.

5000|$|The {{coevolution}} of gritty, fibrous, <b>fire-tolerant</b> {{grasses and}} long-legged gregarious ungulates with high-crowned teeth, {{led to a}} major expansion of grass-grazer ecosystems, with roaming herds of large, swift grazers pursued by predators across broad sweeps of open grasslands, displacing desert, woodland, and browsers. The higher organic content and water retention of the deeper and richer grassland soils, with long term burial of carbon in sediments, produced a carbon and water vapor sink. This, combined with higher surface albedo and lower evapotranspiration of grassland, contributed to a cooler, drier climate. [...] C4 grasses, which are able to assimilate carbon dioxide and water more efficiently than C3 grasses, expanded to become ecologically significant {{near the end of}} the Miocene between 6 and 7 million years ago. The expansion of grasslands and radiations among terrestrial herbivores correlates to fluctuations in CO2.|$|E
50|$|An {{examination}} of swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from Lynch's Crater in Queensland suggests that hunting {{may have been}} the primary cause of the extinction. Analysis of Sporormiella fungal spores (which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores) in the cores shows that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago, at a time when climate changes were minimal; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal, and was followed by a transition from rainforest to <b>fire-tolerant</b> sclerophyll vegetation. The high-resolution chronology of the changes indicates that fire increased about a century after the disappearance of browsing megafauna, probably due to accumulation of fuel. Grass increased over the next several centuries; sclerophyll vegetation increased following a lag of another century, and a sclerophyll forest developed about a thousand years later. Earlier increases in sclerophyll vegetation during shifts to cooler, drier conditions about 120,000 and 75,000 years ago did not have any obvious impact on megafaunal abundance.|$|E
