Ideally one would simply measure the downward atmospheric neutrino flux and compare it with the upward neutrino flux from the opposite direction and use the ratio Earth-in to <b>Earth-out</b> to measure the density profile {{in a way that}} is independent of the intrinsic angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino beam. In reality this unfortunately cannot be done because the relatively high intensity of downward atmospheric muons hides the downward atmospheric neutrinos. Because of the close genetic relation between v [...]...|$|E
