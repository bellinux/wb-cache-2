5|$|Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful {{that his}} {{grandmother}} {{gives him a}} Remembrall, although he cannot remember why. Neville's magical abilities are weak and appeared <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> save his life when he was eight. Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 628 CTMS tanks were {{ordered by the}} Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. Of these, a small number were {{delivered}} to Java, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> see combat in the Dutch East Indies campaign following the Japanese invasion in early 1942. 149 from this order were diverted to Australia where they were used for training. 600 CTLS-4TACs and 4TAYs were delivered to China under Lend-Lease after Pearl Harbor. After the war, the Indonesian Army {{is reported to have}} used several captured Dutch vehicles, with the type remaining in Indonesian service until 1949 amidst the Indonesian National Revolution.|$|E

5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her right hand to avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using her right hand, it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match {{and go on to}} defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree that they had a great date night.|$|E
5|$|As one on an {{official}} mission, Wright {{would probably have}} offered greetings to Leopold's ambassador extraordinary in London, the Marqués de Lede, and to Alonso de Cárdenas, the regular Habsburg ambassador, who had also been engaged since 1649 in art procurement for the Spanish Monarch. The lack of records means that the timing and duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de Cárdenas {{a few weeks later}} – as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> learn of the Archduke's impending departure – and that of his huge art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.|$|E
5|$|Despite these performances, {{he was not}} {{initially}} offered a contract for 2006. Eventually in August 2006, he was again signed as a late-season overseas player for Lancashire <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> appear in the C Trophy final against Sussex, taking 2/28 and scoring a duck in a 15-run defeat. He took eight wickets at 17.25 in four one-dayers, and six wickets at 39.00 in three first-class matches with a best of 3/89, as well a 40 with the bat against Hampshire.|$|E

5|$|In July 1857, Macdonald {{departed}} for Britain to promote Canadian government projects. On {{his return to}} Canada, he was appointed premier {{in place of the}} retiring Taché, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> lead the Conservatives in a general election. Macdonald was elected in Kingston by 1,189votes to 9 for John Shaw, who was subsequently hanged in effigy; other Conservatives, however, did badly in Canada West, and only French-Canadian support kept Macdonald in power. On 28 December, Isabella Macdonald died, leaving John A. Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son. Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.|$|E
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> avoid a head-on collision, but {{the change}} in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard {{side of the ship}} for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|Morgan placed marksmen at {{strategic}} positions, {{who then}} picked off virtually every {{officer in the}} advance company. Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that they were headed directly for Burgoyne's main army. While they succeeded in driving back the advance company, Fraser's leading edge arrived <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attack Morgan's left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who had ridden forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements. As the British company fell back toward the main column, {{the leading edge of}} that column opened fire, killing a number of their own men.|$|E

5|$|Perseus was {{completed}} in 1945, {{after the end of}} World War II, and she made a trip to Australia late in the year, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> help return men, aircraft and equipment. Upon her return to the UK in early 1946, Perseus was placed in reserve. The ship was recommissioned in 1950 to serve as the trials ship for the steam catapult then under development. Over 1600 test launches were conducted before the catapult was removed in 1952 and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier to transport aircraft, troops and equipment overseas. She was reduced to reserve again in 1954 and sold for scrap in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Roman forces Sullivan to {{work with}} him in finding the treasure. Despite {{numerous}} warnings that the treasure and the island are haunted, Roman continues to use his men in search of the treasure. Roman captures Fisher, but Drake and Sullivan catch up to him, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> see Roman about to leave with the statue. However, Navarro tells Roman the real treasure is inside the statue. Roman opens the statue to collect the riches inside. As soon as Roman does, he is cursed and zombified. Apparently angered at this betrayal, Roman savagely charges towards Navarro, who shoots Roman in the head and reveals to Drake that he intended to sell the statue as a weapon the whole time.|$|E
5|$|Roy {{was persuaded}} to rejoin Melchester as manager and part-owner, {{backed by the}} unscrupulous Vinter brothers, and he arrived <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> save the club from relegation. The {{following}} season, Roy and Rocky resolved their differences. Rocky rejoined Melchester, and the club was promoted back into the Premier League {{at the end of}} the year. When the magazine closed in 2001, Rovers were attempting to achieve a league placing that would secure them UEFA Champions League football, giving them financial security. Although this storyline was never resolved, there was nevertheless a certain sense of closure as, shortly beforehand, Roy Sr. had wrested full control of the club from the Vinters, thus completing his 44-year progression from player to owner.|$|E

5|$|The French {{hoped that}} Julius III would be {{hostile to the}} {{interests}} of the Holy Roman Empire. Nevertheless, tensions between him and the French boiled over when he reconvened the Council of Trent in November 1550, culminating in the threat of schism in August 1551 and the brief War of Parma fought between French troops allied with Ottavio Farnese and a papal-imperial army. French prelates did not attend the 1551–1552 sessions of the Council of Trent and were slow to accept its reforms; because Henry II would not allow any French cardinals to reside in Rome, many missed the election of Pope Marcellus II, arriving in Rome <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> elect Marcellus II's successor Pope Paul IV after Marcellus II's brief reign.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, is being {{given a chance to}} prove her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with an uncanny knack for arriving <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> see his victims' final moments. What she does not expect, however, is for Death to play a role himself.|$|E

Snake restrains Nystrom until the police arrive to take him away.|$|E

5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 the two battalions of the Turkish 77th Infantry Regiment were in position, {{and with}} the 27th Infantry they counter-attacked again. At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, {{requested}} reinforcements. The second time he was informed {{there was only one}} uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the Turks would get behind him. At 17:00 Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who sent them to the south forming on the left of the 8th Battalion along Bolton's Ridge. They arrived <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.|$|E

The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E
