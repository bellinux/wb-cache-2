25|$|Moreover, {{since the}} Supreme Court has {{recognized}} voting {{as a fundamental}} right, the Equal Protection Clause places very tight limitations (albeit with uncertain limits) on the states' ability to define voter qualifications; it is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that qualifications beyond citizenship, residency, and age are usually questionable.|$|E
25|$|The basic or {{classical}} twin-design {{contains only}} identical and fraternal twins raised in their biological family. This represents only a sub-set {{of the possible}} genetic and environmental relationships. It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> therefore, that the heritability estimates from twin designs represent {{a first step in}} understanding the genetics of behavior.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that SA and New Guinea are linguistically {{the poorest}} {{documented}} {{parts of the}} world. However, in the early 1960s fairly systematic efforts were launched in Papua New Guinea, and that areamuch smaller than SA, to be sureis in general much better documented than any part of indigenous SA of comparable size.|$|E

25|$|It was Laplace {{who found}} the first answers {{explaining}} the remarkable dance of the Galilean moons (see below). It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that this general field of study has remained very active since then, with plenty more yet to be understood (e.g., how interactions of moonlets with particles of the rings of giant planets result in maintaining the rings).|$|E
25|$|It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that {{scholars}} remain slightly puzzled that the effective and simple penannular brooch developed in this direction, {{though it is}} presumed that the reuniting of the terminals of pseudo-penannular brooches was partly to strengthen the brooch. In many penannular brooches, {{the gap between the}} terminals is now too narrow for the pin to pass through; whether this was always the case is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{allegedly}} overly unrealistic {{assumptions are}} one of the most common criticisms towards neoclassical economics. It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that many (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making). Its disregard for social reality and its alleged role in aiding the elites to widen the wealth gap and social inequality is also frequently criticized.|$|E
60|$|And {{yet there}} were some limits to what could be tolerated even by so Bohemian an assembly. A murmur of anger {{followed}} {{in the wake of}} two roisterers who were making their way down the path. It would, perhaps, be <b>fairer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> one roisterer; for of the two it was only the first who carried himself with such insolence, although it was the second who ensured that he could do it with impunity.|$|R

25|$|It is {{probably}} <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that nobody could have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor {{was that they}} would constantly be second-guessed by those who thought they knew exactly what Wingate would have done in a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} three schools mentioned, this approach, {{associated}} with Joseph Maréchal (1878–1944), Karl Rahner (1904–84), and Bernard Lonergan (1904–84), does not oppose modern philosophy wholesale, but seeks to reconcile Thomism with a Cartesian subjectivist approach to knowledge in general, and Kantian epistemology in particular. It seems <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that most Thomists otherwise tolerant of diverse approaches to Aquinas's thought tend to regard transcendental Thomism as having conceded too much to modern philosophy genuinely to count as a variety of Thomism, strictly speaking, and this school of thought has in any event been far more influential among theologians than among philosophers.|$|E

60|$|Then he had {{a scheme}} for {{inviting}} the girl to his own house, and to that scheme he obtained his wife's consent. But here his courage failed him; or, it might be <b>fairer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that his prudence prevailed. He was very anxious, intensely eager, so to arrange this great family dispute that all should be benefited,--believing, nay feeling positively certain that all concerned in the matter were honest; but he must not {{go so far as}} to do himself an absolute and grievous damage, should it at last turn out that he was wrong in any of his surmises. So that plan was abandoned.|$|R

He called journalist Vincent Sheean a [...] "lying Communistic yellow ——." [...] According to a contemporary account, [...] "In this situation, even though it’s <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] was just doing his job, it’s equally clear that he was a loose cannon. His personality dominated the scene, and it was the personality of a bully." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with NME in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album Everyday Robots, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything {{to get excited about}} yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know. It would be <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> we have discussed it at least once." ...|$|E
500|$|Minogue's {{efforts to}} be taken seriously as a {{recording}} artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not [...] "paid her dues" [...] and {{was no more than a}} manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, [...] "If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1980 Neil Powell {{could write}} that [...] "It is {{probably}} <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Philip Larkin is less highly regarded in academic circles than either Thom Gunn or Donald Davie". But more recently Larkin's standing has increased. [...] "Philip Larkin {{is an excellent}} example of the plain style in modern times," [...] writes Tijana Stojkovic. Robert Sheppard asserts that [...] "It is by general consent that the work of Philip Larkin is taken to be exemplary". [...] "Larkin is the most widely celebrated and arguably the finest poet of the Movement," [...] states Keith Tuma, and his poetry is [...] "more various than its reputation for dour pessimism and anecdotes of a disappointed middle class suggests".|$|E
500|$|Voss {{returned}} from leave on 23 September 1917 {{not yet fully}} rested; as fellow pilot Leutnant Alois Heldmann observed: [...] "He had the nervous instability of a cat. I {{think it would be}} <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was flying on his nerves." [...] Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E
500|$|According to Chad Meister, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert Adams says that [...] "it is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil." [...] William Alston has said that [...] "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing." [...] William L. Rowe has written [...] "granted incompatibilism, there is a fairly compelling argument for {{the view that the}} existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.|$|E
60|$|As it was, however, {{there seemed}} every {{possibility}} of their getting the guns, but De Wet very cleverly covered them by his skirmishers. Taking {{possession of a}} farmhouse on the right flank they kept up a spirited fire upon the 16th Lancers and upon P battery R.H.A. When at last the latter drove {{them out of their}} shelter, they again formed upon a low kopje and poured so galling a fire upon the right wing that the whole movement was interrupted until we had driven this little body of fifty men from their position. When, after a delay of an hour, the cavalry at last succeeded in dislodging them--or possibly it may be <b>fairer</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> when, having accomplished their purpose, they retired--the guns and wagons were out of reach, and, what is more important, the two Presidents, both Steyn and Kruger, who had come to stiffen the resistance of the burghers, had escaped.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>fair</b> today <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that none}} of the major Restoration Movement groups willingly embrace Sommer as a {{primarily}} positive figure in their background. The independent Christian churches and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) certainly do not since it was largely through his efforts that formal division came. But even in Churches of Christ the name of Daniel Sommer is now most often cited in a negative context to condemn divisive behavior.|$|R

500|$|We {{must live}} with our {{virtually}} complete ignorance of Padarn’s life. It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> however, {{that if he}} had died at Llanbadarn {{there would have been a}} shrine, traditions of which would have survived for centuries; none are recorded. Therefore, we can see him as one of the more peripatetic of the missionaries of this period, who spent sufficient time in the Rheidol valley to attract a community of Christian men to him which was sufficiently strong to survive his departure. It could have been these followers in subsequent generations who would have established churches in the saint's name in mid-Wales (Llanbadarn Fynydd, Llanbadarn Garreg), and in Ceredigion (Llanbadarn Odwyn, Llanbadarn Trefeglwys [...] ), if he didn't establish them himself.|$|E

He also made the cover of Time in Asia; Forbes wrote, [...] "Congratulations Jeremy. You have now made the cover of Time the same number of times as Michael Jordan. Linsanity reigns on." [...] Lin's story was also on the front-page of many Taipei newspapers. [...] "I haven't done a computation, but it's <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that no player has created the interest and the frenzy in this short period of time, in any sport, that I'm aware of like Jeremy Lin has," [...] said NBA commissioner David Stern.|$|E
500|$|Dwarf Fortress {{was praised}} for its depth and complexity. Jonah Weiner from The New York Times stated, [...] "Many {{simulation}} games offer players {{a bag of}} building blocks, but few dangle a bag as deep, or blocks as small and intricately interlocking, as Dwarf Fortress." [...] PC Gamer's Steve Hogarty commented, [...] "Dwarf Fortress's reluctance to expend even a joule of energy in prettying itself results in astonishing hidden complexity." [...] Regarding the open-ended nature and emergent gameplay, Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Graham Smith found that with its procedurally generated world and characters simulated [...] "down to the most minute detail", the game's results are [...] "often hilarious, occasionally tragic, and always surprising." [...] Mike Rose from Gamasutra said, [...] "...to an outsider looking in on this game so many years into development, with such a wide scope of features and potential play styles, it's <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that getting into Dwarf Fortress is {{perhaps one of the}} most daunting tasks the video game industry as a whole can provide." ...|$|E
60|$|It is only <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Miss Taft {{had never}} {{indicated}} {{in any way}} that she was mortgaged to another, and no one--so far as I could see, was more in her favor than I, hence I was not entirely to blame in the case.

As a result, Edinson Cavani moved to centre-forward. First-choice goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu was rested for PSG, with Nicolas Douchez starting instead. A BBC preview to the match said, [...] "Champions League heartbreak, losing your best player through injury and then being beaten by tonight's opponents in your last game.
