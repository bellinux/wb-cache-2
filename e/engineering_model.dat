40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{introduces a}} robust design approach using <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> described by implicit mathematical functions. In this paper, the scheme {{to describe the}} <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> using implicit functions is explained first. The relationships between product functional performance variations and design parameters are then derived from these implicit functions. An optimal robust design model is subsequently introduced to minimize functional performance variation. A case study is given to illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} robust design approach with <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> described by implicit mathematical functions...|$|R

2500|$|In February 2007 seven {{detectors}} {{showed signs}} of degradation, with one IR channel almost completely degraded, and one other showing advanced signs of degradation. The problems seemed to disappear when higher temperatures were used to take pictures with the camera. As of March, the degradation appeared to have stabilized, but the underlying cause remained unknown. [...] Subsequent experiments with the <b>Engineering</b> <b>Model</b> (EM) at Ball Aerospace provided definitive evidence for the cause: contamination in the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) which results in flipping bits to create the apparent noise or bad data in the images, combined with design flaws leading to delivery of poor analog waveforms to the ADCs. Further work showed that the degradation can be reversed by heating the ADCs.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950s {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the modern project management era where core engineering fields come together to work as one. Project management became recognized as a distinct discipline arising from the management discipline with <b>engineering</b> <b>model.</b> In the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an ad-hoc basis, using mostly Gantt charts and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical project-scheduling models were developed. The [...] "critical path method" [...] (CPM) was developed as a joint venture between DuPont Corporation and Remington Rand Corporation for managing plant maintenance projects. The [...] "program evaluation and review technique" [...] (PERT), was developed by the U.S. Navy Special Projects Office in conjunction with the Lockheed Corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton as part of the Polaris missile submarine program.|$|E

Transitions between the design phases stem from decision-making processes supported both by generally available domain and design knowledge and from unique and original knowledge worth of recording for future reuse. The Clockwork project addresses the problems of representing, sharing and reusing knowledge in a collaborative design engineering environment. The Clockwork knowledge management methodology is supported by a web-based toolkit that allows designers to share, formally and informally annotate and reuse <b>engineering</b> <b>models.</b> Reuse is supported through the semantic search of <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> and of the design rationale by which the <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> were developed.

40|$|Process {{modelling}} is {{the foundation}} of developing process controllers for monitoring and improving process/system health. Modelling process behaviours using a pure empirical approach might not be feasible due to limitation in collecting large amount of data. <b>Engineering</b> <b>models</b> provide valuable information about processes’ general behaviours but they might not capture distinct characteristics in the particular process studied. Many recent publications presented various ideas of using limited experimental data to adjust <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> for making them suitable for certain applications. However, the focuses there are global adjustments, where modification of <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> impacts the entire model-application region. In practice, some <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> are only valid in a part of experimental data domain. Moreover, many discrepancies between <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> and experimental data are in local regions. For example, in a chemical vapour deposition process, at high temperatures a process may be described by a diffusion limited model, while at low temperatures the process may be described by a reaction limited model. To address these problems, this article proposes two approaches for integrating engineering and data models: local model calibration and local model averaging. Through the local model calibration, the discrepancies between <b>engineering’s</b> first-principle <b>models</b> and experimental data are resolved locally based on experts’ feedbacks. To combine models adjusted locally in some regions and also models required little adjustments in other regions, a model averaging procedure based on local kernel weights is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on simulated examples, and compared against a well-known existing global-adjustment method. ope...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen gas {{produced}} from the {{renewable energy source}} can be the prefect future energy carrier. It will not only reduce the demands for depleting hydrocarbons fuels but will also help in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. The 20 -ft ISO standard containers are widely considered for building self-contained portable fuel cell based power generation units. Safety analysis of these installations is essential to prevent any future catastrophic accidents. The present paper evaluates existing <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> to predict vented explosion peak overpressures {{in case of an}} accident release of hydrogen in these container. Such predictions are required in the design of venting panels, which are commonly used to prevent damage to enclosures by reducing overpressure of combusting gases. Although various <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> and empirical correlations have been developed, a number of which have been included in engineering standards and guidelines [4 - 7]. These correlations, however, often have conflicting recommendations [3]. None of the <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> in the public domain have been validated with vented hydrogen tests data in realistic configurations, such as ISO shipping containers, used in hydrogen energy applications. Evaluating/improving these <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> with the aid of full scale experimental data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based numerical modelling is a main objective of the HySEA project supported by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH 2 JU) under the Horizon 2020 Framework Program for Research and Innovation. The present study aims to assess capabilities of existing <b>engineering</b> <b>models</b> for vented deflagrations of lean hydrogen-air mixtures. As hydrogen has much higher flame speeds than hydrocarbon fuels like methane and propane, {{it is not possible to}} use models derived for hydrocarbons directly with hydrogen flames. The leaner flames of hydrogen are also susceptible to instabilities like Darius-Landau instability, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which are often overlooked in the derivation of <b>engineering</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R
