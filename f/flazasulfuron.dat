50|$|<b>Flazasulfuron</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{that is used}} as a herbicide. It is classified as a sulfonylurea, because it contains that functional group. The mode of action of <b>flazasulfuron</b> is the inhibition of the enzyme acetolactase synthase (ALS), which results in the inhibition of amino acid synthesis, cell division and ultimately plant growth. <b>Flazasulfuron</b> can be used on both pre-emergent weeds and post-emergent weeds. Growth ceases within hours of the application of the compound. Symptoms include leaf discolouration, desiccation, necrosis and ultimately plant death within 20 - 25 days of application. It is a white, water-soluble solid.|$|E

5000|$|ALS inhibitors: the acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme (also {{known as}} acetohydroxyacid synthase, or AHAS) {{is the first}} step in the {{synthesis}} of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine). These herbicides slowly starve affected plants of these amino acids, which eventually leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. They affect grasses and dicots alike. The ALS inhibitor family includes various sulfonylureas (SUs) (such as <b>Flazasulfuron</b> and Metsulfuron-methyl), imidazolinones (IMIs), s (TPs), pyrimidinyl oxybenzoates (POBs), and sulfonylamino carbonyl triazolinones (SCTs). The ALS biological pathway exists only in plants and not animals, thus making the ALS-inhibitors among the safest herbicides.|$|E

Spotlight at 1. 0 pt/A alone was only effective at about 50 %. BAS- 514 and BAS- 790 were not effective against khakiweed when applied alone. In a second experiment, sequential applications of Speedzone and Spotlight plus Turflon Ester provided exceptional control of greater than 95 %. Initial applications of the POST applications that were combined with Gallery offered control of new emerging seedlings of khakiweed. Monument combined with Gallery gave decreased khakiweed control compared to Monument applied alone. An antagonistic effect could be occurring with the tank-mix combination of the two herbicides. Carfentrazone containing products, QuickSilver at 2 oz/A alone was not effective on khakiweed compared to the package mix product Speedzone. For the ALS-inhibiting herbicides, <b>flazasulfuron</b> and Certainty were the least effective while penoxsulam and Image were comparable to Monument in providing about 50 % control...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar a eficiência da cabina do trator, de dois tipos de ponta de pulverização e de duas posições da barra do pulverizador montado em trator em aplicações de herbicidas na cultura de cana-de-açúcar, como medidas de proteção coletiva para a atividade de tratorista, separadamente ou combinadas; e classificar a segurança dessas condições de trabalho com as 46 recomendações de herbicidas registradas. As exposições dérmica e respiratória do tratorista foram quantificadas em aplicações com o pulverizador equipado com barra traseira ou central, associadas com pontas com indução de ar, modelo Turbo TeeJet Air Induction® (TTI- 11004 VP), e sem indução de ar, modelo Turbo Floodjet® (TF-VP 3), e o trator sem e com cabina. Foram calculadas as margens de segurança (MS) para 46 recomendações de aplicação de herbicidas nessas condições de trabalho. Pelos valores de MS calculados, as condições de trabalho foram classificadas como seguras (MS > 1) ou inseguras (MS This {{work was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of the}} tractor cabin, two nozzle models and two bar positions of a tractor-mounted sprayer in herbicide applications on sugar cane crop as a collective protection measure for tractor driver activity, separately or combined; and to classify the safety of these working conditions according to the 46 recommendations of registered herbicides. The truck driver´ s skin and respiratory organ exposures were quantified in applications with the sprayer equipped with back or central bar, nozzles with air induction, Turbo TeeJet Air Induction® (TTI- 11004 VP) model and without air induction, Turbo Floodjet® (TF VP 3) model, and tractor with and without cabin. The safety margins (SM) for 46 herbicide application recommendations under these work conditions were calculated. Based on the calculated MS values, the work conditions were classified as safe (SM e" 1) or unsafe (SM > 1). The safest work conditions for the tractor driver were when the sprayer was combined with the central bar, tractor cabin and TTI model nozzles. With sprayer with central bar without cabin, of the 46 herbicide recommendations, imazapyr, trifloxysulfuron-sodium, imazapic, glyphosate, amicarbazone, hexazinone, sulfentrazone, clomazone, oxadiazon, isoxaflutole, pendimethalin, <b>flazasulfuron,</b> tebuthiuron, ethoxysulfuron and acetoclor were considered safe for the truck driver. With cabin use, metribuzin and s-metalochlor applications were also considered safe.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of six ALS herbicides for controlling purple nutsedge in bermudagrass turf was demonstrated in five field experiments {{during the summer}} of 2004. The highest degree of nutsedge control at 95 % {{at the end of the}} summer was observed after three monthly applications of trifloxysulfuron at 0. 026 lb a. i. /A [...] Three monthly applications of halosulfuron at 0. 062 lb a. i. /A controlled nutsedge 88 to 90 % at the end of September to early October. Imazaquin at 0. 5 lb a. i. /A plus MSMA at 3. 0 lb a. i. /A gave 91 % control of nutsedge with three applications. The most rapid and efficacious nutsedge control was observed with <b>flazasulfuron</b> giving 91 % control at 15 days after a single application. The highest degree of nutsedge control with a single application of sulfosulfuron was 91 to 96 % control at 28 days after treatment. In general, ALS herbicides applied as a single application or multiple applications provided one month of effective control following a first application. After one month, the degree of control declined unless repeated applications at monthly intervals or as needed were applied for extended control. Penoxsulam at 0. 12 lb a. i. /A in one test gave only 70 % control. MSMA at 3. 0 lb a. i. /A was applied four times and nutsedge control at the end of the season was 63 to 66 %...|$|E
40|$|Vegetatively {{propagated}} warm-season turfgrasses {{are established}} with methods {{that rely on}} large quantities of propagation material and subsequent plant growth support. The precision seeding adopted for some seed propagated crops controls the depth and spacing at which seeds are placed in the soil. Sprigs that are reduced in length could potentially be suitable for existing machinery, and precision planting could enhance the efficiency of use of the propagation material. The aim {{of the present study}} was to carry out a preliminary screening on products known to act as plant growth regulators to explore their potential use for controlling stolon development and elongation of ‘Patriot’ hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x C. transvaalensis) grown in pots for propagation purposes. Trinexapac-ethyl (TE), chlormequat chloride (CM), paclobutrazol (PB), propiconazole (PPC), diquat (DQ), <b>flazasulfuron</b> (FS), glyphosate (GP), ethephon (EP), and gibberellic acid (GA) were applied to pot-grown ‘Patriot’ hybrid bermudagrass turf in eight different application rates, ranging for each product from the minimum expected effective rate to a potentially harmful rate. Of the tested treatments, TE applied at 2. 0 kg·ha - 1 and PB applied at 1. 0 kg· ha - 1 reduced stolon and internode length without causing a reduction in the stolon number or turf quality. PPC was also effective in reducing stolon length, but the effect on internode length was not statistically significant. Stolon length was unaffected by CM, while DQ and GP induced stolon elongation. FS, EP, and GA affected stolon length without a consistent relation between stolon length and application rate. The chemical suppression of stolon elongation in pot-grown ‘Patriot’ hybrid bermudagrass can contribute to controlling sprig size for use with precision seeding machinery...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} first {{results of}} Phyt'Eaux Cites, a program {{put in place}} by the local water supply agency, the SEDIF (Syndicat des Eaux d'Ile-de-France), in collaboration with 73 local authorities, private societies and institutional offices (365 km(2)). The challenges included: measurement of the previous surface water contamination, control of urban pesticide applications, prevention of pesticide hazard on users and finally a overall reduction of surface water contamination. An inquiry on urban total pesticide amount was coupled with a surface water bi-weekly monitoring to establish the impact of more than 200 molecules upon the Orge River. For 2007, at least 4400 kg and 92 type of pesticides (essentially herbicides) were quantified for all urban users in the Phyt'Eaux Cites perimeter. At the outlet of the Orge River (bi-weekly sampling in 2007), 11 molecules were always detected above 0. 1 mu g L- 1. They displayed the mainly urban origin of pesticide surface water contamination. Amitrole, AMPA (Aminomethyl Phosphonic Acid), demethyldiuron, diuron, glyphosate and atrazine were quantified with a 100 % of frequency in 2007 and 2008 at the Orge River outlet. During the year, peaks of contamination were also registered for MCCP, 2, 4 MCPA, 2, 4 D, triclopyr, dichlorprop, diflufenican, active substances used in large amount in the urban area. However, some other urban molecules, such as isoxaben or <b>flazasulfuron,</b> were detected with low frequency. During late spring and summer, contamination patterns and load were dominated by glyphosate, amitrole and diuron, essentially applied by cities and urban users. Both isoproturon and chlortoluron were quantified during autumn and winter months according to upstream agricultural practices. In conclusion, 3 years after the beginning of this programme, the cities reduced the use of 68 % of the total pesticide amount. An improvement on surface water quality was found from 2008 and during 2009 for all pesticides. In particular, glyphosate showed a decrease of the load above 60 % in 2008, partly related to the Phyt'Eaux Cites action. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
