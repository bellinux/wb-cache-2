40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{introduction}} of the connotation of agricultural <b>industrialized</b> cluster, the thesis introduces the competitive advantages of agricultural <b>industrialized</b> cluster as follows: firstly, it makes the cluster of agricultural production factors gather and curtails the agricultural production costs; secondly it enhances the innovation abilities of industries; thirdly it improves the urbanization level of rural areas and increases farmers’ income. The thesis also analyzes the status quo of agricultural <b>industrialized</b> cluster, points out the advantages of resources, cost, location and so on, and discuses the existing problems of the <b>industrialized</b> cluster in Henan province as follows: firstly, the scale of agricultural <b>industrialized</b> cluster is small and the <b>industrialized</b> chain is short; secondly, {{there is a shortage of}} leading enterprises, and the radiating effect within <b>industrialized</b> cluster is not prominent; thirdly, the organization degree of agricultural <b>industrialized</b> cluster is weak, lacking scientific innovation ability. In order to solve the existing problems, the corresponding countermeasures are put forward as follows: firstly, take the market as the orientation, strengthen the policies formulation and accelerate the development of <b>industrialized</b> cluster in Henan by leaps and bounds; secondly, choose suitable developing models of agricultural <b>industrialized</b> cluster.

As the first <b>industrialized</b> nation, English economists first proposed the "free economy" and "free trade" policies.

A one standard deviation increase in exchange rate uncertainty leads to an eight per cent increase in trade volatility. These effects differ markedly for trade ﬂows between <b>industrialized</b> countries and NICs, and are not mitigated by the presence of the Eurozone.

25|$|Most {{periphery}} countries rely {{almost entirely}} on agriculture and other natural resources such as oil, coal, and diamonds {{in order to gain}} some sort of profit, but this also keeps them from growing economically. In order for them to grow they must <b>industrialize</b> in order to produce finished goods for exportation around the world, instead of allowing the core countries to profit from their natural resources. Industrializing and adapting newer technology {{is one of the major}} ways in which periphery countries can begin to raise their standard of living and help increase the wealth of their citizens. Becoming industrialized also will help to force trade to come to their cities, if they can produce goods at competitive prices, allowing them to reach out to the global market and take hold. Once a periphery country can <b>industrialize,</b> and use its own resources to its own benefit, it will begin to enter semi-periphery status.|$|E

Hence, {{applicability of}} lean principles and practices to <b>industrialized</b> housing production is clearly {{influenced by a}} production culture that has similarities to a traditional construction culture. Setting up <b>industrialized</b> housing production thus requires careful implementation of lean principles if workers from traditional building are moved into factories, and managers still adhere to the prevailing site-based production mentality.

40|$|Using a world multi-sectoral, multi-regional trade model, {{this paper}} has {{investigated}} the economic and environmental implications of climate control coalitions cooperating on R&D investment that triggers low cost environmentally friendly technologies. We start with the Kyoto scenario where all Annex B <b>industrialized</b> countries (including the US) are assumed to individually meet their mandatory Kyoto greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. Next, we consider <b>industrialized</b> country’s cooperating on climate control and R&D-induced technological innovations. We then expand climate control coalition to include developing countries. Finally, we investigate the implications of additional R&D investment from <b>industrialized</b> countries to developing countries. Our results clearly demonstrate that cooperation on climate control and R&D among <b>industrialized</b> countries induces technological innovations, lowers their compliance costs and thus places less strong economic burden on these countries. But without developing countries getting involved in climate control and R&D investment, such a cooperation alone is unable to completely offset negative economic effects of the emissions reduction commitments on both <b>industrialized</b> countries themselves and developing countries. Recognizing the importance of developing countries’ participation and their legitimate demand for adequate technology transfer and financing, the paper concludes that linking developing country’s cooperation on climate control with <b>industrialized</b> country’s R&D and technology transfer would produce win-win-win outcomes for both developing countries and <b>industrialized</b> countries and for the global environment...|$|R

To appraise studies on the prevalence of two CVD risk factors (hypertension and overweight/obesity) among two major West African populations (Ghanaians and Nigerians) in Africa and <b>industrialized</b> countries. A comprehensive literature search from 1996 to July 2012 was undertaken to identify quantitative studies on hypertension and overweight/obesity among adult Ghanaians and Nigerians in West Africa and <b>industrialized</b> countries.

Studies in Ghana and Nigeria reported a hypertension prevalence of 19. 3 - 54. 6 % with minimal differences between rural, urban, semi-urban, and mixed populations.
