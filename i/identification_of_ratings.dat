40|$|Unraveling the {{mechanisms}} underlying self and agency {{has been a}} difficult scientific problem. We argue for an event-control approach for naturalizing the sense of agency {{by focusing on the}} role of perception-action regularities present at different hierarchical levels and contributing to the sense of self as an agent. The amount of control at different levels of the control hierarchy determines the sense of agency. The current study investigates this approach in a set of two experiments using a scenario containing multiple agents sharing a common goal where one of the agents is partially controlled by the participant. The participant competed with other agents for achieving the goal and subsequently answered questions on identification (which agent was controlled by the participant), {{the degree to which they}} are confident about their <b>identification</b> (sense <b>of</b> <b>identification)</b> and the degree to which the participant believed he/she had control over his/her actions (sense of authorship). Results indicate a hierarchical relationship between goal-level control (higher level) and perceptual-motor control (lower level) for sense of agency. Sense <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>ratings</b> increased with perceptual-motor control when the goal was not completed but did not vary with perceptual-motor control when the goal was completed. Sense of authorship showed a similar interaction effect only in experiment 2 that had only one competing agent unlike the larger number of competing agents in experiment 1. The effect of hierarchical control can also be seen in the misidentification pattern and misidentification was greater with the agent affording greater control. Results from the tw...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a parsimonious and {{flexible}} multivariate Markov chain model for describing the dependency <b>of</b> transitions <b>of</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> credit risky entities.

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} {{effects of}} variability of visual input on development of conceptual representations of academic concepts {{for students with}} normal language (NL) and language-learning disabilities (LLD). Method: Students with NL (n= 38) and LLD (n= 11) participated in a computer-based training for introductory biology course concepts. Participants were trained on half the concepts under a low-variability condition and half under a high-variability condition. Participants completed a post-test {{in which they were}} asked to identify and rate the accuracy of novel and trained visual representations of the concepts. We performed separate repeated measures ANOVAs to examine the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> and <b>ratings.</b> Results: Participants were equally accurate on trained and novel items in the high-variability condition, but were less accurate on novel items only in the low-variability condition. The LLD group showed the same pattern as the NL group; they were just less accurate. Conclusions: Results indicated that high-variability visual input may facilitate the acquisition of academic concepts in both NL and LLD college students. Specifically, it may be beneficial for generalization to novel representations of concepts. Implicit learning methods may be harnessed by college courses to provide students with basic conceptual knowledge when entering courses or beginning new units...|$|R

The current work further investigated the role of non-phase locked activity in dissociation of the neural processes of environmental and personal risks. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy adults when they identified risky and safe environmental or personal events depicted in words or phrases. Event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) in association with risky and safe environmental and personal events were calculated using Morlet's wavelet analysis. We found that, relative to the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> safe environmental events, the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> risky environmental events induced increased theta band power at 260 - 380  ms over the frontal cortex and increased alpha band power after 700  ms with a wide scalp distribution. Moreover, theta band powers associated with the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> risky environmental events correlated positively with subjective <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> the risk degree of environmental events. In contrast, the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> risky personal events was linked to decreased alpha band power at 740 - 900  ms with a wide scalp distribution compared with the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> safe personal events. Our findings indicate that theta and alpha band neural oscillations are involved in differentiation between environmental and personal risks. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.
