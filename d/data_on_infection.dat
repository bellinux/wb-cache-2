40|$|Every year, {{thousands}} of outdoor trekkers worldwide visit high-altitude (12500 m) destinations. Although high-altitude areas per se do not harbor any specific agents, {{it is important}} to know the pathogens encountered in the mountains to be better able to help the ill sojourner at high altitude. These are the same pathogens prevalent in the surrounding lowlands, but various factors such as immunomodulation, hypoxia, physiological adaptation, and harsh environmental stressors at high altitude may enhance susceptibility to these pathogens. Against this background, various gastrointestinal, respiratory, der-matological, neurological, and other infections encountered at high altitude are discussed. Because there are few published <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infections</b> at high altitude, this review is largely anecdotal and based on personal experience. In this review, we identify and discuss infections commonly encountered at high altitude. Because there are few published <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infections</b> at altitude, this review is more anecdotal in nature and largely based on our personal experience. Although 2 of us (B.

40|$|Infection-surveillance is an {{important}} part of the infection control system serving the protection of patients and healthcare workers as well. The continuous surveillance of health care associated infections is among the most important fields of patient safety and quality management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the health care associated infections among patients at the neurointensive care unit. Moreover, we aimed to identify specific infection-forms and the most frequently occurring pathogens. We performed the study for a half-year according to the HELICS-method proposed by the National Center of Epidemiology. In this setup we evaluated the infections and risk factors for infection (instrument-use, antibiotic therapy etc.) among the patients who spent at least 48 hours in the neurointensive care unit. During the six-month period, we observed 16 health care associated mono- and polymicrobial infections out of the 88 cases. Mainly Gram-positive pathogens were identified, but we found multidrug-resistant pathogens as well. Clinically diagnosed pneumonia was the most frequent among the infections. These infections were detected by a relatively low microbiological testing rate, which warns to increase sampling frequency to ensure more accurate <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infections.</b> <b>Infection</b> control based <b>on</b> a comparative standardized infection dataset seems to be one of the most important preventive measures...|$|R

However, considering the increasing number of total knee arthroplasty, the increasing number of patients with multiple comorbidities, and the lifelong risk for acquiring hematogenous infection, the total number of PJI will further increase. Despite existing treatment concepts for PJI of the knee, there are still questions to solve, such as type of debridement surgery in case of implant retention, the role of a spacer from a microbiological perspective, and the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy.

40|$|Information on the {{prevalence}} of morbidity is needed for re-calculation of the Global Burden of Disease (WHO) due to Schistosoma mansoni. This study presents a statistical association {{which can be used}} to predict {{the prevalence}} of morbidity from {{the prevalence of}} S. mansoni in a community. We collected data from field studies reporting prevalence of infection and prevalence of morbidity. <b>Data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infection</b> prevalence were standardised to a default diagnostic sensitivity (i. e.

We determined associations between prevalence of infection and prevalence of early morbidity (diarrhoea, blood in stool and abdominal pain), hepatosplenic morbidity and late morbidity (haematemesis and ascitis). Diarrhoea and blood in stool due to S. mansoni infection mainly occurs in communities with a high prevalence of infection. An influence on hepatosplenic morbidity is already present at low community prevalence of infection. For the aspecific symptom abdominal pain we did not find an association...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Mathematical Modeling, 2014 Biological invasions are an {{important}} topic in today???s global economy. Thousands of animals, plants, and pathogens are being transported through human activity into new ecosystems with sometimes disastrous consequences. Phytophthora lateralis is a water-borne invasive root pathogen that is currently affecting Port Orford Cedar in riparian zones. Once a tree near a stream is infected the pathogen spreads rapidly down the stream. Thus {{it is reasonable to}} consider the infection of streams as opposed to individual trees. Probability of infection for stream crossings within the study site are hypothesized to depend on environmental factors and logging traffic. <b>Data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infection</b> dates, environmental variables, and logging traffic was collected for 77 stream crossings. The data were then used to parametrize infection probability models using maximum likelihood methods and optimization. The resulting model set was analyzed using AICc.

40|$|This {{literature}} review summarizes available <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infection</b> with the parasitic roundworm, Ascaridia galli, {{as a cause}} of disease in poultry, including the consequences of a conversion to alternative production systems. Ascaridia galli has a direct life cycle with resistant eggs that survive and are easily spread in the environment, especially in systems with bedding materials where the faecal contact is high. The infection is usually subclinical but depending on the infection dose, the symptoms range from weight loss and diarrhea to mortality. Factors such as the feed composition and genetic variation among different hybrids clearly affect the establishment rate of the infection. Ascaridia galli will probably become an increasing problem, with a shift from the traditional battery cages to alternative systems where the risk of re-infection is high. There is an increasing need for intensified research in this area to maintain a low infection pressure and thereby avoid the associated clinical and economic problems...|$|E

40|$|In Australia, the obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium Chlamydia pecorum is {{best known}} as the notorious koala pathogen that causes debilitating ocular and urogenital tract disease. While globally published data suggests that this species is essentially ubiquitous in livestock, {{little is known about the}} epidemiology of livestock C. pecorum infections here in Australia. My research is focused on investigating the genetic diversity and transmission patterns of C. pecorum, and why it causes disease. Using our newly developed C. pecorum-specific molecular epidemiology typing scheme we provided the first epidemiological <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infections</b> in sheep and cattle in Australia, identifying strains associated with a range of diseases in livestock, and uncovering an unexpected level of diversity for this pathogen. Most importantly, we observed that the same strain can infect koala and sheep, indicating on ongoing cross-host transmission and ‘spill-over’ risks to wildlife. Further, by dissecting koala, sheep, cattle and pig C. pecorum strains genomes, we have also identified novel virulence-associated factors that could be explored as vaccine candidates for both livestock and koala infections...|$|R

40|$|An {{adaptive}} {{immune response}} is usually initiated only if a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule presents pathogen-derived peptides to T-cells. Every MHC molecule can present only peptides that match its peptide-binding groove. Thus, it seems advantageous for an individual to express many different MHC molecules {{to be able to}} resist many different pathogens. However, although MHC genes are the most polymorphic genes of vertebrates, each individual has only a very small subset of the diversity at the population level. This is an evolutionary paradox. We provide an overview of the current <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infection</b> studies and mate-choice experiments and conclude that overall evidence suggests that intermediate intra-individual MHC diversity is optimal. Selective forces that may set an upper limit to intra-individual MHC diversity are discussed. An updated mathematical model based on recent findings on T-cell selection can predict the natural range of intra-individual MHC diversity. Thus, the aim of our review is to evaluate whether the number of MHC alleles usually present in individuals may be optimal to balance the advantages of presenting an increased range of peptides versus the disadvantages of an increased loss of T-cells...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a comprehensive epidemiologic model of hepatitis C in the United States. Through empirical calibration of model parameter values, the objectives were to gain insights into uncertain {{aspects of the}} natural history of hepatitis C and to improve the basis for projecting the future course of the epidemic. A systematic review of the published literature was conducted to define plausible ranges around model parameters, and multiple simulations of the model were undertaken using sampled values from these ranges. Model predictions produced by each set of sampled values were compared with available epidemiologic <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infection</b> prevalence and mortality from liver cancer, and various goodness-of-fit criteria were used to identify the range of parameter values that were consistent with these data. The results of the study indicate that rates of progression to advanced liver disease may be lower than previously assumed. The authors also found that a wide range of plausible assumptions about heterogeneity in these rates, beyond that explained by age and sex, is consistent with observed epidemiologic trends. These findings have important implications both for individual clinical decisions and for broader public health policy. carcinoma, hepatocellular; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; natural histor...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of universal HIV screening of patients attending a clinic for {{sexually transmitted diseases}} (STD) in Amsterdam. Design: Cost effectiveness analysis. Methods: A Bernoulli model for the secondary transmission of HIV was linked with epidemiological <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>infection</b> with HIV and other STD in patients attending a STD clinic in Amsterdam from 1991 to 1997. This gave {{estimates of the number}} of secondary HIV infections caused by attenders of the STD clinic. Combined with data on the health and monetary benefits of averting HIV infection and costs of HIV screening, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of HIV-screening of attenders of the STD clinic. Results: Increased risk for HIV infection was found in STD clinic attendees infected with other STD. (odds ratio, 2. 07). The risk differed for specific STD: the highest odds ratios were found for syphilis and gonorrhoea. Screening of all attendees was estimated at net costs of (euro) 82 552 per secondary infection averted. The cost-effectiveness ranges between (euro) 680 and (euro) 9335 per life-year gained, depending on the value of key parameters used in the model. Conclusion: Compared to other interventions in infectious diseases control in the Netherlands, screening of STD clinic attendees for HIV has an acceptable cost-effectiveness.
