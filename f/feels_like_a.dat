25|$|The submandibular glands are a pair {{of major}} salivary glands located beneath the lower jaws, {{superior}} to the digastric muscles. The secretion produced {{is a mixture of}} both serous fluid and mucus, and enters the oral cavity via the submandibular duct or Wharton duct. Approximately 65-70% of saliva in the oral cavity is produced by the submandibular glands, even though they are much smaller than the parotid glands.You can usually feel this gland, {{as it is in the}} superficial cervical region and <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rounded ball.

He states that Marlo expects his people to stand behind him, yet he himself does not stand behind people who work for him. He tells McNulty that the game is rigged and that he <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pawn on a chessboard, showing that some of D'Angelo Barksdale's teachings were not lost on him. He offers McNulty information to bring down Marlo, but openly tells McNulty that he will not give any information on any former Barksdale associate. McNulty, out of genuine respect, tells Bodie that he is a soldier.|$|E
