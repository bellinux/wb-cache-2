5|$|By 900 BC, Archaic {{people lived}} at Atlatl Cave and like sites. They left little <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{presence}} in Chaco Canyon. By AD 490, their descendants, of the Late Basketmaker II Era, farmed lands around Shabik'eshchee Village and other pit-house settlements at Chaco.|$|E
5|$|The Livonian Brothers of the Sword {{had been}} all but annihilated in the Battle of Saule in 1236. Even {{if there is no}} other <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{presence}} in Finland than the earlier papal letter from 1232, both the Archbishop and the Tavastians seem to have been on the move right after their demise. There had also been a revolt against the Germans in Estonia in 1236.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{had contact}} with these societies, and {{established}} missions further north, near Lake Okeechobee. In the 18th century, invading Creeks incorporated the dwindling numbers of the Tequesta into their own. Neither the Tequesta nor Calusa tribe existed by 1800. Disease, warfare, and capture for slavery were {{the reasons for the}} eradication of both groups. The only <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existence within the park boundaries is a series of shell mounds that were built by the Calusa.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Slugger and Nappy had come up, and {{they stared at}} Jack and his cousins {{as if they could}} not believe the <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> senses.|$|R

5|$|The family Columbidae {{previously}} {{also contained}} the family Raphidae, {{consisting of the}} extinct Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo. These species are in all likelihood part of the Indo-Australian radiation that produced the three small subfamilies mentioned above, with the fruit doves and pigeons (including the Nicobar pigeon). Therefore, they are here included as a subfamily Raphinae, pending better material <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> exact relationships.|$|E
5|$|The tablets {{constitute}} one of {{the oldest}} archives and libraries ever found; there is tangible <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> arrangement and even classification. The larger tablets had originally been stored on shelves, but had fallen onto the floor when the palace was destroyed. The locations of the fallen tablets allowed the excavators to reconstruct their original positions on the shelves; they found the tablets had originally been shelved according to subject.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
30|$|The geosciences {{community}} increasingly {{recognizes that}} the effects of lower atmospheric gravity waves extend beyond the middle atmosphere into the atmosphere–ionosphere system and are of global nature. Similarly, sudden stratospheric warmings were used to be looked upon as stratospheric phenomena, but now compelling observational <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> signatures in the thermosphere–ionosphere are being routinely provided.|$|R
50|$|In 1648 {{a legacy}} of his father's work in Ireland resurfaced when the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors {{attempted}} to obtain <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> landholdings in County Londonderry. The original papers, they ascertained, were {{in the hands of}} Sir Ralph's three executors, who were his widow Dorothy, Sir Thomas Fotherley, the father of his son-in-law John Fotherley, and Herbert his eldest son.|$|R
40|$|José Oliveira {{is a book}} {{artist who}} takes {{inspiration}} from the history and evolution of the Western book and of Western writing. His artist’s books {{take the form of}} codices, scrolls and leporellos and embody the beliefs, grief and hopes <b>of</b> <b>their</b> author. They ask us about our conceptions of the book and the nature of reading. They are <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> author’s resolute rejection of contemporary techniques applied to books...|$|R
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Even before Carpathia {{arrived in}} New York, efforts were getting {{underway}} {{to retrieve the}} dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them were buried. Memorials were raised in various places– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others– and ceremonies were held {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
5|$|However, the Sogdians epitomized the {{religious}} plurality found along the trade routes. The largest body of Sogdian texts are Buddhist, and Sogdians {{were among the}} principal translators of Buddhist sutras into Chinese. However, Buddhism did not take root in Sogdiana itself. Additionally, the Bulayiq monastery {{to the north of}} Turpan contained Sogdian Christian texts and there are numerous Manichaean texts in Sogdiana from nearby Qocho. The reconversion of Sogdians from Buddhism to Zoroastrianism coincided with the adoption of Zoroastrianism by the Sassanid Empire of Persia. From the 4th century onwards, Sogdian Buddhist pilgrims left behind <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> travels along the steep cliffs of the Indus River and Hunza Valley. It was here that they carved images of the Buddha and holy stupas in addition to their full names, in hopes that the Buddha would grant them his protection.|$|E
50|$|Some {{animals are}} in the area, such as the Philippine baboon, Philippine duck, Philippine hawk-eagle, flame-breasted fruit-dove, Philippine eagle-owl, monitor lizards, endemic frogs, snakes, and other reptiles. Philippine brown deer, warty pigs and rare civets were spotted {{in the area in}} the late 1980s, {{although}} there is no <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existence in the park at present. The park also supports endangered species of frogs, lizards, bats, snakes and other reptiles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the area were the Ohlone people, called by the Spaniards [...] "Coastanoans", or Coast-dwellers. These local residents lived off the land, gathering nuts, berries and fish from both the ocean and the bay. Because of the abundance of food {{there was no need}} for them to practice agriculture. <b>Evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> civilization are still being unearthed on the Filoli estate in Woodside, and along San Francisquito Creek.|$|R
40|$|Monogenetic insect trypanosomatids {{of the genera}} Crithidia, Leptomonas and Herpetomonas, multiplied as in axenic cultures, {{for many}} months, in the lumen of the scent glands of the opossum Didelphis marsupialis. Specific {{antibodies}} were detected in the serum of the animals {{but there was no}} <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> invasion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> tissues by the parasites...|$|R
5|$|Icelandics were {{exported}} to Great Britain before the 20th century {{to work as}} pit ponies in the coal mines, because of their strength and small size. However, those horses were never registered and little <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existence remains. The first formal exports of Icelandic horses were to Germany in the 1940s. Great Britain's first official imports were in 1956, when a Scottish farmer, Stuart McKintosh, began a breeding program. Other breeders in Great Britain followed McKintosh's lead, and the Icelandic Horse Society of Great Britain was formed in 1986. The number of Icelandic horses {{exported to}} other nations has steadily increased since the first exports of the mid-19th century. Since 1969, multiple societies have worked together to preserve, improve and market these horses {{under the auspices of}} the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations. Today, the Icelandic remains a breed known for its purity of bloodline, and is the only horse breed present in Iceland.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December {{a public}} {{memorial}} service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading {{for half an hour}} to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{hourglass}} {{was one of}} the few reliable {{methods of}} measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> use appears in the painting Allegory of Good Government, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, from 1338. From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and Father Time, usually represented as a bearded, old man. Though also used in China, the hourglass's history there is unknown. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.|$|E
50|$|When organisms die, {{they often}} {{decompose}} rapidly or are consumed by scavengers, leaving no permanent <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existence. However, occasionally, some organisms are preserved. The remains or traces of organisms from a past geologic age embedded in rocks by natural processes are called fossils. They are extremely important {{for understanding the}} evolutionary history of life on Earth, as they provide direct <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> evolution and detailed information on the ancestry of organisms. Paleontology {{is the study of}} past life based on fossil records and their relations to different geologic time periods.|$|R
50|$|In a 2 to 12 year {{follow-up}} of 125 patients, pain, functioning, and activity measures improved in 82% of patients. Eighteen of the 125 patients (14.4%) were considered failures. Histologically, 42 of 66 (63.6%) of biopsies showed strong <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> replacement <b>of</b> <b>their</b> articular surface, and 18 of 66 biopsies (27.3%) showed development of normal looking hyaline cartilage.|$|R

5|$|The rules {{had been}} in use since the {{establishment}} of the club. Although a selection of rules from public schools were seen there, the 1858 rules show little <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> influence. Many of the original members were from the local Collegiate School, which favoured the kicking style of the game, rather than handling the ball. The kicking game was also prevalent in the local villages of Penistone and Thurlstone. The rules were the first to penalise foul play with a free kick, introduce the throw-in and eliminate the offside rule. They also had the unique feature of preventing a goal being scored directly from a free kick or throw-in.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{deliberate}} attack by any group targeting the British Army, which had not established defences against any form of assault. During the following day seventy suspects were rounded up, but no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> involvement could be found. In response to the attack, the British imposed a road curfew from 18:00 to 06:00 each night and all cafes, restaurants and public entertainment venues in Tel Aviv were closed between 20:00 and 05:00. However this was not enough for {{some members of the}} division, who attacked Jewish houses in Qastina and Be'er Tuvia, injuring some of the occupants. Those involved were later punished by the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Both Shaivism and Vaishnavism flourished {{during the}} Badami Chalukya period, though {{it seems the}} former was more popular. Famous temples were built {{in places such as}} Pattadakal, Aihole and Mahakuta, and priests (archakas) were invited from {{northern}} India. Vedic sacrifices, religious vows (vrata) and the giving of gifts (dana) was important. The Badami kings were initially followers of Vedic Hinduism and dedicated temples to popular Hindu deities in Aihole. Sculptures of deities testify to the popularity of Hindu Gods such as Vishnu, Shiva, Kartikeya, Ganapathi, Shakti, Surya and Sapta Matrikas ("seven mothers"). The Badami kings also performed the Ashwamedha ("horse sacrifice"). The worship of Lajja Gauri, a fertility goddess is known. Jainism too was a prominent religion during this period. The kings of the dynasty were however secular and actively encouraged Jainism. One of the Badami Cave temples is dedicated to the Jain faith. Jain temples were also erected in the Aihole complex, the temple at Maguti being one such example. Ravikirti, the court poet of PulakeshinII was a Jain. Queen Vinayavati consecrated a temple for the Trimurti ("Hindu trinity") at Badami. Sculptures of the Trimurti, Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva) and Ardhanarishwara (half Shiva, half woman) provide ample <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> tolerance. Buddhism was on a decline, having made its ingress into Southeast Asia. This is confirmed by the writings of Hiuen-Tsiang. Badami, Aihole, Kurtukoti and Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar in the Gadag district) were primary places of learning.|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the two arrival ways of the worship of the goddesses Demeter and Core at Sicily (Gela-Siracuse and Selinous).

5|$|Fort George Island {{is located}} in Duval County, several miles {{northeast}} of downtown Jacksonville. It is a marsh island {{at the mouth of}} the St. Johns River, surrounded by tidal estuaries, Little Talbot Island, and the Nassau River. The north Atlantic coast of Florida had been inhabited for approximately 12,000 years when Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León landed near Cape Canaveral in 1513. The Spanish met the Saturiwa, a Timucua tribe, who were the largest group of indigenous people in the region, numbering about 14,000. Bands of Timucua extended into central Florida and south Georgia. An estimated 35 chiefdoms existed in the territory, and their societies were complex with large villages sustained by fishing, hunting, and agriculture, but they frequently warred with each other and unrelated groups of Native Americans. The Spanish concentrated their efforts of exploration and settlement on the Gulf Coast of Florida. By 1562, Jean Ribault led French explorers to the mouth of the St. Johns River where they built a garrison in 1564, calling it Fort Caroline. Within 200 years the population of the indigenous people of Florida was decimated by disease and constant fighting. They left behind <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> existence in massive middens or shell mounds filled with discarded food byproducts. On Fort George Island, the shells were primarily oysters.|$|E
5|$|Four middle-aged {{friends who}} {{have known each other}} since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by a man in a Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing scare tactics to make them part with the cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their intention is to go to Barcelona).|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelled the end {{for most}} of Somerset's cottage industries. Farming {{continued}} to flourish, however, and the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods. Despite this, 20 years later John Billingsley conducted {{a survey of the}} county's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved. Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries, and by 1800 it was prominent in Radstock. The Somerset Coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s, but all the pits have now been closed, the last in 1973. Most of the surface buildings have been removed, and apart from a winding wheel outside Radstock Museum, little <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> former existence remains. Further west, the Brendon Hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th century; this was taken by the West Somerset Mineral Railway to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale.|$|E
