5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Borduria {{was based on}} Eastern Bloc countries. Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the political leader of Borduria Plekszy-Gladz, a pun on plexiglas, although the English translators renamed him Kûrvi-Tasch ("curvy tash"), {{a reference to the}} fact that the leader's curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé's {{depiction of}} an Eastern Bloc city, Farr highlighted that Borduria's Kûrvi-Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin's Platz der Republik, which would only be completed in the 1970s. All of the <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from that found in the Studios Hergé premises.|$|E
5|$|The east range, of c.1635, {{comprises}} a long, narrow building, {{with a short}} {{projecting wing}} to the south-east. It is {{the only part of}} the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a long gallery, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a harpsichord, among other <b>furniture.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> south-east wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair. The first-floor room has a 17th-century painted ceiling, decorated with fruit, foliage, and heraldic emblems. The south-east wing has crow-step gables, and a sundial on one corner. The east window of the long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment. The roof is of 18th-century date, and is lower than the original, resulting in the loss of the triangular pediments which once topped each of the side windows.|$|E

25|$|The {{house was}} {{purchased}} {{by the city of}} Ponce from the Serrallés heirs. While the castle was valued at $17–$25 million, it was purchased for a mere $400,000 and included much of the <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sale. The city's initial intent was {{to turn it into a}} museum of Puerto Rican music. The Museum of Puerto Rican Music, however, was eventually established elsewhere in the city.|$|E

25|$|The hall retains {{more of its}} {{original}} neoclassical decorative features than many other rooms in the house; the walls' plasterwork panels and ceiling are all original, as are the Spanish mahogany doors (these had been removed during the 1920s, but were {{returned to the house}} in 1954). Only the white marble fireplace is not original to the house, but salvaged from the now demolished Panton Hall. The <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room, against the walls in 18th-century fashion, is in the style of William Kent.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Pabst (June 11, 1826 – July 15, 1910) was a German-born American cabinetmaker of the Victorian Era. He is {{credited}} {{with some of the}} most extraordinary custom interiors and hand-crafted <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Sometimes working in collaboration with architect Frank Furness (1839–1912), he made pieces in the Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Modern Gothic, and Colonial Revival styles. Examples of his work are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.|$|E

The room in which Commander-in-Chief Crown Prince Constantine spent the night contains all the furniture which he actually used. The exhibits consist of photographs and lithographs of the wars of 1912-13. Of particular note are four paintings by Kenan Messare, the son of Hasan Tahsin Pasha, who surrendered {{the city to the}} Greeks, and accompanied Constantine on the Epirus campaign and in the Second Balkan War. They depict scenes from the Battle of Kilkis-Lahanas during the Second Balkan War.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{metal working}} {{is found in}} Ecatepec, Naucalpan, Tecamac, Texcoco, Jiquipilco, Toluca and El Oro, working copper, brass and tin with some pewter work as well. These are mostly worked into {{decorative}} items with rustic designs. The small community of Cacalomacan, just outside Toluca, works tin, brass and copper using the most traditional methods. This was introduced by the Spanish to make both decorative and utilitarian items. Today it is mostly used for the former to make railings, balconies and <b>furniture.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> State of Mexico smiths of this type {{can be found in}} various parts of the state such as Chalco, Jocotitlan, Toluca, Valle de Bravo and Ecatepec.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>furniture</b> {{manufactured}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic from the sixties of the 20 th century {{up to the}} present. The furniture is closely connected with the feelings of society which are reflected <b>in</b> <b>furniture's</b> shapes and decoration. The time of Socialist Realism, Postmodernism, recent history and today are desribed in this thesis. In every chapter (decade) the situation of period, furniture making and summary are sketched. The result of the thesis is a diagram of <b>the</b> <b>furniture</b> development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and an estimation of the future. The results are analysed in a discussion...|$|R

25|$|Very {{nearly as}} {{visually}} evocative are the scenes involving Astor, {{almost all of}} which suggest prison. In one scene she wears striped pajamas, the <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room is striped, and the slivers of light coming through the Venetian blinds suggest cell bars, as do the bars on the elevator cage {{at the end of}} the film when she takes her slow ride downward with the police, apparently on her way to prison and possible execution. Huston and Edeson crafted each scene to make sure the images, action and dialog blended effectively, sometimes shooting closeups of characters with other cast members acting with them off camera.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a set of}} {{beautiful}} inlaid doors, dated 1580 from Antwerp City Hall, attributed to Hans Vredeman de Vries. One of the finest pieces of continental <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection is the Rococo Augustus Rex Bureau Cabinet dated c1750 from Germany, with especially fine marquetry and ormolu mounts. One of the grandest pieces of 19th-century furniture is the highly elaborate French Cabinet dated 1861–1867 made by M. Fourdinois, made from ebony inlaid with box, lime, holly, pear, walnut and mahogany woods as well as marble with gilded carvings. Furniture designed by Ernest Gimson, Edward William Godwin, Charles Voysey, Adolf Loos and Otto Wagner are among the late 19th-century and early 20th-century examples in the collection. The work of modernists in the collection include Le Corbusier, Marcel Breuer, Charles and Ray Eames, and Giò Ponti.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{efforts to}} confine and {{extinguish}} the fire, {{it continued to}} spread into the structure and ignited <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> showroom, growing more quickly than the few operating hose lines could control. Meanwhile, efforts to stretch and begin operating additional hose lines continued. At 7:41p.m. the showroom area of the store experienced a flashover while at least sixteen firefighters were working inside. The flashover contributed to the rapid deterioration of the structural integrity of the building, leading to a near-complete collapse of the roof minutes later. Many of the firefighters caught in the flashover were unable to escape and were trapped under the collapsed roof and shelving weakened by the fast-spreading fire. Several calls for help were made by trapped firefighters and efforts to rescue them were commenced. These efforts proved unsuccessful. By the time the fire was brought under control, nine Charleston firefighters had been killed.|$|E

25|$|The building's most {{distinctive}} architectural {{feature is the}} fireplace, uncommon in office buildings, and the structure's only feature to incorporate Roman brick. The present-day structure consists of one open, interior space, while Wright's original design divided the building into two sections. One section was used as Smith's real estate office, the other as the bank. Wright also designed {{a full set of}} furniture for both offices, although much of it has been sold over the years. One of the pieces of Wright-designed <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building was a round-backed chair. The chair was at least the second attempt at a round-backed chair by Wright; an earlier, more successful attempt was completed in the Darwin D. Martin House. The chair has a bent-wood back, and rounded seat and stretchers. The total integration of the design is less successful than that used in the Martin House. Other interior features include a now electrically lit skylight, oak trim, and exposed stonework.|$|E
25|$|James Rand Jr. soon {{took the}} company on a buying spree. The company became the largest {{supplier}} of office <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world through its 1926 acquisition of Globe Wernicke Co., but was forced to divest itself of the business later that year after an antitrust action. Between 1927 and 1929, the company merged with or bought {{out a number of}} companies, including Index Visible, Inc. (which had been founded by Yale University economist Irving Fisher), Safe-Cabinet Co. (which had invented the fire-proof safe), Library Bureau, Inc. (which had invented the filing cabinet), Dalton Adding Machine and Baker-Vawter Ledger. For a brief time in 1926, the company was known as Rand Kardex Bureau, Inc. In 1927, James Rand Jr. merged his company with the Remington Typewriter Co. (which had invented the noiseless and electric typewriters) and changed its name to Remington Rand. Company sales grew from $5 million in 1927 to $500 million in 1954.|$|E
25|$|The Soulages {{collection}} of Italian and French Renaissance objects was acquired between 1859 and 1865, and includes several cassone. The John Jones Collection of French 18th-century art and furnishings {{was left to}} the museum in 1882, then valued at £250,000. One {{of the most important}} pieces in this collection is a marquetry commode by the ébéniste Jean Henri Riesener dated c1780. Other signed pieces of <b>furniture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection include a bureau by Jean-François Oeben, a pair of pedestals with inlaid brass work by André Charles Boulle, a commode by Bernard Vanrisamburgh and a work-table by Martin Carlin. Other 18th-century ébénistes represented in the Museum collection include Adam Weisweiler, David Roentgen, Gilles Joubert & Pierre Langlois. In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticised at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary items and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon {{collection of}} French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole.|$|E
