50|$|The first PEX {{material}} was prepared in the 1930s, by irradiating the <b>extruded</b> <b>tube</b> with an electron beam. The electron beam processing method was made feasible in the 1970s, {{but was still}} expensive. In the 1960s, Engel cross-linking was developed. In this method, a peroxide is mixed with the HDPE before extruding, the cross-linking taking place during {{the passage of the}} melted polymer through a long heated die. In 1968, the Sioplas process using silicon hydride (silane) was patented, followed by another silane-based process, Monosil, in 1974. A process using vinylsilane followed in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process is}} multi-stepped: first, pharmaceutical-grade plastic resin is {{vertically}} heat extruded through a circular throat {{to form a}} hanging tube called the parison. This <b>extruded</b> <b>tube</b> is then enclosed within a two-part mould, and the tube is cut above the mould. The mould is transferred to the filling zone, or sterile filling space, where filling needles (mandrels) are lowered and used to inflate the plastic to form the container within the mould. Following {{the formation of the}} container, the mandrel is used to fill the container with liquid. Following filling the mandrels are retracted and a secondary top mould seals the container. All actions take place inside a sterile shrouded chamber inside the machine. The product is then discharged to a non-sterile area for labeling, packaging and distribution.|$|E
50|$|The melt is cooled {{somewhat}} {{before leaving}} the die to yield a weak semi-solid tube. This tube's diameter is rapidly expanded via air pressure, and the tube is drawn upwards with rollers, stretching the plastic in both the transverse and draw directions. The drawing and blowing cause the film to be thinner than the <b>extruded</b> <b>tube,</b> and also preferentially aligns the polymer molecular chains in the direction that sees the most plastic strain. If the film is drawn {{more than it is}} blown (the final tube diameter is close to the extruded diameter) the polymer molecules will be highly aligned with the draw direction, making a film that is strong in that direction, but weak in the transverse direction. A film that has significantly larger diameter than the extruded diameter will have more strength in the transverse direction, but less in the draw direction.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two thin-walled outer tubes showed that more extensive alpha working of the billet core stock results in more uniform cladding on the <b>extruded</b> <b>tube.</b> In {{an effort to}} eliminate breakthrough and to reduce eccentricity, shift, and bending of the mandrel, two experimental coppernickel billets with Zircaloy sleeves were extruded to check a modified billet design. lt was observed that the final grain size of the unalloyed uranium core of a thin- walled outer tube is insensitive to small variations in the cooling rate from the beta-treatment temperature. An axia' load of 3000 pounds applied to a thin- walled outer tube during autoclaving was ineffective in preventing bowing of the tube. Shipping experiments demonstrated that current packaging methods of thin- walled inner tubes do not prevent bowing during transit. The fabrication of specimens for the capsule irradiation program was concluded with the shipment of sixteen specimens and excess <b>extruded</b> <b>tube</b> stock to Savannah River Laboratory. The following core compositions were represented: U- 1 wt. % Si, unalloyed dingot uranium, U- 0. 3 wt. % Al- 0. 5 wt. % Si, and U- 0. 3 wt. % Cr- 0. 3 wt. % Mo. All irradiation specimens were supplied in the beta-treated condition. The mechanical behavior of Zircaloy- 4 -clad dingot uranium tube sections was evaluated {{as a function of}} the cooling rate from the beta treatment temperature. The results indicate that the mechanical behavior is approximately independent of the cooling rate and that, in testing to failure, fracture initiates within the core. Also, in a eimilar test of a transient-melted ingot uranium tube, the uranium core appeared to be the most brittle component. Five tubular stainless steel- Zircaloy joints were extruded for use in an experiment to determine if such joints can withstand 30 and 40 % cold reductions. (auth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The change {{rules of}} the billet {{temperature}} field and extrusion load are the significant basis for the optimal design of the needle piercing extrusion process based on ingot billet for the manufacture of large-diameter thick-walled tube. Taking the needle piercing extrusion process of a 7075 aluminum alloy tube with sizes of Φ 500 mmx 400 mm/ 6000 mm as study object, we developed a precise FE model for the process under DEFORM- 2 D environment, then numerically revealed the distributions and evolution {{rules of the}} billet temperature field, and obtained {{the effects of the}} extrusion speed and initial billet temperature on the billet temperature filed and extrusion load.

40|$|Direct link: [URL] audienceIn PA 12 tube extrusion, {{calibration}} or sizing {{is the key}} step of {{the process}} that affects subsequent mechanical properties. The <b>extruded</b> <b>tube</b> is pulled through a cylindrical calibrator under vacuum. A water flow rate is applied at the inner side of the calibrator, creating a lubricant water layer at the polymer outer surface. The {{scope of this article}} is to show how this lubrication influences the elongation at break of tubes through drawing kinematics of the polymer. Lubricant water layer thickness measurements and on-line video recording have been employed to monitor the lubrication dependence of the velocity profiles from the extruder die to the end of calibrator. Velocities were measured through three independent innovative methods and thirty-two calibration conditions have been carried out to validate our work. Three main calibration parameters were found to determine the water layer thickness: the level of vacuum applied in the calibration tank, the water flow rate at the calibrator entrance, and the line speed. The influence of each parameter on lubrication level was found out. Simultaneously, the draw ratio in the calibration tank was deduced from velocity profiles. This parameter was found to affect tensile properties and to depend strongly on the level of lubrication during calibration. We showed quantitatively that using the water layer thickness leads to a diminution of the draw ratio in the calibration tank and an increase of the elongation at break. This implies that we are now able to optimize tensile properties by fitting the main calibration parameters to improve lubrication and restrict draw ratio in the calibration tank...|$|E
40|$|Direct link: [URL] audienceIn {{polyamide}} 12 (PA 12) tube extrusion, calibration {{is crucial}} for the major final properties such as elongation at break or burst pressure. In external calibration, the <b>extruded</b> <b>tube</b> is pulled through a cylindrical calibrator located in a water tank under vacuum. A water flow rate is applied at the calibrator inner side, creating a lubricating water layer at the polymer outer surface. A combination of a quenching and a mechanical drawing was highlighted during calibration by on-line measurements. A subsequent high molecular orientation in the outer tube layers was also featured by X-Ray diffraction and birefringence evaluation in light microscopy. Besides, influence of lubrication level in the sizing-sleeve was investigated by {{an estimate of the}} lubricating water layer and a characterization of the tube final surface state in different calibration conditions. Firstly, we quantitatively showed that rising the water layer thickness leads to a diminution of the draw ratio in the calibration tank, DrCAL (ratio between line velocity and velocity at the calibrator entrance). Excellent correlation has been found between tube superficial orientation and DrCAL: a reduced elongation of the polymer in the calibrator leads to a lower level of superficial orientation. Secondly, two kinds of surface defects were detected on the tubes by light microscopy and microtopography. At last, several correlations were featured with mechanical properties. Elongation at break was found to strongly depend on the molecular orientation resulting from calibration. Moreover, origin of rupture was investigated during tensile testing in light microscopy. We emphasized that surface defects alignments perpendicular to the extrusion initiate the rupture by creating a significant crack via coalescence of initial defects. Thus, microstructure, surface state and tensile properties can be controlled by fitting the calibration parameters to improve lubrication and reduce the draw ratio in calibrator...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to determine if products made via the two cooking processes named are producing materials with similar properties thus resulting in a similar consumer perception or whether two fundamentally different products are being obtained. The presented work investigates the correlations between mechanical behaviour, fracture response, microstructure, acoustic emissions and sensory evaluation {{of a wide range of}} products made via the extrusion and baking processes. The internal microstructure of the products was examined with a Scanning electron Microscope (SEM). A notable difference between the distributions of the cells was observed between the two products; the wafer comprised of separate skin and core regions with variable pore sizes whereas a more uniform distribution of the pores was present in the extruded products. The mechanical behaviour of both, the extruded and baked, products was characteristic of brittle foam. The extruded products were all found to be stiffer materials in compression when compared to the baked wafers and the extruded products were found to be less anisotropic when compared to baked wafers. Analytical models were used to determine the actual mechanical properties of baked wafer and it was concluded that taking the geometry of the baked wafer into account was essential in finding accurate properties. Sensory, acoustic and mechanical testing results were successfully compared to draw links between the structure-property-texture of the different food products. X-ray Micro tomography (XRT) was used to attain a stack of image slices of the <b>extruded</b> <b>tube</b> architecture which was used to create Finite Element (FE) model of the product volume.

Extrusion models in two and three dimensions were developed. Only extrusion problems with radial symmetry were considered. Simulations were carried out using the commercial code MSC. Marc, which is a Lagrangian finite element code. Frequent remeshing was therefore needed during the analyses. The models were validated by comparing predicted values of extrusion force and exit surface temperature with measurements from an industrial extrusion press. The two- dimensional model was shown to provide good and fast solutions to extrusion problems with radial symmetry. A two-dimensional model is sufficient for many applications and this model is planned to be used for solving process problems further on. For the three-dimensional model it was concluded that a very fine mesh would be needed to successfully predict the extrusion force using four-node tetrahedrons. This would result in unacceptably long computational times. The future work will be aiming at improving the three- dimensional model in order obtain accurate results within a reasonable time. To obtain reliable simulation results a good constitutive model is crucial. This work has focused on the use of physically based material models, which are based on the underlying physical processes that cause the deformation. It is expected that these models can be extrapolated to a wider range of strains, strain rates and temperatures than more commonly used empirical models, provided that the correct physical processes are described by the model and that no new phenomena occurs. Physically based models are of special interest for steel extrusion simulations since the process is carried out at higher strain rates than what are normally used in mechanical laboratory tests. A dislocation density-based material model for the AISI type 316 L stainless steel was used in the finite element simulations included in this thesis. The material model was calibrated by data from compression tests performed at different temperatures and strain rates. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E
