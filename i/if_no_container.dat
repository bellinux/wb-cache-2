5000|$|Flowers dried in {{silica gel}} {{must be placed}} in {{airtight}} containers. If a container is not sealed tightly, the silica gel absorbs moisture from the air, and flowers dry too slowly or not at all. A candy tin, plastic container, coffee can, large-mouth jar or any other container with a tight-fitting lid may be used. <b>If</b> <b>no</b> <b>containers</b> with tight lids are available, loose tops should be sealed with tape. Silica gel is especially useful for drying fragile plants and flowers with delicate colors. Flowers that dry best in silica gel are allium, anemone, cornflower, roses, tulip and zinnia.|$|R

40|$|Electrostatic Levitation (ESL) is an {{advanced}} technique for containerless processing of metals, ceramics, and semiconductors. Because <b>no</b> <b>container</b> is required, {{there is no}} contamination from reaction with a crucible, allowing processing of high temperature, highly reactive melts. The high vacuum processing environment further reduces possible contamination of the samples. Finally, there is <b>no</b> <b>container</b> to provide heterogeneous nucleation sites, so the undercooled range is also accessible for many materials. For these reasons, ESL provides a unique environment for measuring thermophysical properties of liquid materials. The properties that {{can be measured in}} ESL include density, surface tension, viscosity, electrical and thermal conductivity, specific heat, phase diagram, TTT- and CCT- curves, and other thermodynamic properties. In this paper, we present data on surface tension and viscosity, measured by the oscillating drop technique, and density, measured by an automated photographic technique, measured in the ESL at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center...|$|R

50|$|Salt, pepper, {{and spice}} mills, {{essentially}} the same as coffee mills, usually do not have a handle, the entire top rotating instead. While this is less convenient, only a few turns are required to grind enough.

Many hard spices are available in containers incorporating a simple cone burr grinder, intended to be discarded when empty.|$|R
