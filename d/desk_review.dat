50|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of setting market values for luxury homes, {{it is not unusual for}} super jumbo mortgage lenders to require 2 full appraisals at a minimum for properties valued at $1,500,000 or more. Should the subject property be unique, or comparable sales be difficult to obtain for the purpose of deriving value, additional field review appraisals, <b>desk</b> <b>review</b> appraisals, and broker price opinions may be ordered to substantiate the property's value. This is a significant concern for the lender as the asset in which they are taking a security interest must have a reasonable value to justify their risk and associated premiums.|$|E

40|$|The {{observations}} {{in this paper}} are not original but stem from two sources. The first is a <b>desk</b> <b>review</b> carried out for DFID Policy Division late last year to identify research gaps in cultural, social, economic and policy analysis of risk and vulnerability {{in the context of}} HIV/AIDS. The second is an appreciative reading of the recent work of Tony Barnett and also Alan Whiteside in their pioneering efforts to understand and contextualise AIDS as a “long wave ” shock (Barnett and Whiteside 2002, Barnett 2004). As the <b>desk</b> <b>review</b> noted, there is a huge and diverse literature on HIV/AIDS relevant to understanding vulnerability. This comes particularly from anthropology and sociology and mainly focuses on micro-level impacts on specific social groups. 1 But there are large gaps in our understanding of the macro-economic and macro-social impacts of HIV/AIDS and a dearth of policy analysis and policy relevant research on the most seriously affected countries. 2 For these countries, both national and international responses have been sparse and weak. Some of the reasons for this have been compellingly spelled out by Barnett an...|$|E

40|$|The {{governments of}} Cambodia and Lao PDR have made strong {{commitments}} through the Climate Change Initiative of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to integrate mitigation of and adaptation {{to climate change}} into their national and sectoral development policies and action plans. Vietnam has also started to address climate-change adaptation at the national and sub-national levels. Governments in the three countries have identified a series of agriculture-based interventions as priorities to strengthen the resilience of smallholder farmers, most notable of which is crop diversification. However, how to practically implement effective policy measures that are of particular benefit to smallholder farmers remains a challenge. Research could contribute to developing a number of pilot initiatives at a sub-national scale to test and assess promising measures. If proven effective, these could then be scaled up under national agricultural policies and the national adaptation programmes of action for climate change (NAPAs). Vietnam does not have a NAPA, but chapter 2 offers a brief analysis of the NAPAs of Cambodia and Lao PDR in terms of the attention paid to crop diversification. It is based on a larger study about NAPAs and aims to explore {{the extent to which the}} NAPAs developed by Cambodia and Lao PDR include activities that, directly or indirectly, propose to utilize higher levels of biological diversity in production systems, agricultural research and development. The original study is entitled “Increased biodiversity in agricultural systems and the status of genetic resources for food and agriculture in the ‘National Adaptation Programmes of Action’ (NAPAs). ” It will be published in 2015 by Bioversity International. Bioversity International is working with national partners in the three countries to identify key elements needed to effectively implement policy measures for crop diversification targeted at farmers (both women and men) and ethnic minorities in low and upland regions. In 2014, this resulted in the elaboration of three country <b>desk</b> <b>reviews</b> of past and ongoing crop diversification projects and an international workshop on crop diversification in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam.
