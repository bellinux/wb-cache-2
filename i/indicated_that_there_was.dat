Dompig also stated that Aruba had spent about $3million on the investigation, which was about 40% of the police operational budget. Dompig <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> evidence that pointed to possession (though not necessarily use) of illicit drugs by Holloway. Members of Holloway's family have denied that she used drugs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of domesticated horses in England comes from archaeological investigations {{showing that the}} ancient Britons were using wheeled horse-drawn transport extensively in southwest England as early as 400 BC. Recent research has <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> significant Roman involvement in mining on Exmoor. Metals including iron, tin, and copper were transported to Hengistbury Head in neighbouring Dorset for export, and Roman carvings, showing British and Roman chariots pulled by ponies phenotypically similar to the Exmoor, {{have been found in}} Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Moakes has <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no {{worry about}} whether a song could be recreated live in concert {{in the same way}} as it would appear on record. A brass section and a chamber choir were hired as {{additional}} musicians. Drum machines and distorted guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works to create a sense of manipulation to the basic rock palette. Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety. On some songs, the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely on the beat. Okereke's voice was often used as an instrument by being looped, vocoded, or run through effects pedals.|$|E

5|$|The {{very first}} Commando raid– Operation Collar on 23 June 1940– was not {{actually}} carried out by a Commando unit, but by one of their predecessors: No.11 Independent Company. The mission, led by Major Ronnie Tod, was an offensive reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Touquet. The operation was a limited success; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had accompanied the raiders as an observer. A second and similarly inconsequential raid, Operation Ambassador, was made on the German occupied island of Guernsey {{on the night of}} 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its launch into water so deep that it came over their heads. Intelligence had <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings.

25|$|Between 1499 and 1502 various royal letters, {{signed by}} King Manuel, <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a need to}} {{demolish}} the balconies and verandas that occupied public spaces in the district.

A similar royal charter in 1500, was issued with the objective of transforming the free lands that still existed with the old walls. These initiatives lead to the first urbanization, named Vila Nova do Olival (around 1502), situated around the old Convent of the Trinity, using a series of administrative tools and proceedings that would, later, be used {{in the creation of the}} Bairro Alto.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{investigation}} of production records at Norsk Hydro {{and analysis of}} an intact barrel that was salvaged in 2004 revealed that although the barrels in this shipment contained water of pH14—indicative of the alkaline electrolytic refinement process—they did not contain high concentrations of D2O. Despite the apparent size of the shipment, the total quantity of pure heavy water was quite small, most barrels only containing 0.5–1% pure heavy water. The Germans would have needed {{a total of about}} 5 tons of heavy water to get a nuclear reactor running. The manifest clearly <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only half a ton of heavy water being transported to Germany.

25|$|By 2003, {{one of the}} two Seastar prototypes {{had been}} {{restored}} and received public transport certification in December of that year. In February 2004, the company stated that, in addition to seeking investment, it had been evaluating potential manufacturing sites in Europe and Asia prior to initiating a planned development phase later that year. It was said that feasibility studies and market analysis <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a global demand for around 250 such aircraft over the next ten years; furthermore, that it was proposing three different versions of the aircraft, each one for a different market segment: A surveillance variant for government agencies, a 12-seat regional airliner configuration aimed at charter operators, and a six-seat layout that was suited to VIP customers. In August 2006, there were claims made that the project was close to being relaunched with backing from firms in Singapore and Abu Dhabi, the latter being contingent upon the Seastar being manufactured in Abu Dhabi.|$|E
25|$|They faced Griqualand West in the 1970 final, with Griqualand West winning 11-9 {{thanks to}} two tries from winger Buddy Swarts. Buurman van Zyl {{described}} {{this as the}} single most disappointing occasion in his 14 seasons at Northerns. The 1971 team did not lose a single game and was most unlucky to play to a draw against Transvaal in the final, 14-all at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. The controversy which surrounded Transvaal's equalising points - a try by prop Theo Sauerman - once again emphasized the necessity of objective referees for Currie Cup finals. Chris Luther kicked a huge penalty that put the game beyond question in injury time and the fans started to run onto the field. The referee ordered them off and <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still time left. From the restart, Transvaal got possession and after some good support play scored a try. Jannie van Deventer kicked the conversion and Transvaal got {{a hand on the}} Cup. This final marked {{the end of an era}} for Frik du Preez who announced his retirement from the game.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{individuals}} first develop into males and then later {{there is a possibility}} that they become females (protandrous hermaphrodites). This also can be termed as plasticity in sex differentiation. This is shown when there are males, females, and juveniles together in an anemone. In the social groups, the female is the dominant and largest member, with signs of aggression towards other members of the social group. The next rank in the social hierarchy were the fishes that will become males and other fishes that stay as non-reproductive. One experiment placed three juvenile anemonefish in a tank and their behaviors were observed over a month. Observations about social rank were made throughout this period, based on interactions with the group. There was also a noticeable correlation between aggressive behaviors and appeasing behaviors. There were many other signs of dominance in this hierarchy, such as the continuous occupation of territory in the tank by the dominant fish, and increase in body mass of the dominant fish compared to that of lower ranked fish (indicating growth suppression). In addition, a difference in certain steroid levels of the fish <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> reproductive suppression also occurring. The individuals that were ranked lower were reproductively suppressed, which was apparent around the first stage of when the group was formed. Gradually, the sex differentiation and dominance were formed after social interactions occurred for a while. Another experiment performed was if we removed the female from the anemone, then the next dominant male would become the female. There is also a dominance hierarchy that exists here. Females actually utilize aggressive dominance to control the males to prevent the formation of other females, and dominant males prevent juvenile males from mating.|$|E
