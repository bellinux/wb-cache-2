40|$|The {{century of}} archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out at}} Corinth, Greece {{have resulted in the}} accumulation of a collection of Byzantine glazed pottery unparalleled in the Aegean. The site is set apart from others as being one of only a few sites in the Byzantine world where glazed pottery manufacture has been confirmed. The glazed pottery assemblage demonstrates a changing industry there. During the eleventh century local production consisted of brown glazed, unslipped vessels in a conservative range of forms that were in use alongside the imported, fine Constantinopolitan slip painted and polychrome White Wares. By the end of the eleventh century the local industry had established itself and these imports had ceased as a competitor. At this time local pottery production went through a major revolution in terms of decorative techniques and vessel morphology. Instead of the earlier plain <b>glazed</b> products <b>slips</b> and green and brown glazes were used in combination to produce a range of decorative styles each lasting only a generation or so. In this thesis, the development of production technologies of Byzantine glazed pottery manufactured at Corinth between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries are examined using a number of archaeometric techniques: pottery fabrics are examined using ceramic petrography and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy and their corresponding glazes are investigated using electron probe microanalysis. The data collected were used to establish patterns of pottery production and trade, and in particular explore developments in methods of glazing. A period of transition in glazing technologies is identified, while certain technological practices are shown to be more sophisticated than has previously been acknowledged for the period in question...|$|R

These parameters involved the idea of harmony and balance within a piece of work. The work speaks of diverse forms and concepts, the columnar aspect being a recurrent theme. All standard forming methods within the ceramic dicipline were used and combined in different ways to 'achieve the desired results. These methods include throwing, slip-casting, slabforming, pinching, press-moulding, and extruding. Designs were applied by means of coloured <b>slips,</b> <b>glazes</b> and on-glazes. In some instances the pieces were multiple-fired in order to achieve the desired effect. Sprayed enamel paint was also used, in two instances, where a particular effect was required. The technical problems of transporting large structures was resolved by the use of modular forms and segmented parts which could be dismantled and reassembled. Once a permanent site is found, the works will be assembled as follows :- A concrete foundation will be made. All segments of the column will be cemented together. A core of reinforced concrete will be set into the inner columnar space so that the pieces are structurally sound. This refers in particular to the Partially Disintegrated Columns I & II.

40|$|AbstractThe Munsell {{color system}} is almost universally used for {{measuring}} colors of archeological artifacts. In addition to recording soil colors, many use the Munsell system {{to record the}} colors of ceramic attributes, such as pastes, <b>slips,</b> <b>glazes,</b> and paints. These data are often used in both modal and typological analyses of ceramic style. Most often, however, Munsell color data are used in a purely descriptive fashion, and the quantitative potential of the information is not fully exploited. We propose here a new protocol for manipulating, analyzing, and interpreting Munsell color data that permits the statistical investigation of sets of Munsell observations as well as hypothesis testing. A Munsell color reading is composed of three continuous interval scale variables, and these data can be transformed into x, y, z coordinates that define a location in color space (D'Andrade and Romney, 2003). Once transformed into spatial coordinates, Munsell data can be analyzed using spatial analysis techniques, such as k-means cluster analysis, as well as non-spatial statistical methods. In our case, we chose to use logistic regression to study {{the degree to which}} color could differentiate ceramic types and varieties. We argue that logistic regression is an appropriate approach for testing common types of hypotheses that archeologists may pose with ceramic color data. We illustrate the approach on sets of Munsell data representing ceramic slip colors from Mayapán, Yucatán, México. We were able to show a clear separation between the Mama Red and Polbox Buff types. Using the techniques we suggest here, archeologists can significantly expand their modal analyses of ceramics because color is a common and easily measured attribute in most ceramic assemblages. The same techniques can easily be extended to other kinds of artifacts, including lithics and textiles, as well as soils, sediments, plants, and other objects studied by field scientists...|$|R

He was still three paces, however, from his victim's side when John upon the cliff above plucked up a huge boulder, and, poising it for an instant, dropped it with fatal aim upon the slinger beneath him. It struck upon his shoulder, and hurled him, crushed and screaming, to the ground, while Alleyne, recalled to his senses by these shrill cries in his very ear, staggered on to his feet, and gazed wildly about him. His eyes fell upon the horses, grazing upon the scanty pasture, and in an instant all had come back to him--his mission, his comrades, the need for haste. He was dizzy, sick, faint, but he must not die, and he must not tarry, for his life meant many lives that day. In an instant he was in his saddle and spurring down the valley. Loud rang the swift charger's hoofs over rock and reef, while the fire flew from the stroke of iron, and the loose stones showered up behind him.

He felt that his eye was <b>glazing,</b> his senses <b>slipping</b> from him, his grasp upon the reins relaxing. Then with one mighty effort, he called up all his strength for a single minute. Stooping down, he loosened the stirrup-straps, bound his knees tightly to his saddle-flaps, twisted his hands in the bridle, and then, putting the gallant horse's head for the mountain path, he dashed the spurs in and fell forward fainting with his face buried in the coarse, black mane.|$|R
40|$|Use of commercially {{prepared}} stains as {{a source}} of glaze and pigment colour leads to less individuality and subtlety. This thesis is about enhancing quality in stoneware glazes and pigments studying the effect of secondary fluxes fired in a reduction atmosphere. Emphasis is placed on establishing an accurate analysis of locally obtainable materials, which cumulatively form the main materials database utilized in this research, necessary in investigating the advantages of using actual analysis as opposed to theoretical analysis when performing glaze calculations. In order to carry out the numerous calculations associated with this research {{it is clear that the}} most logical way to do this was through the use of computer applications. This leads to the investigation of established software programs used for glaze calculation. Two main programs Insight™ (1986) and HyperGiaze™ (1988) have been reviewed, determining whether computer software glaze calculation programs assist in producing glazes which have a better fit, surface quality, and brightness of colour. Subsequently a glaze calculation program GLAZECALC has been written using a spreading sheet application incorporating the local materials database. This research has focused on traditional based stoneware glazes derivative of those originally used in the Song dynasty - 'Celadons and Chuns' and the Ming dynasty - 'Copper Reds', examining "flux substitution" as a means of enhancing the brightness of these glazes. It is noted that the incorporation of additional fluxes into a recipe as a colour enhancer, also has the effect in some cases of improving the surface quality of a glaze. As a consequence, considerable investigations have gone into researching Coefficient of Thermal Expansion, looking at a dual role in the substitution of fluxes i. e. colour enhancement and improved body fit. Recognising the importance of the purity of materials and the colour response to specific oxides, further investigations have been undertaken studying the interaction between secondary fluxes utilized in laminations for specific effects i. e. body, engobe/ <b>slip,</b> <b>glaze</b> and overglaze pigments.

40|$|Clay is my substrato para devaneios, my {{foundation}} for daydreams. Clay is earth, a humble, common material {{that represents the}} possibility of growth and thus, life. As my substrato, clay gives me stability and nourishes me, allowing me to communicate with and relate to the world. It {{has the ability to}} register touch and gesture; it records a moment in time. My work is an abstracted representation of me: my identity, the way in which I relate to others and understand the environment I am in. I use ceramic materials to create formal abstractions that reveal different facets—physical, experiential, emotional—of myself. Working with clay is my form of being. The artwork I create with this clay is influenced by the different cultural experiences to which I have been exposed—from my upbringing in Brazil to my study here in Nebraska—and the way those interactions build my identity. Cultural and language barriers provoke a sense of displacement and generate a wide range of emotional reactions that shape my perception of and interaction with the outer world. These encounters can make me feel curious, allowing me to learn more about my own culture and my way of interacting with the environment around me, but other times frustration prevails, and I feel lonely and misunderstood. I translate these feelings into my objects through expressive surfaces created by the layering of ceramic materials. Like my own skin, the surfaces of my pieces are thin and fragile barriers between the internal and external world. And like skin, the cracks, blisters, and wrinkles that texture the surfaces of my works record time and stories, veiling and yet revealing who we are. <b>Slips</b> and <b>glazes</b> have endless possibilities of behavior, and respond differently when layered on top of particular clays and fired to different temperatures. Slips are made of clay, a dry and solid material, while glazes are primarily made out of glass, a liquid substance. I subvert the traditional order of layering <b>glazes</b> over <b>slips</b> and utilize the fluidity of the glaze layer underneath as a symbol of my inner world of emotions as well as my cultural identity. The stress between the fluid and dry layers of materials results in a partial glimpse into the emotional interior. The slips become an external barrier, while glazes turn into an extremely powerful emotion that always finds its way to the outer reality. The lava rocks in some of my works provide another substrato—like clay, lava is a primal element in much of the environment around us. Porous and light, yet strong and hard, lava, like me, is simultaneously solid and permeable. Further, when subjected to heat, the rock can retain its shape, start to melt, or can melt completely, fusing to the layer underneath it. The lava rock behaves differently according to its environment, as do I. I am driven by curiosity and a sense of discovery that develops as I investigate materials, their properties, and the way they react when layered {{on top of each other}} and subjected to heat. My process of creating each work is a journey; intuition and intellect work in a dialectic manner and create a place for my own daydreams to emerge. As human beings we are constantly changing, so I welcome unexpected results and possibilities in my work. My intuitive approach to the making process keeps my studio practice alive and stimulating, while keeping me engaged and excited by new discoveries. To explore the idea of identity construction through successive overlapping of information, I’ve created some pieces as thin and fragile slabs cut from the same block of clay, layers peeled from the same body as a reflection on my journey of self discovery. Other pieces are thick and heavy, resembling ancient ceramic tablets. Like early cultures, the markings on my tablet forms record and communicate information, emotional states of feeling exposed and vulnerable through my process of self discovery. Ultimately, although my works are abstracted representations of me, they are structured and presented in a way that allows viewers to engage and enter the pieces. The concrete and physical nature of the ceramic materials gives my work a present sense of the real, while the surfaces invite the viewer to create their own interpretation of an imagined place. It is an invitation to devaneios—a reverie one indulges in while awake. This dual perception of my work creates a conceptual overlap between object and image, reality and imagination, physicality and emotion. The constant presence of opposites in my work creates a dialectic tension and allows my sculptures to be a place of reflection and understanding of the self. My work conceives meaning through the language of abstraction. Subtlety plays a veiling role in my sculptures; I intend the work to be revealed through a quiet and introspective moment of interaction between the viewer and the piece. Through careful observation, the work unfolds itself and allows the viewer to access the many different layers of material and meaning, rewarding them for their engagement.

40|$|The {{human mind}} assimilates {{information}} and experiences quickly and constantly, and is aided by mental systems that {{we rely on}} to function. We classify the input of our lives with extreme efficiency. Our notions about the things we encounter {{in the world are}} learned from past experiences, and these expectations help us file the data of our lives. My work is composed to create pause. I am interested in slowing down the processes of assimilation by manipulating our expectations, and extending events measured in microseconds into saturated and engaging experiences. Functional qualities, visual rhythms, and exaggerated proportions are some of the elements I employ in the objects I make to quietly challenge our preconceived notions and our expectations. The importance of genuine utility in my ceramic work is precluded by the desire to borrow a certain quality from the vocabulary usable objects: familiarity. Pottery contains an implied invitation. The intentional placement of openings, lids, and handles in my work conveys the specificity of function, clarifying that the objects I make have an intended purpose. The exact function is less obvious, and a situation is created that pairs a sense of knowing with a sense of mystery. The desire to identify the purpose of an object is an open invitation for continued exploration. Scrutiny and inspection reveal both undulations in edges once considered straight and subtle variations on flat planes. These details act as rewards for a heightened level of engagement. The objects I make exhibit a compositional preference for repetition over variety, and I position repeated elements in regular, metered fashion. This allows the eye to travel predictable paths across my work. A rhythm develops, with a cadence that promotes a rambling exploration of the form. Edges and lines are also measured, and they exhibit a confident, grounded quality that guides visual investigation in a steady and considered way. The mild restlessness of the viewer, caused by their derailed expectations, is placated by regularity. Vessels for containment are, by their own nature, the product of a desire for order. They are tools to categorize our environment, and provide place by defining the spaces they create. The interior spaces in my work are made special by manipulating access to them. Sometimes small lids open into large spaces, other times lids are large enough to require special attention during removal, and some interiors are difficult or impossible to reach. Given these circumstances, the vessels most often contain only a rarefied space. Simply reaching the interior, literally or visually, is an event, a private ritual, that is a self-justifying endeavor. My work displays an attraction to a massing of materials. Industrial architecture and earthen construction are related to the solid volumes in the forms, and the masses I make contribute to an ironic sense of small-scale monumentality. The exaggerated proportions of my work maintain compositional balance through the careful manipulation of a variety of visual elements, including volume and mass and the delicate placement of details. The objects I make appear to be probing their own identity in a subtle and playful way, intentionally undermining their apparent seriousness. Upon investigation, a codified order both mysterious and liberating emerges in the work, and makes it resonate with my intentions. The objects I make are simultaneously an anthropological study and an artistic endeavor, and incorporate an attempt to understand the world we live in, through making. My work has been informed by particular objects, including Japanese Mingei, or folk craft. Not exclusive to that country, but found worldwide, handmade objects have the ability to be fully embedded within the cultures in which they are found, and to reflect the lifestyles and social conditions of the maker. I intend the same level of integration between my work and the society from which it draws. I use surfaces that refer to a variety of sources, and include shiny <b>glazes</b> and polished <b>slips.</b> This use of various treatments helps prolong the assignment of a clear historical lineage to the work. Instead, it can both be rooted in the present and also have a sense of being from elsewhere. By focusing on a rudimentary treatment of the surface, the form of an object I make takes center stage. The composed nature of my work reflects the quiet focus of my investigations. I have a disciplined approach, aimed at augmenting one 2 ̆ 7 s engagement with his or her surroundings by creating objects that contain cryptic lessons. I appreciate the idea that the forms I make have a challenging complexity that can be read on multiple levels. When one pauses, then engages in an unspoken conversation with the objects I make, my intentions have been realized. Adviser: Peter Pinnel...|$|R
