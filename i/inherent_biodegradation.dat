50|$|Advantages of land {{spreading}} are the low treatment {{cost and}} the possibility that the approach could improve soil characteristics. Land spreading is most effectively used for drilling wastes that have low levels of hydrocarbons and salts. Potential concerns include the need for large land areas; the relatively slow degradation process (the rate of biodegradation is controlled by the <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradation</b> properties of the waste constituents, soil temperature, soil-water content, and contact between the microorganisms and the wastes); and the need for analyses, tests, and demonstrations. Also, high concentrations of soluble salts or metals can limit the use of land spreading.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the fate}} of oil {{discharges}} in cold marine environments has become a key issue as {{oil and gas industry}} is expandig exploration activities into frontier regions such as the Arctic Ocean. The aim of this research project was to assess a currently applied modelling approach for predicting crude oil biodegradation rate in the sea and evaluate its limitations. Furthermore, a relatively new static respirometry method was adapted for studying hydrocarbon (HC) biodegradation in seawater and to examine the effect of geographical origin of seawater on <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradation</b> rate and temperature response. The Oil Spill Contingency and Response (OSCAR) model, the industry standard in Norway to evaluate possible effects of accidental oil releases, takes biodegradation into account based on experimentally determined rate coefficient values. These values are adjusted to local ambient conditions by temperature compensation. Based on literature data and experimental observations, the compensation method implemented in the OSCAR model {{has been found to be}} debatable. Literature data and experimental results did not corroborate the rule of thumb approach used in the OSCAR model. The 32 different temperature compensation factors (Q 10 values) calculated from published HC biodegradation rates ranged from 1. 1 to 16. 2 with an average of 2. 8. The Q 10 values for crude oil biodegradation obtained during laboratory tests were 2. 6 and 9. 9 at 5 and 0. 5 °C, respectively. Crude oil type, incubation temperature range and other experimental factors were identified as important factors causing the high variation observed among Q 10 values. Results showed that substrate limitation (reduced bioavailability) occurs at low temperature due to the effect of temperature on physico-chemical properties of oil. This temperature dependence of bioavailability implies that properties of crude oil influence the Q 10 value. Hence, applying the same Q 10 value for different oil types is not suitable. Besides bioavailability, initial number of bacteria participating in biodegradation is potentially affected by temperature, representing the second major cause of variation in observed Q 10 values. The OxiTop®-C system was found to be useful a tool for measuring HC biodegradation and for assessing the effect of different experimental and iii environmental factors on biodegradation kinetics. Seawater sample pre-treatments (e. g. filtration and aging) and dilution of seawater has been tested to understand their influence on kinetic parameters. Dilution of the seawater affected all parameters: lag time, maximum oxygen consumption rate and pseudo first order degradation rate. Filtration and aging of seawater samples did not influence pseudo first order rate coefficient, the parameter most often reported for HC and crude oil biodegradation, while results were inconclusive in terms of lag time and maximum oxygen consumption rate. The OxiTop®-C system is suggested to be a suitable tool for kinetic model development and validation, especially due to high resolution of measurement data. Using naphthalene as a model compound, biodegradation rate, temperature response and bacterial community composition of seawaters from two geographically and climatically different areas (the North Sea and the Arctic Ocean) were studied and compared. Three times higher pseudo first order degradation rate coefficients were measured for naphthalene in arctic seawater samples compared to temperate, at all incubation temperatures. Calculated at in situ temperatures, rate coefficients of the two seawater types were similar (0. 048 d- 1 for temperate and 0. 068 d- 1 for arctic). Moreover, temperature responses were also found to be comparable with Q 10 ratios of 3. 3 and 3. 5 for temperate and arctic seawater, respectively. Temperate and arctic untreated bacterial communities were different at genus level, as revealed by pyrosequencing, and dominating genera during naphthalene biodegradation was also distinct in the two seawater types. <b>Inherent</b> <b>biodegradation</b> capacity in arctic seawater was shown to be comparable to temperate, implying that biodegradation capacity can be similar in cold compared to warm environments. Overall, approaches like a coupled physical-metabolic model for predicting HC biodegradation rates based on exponential growth of bacteria could represent better alternative compared to temperature compensation when estimating biodegradation rates in the sea...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of estimating transport and biodegradation parameters in a contaminant transport model. We develop a convergence theory for parameter identification under approximation that includes the nonlinearities <b>inherent</b> in the <b>biodegradation</b> models. The functional analytic approach provides a means for studying a variety of solute transport and biodegradation problems. *Research {{supported in part by}} AFOSR contract number F 49620 - 93 - 1 - 0153. 1. Introduction. Remediation of contaminated groundwater is a major scientific and technological challenge. One promising approach is bioremediation, in which either naturally occurring or externally introduced bacteria are used to decompose contaminants into non-toxic by-products. Important elements in the design of bioremediation strategies include mathematical models and computational algorithms for accurate prediction of contaminant degradation and transport. The literature on modeling and computation for biodegrad [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Petroleum {{hydrocarbon}} (PHC) contamination {{is becoming}} more common in boreal forest soils. However, linkages between PHC biodegradation and microbial community dynamics in the mycorrhizosphere of boreal forest soils are poorly understood. Seedlings (lodgepole pine, paper birch, lingonberry) were established in reconstructed soil systems, consisting of an organic layer (mor humus, coarse woody debris, or previously oil-contaminated mor humus) overlying mineral (Ae, Bf) horizons. Light crude oil {{was applied to the}} soil surface after 4 months; systems were destructively sampled at 1 and 16 weeks following treatment. Soil concentrations of four PHC fractions were determined using acetone– hexane extraction followed by gas chromatography – flame ionization detection analysis. Genotypic profiles of root-associated bacterial communities were generated using length heterogeneity-PCR of 16 S rDNA. Most plant–soil treatments showed significant loss in the smaller fraction PHCs indicating an <b>inherent</b> capacity for <b>biodegradation.</b> Concentrations of total PHCs declined significantly only in planted (pine-woody debris and birch-humus) systems (averaging 59 % and 82 % loss between 1 and 16 weeks respectively), reinforcing the importance of the mycorrhizosphere for enhancing microbial catabolism. Bacterial community structure was correlated more with mycorrhizosphere type and complexity than with PHC contamination. However, results suggest that communities in PHC-contaminated and pristine soils may become distinct over time...|$|R
