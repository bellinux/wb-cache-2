Hunt proved to be a success for the Broncos; he played every game in 2004, missing just four minutes in total, and was the team's top try-scorer. Bennett remarked of him that [...] "Karmichael has an attitude just like Darren Lockyer where he can make a mistake and kiss it off and <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with the game, It's a wonderful quality to have and you'd like every player to have it.

About two years later and shortly before entering teenagehood, Thompson successfully auditioned to feature in the BBC children's comedy programme Stupid!.

500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E

[...] Kunasch was {{temporarily}} replaced by friend Brandon Hamm on guitar, alongside drummer Chris Envy from the recently disbanded Showoff, but both quit prior to the kickoff of the tour. The band invited Hurley instead to fill-in once more, while Stump borrowed one of Trohman's guitars for the trek. While most shows were cancelled, the band played any show possible: [...] "Let's <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> whatever show we can. You can pay us in pizza," [...] remembered Wentz. As the tour concluded, the general consensus was that Hurley would be the band's new drummer, and the band began to shop around the three songs from the group's unreleased split as a demo to record labels. The band members set their sights on pop punk labels, and attempted with considerable effort to join Drive-Thru Records. A showcase for label co-founders went largely mediocre, and the band were offered to sign to side label Rushmore, an offer that the members of the band declined. They got particularly far in discussions with The Militia Group and Victory Records, and Bob McLynn of Crush Management became the band's first manager. The band re-entered the studio with O'Keefe to record several more tracks to create label interest. Wentz felt [...] "in the backseat" [...] in writing the songs and temporarily questioned his place in the group, but Stump argued in his favor: [...] "No! That's not fair! Don't leave me with this band! Don't make me kind of like this band and then leave it! That's bullshit!" ...|$|E

[...] However, he felt the game did feature [...] "some genuinely disconcerting moments, an interesting story of demonic misadventure, some fairly ghastly sights and sounds, and some genuinely standout frights." [...] He further wrote [...] "Certainly it's been well designed in places." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Suffering has some scary moments, {{but for the most}} part they punctuate a fairly regular, albeit twisted, action game, rather than driving it [...] It's a shame, because The Suffering could have been great. We're not asking for a carbon copy of Resident Evil or Silent Hill, but with a little more consideration, Surreal could have remoulded the experience a lot more effectively." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A chronic {{condition}} {{does not}} just affect the individual diagnosed, {{but also their}} families. The process of adaptation, following the onset of symptoms, can be complex requiring flexibility from the family. This may be especially pertinent with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) which is characterised by unpredictable flare-ups and an uncertain disease trajectory. Families negotiating JIA may be at an increased vulnerability of distress {{as a result of}} additional demands placed upon their resources. This may have implications for health services. It is therefore important to understand family experiences of living with a chronic condition in order to support families throughout the adaptation process. To date, the majority of studies have investigated individual family members’ reports in order to assess family functioning, but these investigations have neglected to study the family as a unit. Method: This study utilised a multiple-perspective case study design in order to explore family experiences of JIA. Two families were recruited from a paediatric rheumatology service in Leeds. Family group interviews were conducted and five of the seven participating family members completed follow-up individual interviews, which used a semi-structured interviewing format. Interviews were transcribed and an interpretative phenomenological approach was used to analyse each case study. A synthesis of the results was also conducted. Results: Four master themes were identified from the first family interviews. These were: negotiating power, not letting go: managing transitions, when the invisible becomes visible and <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> with it. Four master themes were also identified from the second family: a positive outlook, being ‘normal’, power and empowerment and medications: friend or foe. Analysis also focused upon how both families negotiated their understandings of JIA. Five themes were identified following a synthesis of the case study data. These were: <b>Just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> with it and maintaining a sense of normality, battling, fighting and the negotiation of power, transitioning, JIA as a hidden condition and negotiating understandings. Discussion: The themes relating most significantly to the research aims: <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> with it and maintaining a sense of normality, battling, fighting and the negotiation of power and negotiating understandings, from the synthesised data were discussed {{within the context of the}} existing chronic health conditions and family communication literature. The study’s methodological strengths and limitations were also presented following the discussion of the themes. Clinical implications relating to families experiencing JIA and services providing care to these families was discussed throughout the discussion chapter, and finally, recommendations for further research were outlined...|$|R
