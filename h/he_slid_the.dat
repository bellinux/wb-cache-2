2500|$|Away they went, thunder-and-turf, out the Canal Road. Coutts took [...] Saucel {{at about}} his usual , and <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> whole crowd in [...] "The Shebeen" [...] under the table. Paisley Canal station did the same; {{and so did}} Elderslie. Right out at the cow's tail and getting all the wag, the {{distinguished}} party had a pretty stormy trip {{all the way to}} Ayr, at which point the murder of Coutts was strongly advocated. But when they found that Coutts had actually lost a minute to Paisley, they began to think something must be wrong with the routing, so the 5.10 was altered to run via the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line, which was at least straight.|$|E
2500|$|Bader {{escaped from}} the {{hospital}} where he was recovering by tying together a number of sheets. Initially the [...] "rope" [...] did not reach the ground; {{with the help of}} another patient, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> sheet from under the comatose New Zealand pilot, Bill Russell of No. 485 Squadron, who had had his arm amputated the day before. Russell's bed was then moved to the window to act as an anchor. A French maid at the St. Omer hospital attempted {{to get in touch with}} British agents to enable Douglas to escape back to Britain. She later brought a letter from a peasant couple (a Mr. and Mrs. Hiecques), who promised to shelter him outside St. Omer until he could be passed further down the line. Until then, their son would wait outside the hospital every night until there was a chance of escape. Eventually, he escaped out of a window. The plan worked initially. Bader completed the long walk to the safe house despite wearing a British uniform. Unfortunately for him, the plan was betrayed by another woman at the hospital. He hid in the garden when a German staff car arrived at the house, but was found later. Bader denied that the couple had known he was there. They, along with the French woman at the hospital, were sent for forced labour in Germany. The couple survived. After the war, French authorities sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> present label off with his hand and laid it aside; it had been newly put on, its paste was still wet. When the new label came, he put it on; our French wine being now turned into German wine, {{according}} to desire, the head waiter went blandly about his other duties, as if the working {{of this sort of}} miracle was a common and easy thing to him.|$|E
60|$|The sheriff {{swung his}} leg, and, never moving his hands, {{with his face}} now a deathly, sickening white, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> to <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
60|$|While Eustacia {{looked on}} from this {{distance}} the boy's form visibly started: <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> down <b>the</b> bank and ran across towards the white gate.|$|R
6000|$|The Curator {{looked through}} them. They were heavily scratched, {{but the power}} was almost exactly that of his own pair, which <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> into <b>the</b> lama's hand, saying: 'Try these.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the door}} was unlocked, and I alone knew it. The gay-cat and I begged for mercy. I joined in the {{pleading}} and wailing out of sheer cussedness, I suppose. But I did my best. I told a [...] "story" [...] that would have melted the heart of any mug; but it didn't melt the heart of that sordid money-grasper of a shack. When he became convinced that we didn't have any money, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> door shut and latched it, then lingered {{a moment on the}} chance that we had fooled him and that we would now offer him the two dollars.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Be'old the bloomin' miracle,' {{said the}} man with the revolver, with ill-timed facetiousness. 'Parson, prepare to meet your God.' And with this <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> glass out of the frame. As the glass moved, I saw that part of the picture was painted on it in Chinese white, notably a pair of white {{whiskers}} and a clerical collar. And underneath was a portrait of an old lady in a quiet black dress, leaning her head on her hand against the woodland landscape. The old lady was as like me as one pin is like another. It had required only the whiskers and the collar to make it me in every hair.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} poor man was so {{astonished}} that he gazed after the retiring figure and {{made no effort to}} conceal this unexpected addition to his meal. Fortunately, his wits revived before any of the guards observed him. <b>He</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> biscuits into his shirt bosom with conjurer-like facility, and at the same moment broke off a large bit of one, which he devoured with unwonted satisfaction. The addition did not indeed furnish the unfortunate slave with a full meal, but it at least tended towards that desirable end, and sent him to work with a full heart, because of the assurance that there was in the city, at all events, one human being--and that being, strange to say, a negress!--who pitied him in his forlorn condition.|$|E
60|$|Conger {{pushed the}} door open. Warm air rushed around him. Lora was {{drinking}} hot chocolate, with whipped cream. She looked up in surprise as <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> into <b>the</b> seat beside her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>slid</b> through <b>the</b> {{bushes and}} disappeared. I sat where I was, musing, my work interrupted, {{a mood of}} bitter disillusionment heavy upon me. So I sat, {{it may have been}} for hours.|$|R
60|$|So saying <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> down <b>the</b> shaft, closely {{followed}} by Tonkin, who {{was nearly as}} much afraid {{to be left alone}} on the bleak moor as he was to enter the old mine.|$|R
60|$|The {{elevator}} boy smiled knowingly to himself. When he {{took her}} up, he had noted the sparkle in her eyes, the color in her cheeks. His little cage had quite warmed with the glow of her repressed eagerness. And now, on the down trip, it was glacier-like. The sparkle and the color were gone. She was frowning, and what little he could see of her eyes was cold and steel-gray. Oh, he knew the symptoms, he did. He was an observer, and he knew it, too, and some day, when he was big enough, {{he was going to}} be a reporter, sure. And in the meantime he studied the procession of life as it streamed up and down eighteen sky-scraper floors in his elevator car. <b>He</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> door open for her sympathetically and watched her trip determinedly out into the street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{in spite}} of his dreadful fright, Mr. Otter had enjoyed that {{exciting}} slide down the steep bank. He got to thinking about it after Mr. Lynx had slunk away into the Green Forest, and when he was rested and could breathe comfortably again, he made up his mind to try it once more. So he climbed out where the bank was low and ran around to the steep place and once more slid down into the water. It was great fun, the greatest fun Mr. Otter ever had had. He did it again and again. In fact, he kept doing it all the rest of that day. And he found that the more <b>he</b> <b>slid,</b> <b>the</b> smoother and more slippery became the slippery-slide, for the water dripped from his brown coat and froze on the slide.|$|E
60|$|By and by {{he heard}} the roar of water and pushing on faster came to a foaming creek that plunged down a stony ravine. A bridge crossed the gorge, and leaving the track he clambered down the rocky bank. Where the spray had fallen there were patches of ice, but Foster felt that he must get a drink. When he was half-way down his foot slipped and <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> rest of the distance, {{bringing}} up with a shock {{at the edge of}} the water, where he struck a projecting stone. He felt shaken, but got a drink, and when he began to climb back found that he had wrenched his knee. Some movements were not painful, but when his weight came upon the joint it hurt. He must get up, for all that, and reached the top, where he sat down with his lips firmly set, and after putting on the coat felt in the pocket for a cigarette.|$|E
50|$|Young's final {{match for}} Australia ended after <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> into <b>the</b> fence {{trying to prevent}} a {{boundary}} {{and needed to be}} carried from the Sydney Cricket Ground in considerable pain after injuring his leg.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now the car," [...] Erick said. [...] "If they haven't got to it." [...] <b>He</b> <b>slid</b> down <b>the</b> slope {{into the}} ravine, fumbling in the darkness, {{reaching}} and {{holding onto the}} handle of the case. Reaching, reaching-- ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he handed}} her his gun, which, {{together}} with the dead birds, she carefully stowed {{in the bottom of}} the frail craft. Next, with great caution, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> down <b>the</b> rock till his feet rested in the canoe.|$|R
60|$|Whereupon, in studious mood, Dale took up {{his rifle}} and strode out to hunt. His winter supply of venison {{had not yet been}} laid in. Action suited his mood; he climbed far and passed by many a {{watching}} buck to slay which seemed murder; at last he jumped one that was wild and bounded away. This he shot, and set himself a Herculean task in packing the whole carcass back to camp. Burdened thus, he staggered under the trees, sweating freely, many times laboring for breath, aching with toil, until at last he had reached camp. There <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> deer carcass off his shoulders, and, standing over it, he gazed down while his breast labored. It was one of the finest young bucks he had ever seen. But neither in stalking it, nor making a wonderful shot, nor in packing home a weight that would have burdened two men, nor in gazing down at his beautiful quarry, did Dale experience any of the old joy of the hunter.|$|E
6000|$|I {{made the}} fireman get a lantern, and then I {{went to the}} express car and yelled to the {{messenger}} to open up or get perforated. <b>He</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> door back and stood in it with his hands up. [...] "Jump overboard, son," [...] I said, and he hit the dirt like a lump of lead. There were two safes in the car--a big one and a little one. By the way, I first located the messenger's arsenal--a double-barrelled shot-gun with buckshot cartridges and a thirty-eight in a drawer. I drew the cartridges from the shot-gun, pocketed the pistol, and called the messenger inside. I shoved my gun against his nose and put him to work. He couldn't open the big safe, but he did the little one. There was only nine hundred dollars in it. That was mighty small winnings for our trouble, {{so we decided to}} go through the passengers. We took our prisoners to the smoking-car, and from there sent the engineer through the train to light up the coaches. Beginning with the first one, we placed a man at each door and ordered the passengers to stand between the seats with their hands up.|$|E
6000|$|Westover {{understood}} from Whitwell's afterthought {{that it was}} Cynthia he {{was anxious}} to keep ignorant of his misgivings, if they were so much as misgivings. But {{the importance of this}} fact could not stay him against the tide of sleep which was bearing him down. When his head touched the pillow it swept over him, and he rose from it in the morning with a gayety of heart which he knew to be returning health. He jumped out of bed, and stuffed some shavings into his stove from the wood-box beside it, and laid some logs on them; <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> damper open, and then lay down again, listening to the fire that showed its red teeth through the slats and roared and laughed to the day which sparkled on the white world without. When he got out of bed a second time, he found the room so hot that he had to pull down his window-sash, and he dressed in a temperature of twenty degrees below zero without knowing that the dry air was more than fresh. Mrs. Durgin called to him through the open door of her parlor, as he entered the dining-room: [...] "Cynthy will give you your breakfast, Mr. Westover. We're all done long ago, and I'm busy in here," [...] and the girl appeared with the coffee-pot and the dishes she had been keeping hot for him at the kitchen stove. She seemed to be going to leave him when she had put them down before him, but she faltered, and then she asked: [...] "Do you want I should pour your coffee for you?" ...|$|E
50|$|In 1967 he {{suffered}} an accident while testing at Silverstone, in which <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> off <b>the</b> track in wet conditions {{and hit a}} marshal's post. Anderson suffered serious chest and neck injuries and died later in Northampton General Hospital.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then work {{still remains}} for you," [...] remarked the beetle, composedly; [...] "no {{one will ever}} try to rob you of that, you may be sure!" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> from <b>the</b> stone and {{disappeared}} for the last time.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>slid</b> it into <b>the</b> left slot for them. It {{shot down}} the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.|$|R
50|$|On Lap 27, Richard Petty (who {{started a}} {{promising}} 11th) spun ahead of Phil Parsons while running 13th. The spin {{left him with}} all four tires flat, meaning The King would need a wrecker {{to take him to}} the pits for new tires, and he would finish well down the order. During the yellow, Davey Allison (running 6th) pitted with the leaders and hit the pit wall as <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> tires. This was unnoticed by the television broadcast for several minutes; no injuries were reported but Mike Joy confirmed left front toe damage.|$|E
5000|$|Away they went, thunder-and-turf, out the Canal Road.

60|$|Psmith did not reply. With {{a benevolent}} {{smile and a}} gesture {{intended}} to signify all would come right in <b>the</b> future, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> through <b>the</b> swing-doors, and began to move down the street at a somewhat swifter pace than was his habit.|$|R
60|$|When little Pat {{thought that}} he had heard enough, <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> off <b>the</b> seat, crawled close {{along the side of the}} house, doubled round the corner, rose up, and ran off towards the parsonage as fast as his little legs could go.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with calling on me?" [...] put {{in the voice of}} Jim Haskett, as <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> into <b>the</b> seat behind them, and leaned over. [...] "I reckon I know as much as Doring about a ship, and maybe a leetle more." ...|$|R
40|$|Professor Hart, and Hart {{had often}} said [...] {{to others and}} to himself [...] that he was honored to help Dave secure his well-earned dream. Well before the defense, Striver gave Hart a {{penultimate}} copy of his thesis. Hart read it and told Dave that it was absolutely first-rate, {{and that he would}} gladly sign it at the defense. They even shook hands in Hart's book-lined office. Dave noticed that Hart's eyes were bright and trustful, and his bearing paternal. At the defense, Dave thought that he eloquently summarized Chapter 3 of his dissertation. There were two quest 2 ons, one from Professor Rodman and one from Dr. Teer; Dave answered both, apparently to everyone's satisfaction. There were no further objections. Professor Rodman signed. <b>He</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> tome to Teer; she too signed, and then slid it in front of Hart. Hart didn't move. "Ed?" Rodman said. Hart still sat motionless. Dave felt slightly dizzy. "Edward, are you going to sign?" Later, Hart sat alone in his office, in his big leathe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to offer some counterarguments to Iwata’s (2006) claim that 26 Broccias’s (2003) {{analysis}} of resultative constructions cannot account for the differences 27 between what Iwata calls Type A resultatives and Type B resultatives. Type A resultatives 28 involve non-telic predicates (e. g. The joggers ran the pavement thin) while Type B resulta- 29 tives involve telic predicates (e. g. <b>He</b> <b>slid</b> <b>the</b> door shut). Iwata contends that various prop- 30 erties of Type B resultatives – viz. the impossibility of a causal paraphrase, the occurrence 31 of multiple resultative phrases, implicit host predication and the similarity with phrasal 32 verbs – follow from the adjunct and non-path status of the (adjectival) resultative phrase 33 in Type B. Since these assumptions are not made by Broccias (2003), Iwata argues that 34 Broccias’s model is unable to capture the peculiar properties of Type B resultatives. In fact, 35 I contend that Iwata’s theory is based on questionable assumptions and that Broccias’s the- 36 ory is compatible with Iwata’s observations without the need to invoke any of its concep- 37 tual machinery. In particular, I argue that (i) the impossibility of a causal paraphrase does 38 not imply the absence of a causal component in the conceptual representation of Type B 39 resultatives, (ii) the similarity with phrasal verbs is not limited to Type B resultatives, 40 (iii) implicit host predication is a by-product of the semantics of (some) of the verbs used 41 in Type B resultatives, (iv) the co-occurrence of multiple telic events within a resultative 42 clause is due to their nature as different but tightly linked facets of a complex event...|$|E
60|$|The {{emphasis}} {{with which}} he spoke that word caused his chair, {{on the edge of}} which he was sitting, to tilt up under him so that <b>he</b> <b>slid</b> under <b>the</b> table, losing the vision of that figure in helmet and field-grey which he had been apostrophizing.|$|R
60|$|The {{effect was}} instantaneous. John {{had risen from}} his seat as he {{delivered}} the blow, and it got the full benefit of his weight. Mr. Parker literally crumpled up.

60|$|Matt made {{a couple}} of steps toward White Fang, but <b>the</b> latter <b>slid</b> away from him. The dog-musher made a rush of it, and White Fang dodged between the legs of a group of men.

6000|$|When chair-bottoming would fail, resort was had to match-making. That {{business}} being overdone in turn, next came the cutting of old rags, bits of paper, nails, and broken glass.
