5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order <b>due</b> <b>out</b> for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2010, Angra started writing songs for their upcoming yet unnamed album <b>due</b> <b>out</b> in mid-2010. The album was composed partly at the members' houses and partly at Confessori's ranch, where they rehearsed and improved the arrangements of the new songs. In February, they came into Norcal Studios in São Paulo, to start recordings. The band members made home videos from the writing/recording process and released them to the fans almost weekly.|$|E

As president, Madison corresponded on national politics, international diplomacy and war, Indian affairs, {{and the development}} of the nation's capital, while also responding to ordinary citizens who sent petitions for charity and mercy.

25|$|McCartney had privately {{agreed to}} a mid-April release date for McCartney with Apple Records {{executive}} Neil Aspinall, {{one of the few}} people associated with the Beatles who was aware of the project. Its late addition to Apple's schedule clashed with the imminent release of the Let It Be album, and of Starr's solo debut, Sentimental Journey, which was <b>due</b> <b>out</b> on 27 March. On 25 March, after discovering that Klein had already arranged to have the release of McCartney postponed, McCartney received an assurance from Harrison, as a director of Apple Records, that his solo album would be issued on 17 April, as planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} offices of General Motors headquarters continued to clash with DeLorean's nonconformity, {{and he was}} still not able to fit the traditional mold of conservatism that was usually expected of someone of his stature. When John was appointed, Chevrolet was having financial and organizational troubles, and GM president Ed Cole needed a first-class manager in that position to sort things out – company man or not. The new model Camaro was <b>due</b> <b>out</b> for the 1970 model year, and it was rapidly falling behind schedule. Redesigns for the Corvette and Nova were also delayed, and unit sales had still not recovered from the past four years of turmoil, much of that because of the bad publicity surrounding the Corvair and well-publicized quality-control issues affecting other Chevy models, including defective motor mounts that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million Chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969. DeLorean responded to the production problems by delaying the release of the Camaro, and simplifying the modifications to the Corvette and Nova.|$|E

500|$|... {{have been}} asked by {{individuals}} in the United Kingdom to help stop the distribution of Take-Two/Rockstar's hyperviolent video game Manhunt 2 in that country <b>due</b> <b>out</b> this summer. The game will feature stealth murder and torture. The last version allowed suffocation of victims with plastic bags. The original Manhunt {{was responsible for the}} bludgeoning death of a British youth by his friend who obsessively played the game. The killer used a hammer just as in the game he played. Take-Two/Rockstar, anticipating the firestorm of criticism with the release of the murder simulator sequel, is lying to the public {{on both sides of the}} pond in stating this week that the game had nothing to do with the murder.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album <b>due</b> <b>out</b> next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E

500|$|The 32X's {{game library}} {{consists}} of fortytitles, including six that required both the Sega 32X and Sega CD. [...] Among the titles for the 32X were ports of arcade games Space Harrier and Star Wars Arcade, a sidescroller with a hummingbird {{as a main}} character in Kolibri, and a 32X-exclusive game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series titled Knuckles' Chaotix. [...] Several of the games released for the 32X are enhanced ports of Genesis games, including After Burner, NFL Quarterback Club, and World Series Baseball '95. In a retrospective review of the console, Star Wars Arcade was considered the best game for the 32X by IGN for its cooperative play, soundtrack, and faithful reproduction of the experiences of Star Wars. In a separate review, IGN's Buchanan praised the 32X title Shadow Squadron as superior to Star Wars Arcade. [...] Retro Gamer writer Damien McFerran, however, praised Virtua Fighter as [...] "the jewel in the 32X's crown", and GamesRadar named Knuckles' Chaotix as the best game for the system. Next Generation called Virtua Fighter [...] "the colorful wreath on 32X's coffin", [...] reflecting the consensus among contemporary critics that the game was at once arguably the 32X's best release and a clear harbinger of the platform's imminent discontinuation, since it was clearly inferior to the Saturn versions of Virtua Fighter Remix (which had already been released) and Virtua Fighter 2 (which was <b>due</b> <b>out</b> {{in just a few}} months). In response to fan inquiries, Sega stated that the 32X architecture was not powerful enough to handle a port of Virtua Fighter 2.|$|E
500|$|The halftime show {{received}} critical acclaim. Said Marc Schneider of Billboard: [...] "It's Madonna Louise Ciccone's world, we're just {{living in}} it".

Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album <b>due</b> <b>out</b> in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E
