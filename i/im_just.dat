40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of this thesis is to try to examine the concepts of mental sickness and responsibility (and some other related concepts) and see whether or not they can be defended against some of the criticisms that have been made against them. It has, for instance, been argued that the concept mental sickness is culture relative in a bad sense. If this criticism is valid, then we cannot be justified in saying that mental sickness has impaired a person's responsibility. Another criticism that has been made is that arguments that use mental sickness to explain and excuse criminal behaviour are circular. Most of the criticisms that I have discussed are intended to be general, i. e. they are criticisms of the concept of mental disorder <b>im</b> general, not <b>just</b> of a particular kind of mental disorder. Thus though Lady Wootton says that arguments that try to explain the psychopath's anti-social behaviour are circular, she thinks (at least in her more radical moments) that the circular process prevails in other mental disorders as well (e. g. with mental defectives. See Social Science and Social Pathology, page 256 ff.). Similarly, the argument that different standards of mental defect prevail in different cultures, and that therefore {{there is something wrong with}} the concept of mental defect, is intended to be (at least in her more radical moments) a general one, i. e. it is intended to apply, mutatis mutandis against other kinds of mental disorders also.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the long-term durability after successful SRER for early Barrett's neoplasia. Patients who were treated with SRER for BE ≤ 5 cm with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or early cancer (EC) and had reached complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) and neoplasia (CE-neo) were included. Primary outcomes: recurrence of neoplasia (HGD/EC), recurrence of dysplasia (indefinite of dysplasia included) and recurrence of endoscopically visible BE. buried Barrett's glands, IM in biopsy specimens obtained distal to a normal-appearing neo-squamocolumnar junction, need for retreatment, and sustained CE-IM and CE-neo at the last follow up endoscopy. Seventy-three patients were included (64 men, mean age 66 years, median BE C 2 M 3). Median follow-up was 76 months. Recurrence of neoplasia was observed in 1 patient (T 1 bN 0 M 0) after 129 months of follow-up and was treated with curative surgery (annual incidence of 0. 22 % per patient-year of follow-up). In 4 patients, recurrence of dysplasia was found (0. 87 % per patient-year of follow-up). Twelve patients had recurrent endoscopically visible BE after a median follow-up of 22 months (2. 6 % per patient-year of follow-up), mostly small islands or tongues.

40|$|Background: Cerebral malaria is {{a severe}} {{neurological}} form of malaria {{that affects the}} central nervous system, is caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia, and has a common complication of seizures and coma especially in children. In African {{children under the age}} of 5 it is the leading cause of death; over one million children in sub-Saharan Africa alone die or are disabled as a result of cerebral malaria annually. Seizures are a frequent complication of cerebral malaria and are associated with an increased risk of death and neurological sequelae including epilepsy, as well as a much broader range of motor and cognitive impairments. These impairments severely impact a child’s lifelong educational and social potential. Phenobarbital is an effective anti-convulsant that both controls and prevents seizures, is widely available in resource poor countries and can be delivered in a single IM dose for ease of rapid delivery. The objective is to assess the efficacy of phenobarbital when given as anti-convulsant prophylaxis in children with cerebral malaria. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was performed using CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database, and the African Index Medicus. The search terms included “cerebral malaria”, “children”, “Phenobarbital”, “prophylaxis” and “seizure”. All full text articles in the English language were used. Meta-analysis and case studies were excluded. Three articles were chosen for review. Results: Overall it was found in all the studies that the prophylactic use of phenobarbital (PB) in children with cerebral malaria decreased the number of prolonged seizures they had while in the acute stage of parasitemia. It was also found that malaria treatment with quinine does not potentiate or interact with the PB, and that PB does not prolong coma or delay the recovery of children with cerebral malaria, nor does PB have any long term negative cognitive effects in children. However, the dose and route of administration of PB in children remains a controversy. One study that suggested that PB 20 mg/kg intramuscularly was effective, but the children in this study receiving treatment had a mortality rate double the control group, likely due to anti-convulsant polypharmacy. Another study recommended 10 mg/kg IM dosing but it was found to not be effective in controlling seizures. One study showed that 15 mg/kg intravenously was effective, and a parallel simulated study recommended that the same dose given <b>IM</b> would be <b>just</b> as effective, although there is no actual data to support this. Conclusion: The use of phenobarbital as a prophylactic anti-convulsive in children that have cerebral malaria is an effective way of decreasing acute seizure activity and therefore reducing the risk of long term neurological sequelae in this population. Standardized dosing and route of administration of phenobarbital for this application have not yet been established however, and more randomized controlled trials need to be completed before recommendations can be made...|$|R
40|$|Objective – This study investigates college students’ {{perceptions}} of instant messaging (IM) and e‐mail for conveying emotions, aiding in relationship building, ease of use, and reliability. Design – A survey consisting of 59 questions {{was administered to}} 1, 000 college students, resulting in 545 usable responses. Setting – The research took place at a midwestern university in the United States. Subjects – 1, 000 Management Information Systems (MIS) college students. Methods – A 59 ‐question survey was distributed to 1, 000 MIS students during the 2005 academic year. 545 usable responses were returned. Participation was voluntary. During the pre‐phase of the research, four categories were determined: emotion, relationship, usage, and reliability. Questions were then written for a pilot study using Likert scaling. The post‐research phase involved evaluating the questions linguistically to ensure proper word usage, comprehension, and lack of bias. Main Results – The questions in the section on conveying emotion dealt with how well the two technologies (e‐mail and IM) communicated feelings and emotions. While both technologies were acknowledged as being able to communicate more than merely text, IM was clearly preferred for expressing emotion. Fifty‐two {{percent of the respondents}} strongly agreed or agreed that they used emoticons (originally symbols created with letters and special characters; later evolving into graphical images produced and made available by IM companies) to express emotion in IM, while fewer than 11 % agreed or strongly agreed that they did so in e‐mail. More than 70 % of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that their friends used emoticons in IM,while fewer than 14 % strongly agreed or agreed that their friends used emoticons in e‐mails. More than 75 % of respondents agreed that it is easier to convey emotions in IM than via e‐mail. Analysis on the questions that dealt with the technologies as useful relationship builders again showed a preference for IM. IM was preferred by a greater number of respondents for fostering friendships, improving relationships with friends or team members, building relationships, social interaction, and social networking. This section also found that more than 75 % of the respondents felt that IM was more useful than e‐mail when interacting with friends. However, when asked about interacting with co‐workers specifically, only 44 % were in agreement. Nearly 32 % were neutral on this point, while 24 % were in disagreement. It appears that IM is preferred over e‐mail for fostering social and friendly relationships, but is not preferred when the interaction is work‐related and more professional. In terms of use, both technologies were considered easy to learn and use by more than 90 % of respondents. In terms of preferred use, more than 60 % of respondents use IM for personal and social interaction, while less than 1 % uses IM for work‐related activities. Nearly 80 % of respondents preferred using e‐mail for work, and nearly 75 % preferred using IM for social interaction. Sixty‐three percent of respondents did not agree that <b>IM</b> is <b>just</b> as effective as face‐to‐face meetings, while nearly 75 % did not agree that e‐mail can be as effective as meeting face‐to‐face. In the areas of reliability, security, and privacy of IM and e‐mail, respondents perceived e‐mail more favourably. Sixty-four percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that IM is very reliable, while 80 % of respondents felt the same way about e‐mail. Just over 30 % of those questioned agreed that IM is very secure, while more than 50 % felt that way about email. However, the gap is narrower when users were queried {{as to whether or not}} they worry about security: 13 % strongly agreedwith the statement that users do not worry about their security when using IM, while 15 % strongly agreed with the statement as it pertained to e‐mail.
