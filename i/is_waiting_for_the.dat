25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> right time to mount an attack.|$|E
25|$|Adjustment {{of status}} (AOS) – Adjustment of status is {{for when the}} {{immigrant}} is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally. Except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the immigrant must also be in legal status {{at the time of}} applying for adjustment of status. For immediate relatives and other relative categories whose visa numbers are current, adjustment of status can be filed for at the same time with the petition (step 1 above). Adjustment of status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. The USCIS conducts a series of background checks (including fingerprinting for FBI criminal background check and name checks) and makes a decision on the application. Once the adjustment of status application is accepted, the alien is allowed to stay in the United States even if the original period of authorized stay on the Form I-94 is expired, but he/she is generally not allowed to leave the country until the application is approved, or the application will be abandoned. If the alien has to leave the United States during this time, he/she can apply for travel documents at the USCIS with form I-131, also called Advance parole. If there is a potential risk that the applicant's work permit (visa) will expire or become invalid (laid off by the employer and visa sponsor) or the applicant wants to start working in the United States, while he/she <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> decision about his/her application to change status, he/she can file form I-765, to get Employment Authorization Documents (also called EAD) and be able to continue or start working legally in the United States. In some cases, the applicant will be interviewed at a USCIS office, especially if it is a marriage-based adjustment from a K-1 visa, in which case both spouses (the US citizen and the applicant) will be interviewed by the USCIS. If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien's last known mailing address.|$|E

2500|$|Paul {{bought a}} Cadillac {{to use on}} their {{expanding}} road tours with plenty of space for all their electronic gear. They also purchased a woodland retreat in Mahwah, New Jersey, in the Ramapo Mountains, and their mansion included a recording studio and an echo chamber carved out of a neighboring mountain. In September 1952, after cutting [...] "I'm Sitting on Top of the World", Ford and Paul sailed for London to appear at the Palladium Theatre, where they debuted before Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family. In 1952, their innovative sound was satirized by Stan Freberg in his recording of [...] "The World <b>Is</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sunrise" [...] (Capitol, F 2279).|$|E
2500|$|Ford and Paul were music superstars {{during the}} first half of the 1950s, putting out 28 hits for Capitol Records between 1950 and 1957, {{including}} [...] "Tiger Rag", [...] "Vaya con Dios" [...] (11 weeks at #1), [...] "Mockin' Bird Hill" [...] (top 10), [...] "How High the Moon" [...] (nine weeks at #1), [...] "Bye Bye Blues" [...] and [...] "The World <b>Is</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sunrise". These songs featured Ford harmonizing with herself, giving the vocals a novel sound. Paul and Ford did all their recording at home or on the road and submitted the masters to Capitol, with Paul dictating to the record company what songs were destined to become hits. Paul and Ford also used the now-ubiquitous recording technique known as close miking, where the microphone is less than six inches from the singer's mouth. This produces a more intimate, less reverberant sound than when the singer is a foot or more from the microphone. It also emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice. The result was a singing style that diverged strongly from earlier styles, such as vocals in musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare's Sonnet 57, {{shows that}} [...] "his {{love for the}} fair youth is seen as pure and even heavenly…" [...] but in other sonnets he {{introduces}} new characters, one in particular the Dark Lady, [...] "his association with the dark lady leads to infection and madness of love". [...] He also uses a terminology about his love and how beautiful it appears, but when this love is being directed {{to a young man}} this might appear out of the norm at this time. In the line [...] "Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you" [...] the word [...] "sovereign" [...] implies that the youth is held at a higher degree and [...] "watch the clock for you" [...] implies that he will wait for something to happen because of the youth's age or because he <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> youth to recognise his love. [...] The line [...] "nor dare I question with my jealous thought" [...] implies that he has considered that jealously will raise doubts in his head and might drive his love to madness. [...] That this could end up driving the poet to insanity is suggested in this line, [...] "but, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought." [...] The Speaker is referring to himself as the slave again and is diminishing himself by implying no one would love so low and asking the fair youth to clear his mind of all thoughts of him. [...] Although he is comparing himself to a slave, the poet's love has never once subsided. [...] The last two lines saying [...] "so true a fool is love, that in your will, though you do anything, he thinks no ill." [...] The word [...] "will" [...] could be seen as desire or possibly used as a pun on his name, Will. [...] Since he thinks no ill, he is admitting that his love for the youth has made him a fool: [...] "Ultimately Shakespeare provides space for the homoerotic but must eventually return to the perpetuating systems of heterosexual love". This critique states that Shakespeare's sonnets must seen as a continuation of love sonnets that play with different ideas of love. Love could imply economic interest or patronage. Another way of viewing the poet's intent could be a sexual or erotic attraction (as the critic Rudd emphasises) or a brotherly or platonic affection.|$|E
