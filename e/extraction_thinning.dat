By removing the sap-phire substrate through laser lift-off, vertical current conduction becomes possible, improving current spreading capability and thus electrical properties.

Molecular interaction mechanism between doliroside and amyloid β 42 protein was evaluated by thioflavin T fluorescence (ThT), circular dichroism (CD), atomic force microscope (AFM), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) from the aspects of kinetics, secondary structure, morphology, and thermodynamics, respectively. Results show that the purity of doliroside A is 99. 9 % by HPLC, and its chemical structure is identified by 1 H- and 13 C-NMR. Doliroside A is observed to be concentration-dependent inhibiting the fibrillation of Aβ 42 with the IC 50 value of 26. 57 ± 1. 6 μM.

We examined eight profiles along this sequence, ranging from pale brown loamy coral sand {{on the lowest}} bench that fringes the coast at an elevation of about 10 m to deep, intensely red and acid clay on the highest bench at about 240 m. Chemical analyses, differential Fe <b>extractions,</b> <b>thin</b> sections, X-ray diffraction of the clay minerals and indices of pedochemical weathering and strain indicated that soil development progressed by weathering of primary and secondary phyllosilicates through argilluviation in the intermediate stages to the generation of increasing quantities of free Fe. The Fe accumulates as free sesquioxides, which crystallize with age. Taxonomically the soil types progress from sandy coral Arenosol, through Eutric Cambisol, Hypereutric Lixisol and Acrisol to incipient Ferralsol (Udipsamment → Eutrudept → Udalf → Udultisol → Udox in Soil Taxonomy). The profiles are interpreted as a chronosequence, although this is complicated by minor and upwardly diminishing contributions of reef coral to the mainly igneous parent materials. There are also variations in the andesitic-basaltic bedrock, and minor aeolian inputs in the higher and older soil types. Regional eustatic sea-level correlations, 14 C dating of carbonates on the two lowest benches and estimates of local tectonic uplift indicate that the incipient Ferralsols on the upper bench might date from about 150 ka. The transition through argilluvial Acrisols to incipient sesquioxide-dominated Ferralsols appears, therefore, to develop within 100 – 200 ka on Green Island, which is faster than usual...|$|R

The Young's moduli are determined using the resonance frequencies measured by laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV). Finite element modeling (FEM) is used to consider the under-etching of the cantilevers at the anchor. In this study, {{we find that the}} Young moduli of GaN and AlN layers are respectively 261 ± 60 GPa and 339 ± 78 GPa that compares well with the results found in the literature for bulk materials...|$|R
40|$|Several {{reports on}} the {{phytochemical}} screening and antibacterial assays on M. oleifera leaves extract have been documented {{but none of the}} reports showed the fractionation and separation of the phytoconstituents by solvent <b>extraction</b> and <b>thin</b> layer chromatographic procedures, respectively. The ethanolic leaves extract of M. oleifera of the family moringaceae was reviewed for the antibacterial susceptibility pattern, preliminary phytochemical analysis, solvent extraction and TLC analysis, which were carried out using standard procedures. The results of the preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of saponins, condensed tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, phenolics, alkaloids, phlobatannins, cardiac glycosides and reducing sugars. The TLC separation of the phytoconstituents using chloroform-methanol solvent system resolved the fractionated extract into compounds with Rf values; 0. 32, 0. 53, 0. 54, 0. 55, 0. 69, 0. 89, 0. 95 and 0. 97. The antibacterial susceptibility pattern portrayed broad activity spectrum against the test microbes with comparable inhibitory zones by standard antibiotics. The MIC ranged between 0. 1 mg/ml and 9 Omg/ml for all the organisms. The results from this review have shown the antibacterial susceptibility pattern of M. oleifera implying that the extract could help as a chemotherapeutic agent or might be a lead compound for the development of new efficacious antibacterial agents...|$|R
