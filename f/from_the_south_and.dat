5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{now with}} the commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade under command, had to defend the Orne bridgehead. This {{was not an easy}} task as it had to face {{elements}} of the 21st Panzer Division <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> the 346th and 711th Infantry Divisions from the east.|$|E
5|$|After Thiệu's resignation, the South Vietnamese {{military}} situation increasingly declined. On the 26th, the North Vietnamese {{launched an}} all-out attack to take Biên Hòa and the sprawling logistical complex at Long Binh <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> southeast. Three days later, {{the port city}} of Vũng Tàu was under assault and the pressure against the Cu Chi front was intense.|$|E

5|$|Caversham Valley {{has long}} been the major route out of the central city to the south. The suburb is located close {{to the start of the}} Dunedin Southern Motorway (part of State Highway 1), the main road access to central Dunedin <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>and</b> close to the South Island Main Trunk railway. The {{creation}} of the Dunedin Southern Motorway redirected traffic away from South Road, the main thoroughfare through Caversham.|$|E
5|$|Despite the debacle, Reshef {{remained}} {{determined to}} seize the junction, giving the task to the division's reconnaissance battalion attached to his brigade. To achieve surprise, the battalion maneuvered to attack at 3:00 AM from the west, as the Egyptians were preparing for further attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> east. As the Israelis attacked, Lieutenant Colonel Brom was killed barely thirty meters from Egyptian positions, disrupting his battalion's assault. The Israelis sustained losses, but managed to retreat. Soon after, a tank company attacked the crossroads at 4:00 AM on October 16, but also withdrew after losing three tanks.|$|E
5|$|However, {{a recent}} genetic studies {{carried out by}} HUGO (Human Genome Organization) {{involving}} almost 2000 people across Asia, points to another theory of Asian migration pattern. The HUGO findings {{support the hypothesis that}} Asia was populated primarily through a single migration event <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> that the South East Asian region was populated first which contained the most diversity, then continuing slowly North with its diversity being lost.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Davis met Varina Banks Howell, then 17 years old, whom {{his brother}} Joseph had invited for the Christmas season at Hurricane Plantation. She was a granddaughter of New Jersey Governor Richard Howell; her mother's family was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> {{included}} successful Scots-Irish planters. Within {{a month of}} their meeting, the 35-year-old widower Davis had asked Varina to marry him, and they became engaged despite her parents' initial concerns about his age and politics. They were married on February 26, 1845.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon withdrew {{back into}} France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers, and little cavalry; he faced {{more than three}} times as many Allied troops. The French were surrounded: British armies pressed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>and</b> other Coalition forces {{positioned}} to attack from the German states. Napoleon won a series of victories in the Six Days' Campaign, though these were not significant enough to turn the tide. The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June, Prpić {{launched}} a three-pronged assault to clear the routes to Nevesinje. Prohaska commanded the push east along the Mostar–Nevesinje road by a force close to two battalions, Francetić led his unit of Ustaše north from Berkovići through the mountains via Odžak to approach Nevesinje <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>and</b> two companies of the 11th Battalion thrust southwest along the road from Plužine. Once this task was complete, the NDH forces were to vigorously pursue the rebels and destroy them.|$|E

He also edited two collections of short stories from the frontier, The Big Bear of Arkansas in 1846 and A Quarter Race in Kentucky and Other Sketches in 1847.|$|E
5|$|The Amorite Mari {{maintained}} the older {{aspects of the}} economy, which was still largely based on irrigated agriculture along the Euphrates valley. The city kept its trading role and was a center for merchants from Babylonia and other kingdoms, it received goods <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> east through riverboats and distributed them north, north west and west. The main merchandises handled by Mari were metals and tin imported from the Iranian Plateau and then exported west as far as Crete. Other goods included copper from Cyprus, silver from Anatolia, woods from Lebanon, gold from Egypt, olive oil, wine, and textiles in addition to precious stones from modern Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue {{marks the}} {{boundary}} with Glastonbury, {{to the north}} of Street. At the time of King Arthur, the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>and</b> it was here that Sir Bedivere is thought to have thrown the sword Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.|$|E

5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry attacked <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> west. Capehart's brigade attacked from the southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E
5|$|With {{the exodus}} of several {{manufacturing}} companies, the area's industrial economy began to decline during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led {{to the collapse of}} the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics. This decline would continue into the later half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000. The 1969 closure of the Springfield Armory, in particular, spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Wittmann briefed the Panzer-Lehr Division {{intelligence}} officer {{and was given}} a Schwimmwagen to return to Point 213. Kauffmann ordered Hauptmann Helmut Ritgen to block the northern exits of the town with 15 Panzer IV, mainly from 6th Company, 2nd Battalion Panzer-Lehr Regiment 130 and ten from a workshop south of Route Nationale 175. Ritgen rendezvoused with the Panzer-Lehr Division commanding officer, Generalleutnant Fritz Bayerlein, at Villy-Bocage. As Ritgen's tanks moved towards Villers-Bocage they ran into a British anti-tank gun screen and lost a tank. Four Panzer IVs entered the town <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> the first two tanks were knocked out; the others withdrew.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of the 26th Corps at Hagaru-ri, the PVA High Command ordered the 26th and the 27th Corps to chase the {{escaping}} UN force with the 20th Corps blocking the escape route. But with most of the 20th Corps destroyed at Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the only forces between Koto-ri and Hungnam were the remnants of the 58th and the 60th Divisions. In desperation, Song Shi-Lun ordered these troops to dig in at Funchilin Pass while blowing up the vital treadway bridge, hoping the terrain and obstacles would allow the 26th and the 27th Corps {{to catch up with the}} retreating UN forces. The PVA 180th Regiment that occupied Hill 1081 blew up the original concrete bridge and two improvised replacements in succession, believing the bridge was rendered irreparable. In response, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines (1/1) attacked Hill 1081 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>and</b> the hill was captured on 9 December after the defenders fought to the last man. At the same time, the 7th Marines and RCT-31 attacked the treadway bridge from the north, only to encounter defenders that were already frozen in their foxholes.|$|E
5|$|Bittrich {{ordered a}} {{resumption}} of the offensive {{during the night}} of 29–30 June, hoping to avoid Allied air support. The 19th and 20th Regiments of the 9th SS Panzer Division, renewed their attacks against Grainville-sur-Odon and le Valtru in the dark but little progress was made against the 11th Armoured Division north of the Odon and heavy British artillery bombardments. At 0120, the 10th SS Panzer Division started to move towards Hill 112 and at dawn, covered by a heavy artillery barrage they assaulted the vacated British positions. Unaware that the British had pulled back, Panzergrenadiers and tanks of the 10th SS Panzer advanced on the hill <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> south-west and infantry from 12th SS Panzer attacked from the east and south-east. Meeting no opposition, by noon the Germans had occupied the hill. A British counter-attack and artillery fire broke up a follow-up attack towards Baron-sur-Odon.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, Mickl's kampfgruppe was deployed {{on the high}} ground {{on either side of}} the airfield at Sidi Rezegh. That afternoon, British armoured cars and tanks appeared, and Mickl's force was hard-pressed to hold its positions barring the British approach to Tobruk <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> south-east, as little tank support was available. In the face of a superior force, Mickl's kampfgruppe fought hard in what became known as the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, with their commander often forward rallying his troops, and in the thick of counter-attacks launched to regain ground. Mickl and around 800 of his troops were captured by elements of the New Zealand Division on 26 November 1941, the captured troops being mainly from the Afrika Regiment.|$|E
