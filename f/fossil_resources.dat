This paper explores changes in resource consumption patterns in the UK between 1968 and 2000. Using an environmental input-output model, the paper tracks the <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> requirements attributable to 8 high-level functional purposes and finds that overall <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> consumption increased 35 % over the 32 Â year period.

The size of remaining <b>fossil</b> phosphate <b>resources</b> is uncertain but practically finite. Thus, <b>fossil</b> P <b>resources</b> may become depleted by ongoing mining. Despite calls for <b>resource</b> conservation, <b>fossil</b> P <b>resources</b> have been depleted at an increasing rate. Geographically, fossil P supply and demand are distributed in an increasingly uneven way, which has geopolitical consequences and may well affect security of supply. Current use of P gives rise to negative environmental impacts due to P losses from the economy and contaminants derived from <b>fossil</b> P <b>resources.</b> There may also be negative impacts on human health. Reducing the demand for fossil phosphorus may reduce environmental burdens and may improve the future security of supply.

40|$|<b>Fossil</b> <b>resource</b> endowments and {{the future}} {{development}} of fossil fuel prices are important factors that will critically influence the nature {{and direction of the}} global energy system. In this paper we analyze a multi-model ensemble of long-term energy and emissions scenarios that were developed {{within the framework of the}} EMF 27 integrated assessment model intercomparison exercise. The diverse nature of these models highlights large uncertainties in the likely development of <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> (coal, oil, and natural gas) consumption, trade, and prices over the course of the twenty-first century and under different climate policy frameworks. We explore and explain some of the differences across scenarios and models and compare the scenario results with <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> estimates from the literature. A robust finding across the suite of IAMs is that the cumulative fossil fuel consumption foreseen by the models is well within the bounds of estimated recoverable reserves and <b>resources.</b> Hence, <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> constraints are, in and of themselves, unlikely to limit future GHG emissions this century. Our analysis also shows that climate mitigation policies could lead to a major reallocation of financial flows between regions, in terms of expenditures on fossil fuels and carbon, and can help to alleviate near-term energy security concerns via the reductions in oil imports and increases in energy system diversity they will help to motivate. Aggressive efforts to promote energy efficiency are, on their own, not likely to lead to markedly greater energy independence, however, contrary to the stated objectives of certain industrialized countries.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which future energy transformation pathways meeting ambitious climate change mitigation targets depend on assumptions about economic growth and fossil fuel availability. The analysis synthesizes results from the RoSE multi-model study aiming to identify robust and sensitive features of mitigation pathways under these inherently uncertain drivers of energy and emissions developments. Based on an integrated assessment model comparison exercise, we show that economic growth and <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> assumptions substantially affect baseline developments, but in no case they lead to the significant greenhouse gas emission reduction that would be needed to achieve long-term climate targets without dedicated climate policy. The influence of economic growth and <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> assumptions on climate mitigation pathways is relatively small due to overriding requirements imposed by long-term climate targets. While baseline assumptions can have substantial effects on mitigation costs and carbon prices, we find that the effects of model differences and the stringency of the climate target are larger compared to that of baseline assumptions. We conclude that inherent uncertainties about socio-economic determinants like economic growth and <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> availability can be effectively dealt with in the assessment of mitigation pathways...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{consequences}} of renewable energy policies on welfare, resource rents and energy costs {{in a world where}} carbon pricing is imperfect and the regulator seeks to limit emissions to a (cumulative) target. We use a global general equilibrium model with an intertemporal <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> sector. We calculate the optimal second-best renewable energy subsidy and compare the resulting welfare level with an efficient first-best carbon pricing policy. If carbon pricing is permanently missing, mitigation costs increase by a multiple (compared to the optimal carbon pricing policy) {{for a wide range of}} parameters describing extraction costs, renewable energy costs, substitution possibilities and normative attitudes. Furthermore, we show that small deviations from the second-best subsidy can lead to strong increases in emissions and consumption losses. This confirms the rising concerns about the occurrence of unintended side effects of climate policy { a new version of the green paradox. We extend our second-best analysis by considering two further types of policy instruments: (1) temporary subsidies that are displaced by carbon pricing in the long run and (2) revenue-neutral instruments like a carbon trust and a feed-in-tariff scheme. Although these instruments cause small welfare losses, they have the potential to ease distributional conflicts as they lead to lower energy prices and higher <b>fossil</b> <b>resource</b> rents than the optimal carbon pricing policy.

5000|$|There is {{also the}} issue of the {{perceived}} economic costs of action. In Germany, in contrast with many other countries, climate action is not considered to be an economic burden. The additional financial burden on the average household has been rather small, although it has increased {{in the form of a}} growing tax burden. Although certain measures have clear and distinct costs, there is a growing belief that the broader efforts to move to cleaner technologies have created economic [...] "winners" [...] as well. Green technology and renewable energy sectors have created many new jobs. In addition, the dependency on the world energy market for <b>fossil</b> <b>resources</b> is decreasing, reducing Germany's economic-political vulnerability. Thus, a structural change toward a climate-sensitive energy policy has been adopted with almost no social conflicts. These positive employment and foreign energy policy effects of climate-related policies have played an imported role in the public's climate change discourse.|$|E
