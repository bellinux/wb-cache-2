Preparations containing lignocaine (Monash, 1957; Lubens et al., 1974), benzocaine (Dalili and Adriani, 1971), combinations of local anaesthetics with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) (Khgman, 1965; Brechner, Cohen and Pretsky, 1967) and <b>ketocaine</b> in alcoholic solutions (Pettersson, 1978) have been tried. Physical methods such as iontophoresis have been applied to improve penetration through the intact skin (Rapperport, 1971; Russo et al., 1980). However, no formulation has gained wide accep-tance, mainly as a result of inadequate relief of pain, local irritation or toxic reactions. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics) cream in obtunding the pain associated with the insertion of an i. v. cannula in unpremedicated adult volunteers, and to evaluate possible adverse reactions to the preparation. EMLA cream is a preparation containing a mixture of the bases of lignocaine and prilocaine (Juhlin, Evers and Broberg, 1979). SUBJECTS AND METHODS Forty volunteers, participating in an occupational health investigation of hospital staff at the Karolinska Hospital, were invited to participate in the present study. Eight venous blood samples were required from each individual, and the effects of EMLA and a placebo were evaluated in connection with the sampling. The volunteers were informed about the aims and the nature of the study via...|$|E
