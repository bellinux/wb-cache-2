The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Worsley <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity, {{including}} two Roman roads. The completion in 1761 of the Bridgewater Canal allowed Worsley to expand {{from a small}} village of cottage industries to an important town based upon cotton manufacture, iron-working, brick-making and extensive coal mining. Later expansion came after the First and Second World Wars, when large urban estates {{were built in the}} region.|$|E
5|$|Pottery shards {{found at}} the {{important}} site of Jarlshof also indicate that there was Neolithic activity there although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age. This includes a smithy, a cluster of wheelhouses and a later broch. The site <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of habitation during various phases right up until Viking times.

5|$|Through {{observation}} of the light curves of many Type Ia supernovae, {{it was discovered that}} they appear to have a common peak luminosity. By measuring the luminosity of these events, the distance to their host galaxy can be estimated with good accuracy. Thus this category of supernovae has become highly useful as a standard candle for measuring cosmic distances. In 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project discovered that the most distant Type Ia supernovae appeared dimmer than expected. This <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{the expansion of the universe}} may be accelerating.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of water and Earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. This began as {{the study of the}} shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical oceanography. Marine biology (biological oceanography) studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of continental drift and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.|$|E

The VIRTIS spectrometer on board the Rosetta spacecraft <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere {{on the surface of}} comet 67P with little to no water ice visible. Preliminary analyses strongly suggest the carbon is present as polyaromatic organic solids mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel alloys.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies using}} Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> proving that {{chemical}} {{changes that occur}} with emotions are similar between humans and non-human animals. In a study comparing guinea pigs and humans, {{it was determined that}} the distress experienced by offspring separation in a guinea pig and a human going through depression activates the same region of the brain. The opiate receptor was also examined, allowing observation of the pleasure stimuli. In the procedure both human and a rat had their receptors blocked with a certain drug. Once receptors were blocked, both the rat and the human were exposed to pleasurable food, but both were disinclined to eat the food.|$|E
25|$|Quantum theory also {{provides}} accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena, such as black-body radiation and {{the stability of}} the orbitals of electrons in atoms. It has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems, including smell receptors and protein structures. Recent work on photosynthesis <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> that quantum correlations play an essential role in this fundamental process of plants and many other organisms. Even so, classical physics can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers. Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.|$|E

25|$|A new {{sample from}} the Gogo Formation in the Canning Basin of Western Australia <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> {{regarding}} the morphological {{features of the}} visceral jaw elements of Bothriolepis. Using the sample, {{it is evident that}} the mental plate (a dermal bone that forms {{the upper part of the}} jaw) of antiarchs is homologous with the suborbital plate found in other placoderms. The lower jawbone consists of differentiated blade and biting portions. Next to the mandibular joint are the prelateral and infraprelateral plates, which both are canal-bearing bones. The palatoquadrate lacks a high orbital process and was attached only to the ventral part of the mental plate, proving that the ethmoidal region of the braincase (the region of the skull that separates the brain and nasal cavity) was in fact deeper than originally believed. In addition to the above listed sample from the Gogo Formation, several other specimens have been found with mouthparts held in the natural position by a membrane that covers the oral region and attaches to the lateral and anterior margins of the head. Bothriolepis has a jaw in which the two halves are separate and in the adult are functionally independent.|$|E
25|$|From the Israeli perspective, a key {{concern is}} security, {{and whether the}} major Palestinian figures and {{institutions}} are in fact trying to fight terrorism and promote tolerance and co-existence with Israel. Israeli concerns are based on abundant documentary and empirical evidence of many Palestinian leaders having in fact promoted and supported terrorist groups and activities. Furthermore, there is much concrete evidence of Palestinians having supported and expressed incitment against Israel, its motives, actions, and basic rights as a state. The election of Hamas <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for this view, with the Hamas charter stating unequivocally {{that it does not}} recognize Israel's right to exist. However, there remain some activists on the Palestinian side who claim that there are still some positive signs on the Palestinian side, and that Israel should use these to cultivate some positive interactions with the Palestinians, even in spite of Hamas's basic opposition to the existence of the Jewish State. Since mid-June 2007, Israel has cooperated with Palestinian security forces in the West Bank at unprecedented levels, thanks in part to United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.|$|E
500|$|A University of California {{research}} team, led by Nobel Prize winner Stanley Prusiner, <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for {{the theory}} that infection can occur from prions in manure. [...] And, since manure is present in many areas surrounding water reservoirs, as well as used on many crop fields, it raises the possibility of widespread transmission. [...] It was reported in January 2011 that researchers had discovered prions spreading through airborne transmission on aerosol particles, in an animal testing experiment focusing on scrapie infection in laboratory mice. [...] Preliminary evidence supporting the notion that prions can be transmitted through use of urine-derived human menopausal gonadotropin, administered {{for the treatment of}} infertility, was published in 2011.|$|E

500|$|Iguanodon was {{not part}} of the initial work of the dinosaur renaissance that began with the {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969, but it was not neglected for long. David B. Weishampel's work on ornithopod feeding mechanisms provided a better understanding of how it fed, and David B. Norman's work on numerous aspects of the genus has made it one of the best-known dinosaurs. In addition, a further find of numerous Iguanodon skeletons, in Nehden, Nordrhein-Westphalen, Germany, <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for gregariousness in this genus, as the animals in this areally restricted find appear to have been killed by flash floods. At least 15 individuals, from [...] long, have been found here, although at least some of them are gracile iguanodontians and belong to the related Mantellisaurus or Dollodon (described as I. atherfieldensis, at that time believed to be another species of Iguanodon).|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} phase of stellar evolution, massive stars like Betelgeuse exhibit {{high rates of}} mass loss, {{possibly}} as much as 1 every [...] years, resulting in a complex circumstellar environment that is constantly in flux. In a 2009 paper, stellar mass loss was cited as the [...] "key to understanding {{the evolution of the}} universe from the earliest cosmological times to the current epoch, and of planet formation and the formation of life itself". However, the physical mechanism is not well understood. When Schwarzschild first proposed his theory of huge convection cells, he argued it was the likely cause of mass loss in evolved supergiants like Betelgeuse. Recent work has corroborated this hypothesis, yet there are still uncertainties about the structure of their convection, the mechanism of their mass loss, the way dust forms in their extended atmosphere, and the conditions which precipitate their dramatic finale as a type II supernova. In 2001, Graham Harper estimated a stellar wind at 0.03 every [...] years, but research since 2009 <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of episodic mass loss making any total figure for Betelgeuse uncertain. Current observations suggest that a star like Betelgeuse may spend a portion of its lifetime as a red supergiant, but then cross back across the H-R diagram, pass once again through a brief yellow supergiant phase and then explode as a blue supergiant or Wolf-Rayet star.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes a {{distinction}} is made between [...] "physical pain" [...] and [...] "emotional" [...] or [...] "psychological pain". [...] Emotional pain is the pain {{experienced in the}} absence of physical trauma, e.g. the pain experienced by humans after the loss of a loved one, or the break-up of a relationship. [...] It has been argued that only primates and humans can feel [...] "emotional pain", because they are the only animals that have a neocortex – a part of the brain's cortex considered to be the [...] "thinking area". However, research <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> that monkeys, dogs, cats and birds can show signs of emotional pain and display behaviours associated with depression during painful experience, i.e. lack of motivation, lethargy, anorexia, unresponsiveness to other animals.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Barnett, who was {{a senior}} {{official}} at the UN at that time, <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> that the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) failed {{to pass on to}} the Security Council information that could have bolstered a case for intervention.

The informer was Jean-Pierre Twatzinze, who has been asked to compile the list. According to Barnett, UN inaction stemmed from its desire not to get involved in a potentially PR-risky operation which could damage the prospects for future peacebuilding operations, given that 18 UN troops had recently been killed in Somalia, even though UN troops had the capacity to save thousands of lives. [...] "For many at the UN", Barnett writes, the moral compass pointed [...] "away from and not toward Rwanda." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is clear, however, that Catherine {{regarded}} these festivals as {{more than}} a political and pragmatic exercise; she revelled in them as a vehicle for her creative gifts. A highly talented and artistic woman, Catherine took the lead in devising and planning her own musical-mythological shows and is regarded as their creator as well as their sponsor. Historian Frances Yates has called her [...] "a great creative artist in festivals". Though they were ephemeral, Catherine's [...] "magnificences" [...] are studied by modern scholars as works of art. Catherine employed the leading writers, artists, and architects of the day, including Antoine Caron, Germain Pilon, and Pierre Ronsard, to create the dramas, music, scenic effects, and decorative works required to animate the themes of the festivals, which were usually mythological and dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm. It is difficult for scholars to reconstruct the exact form of Catherine's entertainments, but research into the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of their richness and scale.|$|E
