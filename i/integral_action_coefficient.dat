40|$|In this paper, a laboratorial {{experiment}} {{has been}} used to investigate some aspects re-lated to <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> in model predictive control (MPC). Simulations using the same model as used for control design may indicate that <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> is present and that disturbances are handled well with no steady-state offset, but in practice unmodelled phe-nomena may give a poor response, including steady-state offset. The reason is that the controller may not contain feedback with <b>integral</b> <b>action,</b> although the zero offset sems to indicate it.

40|$|A {{technique}} that provides closed loop <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> {{depending on the}} passive outputs of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems is already available. This paper addresses a new method {{that allows us to}} add <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> also on system variables having relative degree higher than one, while still preserving the Hamiltonian form and, thus, closed loop stability. The new approach is applied to design speed regulation controllers for the permanent magnet synchronous motor. Closed loop stability and asymptotic rejection of unknown piecewise constant load torques are formally proved. This theoretically predicted control system performance is illustrated via simulation experiments, which also show that the properties hold under parameter uncertainties. This is in line with the usual practice of including <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> in a controller with the aim of improving its closed loop robustness. The fact that the method enhances the range of possible <b>integral</b> <b>actions</b> in the controller, enriched with this robustness property, allows us to assess it as a practically important complement to the well-known interconnection and damping assignment techniques developed in the framework of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems...|$|R
40|$|The load {{frequency}} control of inter-connected power systems using the self tuning control techniques {{is presented in}} this thesis. Different self tuning techniques are analyzed and it is shown that with some controllers the <b>integral</b> <b>action,</b> which is essential to provide the zero steady state condition, is achieved {{as a result of}} the chosen predictive model. Some schemes where the <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> is achieved through the choice of the cost function and the predictive model as well as schemes with the <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> built into the control algorithm are presented.

It is also shown that for slow sampling rates the basic minimum variance controller can function but as the sampling rate is increased to cover the required band width, the controller fails. The application of pole assignment techniques and generalised minimum variance control techniques are considered and it is shown that a stable control situation can be achieved with sampling rates at which the minimum variance controller is unstable...|$|R

This contribution concerns to the <b>integral</b> <b>action,</b> which is managed as function of control error sign. The effect due to the action of reset to zero or clear <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> when sign error changes, is a drastic reduction in response overshoot to command inputs for a special type of common industrial control systems among which, are ship steering control.

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{sufficient}} condition for the robust stability of constrained linear model predictive control is for the plant to be open-loop stable, for zero to be a feasible solution of the associated quadratic programme and for the input weighting be sufficiently high. The result can be applied equally to state feedback and output feedback controllers with arbitrary prediction horizon. If <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> is included a further condition on the steady state modelling error is required for stability. We illustrate the results with two forms of <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> commonly used with model predictive control. ...|$|R

The main control goal is to regulate oxygen/fuel ratio and intake manifold EGR-fraction. These are chosen as main performance variables since they are strongly coupled to the emissions. A recently developed non-linear control design based on feedback linearization is extended with <b>integral</b> <b>action.</b> The nonlinear controller gives an inner loop with good stability and robustness properties. It is shown that <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> is necessary to handle model errors so that the controller can track the performance variables specified in the outer loop. In particular the control design method utilizes a control Lyapunov function and inverse optimal control, which results in a control law with robustness properties interpretable as gain and phase margins. Furthermore, comparisons by simulation also show that the proposed control design successfully handles non-linear effects...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three main parts. The {{first part of the}} master thesis looks at the identification of thruster dynamics and low speed ship dynamics. The relevant parameters identified are time constants and time delays in the system. Simple step tests are used for the identification. Different models for identification are suggested, both for uncoupled surge, sway, and yaw dynamics. Other test results, such as agility plots, DP 4 corner tests, and pure DP tests (stationkeeping) are reported. All the results are to be compared to similar tests performed after R/V Gunnerus has a retrofit of the thruster system. The second part discusses another problem, and that is the topic of numerically estimat- ing the body frame position of the GNSS and MRU sensors. For the GNSS position an Luenberger observer design and an adaptive scheme are proposed and analyzed. The es- timation designs are tested using numerical simulations and experimental data from the Gunnerus sea trials. A similar Luenberger observer is proposed for the MRU positions, and experimental data from the sea trials are used to test the observer. The third part discusses a hybrid augmentation of <b>integral</b> <b>action.</b> The motivation is a DP system, where typically the <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> is tuned very low to avoid oscillations due to the <b>integral</b> <b>action.</b> When there is a sudden load change, such as a ice load that hits the vessel, or if a mooring wire snaps, then a hybrid update augmentation could be useful, to speed up the convergence of the <b>integral</b> <b>action.</b> The update law is a linear update law based on the error in the states (the velocity for the DP system). The augmentation can significantly improve performance, especially for very large disturbance changes. </p...|$|R
