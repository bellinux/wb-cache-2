5000|$|Eduardo Zuleta (born 19 November 1935, in Guayaquil) is a {{right-handed}} former noted Ecuadorian international tennis player. He {{competed in}} the Davis Cup in 1961 and 1963. [...] Eduardo competed on the U.S. {{as well as the}} European summer tennis circuit in the late 1950s-early 1960s, with notably more success on slow clay surfaces, on which he was a very steady and indefatigable retriever, than on the faster grass, which was a much more popular surface in his day than it is today. When not on the tournament circuit he practiced in Miami, where he was well known for hitting against a wall for hours, which gave him callouses on his racket hand a good quarter of an inch thick that he would shave down at night with a razor blade. He toured at times with Ecuadorians Washington Suarez and Davis Cupper Miguel Olvera. Zuleta had the nickname El Barco ("The Ship") in his home country because he invariably returned there from his tennis tours with suitcases full of tennis equipment and clothing that he received free from manufacturers as <b>goodwill</b> <b>advertising.</b> Perhaps his most conspicuous debut on the tennis stage was his first-round encounter on the grass of the U.S. Championships at Forest Hills, NY in 1963 with then U.S. No. 1 Chuck McKinley, who had just won Wimbledon two months earlier. The outcome was a foregone conclusion in straight sets, but Eduardo put up a creditable fight.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} a firm whose advertisements and sales contribute to its customers’ stock of <b>goodwill.</b> An <b>advertising</b> campaign precedes the firm’s sales when the marginal product of advertisement is sufficiently large (e. g., Amazon Kindle and Apple Macintosh), whereas sales of a new brand of a familiar product may start without advertising (e. g. Crocs shoes). When the firm chooses both advertising and sales policies, the optimal solutions {{can be divided into}} two groups typified by low and high demand elasticities. When demand elasticity is low, a massive increase in the quantity sold causes a considerable drop in the product's price. Therefore, the firm prefers to use advertising, rather than excess sales. With high demand elasticity, a massive increase in the quantity sold reduces the price only marginally, thus sales becomes a relatively cheap way to build up the stock of <b>goodwill,</b> compared with <b>advertising.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} a monopolist's {{quality and}} advertising policies and evaluates their social optimality. Our model considers a rational, though not fully informed, consumer who holds prior perceptions about aspects of quality, which determine his purchase pattern. These quality perceptions constitute the product's goodwill. Differences between expected and experienced quality lead to reevaluation of expectations. Monopolists affect these perceptions, and hence build up <b>goodwill,</b> by <b>advertising</b> and quality attribute variations. These affect consumer welfare {{directly and indirectly}} by their informational content. We find that advertising may profitably mislead, {{at least in the}} short run. Although the welfare effects of a monopolist's quality and advertising policies are not generally determinate, even when information is untrue, we are able to evaluate the welfare determinants of advertising policy from an objective standard and to specify some of the conditions under which advertising is socially excessive. ...|$|R

30|$|Unlike a lot {{of works}} in the {{literature}} which consider cases where {{only one of the}} players (particularly the retailer) is directly involved in advertising, this work incorporates the manufacturer’s national advertising into Sethi model. It then considered a situation where both players are involved in advertising, with the manufacturer involved in national advertising and the retailer in local advertising. We identified two types of equilibria. While one centred on unsubsidised retail advertising effort, the other majored on subsidized advertising. We obtained results which established how the advertising efforts affect the payoffs through the awareness share. The obtained strategies provide information on the extent that the firms should be involved in advertising. While the retailer should increase advertising with subsidy, the manufacturer should reduce advertising since his subsidy to the retailer is an involvement in advertising. Thus without much spending on brand name and <b>goodwill</b> (national <b>advertising)</b> his product can still be successfully sold by subsidising retail advertising.|$|R

40|$|Firms {{often use}} a pool or series of {{advertising}} themes in their campaigns. Thus, for example, a firm may employ {{some of its}} advertising to promote price-related themes or messages and other of its advertising to promote product-related themes. This study examines the interdependence that can occur between pairs of themes in a pool (i. e., pooling effects), {{the impact of these}} pooling effects on the allocation of advertising expenditures, and the factors that can affect forgetting rates (or, conversely, carry-over rates) in a multitheme advertising environment. The study measures pooling, wear out, and forgetting (carry-over) effects for a campaign that uses five different advertising themes. To obtain these measures, I extend the linear Nerlove-Arrow (NA) (1962) model to a nonlinear model of advertising theme quality and goodwill and estimate the extended model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and particle filtering ideas. Particle filtering belongs to a class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods designed to estimate nonlinear/nonnormal state space models. Results show that forgetting (or carry-over) rates may be time varying and a function of prior <b>goodwill</b> (past <b>advertising)</b> and other advertising variables. Results show, moreover, that pooling effects can reduce theme wear out and, in turn, significantly improve advertising efficiency.

40|$|Economic {{literature}} treats {{price as}} the traditional competition variable. However, Schmalensee (1976, p. 493) argued that prices change infrequently, and that firms compete mainly through non-price variables. The most impor-tant non-price competition variables are advertising and product variation. Although {{there are many}} works dealing with non-price competition, they have not devoted {{much attention to the}} multi-period effect of these variables and the models have been mainly static, or a sequence of static models. (Further discussion of this argument can be found in Kydland (1977), in which dynamic dominant player models are discussed.) In an earlier paper, Arrow and Nerlove (1962) pointed out that advertising expenditure should be treated {{in the same way as}} investment in a durable good.

40|$|In some product categories, generic {{advertising}} {{is used to}} increase market demand of the category {{and at the same}} time brand {{advertising is}} used to entice consumers to choose the advertised brand over competing brands. This paper empirically investigates the optimal levels of brand and generic advertising in a dynamic differentiated product oligopoly. A nested logit demand system incorporating brand and generic <b>advertising</b> <b>goodwill</b> stocks is specified and estimated without imposing any supply-side restrictions. Demand side parameters are then used to calibrate a dynamic game of brand and generic advertising that takes into account the vertical relationship between manufacturers and retailers. Estimates from the fluid milk product category indicate that brand advertising is effective for increasing brand level demand and generic advertising has a differential effect on individual brands.

40|$|In this paper, we empirically analyze weekly {{advertising}} {{policies of}} manufacturing firms in consumer goods markets. We assume firms engage in persuasive advertising, thus policies of firms affect the goodwill of a brand. We introduce a demand and a goodwill production function. A simple {{transformation of the}} demand function allows us to identify not only the demand parameters but also {{the parameters of the}} goodwill production function. We reconstruct the unobserved goodwill levels using these parameters and past advertising levels. We restrict our attention to Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) strategies which are functions of payoff relevant state variables. Without imposing further restrictions on the dynamic competitive environment, we investigate the relationship between observed advertising strategies—which are assumed to be MPE—and payoff relevant state variables by means of several reduced form specifications. The most important determinant of advertising intensity turns out to be goodwill. We demonstrate that controlling for an advertising campaign significantly improves the explanatory power of the model.

40|$|In this paper, {{a dynamic}} {{continuous}} time model, encompassing operations, investments, output prices, informative advertising, and brand advertising, is formulated as an optimal control problem {{in an activity}} analysis context. In the model, {{the objective of the}} firm is to maximise, subject to various constraints, the discounted value of accumulated savings over the finite decision-making interval plus the discounted value of capacity {{at the end of the}} interval. The state variables are capacity, goodwill of type 1 reflecting informative <b>advertising,</b> <b>goodwill</b> of type 2 reflecting brand advertising, net debt, and the output price. The controls are the scale of operation, the purchase of new capacity, informative advertising, brand advertising, and the rate of change of the output price. Final capacity, goodwill of types 1 and 2, net debt, and price are control parameters. There are several inequality constraints. Using results in control theory, the optimal controls are completely characterized. These results are interpreted using the properties of the Value Equation. In addition, the control problem is transformed into an approximate programming problem. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper formulates a {{model for}} {{determining}} the optimal allocation of a given advertising budget over M interacting market segments and a time domain of T periods. Guidance for budget size optimization is provided via a shadow price. The basic input parameters are in terms of sales saturation levels and advertising elasticities, concepts experienced advertising executives understand {{and are willing to}} estimate. Economic and political developments in Western Europe are increasing the interactions among geographically defined segments, and recent development in discrimination techniques may soon make market segmentation a practical strategy for the United States market. In relation to the time domain, the simplistic and often unrealistic constraint of a constant carryover effect is relaxed in that current advertising is hypothesized to generate sales both by creating new customers and by interacting with the residual effects of past <b>advertising</b> (<b>goodwill)</b> thus reinforcing preferences of past customers. This interactive formulation relating past and future expenditures allows a model user greater flexibility in specifying the relationship between advertising and sales. The mathematical programming technique used is a form of convex programming. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper determines {{an optimal}} policy for {{investment}} in advertising for {{a firm that}} wishes to maximize its discounted profits. To that end, an integrated approach consisting of model formulation, empirical investigation, and optimization is carried out. A model of market share response to advertising is formulated as a first-order Markov process, with nonstationary transition probabilities. These probabilities {{are assumed to be}} a function of the <b>advertising</b> <b>goodwill</b> accumulated by the firm and its competitors. The model as specified is nonlinear in its parameters, and nonlinear regression techniques are applied to estimate them. It is shown that this nonlinear form offers, via likelihood ratio tests, a unique opportunity for testing the model, and in a resulting empirical test, the model is found to be consistent with the data. Given these empirical findings, an optimal advertising policy is derived by the use of optimal control theory. The managerial implications of the recommended multi-period policy are examined, and the policy's sensitivity to managerial inputs and economic conditions is analyzed and illustrated. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} on past choices of present opportunities, costs, and benefits is pervasive in industrial markets. Each {{of the three}} chapters of this thesis considers a different example of such dependence affecting dynamic behaviour. In the first chapter a single firm's present choices depend on what it has learnt from past experience. The firm is searching for the best outcome of many multi-stage projects and learns as stages are completed. The branching structure of the search environment is such that the payoffs to various actions are correlated; nevertheless, it is shown that the optimal strategy is given by a simple reservation price rule. The chapter provides a simple model of R&D as an example. In the central model of the second chapter firms slowly build up stocks of <b>goodwill</b> through <b>advertising.</b> While many firms start to advertise in a new market, over time a successful set emerges and the others exit. The chapter explores the relative growth of firms and {{the determination of the}} number of successful ones. The chapter compares the results to those of a model in which a firm must complete all of a given number of R&D stages before being able to produce. The final chapter considers one of the effects of urban bus deregulation in the UK: bus arrival times are changed very frequently. It is assumed that passengers do not know the timetable and once at a stop board the first bus to arrive. There can be no equilibrium in which an operator's bus arrival times are never revised: otherwise those of a rival would arrive just before and take all the waiting passengers. The chapter considers the pattern of revisions when they are costly. The chapter also shows that fares can be higher with two competing operators than with a single monopolist...|$|R
60|$|The {{newspaper}} disseminates ideas. So, too, {{does the}} book and the pamphlet, and so far as these latter are concerned, their distribution does not at present rest in the same degree upon their value as vehicles of advertisement. They are saleable things unaided. The average book of to-day at its nominal price of six shillings pays in itself and supports its producers. So in a lesser degree does the sixpenny pamphlet, but neither book nor pamphlet reach so wide a public as the halfpenny and penny press. The methods and media of the book trade have grown up, no man designing them; they change, and no one is able to foretell the effect of their changes. At present there is a great movement to cheapen new books, and it would seem the cheapening is partly to be made up for in enhanced sales and partly by an increased use of new books for advertisement. Many people consider this cheapening of new books as being detrimental to the interests of all but the most vulgarly popular authors. They believe it will increase the difficulty of new writers, and hopelessly impoverish just the finest element in our literary life, those original and exceptional minds who demand educated appreciation and do not appeal to the man in the street.

This study investigates the effect of advertising on sales, including providing unique contributions by quantifying threshold and ceiling levels of advertising effectiveness and providing an understanding of what affects those levels. Specifically, the study considers the effects of familiarity, market share and clutter on advertising effectiveness, and on those thresholds and ceilings, and quantifies the relative importance of each of these factors by combining them into a single model. The determinants of <b>advertising</b> <b>goodwill</b> decay are also considered. The study uses two methodologies: Data Envelopment Analysis and nonlinear regression, on a longitudinal (eight-year) data set of over 6, 000 observations. Findings confirm the existence of ceiling and threshold effects whilst demonstrating the impact of clutter and familiarity. The share-of-voice / share-of-market relationship is re-examined in this context. The findings further demonstrate that the ceilings and thresholds are dependent on the level of clutter and familiarity. These findings extend the existing literature by providing evidence from the field (as opposed to previous laboratory-only studies), and by including several new variables (the Herfindahl Index, a measure of advertising concentration, and the difference between Share-of-Voice and market share) together with variables of clutter, familiarity and lag effects, simultaneously, in a single estimator function...|$|R
40|$|A Public Disclosure Program (PDP) is {{compared}} to a traditional environmental regulation (exemplified by a tax/subsidy) in a simple dynamic framework. A PDP aims at revealing the environmental record of firms to the public. This information affects its image (goodwill or brand equity), and ultimately its profit. In our model, this impact is endogenous, i. e., a firm polluting less than its prescribed target would win consumer's sympathy and raises its goodwill, whereas it is {{the other way around}} when the firm exceeds its emissions quota. The evolution of this goodwill is assumed to depend also on green activities or advertising expenditures. Within this framework, we analyse how a PDP affects the firm's optimal policies regarding emissions, pricing and advertising as compared to a traditional regulation. We show that advertising acts as a complementary device to pricing and that emissions are increasing in goodwill. We also conclude that the effects of a PDP are more pronounced than those of traditional instruments for firms with a high goodwill. Moreover, we study under which conditions a PDP may be profit improving and we connect this issue to the possibility that a PDP can induce firms to overcomply with the standard. The numerical value of the emission target is rather innocuous in a market-based setting but it turns to be a crucial variable {{in the presence of a}} PDP. The theoretical results are complemented with a numerical illustration.

The role of a standard or target level for emissions turns out to be totally different under both policy regimes. In the case of a tax/subsidy approach, this target level only acts as constant who increases or decreases profit by a fixed amount, but it does not affect the policy of the firm. On the contrary, if a PDP is implemented, the target value for emissions enters in an important way in the goodwill accumulation mechanism and determines how the firm reacts to the regulation and what is the time path for the economic and environmental variables. Moreover, this value is also crucial to determine the possibility that a PDP is profit improving. A policy implication of this fact is that regulators should be particularly careful in fixing the emission standard when a PDP is applied.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on topics in empirical industrial organization. The first essay proposes and estimates a fully dynamic model of generic and brand advertising in a differentiated product oligopoly. It first specifies a nested logit demand system incorporating brand and generic <b>advertising</b> <b>goodwill</b> stocks. Demand side parameters are then used to calibrate a dynamic game of brand and generic advertising {{that takes into account}} the vertical relationship between manufacturers and retailers. Estimates from the fluid milk product category indicate that brand advertising is effective for increasing brand level demand and generic advertising has a differential effect on individual brands. On the supply side, we found that it is optimal for brand manufacturers not to advertise in the presence of generic advertising. ^ The second essay proposes a semiparametric Bayesian framework for the analysis of discrete choice models that can be applied to both individual and aggregated data. Instead of assuming a parametric model for the distribution of consumer sensitivity to product characteristics as is typically the case in both Bayesian and classical models, the distribution of consumers 2 ̆ 7 heterogeneity is modeled using a Dirichlet process prior which varies with consumer demographic characteristics. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for fitting the model, and the methodology is illustrated using a panel dataset of peanut butter purchases. ^ The third essay adapts the model developed in Essay 2 to a structural random coefficients discrete choice model with learning, state dependence, and long lasting advertising effects. It applies the model to analyze demand for ready-to-eat breakfast cereal in selected U. S. cities. The model parameter estimates are then used to investigate brand-level dynamic advertising competition. Results indicate that consumers have negative priors about new cereal brands but after experiencing with the new products, they found these to have better quality than the established brands. The estimated distribution of individual-specific parameters uncovers some of the limitations of the commonly used parametric models of consumer heterogeneity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the threshold effect of the U. S. generic fluid milk and cheese advertising programs. A threshold delineates the level of advertising intensity that has to be met to generate a specific level of sales effect. Given that promotional organizations face budget constraints, it is of particular interest to ascertain if there exists a minimum threshold that an advertising campaign has to overcome to yield a non-trivial sales effect. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study focusing on the threshold effects of generic advertising of agricultural products. The estimation results confirm that, for both fluid milk and cheese advertisings, there exist three thresholds which partition the quarterly observations between 1975 and 2004 into four possible regimes depending on the level of advertising intensity in each period. The generic fluid milk <b>advertising</b> <b>goodwill</b> coefficient is found to be relatively small for the regime with the lowest advertising intensity, building up to a higher level as the regime progresses, but eventually drops to lower levels as the intensity continues to grow, reflecting the eventual arrival of the diminishing returns of advertising. The pattern of initial build up, however, is not detected in the cheese equation in which the estimated goodwill parameter starts at a rather large magnitude in the first regime, but declines monotonically and drastically in the second and third regimes, only to become statistically not different from zero in the fourth regime. To evaluate the performance of the National Dairy Board (NDB) programs over time, the estimated demand equations are used to simulate the effect on sales of a change in the fluid milk and cheese advertising expenditure paths, focusing on the first ten years and the second ten years of the NDB’s operation since 1984. While an increase in advertising expenditures has the effect of increasing sales (holding regime configuration constant), it is found that this scale effect of additional advertising may be outweighed by the negative effect of a downward shift in the goodwill coefficient arising from regime change. In other words, sales can be made lower as the result of increased advertising, a feature not supported by the conventional model of no threshold. Indeed, in the cheese case advertising elasticity is found to be negative when evaluated at some levels larger than the historical pattern. Compared to the result pertaining to the first ten years, the benefit-cost ratio of the fluid milk program suggests that the NDB has moved its fluid milk operation scale closer to optimal during the second ten years. The optimal fluid milk advertising expenditure level for the second ten years is found to be between 105 and 110 percent of the historical level. This paper will contribute to the discussion among researchers, program managers, and industry participants on the importance of entertaining the threshold effect of advertising when examining program effectiveness and the optimal allocation of program dollars. Researchers need to be aware of the potential pitfalls of their conventional econometric estimates (and, hence, the limitations of their policy suggestions) when the true model is of threshold type. Program managers have argued that advertising effectiveness may vary, depending on the intensity of their campaigns and have long sought this information in their spending allocation decisions. The insights provided in this paper will enhance our understanding of the threshold effect of advertising. Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R
