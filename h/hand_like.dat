5|$|Eris's orbit {{is highly}} eccentric, and brings Eris to within 37.9AU of the Sun, a typical {{perihelion}} for scattered objects. This {{is within the}} orbit of Pluto, but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (29.8–30.4AU). Pluto, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> other plutinos, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by orbital resonance, can cross Neptune's orbit. It is possible that Eris is in a 17:5resonance with Neptune, though further observations {{will be required to}} check that hypothesis. Unlike the eight planets, whose orbits all lie roughly in the same plane as the Earth's, Eris's orbit is highly inclined: It is tilted at an angle of about 44degrees to the ecliptic. In about 800years, Eris will be closer to the Sun than Pluto for some time (see the graph at the right).|$|E
25|$|In 1440, {{the poet}} Kabir was also {{said to have}} been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through the palm of her <b>hand.</b> <b>Like</b> Karna, Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream. This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as {{secretly}} descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority {{in the eyes of the}} Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.|$|E

25|$|On 6 February 1943, Mussolini {{carried out}} the most wide-ranging {{government}} reshuffle in 21 years of Fascist power. Almost all the ministers were changed: the most important heads which fell were those of Galeazzo Ciano (the son-in-law of the duce), Dino Grandi, Giuseppe Bottai, Guido Buffarini Guidi and Alessandro Pavolini. The two most important goals of this operation (placating public opinion and vital segments of the Fascist Party itself) were not achieved, since the situation was too compromised. Among the new appointments, the new Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs (the Duce took over the department himself) Giuseppe Bastianini, a serious Umbrian, {{was well aware of}} the seriousness of the situation. Bastianini's strategy was twofold: on the one <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> Mussolini, he tried to argue in favor of a peace between Germany and the USSR, and on the other he aimed to create a block of Balkan countries (the junior Axis partners Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria) led by Italy, who should act as a counterbalance to the excessive power of the German Reich in Europe. In April the Duce took two other important actions: on 14 April he substituted the chief of the police, Carmine Senise (a man of the King) with Lorenzo Chierici, while five days later he changed the young and inexperienced secretary of the Party, Aldo Vidussoni, with Carlo Scorza. While Senise was accused of inefficiency during the March strikes in northern Italy, with the appointment of Scorza, a hardliner, Mussolini wanted to galvanize the Party.|$|E

500|$|The {{hold that}} the {{darkness}} has over her does not disappear when she escapes and the Tombs are brought {{down in an}} earthquake by the nameless ones. She contemplates killing Ged, blaming him for her pain, but eventually learns to accept her guilt over her actions, realizing that though {{she had no choice}} in her actions as a priestess, she now has a choice to move away from them; but this [...] "freedom is a heavy load". Le Guin ends the novel with the reassuring sentence [...] "Gravely she walked beside [...] up the white streets of Havnor, holding his <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> a child coming home", suggesting that she has been successful in finding new connections in her life. The conclusion of the novel represents the successful end of a quest that Ged undertook as a mature wizard, part of the story arc that traces his character development across the first three Earthsea books; thus The Tombs of Atuan has been described as part of Ged's coming-of-age as well.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, poker night is a Thursday night {{tradition}} among Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), the TGS staff. Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) join {{them for the}} first time. Jack is able to read and defeat all of the other players, except for NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), who wins the final hand. The next day, Jack sets up another poker night. Eventually, Jack and Kenneth come down to the final hand. Jack has more chips and goes all-in. He offers to make the hand winner-take-all if Kenneth bets his page jacket. Kenneth agrees, and Jack's pair of twos beats Kenneth's king high. Liz asks why Kenneth would bet on a <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> that, and he responds that he enjoys living on the edge and was also confused about the rules. Jack stops Kenneth from leaving, explains that he only made Kenneth bet his job to prove his power over him, and returns the jacket to Kenneth with the expectation that he come in early on Monday.|$|E
500|$|Before filming took place, David-Lloyd {{met with}} Caroline Chikezie {{and got to}} know each other to help give their {{respective}} characters their chemistry. The episode was filmed as part of the third production block of the first series, along with eighth episode [...] "They Keep Killing Suzie". Director James Strong wanted to film the episode in a sort of real time format. Filming largely took place at the Upper Boat Studios outside Pontypridd, where the Torchwood Hub set is located. The scene where Jack threatens to kill Ianto if he does not kill Lisa was the first scene to be shot. The flashback scene where Ianto finds a half-converted Lisa in Canary Wharf took a full day to film; it was originally supposed to take only a few hours, but the camera failed to record the scene. It was replaced, but the second camera failed to record also. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman were both trained how to handle guns and a torch like a [...] "secret agent." [...] Strong noted that they both held the gun and torch in each <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> professionals.|$|E

I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|E
2500|$|Linguists have {{identified}} speech patterns found among Vermonters {{as belonging to}} Western New England English, a dialect of New England English, which features of full pronunciation of all r sounds, pronouncing horse and hoarse the same, and pronouncing vowels in father and bother the same, none of which are features traditionally shared in neighboring Eastern New England English. Some rural speakers realize the t as a glottal stop (mitten sounds like [...] "mi'in" [...] and Vermont like [...] "Vermon' [...] "). A dwindling segment of the Vermont population, generally both rural and male—especially in northwestern Vermont, pronounces certain vowels in a distinctive manner (e.g. cows sounds like [...] "cayows," [...] fight like [...] "foight," [...] calf like [...] "caaf," [...] there like [...] "thair," [...] <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> [...] "hay-nd," [...] and back like [...] "bah-k").|$|E

2500|$|In Visser's modification, the Acetone box was {{extended}} {{with a large}} flat board holding 12 printed circuit boards of approximately 4×4 inches, with the copper traces intertwining like forks. The copper traces formed the touch surfaces for the sounds generated by the Acetone box. Each touch pad was sensed by an electronic circuit driving high-speed Siemens computer relays he found in surplus shops. These were connected to the drum and percussion sounds of the rhythm box. [...] Although it was a crude way of playing electronic drum sounds by <b>hand</b> (<b>like</b> a percussionist playing bongos and congas), it worked and added a [...] "human feel". Visser's approach enabled drummers to have new type of virtuosity (e.g., rolls on electronic bass drums could be played with sticks). The unit was used in Frans Peters' studio in radio city Hilversum, Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> {{other members}} of the pioneer {{generation}} of composers who emigrated to Palestine in the 1930s, Tal sought to create a new national style distinct from European (and particularly German) modernism. On the other hand, to distance himself from Ben-Haim's [...] "Mediterranean" [...] school he adopted a distinctly modernist style. Tal's music is not monolithic. Despite its dominant atonality, Tal's music has undergone changes and modifications over the years. These changes reflect what occurred over time in Israeli music. Most of the works which Tal wrote around 1950 are characterized by traditional components and frameworks, written in traditional techniques such as variations, and atonal musical language. In the late 'forties and early 'fifties, when the Mediterranean style was at its peak, Tal was a frequent borrower of Oriental-Jewish source material as the basis for his compositions. If we take Ben-Zion Orgad's definition as the most pertinent it would surely follow that Tal's Piano Sonata, 1st symphony, 2nd Piano Concerto and other works based on Oriental-Jewish melodies are definitely not Mediterranean.|$|E
2500|$|During the Enlightenment, Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style {{method of}} {{thinking}} that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions {{in order to justify}} his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the sensus communis linking them). Cartesians such as Henricus Regius, Geraud de Cordemoy, and Nicolas Malebranche realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the [...] "external world" [...] at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith. Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a [...] "revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense". Descartes and the Cartesian [...] "rationalists", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and inductive reasoning, and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or [...] "a priori" [...] knowledge in the human mind - a controversial proposal.|$|E

2500|$|The Nintendo Switch is {{the seventh}} major video game console {{developed}} by Nintendo. Known in development by its codename NX, it was unveiled in October 2016 {{and was released}} worldwide on March 3, 2017. [...] Nintendo considers the Switch a [...] "hybrid" [...] console; it is designed primarily as a home console, with the main unit inserted onto a docking station to connect to a television. Alternatively, it can {{be removed from the}} dock and used similarly to a tablet computer through its LCD touchscreen, or placed in a standalone tabletop mode visible to several players. The Switch uses Joy-Con wireless controllers, which include standard buttons and a directional joystick for user input, motion sensing, and high-definition tactile feedback. The Joy-Con can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play, connect to a Grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad form, or be used individually in the <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> the Wii Remote, supporting local multiplayer modes. The Switch's software supports online gaming through standard Internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with other Switch consoles. Switch games and software are available on both physical flash ROM cartridges and digital distribution; the system does not use region locking. [...] The Switch competes on the console gaming market with contemporaries Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One.|$|E
