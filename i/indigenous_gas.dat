40|$|The {{fact that}} {{depletion}} of <b>indigenous</b> <b>gas</b> production increases gas import dependency is widely known and accepted. However, {{there is considerable}} less attention for the implications of indigenous resource depletion {{for the provision of}} seasonal flexibility. The traditionally largest source of seasonal flexibility in Europe is <b>indigenous</b> <b>gas</b> production, mainly based in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. With the depletion of indigenous sources the market increasingly needs to rely on other sources for seasonal flexibility, such as gas storage facilities. We investigate the future need for gas storage as a source for seasonal flexibility provision using a dynamic gas market model (GASTALE) in which different potential sources for seasonal flexibility - gas production, imports via pipeline, LNG imports and storage facilities - compete with each other in a market-based environment. The inclusion of seasonal flexibility properties in a gas market model allows a more complex analysis of seasonal flexibility issues than previously documented in literature. This is demonstrated in an analysis of the future demand for gas storage in northwestern Europe until 2030. Our results indicate that there is substantial need for additional gas storage facilities and thus supports current project proposals for new investment in gas storage facilities.

40|$|Introduction The gas {{transmission}} {{network in the}} Netherlands transports two different qualities of gas, low-calorific gas known as G-gas or L-gas and, high calorific gas (H-gas). These two gas qualities are transported in separate networks, and are connected by means of five blending and conversion stations where high-calorific gas can either be blended with low-calorific gas or ballasted with nitrogen to produce gas that can be introduced into the low-calorific, G-gas, network. The network was originally developed following {{the discovery of the}} large Groningen gas field. The Groningen field is low calorific gas. The low-calorific gas from the Groningen field became the standard for the consumers in the Netherlands. Later on, H-gas gas was produced from the so-called small fields in the Netherlands. High-calorific gas is also imported from Norway, Russia and through the LNG terminal in Rotterdam. The H-gas is supplied to industrial end users via approximately 80 connections to the high-calorific network and is also exported to other countries. The standard Wobbe Index bandwidth currently specified for exit points in the gas {{transmission network}} for H-gas is 47 - 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0), with a number of regional variations as described in the Ministerial Ruling (MR) for gas quality. The supply of low-calorific gas from the Groningen field is in decline, and ultimately the future supply to end users will be high-calorific gas. In March 2012, the Minister of Economic affairs declared that all appliances falling under the Gas Appliance Directive (the GAD) should be able to switch to high-calorific gas to prepare for a smooth transition {{at the end of the}} lifetime of the Groningen field. For this purpose, a formal notification has been given to the European Commission. However, at the moment it is unclear what the future range of high-calorific gas quality should be; that is, the range of gas quality that appliances falling under the GAD can accept is at present uncertain. The question posed by the Dutch government is whether or not the government should change the existing notification of the requirements that GAD gas appliances should be able to meet to cope with high-calorific gas, and if so, how and when. Analysis The study comprised three major areas of investigation. In the first step, the limitations in appliance performance with varying gas quality were assessed. This assessment is based on a critical analysis of existing data from laboratory experiments on appliances from well-defined field tests and also from a critical analysis of non-experimental information (theoretical studies and evidence-based experience). In the second step, the future ranges of gas quality expected to be supplied in the Netherlands was inventoried, and the possibilities for, and costs of, treating the gases to limit the range of gas quality was assessed. In the third step, the potential of innovation for widening the range of gases acceptable for appliances was assessed. The recommendations summarized below are based on the synthesis of these three elements. Limitations in appliances We assessed the existing experimental, theoretical and practical/experiential evidence regarding which bands of Wobbe Index maintain the safety and reliability of the population of H-/E-band appliances installed in the field. In our opinion, the distribution practices in the UK, France, Denmark and Belgium give the best reflection of a practical range for Wobbe Index: the years-long practice in these countries shows that H-/E-band appliance performance with distribution limits in the range 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 satisfies the national requirements and/or customs for safety and reliability in these countries. We also note that DNV GL – Report No. 74106553. 01 b – www. dnvgl. com Page 2 these countries have some form of active maintenance regime. Provided adjustable appliances are properly adjusted, the laboratory experiments assessed support a range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3, although these experiments require extra interpretation before being applied to the situation in practice. The theoretical analyses show that the approval regime does not safeguard the intended appliance performance in a number of situations. However, these analyses say nothing about the actual safe and reliable performance of appliances in the field. Therefore, we conclude that a bandwidth of in the range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 can be realized for appliances approved under the GAD. Future supply Ultimately, when Dutch <b>indigenous</b> <b>gas</b> production becomes small, gas is expected to be supplied by pipeline imports from Norway and Russia, and as LNG from the worldwide market. The Netherlands is expected to become a net importer from 2025 onwards. The expectation is further that the imported gas will have a Wobbe Index between 51 and 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0). The upper limit of 55. 7 MJ/m 3 is set by the Dutch government. This gas quality bandwidth is significantly smaller than the current standard bandwidth permitted in the H-network, from 47 to 55. 7 MJ/m 3. The ‘small fields’ contribute predominantly to the lower half of this range. At the moment an annual volume of 25 bcm is produced from the small fields. By 2032 the total capacity including so-called futures is expected to be almost three times lower than the 2014 capacities. These futures are however uncertain. When the futures are not taken into account, the total capacity will be 15 times lower compared to 2014. In 2032 supply from the small fields will then only be 3 % of demand (20 % if the futures fully materialize). Excluding futures, the production volume of the small fields decreases to 1 bcm in 2030. Three cases with different Wobbe Index bandwidths were evaluated: a band of 2 MJ/m 3, significantly narrower than the expected range of import qualities, a wide band of 8 MJ/m 3 and a band coincident with the expected future import band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3. The results show that the narrow band option requires the most gas treatment, particularly nitrogen ballasting, which given the expected import will be required indefinitely. The costs for gas treatment (especially nitrogen ballasting) will thus recur every year. The widest band allows the widest accommodation of both import gases and residual small-field gases. Referring to the appliance limitations analysis above, not all appliances can handle a band of 8 MJ/m 3 without further gas treatment measures. We note that the potential measures that support the intake of ‘off-spec’ gas with a Wobbe Index lower than the minimum Wobbe Index of H-gas imports are expected to be temporary. The volume of gas from the small fields is expected to become very small after 2030 as mentioned above. The use of the gas quality management options described here is seen more as a transition measure and not as permanent. In light of the expected gas supply, the widest band gives therefore only a temporary advantage. For the intermediate band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3, the import gases can be easily accepted, but relatively more small-field gases become ‘off spec’, requiring blending with the H-gas import. The forecast of H-gas imports volumes indicate that sufficient H-gas is available for blending the ‘off spec’ gas in this case. Ballasting with nitrogen will not be required if the upper Wobbe limit is set at 55. 7 MJ/m 3. Concluding, choosing the intermediate band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3 corresponds to the bandwidth of the expected import of future H-gases of 51 - 55. 7 MJ/m 3, and is also within the range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 to which the GAD appliances have been exposed in practice. In this option there are no extra costs for nitrogen ballasting. This range may provide an optimum between appliance performance and expected gas supplies. Innovation An inventory has been made to determine the status of the development of innovative products aimed at extending the fuel flexibility of GAD end-use equipment, e. g. by means of active control systems. The inventory is based on interviews with different stakeholders and collecting existing information available, including progress made in existing innovation programs such as SBIR. It became clear that commercially available (premixed) appliances having active control systems are suited to operate across the entire E-band and for handling abrupt Wobbe fluctuations. We also observed promising developments for (inexpensive) control systems for premixed appliances to extend the fuel flexibility for both new domestic appliances and suitable appliances already installed in the field. Also, a sensor-based hob burner (cooker) is under development to guarantee high performance and capacity while using variable gas quality (L+H band). DNV GL is not aware of any existing developments or innovations to make other type of partially premixed domestic appliances, such as flow-through hot water heaters, suitable for a wide range of gas compositions. To our knowledge, no innovation regarding the development of fuel-adaptive control systems for non-domestic burners is currently being undertaken. However, several control strategies are possible and economically feasible. Recommendation Based on the analysis, DNV GL recommends setting the long term quality bandwidth for H-gas at 51 – 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0). In this choice, the bandwidth (4. 7 MJ/m 3) is within the 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 with which millions of H-/E-band appliances function in other EU countries, aligning the distribution practice with those in other countries, and complex and costly gas quality management measures are limited. A consistent policy for appliance adjustment using known gas quality is essential for maintaining this band. We recommend updating the existing notification and suggest modifications to the notification as formulated in Appendix A. We further note that in terms of Wobbe Index this band allows room for the accommodation of a reasonable bandwidth for renewable gases...|$|E

Using the model several scenarios have been analysed. We found that management of the supply-side policy alone cannot substantially postpone the discovery, production and consumption peak.

Postponing the onset of gas price increases can therefore be achieved more effectively through efforts to reduce demand growth. One might expect that a low taxation policy would encourage more exploration and production of gas and thereby stimulate higher consumption rates. Instead, there was no overall net effect on production and consumption in the long term. The depletion effect on cost of exploration acts as counterbalance to low taxation policy. Depletion effect causes cost and thus price to rise further which depress consumption rate. The advances in exploration and production technology can delay the peak of exploration, production and consumption. Technological improvements mean lower cost of exploration and production which pressure down long-term pattern of price dynamics.

Apart from electricity production, CO 2 capture can {{play an important role in}} the production of transportation fuels and in manufacturing industries. In fact there are less competing emission mitigation options in these sectors, which makes it an even more important strategy. CO 2 capture helps to enhance supply security in regions where <b>indigenous</b> coal and <b>gas</b> can replace imports of oil and gas. 1...|$|R
40|$|Crude oil {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the significant energy sources. Several countries do not have enough <b>indigenous</b> oil and <b>gas</b> resources. These countries resort to overseas business of Exploration and Production (E&P) of oil to secure a stable supply. Profitability, risk and growth guide overseas investment decisions. Selection of overseas investment opportunities are critical for a firm because of uncertainty in identifying and quantifying the attendant geological, commercial, social and political risks as well as return on investment. To secure overseas oil acreage, business entities intend to invest in overseas E&P destination having reasonable petroleum reserve, favorable contract terms (fiscal terms), well-developed infrastructure, sound legal system, minimum country risk (CR) (economic, social and political) and facilitate relative ease to do business in that country. The countries have varied mix of these parameters, and it leads to growing concern to screen and rank overseas investment opportunities. Methodologies to rank global opportunities should take into consideration the risk factors such as petroleum potential, infrastructure, geo-political scenario, contract terms, etc. We coin the term for the numerical rank as Globalization Index (GI), which is a function of the factors considered to affect the decision of a business entity in screening the global destinations for venturing in to E&P business of crude oil. This paper is an attempt to model these factors by invoking Alternating Conditional Expectation methodology to find GI. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} natural gas {{geopolitics}} of Turkey and explores its interaction with the Turkish foreign policy making of the Justice and Development Party (JDP). Whilst Turkey {{does not have enough}} <b>indigenous</b> natural <b>gas</b> reserves to meet the existing and growing demand, the country does have great advantages, as it is located between the major supplier countries in the Middle East and Eurasia and is placed at the crossroads of an energy hungry European natural gas market. Therefore, the major aim of this research is to explore capacity building in the creation of relationships of interdependence between Turkey and supplier and demanding countries. Rather than introducing a dependency energy mechanism, this thesis offers the interaction capacity of the country with natural gas suppliers and consuming countries. In order to explain the relationship between politics and energy variables, the thesis establishes the theoretical framework of the study {{through the use of a}} pluralistic and integrated model, by combining International Relations Theories, the foreign policy making process of Turkey and a conceptualisation of the relations of energy interdependence. The descriptive analysis of Eurasia and the energy profile of Turkey provide detailed information about the existing energy trade and dependency relations in the Eurasian space. Hence, it explains the importance of Turkey in Europe’s diversification of energy corridors and Turkey’s natural gas market, which is considered to be the second biggest market in Europe. The significance and role of Turkey in the construction of pipeline projects (ITGI, TANAP, Nabucco, Nabucco-West and TAP) that go through Turkey to Europe, a route which is called the Southern Corridor, are analysed in the thesis. On the other hand, this thesis offers certain perspectives for the Caspian-Turkey-Europe natural gas corridor, focusing on Azerbaijan-Turkmenistan’s role in {{the natural gas}} trade for the energy security of Europe. Moreover, the natural gas potential of Iran, Iraq (including KRG), Qatar, Egypt and Israel, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan are viewed as major natural gas sources for Turkey and Europe in this thesis. Turkey has historical and economic ties with the Caspian Sea and Middle East regions, which hold immense natural gas reserves that can be marketed to Turkey and to the European Union (EU). Mapping Turkey’s energy relations with consuming and producing countries, and defining Turkey’s geopolitical space, will not only help to develop its energy policy to secure its own energy consumption but also to manage interdependence relations between Eurasia and Europe. This is a new conceptualisation of energy supply and transit management of Turkey in the context of a new model called the Anatolian Gas Centre (AGS). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{predicted}} {{shortage of}} <b>indigenous</b> UK natural <b>gas</b> {{coincides with the}} continuing decline of the UK deep coal mining industry. Significant capacity has been lost through mine closures {{over the last few}} years as a result of competition from cheaper sources of coal from overseas and changes to the UK energy market. It is unlikely that any new large underground mines will be developed in the UK in the short or medium term. There are, however, still vast untouched coal resources in the UK that represent a significant energy resource. Increased awareness of the potential for clean energy from coal seams, advances in technology and recognition of the environmental benefits has seen a revival of interest in the potential to release some of the energy value of UK coal via alternative, non-mining technologies such as coalbed methane production and underground coal gasification. If successful, these could supplement declining conventional UK natural gas production. The utilization of clean energy from coal seams is supported by the UK Government through its Cleaner Fossil Fuels Programme. There is some activity in this field already. Methane is being drained from most of the remaining deep mines and utilized as fuel for electricity generation or on-site boilers. Drained gas that is not utilized is conventionally vented, but at one mine this gas is now flared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Methane is also being produced from abandoned mines, but the present low electricity and gas prices have adversely affected its economics. For the longer-term future, there is potential for virgin coalbed methane production and underground coal gasification. The UK has coalbed methane resources estimated to be in the order of 2. 9 × 1012 m 3 CH 4. However, the limited exploratory drilling for coalbed methane in unmined areas undertaken to date has not led to commercial production – the major barriers are perceived to be low seam permeability, drilling and completion costs, together with planning and access issues. Initial research suggests there is very large potential for underground coal gasification providing the environmental and perceived safety issues surrounding the application of this technology can be overcome. ...|$|R
