In 1941, he derived the exact {{distribution of the}} ratio of the mean square of successive <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin–Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.|$|E
40|$|Many people {{argue that}} history makes a special <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the {{subjects}} of biology and psychology, and that history does not make this special <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> {{other parts of the}} world. This paper will show that historical properties make no more or less of a <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> biology or psychology than to chemistry, physics, or other sciences. Although historical properties indeed make a certain kind of <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> biology and psychology, this paper will show that historical properties make the same kind of <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> geology, sociology, astronomy, and other sciences. Similarly, many people argue that nonhistorical properties make a special <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the nonbiological and the nonpsychological world. This paper will show that nonhistorical properties make the same <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> all things in the world {{when it comes to their}} causal behavior and that historical properties make the same <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> all things in the world when it comes to their distributions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{fact that}} our asking God to do {{something}} can make a <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> what he does underwrites the point of petitionary prayer. Here, however, a puzzle arises: Either doing what we ask is the best God can do or it is not. If it is, then our asking won‟t make any <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> whether he does it. If it is not, then our asking won‟t make any <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> whether he does it. So, our asking won‟t make any <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> whether God does it. Our asking is therefore pointless. In this paper, we try to solve this puzzle without denying either that God must do {{the best he can}} or that petitioning God can make a <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> what he does...|$|R

5|$|Yellowhammer males {{learn their}} songs from their fathers, {{and over the}} course of time {{regional}} dialects have developed, with minor <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas. Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect; females tend to mate with males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires.|$|E
5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> {{previous}} versions. The {{most significant}} modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E
5|$|Events {{under the}} Ski Flying World Cup have several <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> the Ski Flying World Championships. The latter is an {{isolated}} tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as the Ski Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the Ski Flying World Cup is part of the overall Ski Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the Ski Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the Ski Jumping World Cup standings to the Ski Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E

5|$|IRIS {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} cast split between characters of North Korean and South Korean descent. Because the series explores {{the tension and}} mentality behind {{the two sides of}} the conflict, both the North and South perspectives are shown at length. The plot focuses on the cast overcoming the manipulation they face at an international level and occasionally attempting to reconcile their <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> fight an evil greater than either side ever acknowledged, making way for scenarios in which their allegiances are stressed and put to the test.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{paleontologist}} Charles H. Sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton {{from the}} slightly older Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur Gorgosaurus libratus in 1914. Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of Montana. Finding, {{largely due to}} a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material, no significant <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> separate the two taxa, Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of Albertosaurus, which had been named first, and G. libratus was renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus Albertosaurus backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} to find himself in the machine in 2011, only one minute since he entered it, and Olivia waiting by his side; concurrently, in the parallel universe, Walternate attempts to convince Fauxlivia to help stop the machine. Peter recalls the memories from the future, and uses the machine to merge the machine rooms from both universes into one thus creating a bridge. While Olivia and Walter and their doppelgangers stare each other down, Peter convinces the two sides {{to work together to}} try to repair the damage to save both universes, then suddenly disappears. The Olivias and Walters cautiously agree that they need to put aside their <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> save both worlds, apparently unaware of Peter's disappearance. Outside on Liberty Island in the prime universe, the Observers watch as September (Michael Cerveris) notes to December (Eugene Lipinski) that Peter has already been forgotten by his friends, his purpose having been served, and explains that Peter now never existed.|$|E

5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex <b>Differences</b> <b>to</b> further the study of sex differences.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Dearly Stars {{is similar}} to previous games in the series, but with new elements and <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> the minigames. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story, but head director Toshihiko Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge. The story is told {{from the perspective of}} Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter the talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player has access to the three idols' different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line.|$|E
5|$|The {{video games}} provide the {{canonical}} {{story of the}} series. The manga series is adapted by Shiro Amano and the novels are written by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano.

The manga and novel series are both divided up into three series based on each of the three main video games. Each series is further broken up into multiple volumes. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Square's Monthly Shonen Gangan, but has since been released worldwide. The manga was released in the United States by Tokyopop near the end of 2005, but was discontinued in 2008.|$|E

However, most later localizations used the original title. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{connected}} {{the notion of}} karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. Just like {{in the case of}} karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, {{as in the case of}} someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.|$|E
