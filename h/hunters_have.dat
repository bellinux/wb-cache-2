5|$|Treasure <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> {{sought out}} the Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 {{artifacts}} bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site {{found their way to}} Beirutine antiquities markets where they stirred the interest of the Ottoman authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs.|$|E
5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E

5|$|The first {{identification}} of Plymouth Rock as the actual landing site was in 1741 by 90-year-old Thomas Faunce, whose father {{had arrived in}} Plymouth in 1623, {{three years after the}} supposed event. The rock was later covered by a solid-fill pier. In 1774, an attempt was made to excavate the rock, but it broke in two. The severed piece was placed in the Town Square at the center of Plymouth. In 1880, the intact half of the rock was excavated from the pier, and the broken piece was reattached to it. Over the years, souvenir <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> removed chunks from the rock, but the remains are now protected as part of the complex of living museums. These include the Mayflower II, a recreation of the original ship; Plimoth Plantation, a historical recreation of the original 1620 settlement; and the Wampanoag Homesite, which recreates a 17th-century Indian village.|$|E
25|$|Road {{construction}} from {{logging and}} mining operations decreases the distance <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> {{to walk to}} reach a given section of the forest to hunt, making what was previously a multi-day trip possible to complete within a day. Additionally {{it has been shown}} that as logging increases, wages and demand for bushmeat increases as well; this leads to the increased export of bushmeat from the forest.|$|E

However Fantome played no part in the Washington raid and most historians feel the convoy was carrying goods and customs revenue from Castine. The site of Fantome's loss is marked today by an inscription on a large granite boulder near the wreck site at Prospect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hunters</b> <b>have</b> meticulous turnout {{and tend}} toward very quiet, {{conservative}} horse tack and rider attire. Hunter bits, bridles, crops, spurs, and martingales are tightly regulated. Jumpers, while {{caring for their}} horses and grooming them well, are not scored on turnout, are allowed {{a wider range of}} equipment, and may wear less conservative attire, so long as it stays within the rules. Formal turnout always is preferred; a neat rider gives a good impression at shows.|$|E
25|$|Hunters widely {{sharing the}} meat {{has been seen}} as a costly signal of ability and {{research}} has found that good <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations {{has been seen as}} ways of demonstrating one's resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the ages, farmers, {{archaeologists and}} amateur {{treasure}} <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> unearthed important treasures of immense historical, scientific and financial value. However, the strictness {{of the common}} law rules meant that such items were sometimes not treasure trove. The items risked being sold abroad, or were only saved for the nation by being purchased at a high price. Mention has already {{been made of the}} objects comprising the Sutton Hoo ship burial, which were not treasure trove as they had been interred without any intention to retrieve them. The objects were later presented to the nation by their owner, Edith May Pretty, in a 1942 bequest. In March 1973, a hoard of about 7,811 Roman coins was found buried in a field at Coleby in Lincolnshire. It was made up of antoniniani believed to have been minted between 253 and 281A.D. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held in the 1981 case of Attorney-General of the Duchy of Lancaster v. G.E. Overton (Farms) Ltd. that the hoard was not treasure trove as the coins did not have a substantial silver content. Thus, it belonged to the owner of the field and could not be retained by the British Museum.|$|E
25|$|The Lebanese Air Forces have a {{long history}} {{operating}} Hawker Hunter jets since 1958. A Lebanese Hawker Hunter shot down an Israeli jet over Kfirmishki in the early 1960s and its pilot was captured by the Lebanese Armed Forces. One Lebanese Hawker Hunter was shot down {{on the first day of}} the Six-Day War by an Israeli Air Force Mirage IIICJ. The Hawker <b>Hunters</b> <b>have</b> not flown any combat sorties since September 17, 1983. This was at a time when the French and Americans were rebuilding the Lebanese Army. Three F.Mk.70s were made airworthy, and resumed combat operations on September 15. Because the main airfield, Rayak Air Base, had been shelled by Syrian forces, the Hunters had to operate from an airfield in Byblos. The Hunters were finally grounded in 1994 after a minor accident with one of the T.66 trainers during landing and the remaining 8 were stored in Rayak. The last loss took place in 1989 near Batroun during routine training, when the undercarriage failed to lower, causing the jet to crash. The pilot ejected safely from the doomed aircraft and landed in the Mediterranean sea, where he was promptly rescued by the Syrian Army, which then handed him over to Suleiman Frangieh, who in turn handed him over to the Lebanese Army at the al-Madfoun crossing.|$|E
500|$|C.crispus is philopatric and territorial, {{and marks}} trees with sweet-sour-smelling preorbital gland {{secretions}} to indicate its territory.

500|$|Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, from New London, Wisconsin, set up Wolf River Kennels {{in order}} to save the breed. Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs. He advertised the dogs widely across the country, selling male dogs for $25 and females dogs for $20. Part of a sales pitch that Pfeifer mailed to {{prospective}} dog owners read, [...] "The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production. <b>Hunters</b> <b>have</b> known this type for years and it was through their efforts that this dog was propagated.... For years we have bred only selective stock, breeding for gameness, stability, courage, intelligence, and beauty. They are dogs to admire and trust under all conditions whether in the home circle or in the field with the outdoor man." ...|$|E
500|$|Current whaling {{nations are}} Norway, Iceland, and Japan, despite their joining to the IWC, {{as well as}} the {{aboriginal}} communities of Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada. Subsistence hunters typically use whale products for themselves and depend on them for survival. National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of hunting are seen as less destructive and wasteful. This distinction is being questioned as these aboriginal groups are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with, and are selling whale products in the marketplace. Some anthropologists argue that the term [...] "subsistence" [...] should also apply to these cash-based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption. In 1946, the IWC placed a moratorium, limiting the annual whale catch. Since then, yearly profits for these [...] "subsistence" [...] <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> been close to US$31 million (UK£20m) per year.|$|E
500|$|Despite his infamy, Teach was not {{the most}} {{successful}} of pirates. Henry Every retired a rich man, and Bartholomew Roberts took an estimated five times the amount Teach stole. [...] Treasure <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumoured hoard of gold and silver, but nothing found in the numerous sites explored along {{the east coast of}} the US has ever been connected to him. [...] Some tales suggest that pirates often killed a prisoner on the spot where they buried their loot, and Teach is no exception in these stories, but that no finds have come to light is not exceptional; buried pirate treasure is often considered a modern myth for which almost no supporting evidence exists. [...] The available records include nothing to suggest that the burial of treasure was a common practice, except in the imaginations of the writers of fictional accounts such as Treasure Island. [...] Such hoards would necessitate a wealthy owner, and their supposed existence ignores the command structure of a pirate vessel, in which the crew served for a share of the profit. [...] The only pirate ever known to bury treasure was William Kidd; the only treasure so far recovered from Teach's exploits is that taken from the wreckage of what is presumed to be the Queen Anne's Revenge, which was found in 1996. [...] As of 2009 more than 250,000 artefacts had been recovered. [...] A selection is on public display at the North Carolina Maritime Museum.|$|E

500|$|... : Samus, {{along with}} bounty hunters Rundas, Ghor, and Gandrayda, are brought {{together}} in a ship over Norion to discuss a Space Pirate infection sweeping the Galactic Federation supercomputer network, one composed of organic Aurora Unit systems. Having this network shut down allows for the Pirates to engage in large scale combat {{in an attempt to}} further spread Phazon. As a battle erupts on Norion's surface, enormous Phazon-based seedships, called Leviathans, also begin to rain from the sky onto planets in order to begin corrupting them with Phazon. After a skirmish with Dark Samus which left her asleep for a month, Samus is charged with destroying these [...] "Phazon Seeds" [...] and restoring functionality to the Federation's computer network, as the other three <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> mysteriously cut all contact during their missions. Samus is told that after the battle on Norion, her body gained the capability to self-generating non-hazardous Phazon, allowing for her to enter a [...] "Hypermode" [...] attack frenzy with her suit's PED (Phazon Enhancement Device). After purging three planets of Phazon (including a Space Pirate homeworld), the Federation locates the source of Phazon - planet Phaaze - which is made entirely of Phazon. As the Federation engages the Space Pirates in orbit, Samus enters the depths of the planet and succeeds in destroying Dark Samus and Phaaze, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert and cleansing her body from its corruption. A ship is seen following her into Warp Space at the end. It is the third game of the Metroid Prime series, and was released for the Wii console.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> used a steel [...] "yankee style" [...] head, {{but they have}} {{retained}} the yew wood shaft because of its flexibility, water resistance, and strength. Held fast to the whale, the harpoon shaft comes loose, to be recovered later, and a line is thrown from the canoe with seal skin floats attached, to provide drag to weaken the whale. In the past, a series of smaller lances were used to repeatedly strike the whale, gradually weakening and killing it, often {{over a period of}} hours, and in some cases, days. Recently, <b>hunters</b> <b>have</b> adopted use of a big game rifle after the harpoon strike, to ensure a more efficient kill. The International Whaling Commission permits four cartridges in whaling: [...]458 Winchester Magnum, [...]460 Weatherby Magnum, [...]50 BMG, and the [...]577 Tyrannosaur, which the Makah fired in the 1999 hunt.|$|E
