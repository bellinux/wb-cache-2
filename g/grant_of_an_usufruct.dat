50|$|In Ex Parte McDonald, an {{important}} {{case in the}} South African law of succession, the testator bequeathed his entire estate to a trust subject to the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>usufruct</b> in favour <b>of</b> his wife, so long as she remained unmarried, in which she received the full use and enjoyment of the income of his estate. Her life interest was subject to the condition that she should provide for, maintain and educate the children during their respective minorities.|$|R
50|$|The {{rights of}} the other person {{concerned}} in each case in these dispositions, the residuary owner and the fideicommissary respectively, naturally differ very considerably. In the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>usufruct,</b> the owner <b>of</b> the property has a vested right, although the owner’s enjoyment is postponed, whereas the right <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fideicommissary is not vested, but rather contingent upon fulfilment of the fideicommissary condition.|$|R
5000|$|Usufruct {{comes from}} civil law, under {{which it is}} a {{subordinate}} real right (ius in re aliena) of limited duration, usually for a person's lifetime. The holder <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>usufruct,</b> known as <b>a</b> usufructuary, {{has the right to}} use (usus) the property and enjoy its fruits (fructus). In modern terms, fructus more or less corresponds to the profit one may make, as when selling the [...] "fruits" [...] (in both literal and figurative senses) of the land or leasing a house.|$|R
50|$|In Durban v Woodhaven, {{the court}} {{questioned}} the fine distinction drawn between the usufruct {{itself and the}} right of enjoyment comprised by the usufructuary interest. This decision implies that the nature and purpose <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular personal servitude should determine whether the rights under the servitude are alienable. The usufructuary's rights include possession, administration, use and enjoyment of the property, as well as its natural and civil fruits. Consumable property cannot be the object <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>usufruct,</b> since the usufructuary must be able to give the property back to the owner salva rei substantia (or substantially intact) {{at the end of the}} usufructuary period. The usufructuary must use the property reasonably: that is, for the purpose for which it was intended. The owner of the property retains all the rights of ownership, subject to the usufruct, and may therefore alienate or mortgage the property, subject to the usufruct.|$|R
50|$|The {{value of}} {{furniture}} and household items is calculated using a standard formula {{based on the}} appraised value of the estate's liquid and non-liquid assets, then the usufruct's value to the surviving spouse is subtracted, and finally the remaining balance is divided among the children {{on the death of}} the surviving spouse. This simplifies handling household items since the surviving spouse is free to maintain, replace or dispose of them as he/she wishes during his/her lifetime, with the monetary value of the items going to the children. Title to assets does not pass, and the usufruct disappears on death or at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> term <b>of</b> years. <b>A</b> <b>usufruct</b> is distinct from a trust or similar settlement. French law breaks with Roman law by construing <b>a</b> <b>usufruct</b> as not <b>a</b> servitude but rather a possessory interest.|$|R
50|$|Opposition is {{a process}} {{provided}} by some patent law systems in which a third party can oppose the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patent {{in an attempt to}} prevent (or revoke) the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patent. In the European Patent Office, for example, any person may file opposition to the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European patent within nine months from grant.In Israel, a third party may oppose an allowed application for three months after publication of the allowed application.|$|R

5|$|The senior {{registrant}} {{in such a}} proceeding has ample {{incentive to}} oppose the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concurrent use registration, because a registered trademark is presumed to apply throughout the entire United States.
