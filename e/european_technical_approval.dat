Key element to this, are the Harmonized Product Standard and the <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Approval.</b> Harmonized standards are established by the European standardizations bodies CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and Cenelec (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) with the involvement of stakeholders. Where a manufacturer would like to declare the characteristics for a construction product not yet covered by a harmonized product standard, he may use the procedure to establish a European technical assessment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{need for}} {{protection}} against rockfall {{has led to}} the development of different types of technological solu-tions that are able to both prevent blocks from detaching from rock walls and to control, intercept or deviate the blocks dur-ing movement. Of the many devices that are able to inter-cept and stop a block, one of the most frequently used is net fence. Many different types of full-scale tests have been car-ried out, with different test site geometries and procedures to study their behaviour and to certify these devices. This has led to a series of data and information that are not easy to compare. The recent endorsement, by the European Or-ganization for Technical Approvals (EOTA), of a <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Approval</b> Guideline (ETAG), which defines how to test and assess the performance of a net fence, is there-fore a great innovation that will change both the market and the design procedures of these devices. The most important innovations introduced by this new guideline are here pre-sented and discussed and a net fence design procedure for protection against rockfall is provided. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to see if on-site portable pull-out tests in South Africa on post-installed chemical and mechanical fixings can produce similar results to internationally laboratory tested fixings. The method used in the field study was to use typical South African 25 MPa, 75 mm slump ready mix concrete as supplied by a reputable supplier and to test several types of fixings in common situations, some covered in the <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Approval</b> Guidelines (ETAG) and some not. The results were analyzed against published international values and theoretical calculations for the fixings. The findings showed that the results produced using the portable equipment can show values similar to the published and theoretical values. It was also shown that this methodology {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool to reveal installation errors. The pull-out test operator needs to be skilled to ensure a satisfactory outcome of the tests. The implications of the findings have direct bearing on: The on-site pullout testing of post installed anchors in South Africa; The diagnosing of bad anchor installation. And secondarily bearing on: The education of post-installed fixing installers and designers; The lack of standards for post-installed anchors in South Africa; The transportability of data from international research to South African conditions...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} 30 years, {{on all the}} French {{territory}} and more specifically in the Alps area, net-fences {{have been set up}} to protect roads, railroads or houses against rock falls. If these works often fulfil correctly their functions, various levels of disorder are observed after rock impacts. Raised pathologies prove to have several different kinds of origin that can act in independent or combined ways. The disorders strictly link to the impact of the blocks (functional request), and with a satisfying operation of the work, will be often proportional to the energy level of the blocks impacting the fence. The pathology level will be related to the adequacy between the risk level and the parade. Maintenance or repairs to be realized on the protection will require a precise diagnosis. Some other disorders, which we can be consider as non-normal, result from an environmental impact which can affect the geometry or the structure of the protection as well as its constitutive materials. In other rather frequent cases, the quality of the implementation on site, and the assembly of the different components, can be responsible. In all these cases, the role of prevention and control become dominating. All the observations, carried out by the CETE of Lyon* during several decades and in agreement with the project of <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Approval</b> for these works, have resulted in setting up particular rules and procedures to ensure the durability of the protections...|$|E

40|$|Factory-made {{aggregates}} {{of cellular}} glass with a typical lump size of 10 to 75 mm represent {{a new type}} of thermal insulation with drainage properties being applied in Switzerland, Germany, and other European countries. Cellular glass aggregates are used as insulating filling material at the perimeter of buildings as well as under load-bearing foundations. They can serve as insulation drainage layers of garden roofs. The insulation material is manufactured from recycled glass and mineral additives in a thermal process. The aggregates form when slabs of cellular glass crack while cooling down. In order to obtain the required hygrothermal properties, the manufacturing process must be carefully controlled. Despite its low density of approximately 120 to 250 kg/m³, cellular glass aggregate has a high pressure resistance, absorbs hardly any water, and is fireproof. The expected service life is at least 50 years. Since its first appearance on the market, this insulation material has been thoroughly tested and the effect of water clinging to the aggregate has been investigated in the laboratory. To confirm the assumptions, the average moisture content and the thermal conductivity of the material in service was also determined by material sampling on existing buildings. This paper gives an overview of the different tests that must be performed in order to obtain a German and <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Approval.</b> It summarizes the aggregate properties of different manufacturers and reports the practical experience gained by in-situ investigations...|$|E

From the design point of view, ETICS are differentiated according to the methods of fixing: bonded ETICS, bonded ETICS with supplementary mechanical fixings, mechanically fixed ETICS with supplementary adhesive, purely mechanically fixed ETICS. There are also different types of substrates (masonry walls [made from units of clay, concrete, calcium silicate, autoclaved aerated concrete or stone]; in situ or prefabricated concrete walls; wood structures. ETICS components are many and can {{be very different from}} one system to one other: basically are adhesive (dry mortar, powder requiring addition of extra binder, paste requiring addition of cement, ready-to-use paste), with more of less organic resin; insulation product (basically EPS, mineral wool, and wood wool, but also cork, XPS, PU); rendering system, made by reinforcement (glass fiber, or plastic mesh - standard or reinforced -, or metal lath, or dispersed fibers embedded or dispersed in render coating, formed by base coat, key coat; finishing coat and decorative/protective coat; mechanical fixing devices and ancillary materials and components, as window’s sills, corners, joint-covers, sealants, mastics and so on. Due to the complexity of the structure and number of performance required, in the case of emerging pathologies the checking for causes is very difficult. The paper shows a method for doing this, based on: the study of the influence of local conditions; the respected or not, from every layer and from the relationship between the layers, of the performances fixed by ETAG 004 and by other Specialized Body, as Groupe Spécialisé n° 7 of C.

During the first semester 2007 the Spanish economy has had a positive evolution but some slowdown during the second semester seems to concern all the agents for the near future.

All the certificates issued by IETcc (DIT and DIT plus) included those based on Confirmation Procedure of UEAtc must contain the necessary information to justify the fulfilment of the CTE. This justification must be managed considering each basic (essential) requirement. The number of applications for DIT plus (application document) is growing year by year. The number of certificates DIT plus issued in 2007 (24) as well as {{the number of}} applications underway (30) confirms the interest and confidence of the Spanish manufacturers on this procedure.
