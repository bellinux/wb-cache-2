40|$|The product, convolution, correlation, Wigner {{distribution}} function (WDF) and ambiguity function (AF) of two <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> of arbitrary order n and m are derived and {{expressed as a}} bounded, weighted sum of n+m <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions.</b> It was already known that these mathematical operations performed on Gaussians (<b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> of the zeroth-order) lead to a result which can be expressed as a Gaussian function again. We generalize this reciprocity to <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> of arbitrary order. The product, convolution, correlation, WDF, and AF operations performed on two <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> of arbitrary order lead to remarkably similar closed-form expressions, where {{the difference between the}} operations is primarily determined by distinct phase changes of the weights of the <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> in the result. The closed-form expressions are generalized to the class of square-integrable functions. A key insight from the closed-form expressions is applied to the design of orthogonal, time-frequency localized communication signals which are characterized by an AF with rotational symmetry. In addition to this application, the theoretical expressions may prove useful for signal analysis in fields ranging from communications, radar and image processing to quantum mechanics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An image {{watermarking}} {{scheme that}} combines <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> expansion and space/spatial-frequency analysis is proposed. In the first step, the <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> expansion is employed to select busy regions for watermark embedding. In the second step, the space/spatial-frequency representation and <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> expansion are combined {{to design the}} imperceptible watermark, using the host local frequency content. The Hermite expansion {{has been done by}} using the fast Hermite projection method. Recursive realization of <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> significantly speeds up the algorithms for regions selection and watermark design. The watermark detection is performed within the space/spatial-frequency domain. The detection performance is increased due to the high information redundancy in that domain in comparison with the space or frequency domains, respectively. The performance of the proposed procedure has been tested experimentally for different watermark strengths i. e. for different values of the Peak Signal to Image Watermarking based on the space/spatial-frequency analysis and <b>Hermite</b> <b>functions</b> expansion * 1 Srdjan Stanković, 1 Irena Orović, 2 Marie Chabert, 3 Bijan Mobasseri 2 Noise Ratio (PSNR). The proposed approach provides high detection performance even for high PSNR values. It offers a good compromise between detection performance (including the robustness {{to a wide variety of}} common attacks) and imperceptibility.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a stellar coronagraph {{that uses a}} coronagraphic mask described by a <b>Hermite</b> <b>function</b> {{or a combination of}} them. It allows the detection of exoplanets providing both deep starlight extinction and high angular resolution. This angular resolution depends on the order of the <b>Hermite</b> <b>function</b> used. An analysis of the coronagraph performance is carried out for different even order masks. Numerical simulations of the ideal case, with no phase errors and perfect telescope pointing, show that on-axis starlight is reduced to very low intensity levels corresponding to a gain of at least 25 magnitudes (10 − 10 light intensity reduction). The coronagraphic throughput depends on the <b>Hermite</b> <b>function</b> or combination selected. The proposed mask series presents the same advantages of band limited masks along with the benefit of reducing the light diffracted by the mask border thanks to its particular shape. Nevertheless, for direct detection of Earth-like exoplanets it requires the use of adaptive optics facilities for compensating the perturbations introduced by the atmosphere and by the optical system...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for over 70 years that there is an {{asymptotic}} transition of Charlier polynomials to Hermite polynomials. This transition, which is still presented in its classical form in modern reference works, is valid if and only if a certain parameter is integer. In this light, it is surprising that a much more powerful transition exists from Charlier polynomials to the <b>Hermite</b> <b>function,</b> valid for any real value of the parameter. This greatly strengthens the asymptotic connections between Charlier polynomials and special functions, with applications for instance in queueing theory. It is shown in this paper that the convergence is uniform in bounded intervals, and a sharp rate bound is proved. It is also shown that there is a transition of derivatives of Charlier polynomials to the derivative of the <b>Hermite</b> <b>function,</b> again with a sharp rate bound. Finally, it is proved that zeros of Charlier polynomials converge to zeros of the <b>Hermite</b> <b>function.</b> While rigorous, the proofs use only elementary techniques.
