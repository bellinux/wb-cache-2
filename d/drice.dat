40|$|Cysteine proteases of the ICE/CED- 3 family (caspases) are {{required}} for the execution of programmed cell death (PCD) {{in a wide range}} of multicellular organisms. Caspases are implicated in the execution of apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster by the observation that expression of baculovirus p 35, a caspase inhibitor, blocks cell death in vivo in Drosophila. We report here the identification and characterization of <b>drICE,</b> a D. melanogaster caspase. We show that overexpression of <b>drICE</b> sensitizes Drosophila cells to apoptotic stimuli and that expression of an N-terminally truncated form of <b>drICE</b> rapidly induces apoptosis in Drosophila cells. Induction of apoptosis by rpr overexpression or by cycloheximide or etoposide treatment of Drosophila cells results in proteolytic processing of <b>drICE.</b> We further show that <b>drICE</b> is a cysteine protease that cleaves baculovirus p 35 and Drosophila lamin DmO in vitro and that <b>drICE</b> is expressed at all the stages of Drosophila development at which PCD can be induced. Taken together, these results strongly argue that <b>drICE</b> is an apoptotic caspase that acts downstream of rpr. <b>drICE</b> is therefore the first unequivocal link between the molecular machinery of Drosophila cell death and the conserved machinery of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrates. Identification of <b>drICE</b> should facilitate the elucidation of upstream regulators and downstream targets of caspases by genetic screening...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{developing}} Drosophila optic lobe, cell death occurs via apoptosis {{and in a}} distinctive spatio-temporal pattern of dying cell clusters. We analyzed the role of effector caspases <b>drICE</b> and dcp- 1 in optic lobe cell death and subsequent corpse clearance using mutants. Neurons in many clusters required either <b>drICE</b> or dcp- 1 and each one is sufficient. This suggests that <b>drICE</b> and dcp- 1 function in cell death redundantly. However, dying neurons in a few clusters strictly required <b>drICE</b> but not dcp- 1, but required <b>drICE</b> and dcp- 1 when <b>drICE</b> activity was reduced via hypomorphic mutation. In addition, analysis of the mutants suggests an important role of effecter caspases in corpse clearance. In both null and hypomorphic <b>drICE</b> mutants, greater number of TUNEL-positive cells were observed than in wild type, and many TUNEL-positive cells remained until later stages. Lysotracker staining showed {{that there was a}} defect in corpse clearance in these mutants. All the results suggested that <b>drICE</b> {{plays an important role in}} activating corpse clearance in dying cells, and that an additional function of effector caspases is required for the activation of corpse clearance as well as that for carrying out cell death...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to their well-known function in apoptosis, caspases are also important in several nonapoptotic processes. How caspase activity is restrained and shut down under such nonapoptotic conditions remains unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila melanogaster inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (DIAP 2) controls the level of caspase activity in living cells. Animals that lack DIAP 2 {{have higher levels of}} <b>drICE</b> activity. Although diap 2 -deficient cells remain viable, they are sensitized to apoptosis following treatment with sublethal doses of x-ray irradiation. We find that DIAP 2 regulates the effector caspase <b>drICE</b> through a mechanism that resembles the one of the caspase inhibitor p 35. As for p 35, cleavage of DIAP 2 is required for caspase inhibition. Our data suggest that DIAP 2 forms a covalent adduct with the catalytic machinery of <b>drICE.</b> In addition, DIAP 2 also requires a functional RING finger domain to block cell death and target <b>drICE</b> for ubiquitylation. Because DIAP 2 efficiently interacts with <b>drICE,</b> our data suggest that DIAP 2 controls <b>drICE</b> in its apoptotic and nonapoptotic roles...|$|E

40|$|Caspases are {{involved}} in the execution of cell death in all multicellular organisms so far studied, including the nematode worm, fruit fly and vertebrates. While Caenorhabditis elegans has only a single identified caspase, CED- 3, whose activity is absolutely required for all developmental programmed cell deaths, most mammalian cell types express multiple caspases with varying specificities. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is genetically tractable, less complex than vertebrates and possesses two known caspases, DCP- 1 and <b>drICE.</b> The fly may therefore provide a good model system for examining the hierarchy and relative roles of individual caspases in the execution of apoptosis. We have examined the role of <b>drICE</b> in in vitro apoptosis of the D. melanogaster cell line S 2. We show that cytoplasmic lysates made from S 2 cells undergoing apoptosis induced by either reaper (rpr) expression or cycloheximide treatment contain a caspase activity with DEVD specificity which can cleave p 35, lamin DmO, <b>drICE</b> and DCP- 1 in vitro, and which can trigger chromatin condensation in isolated nuclei. Using antibodies specific to <b>drICE,</b> we show that immunodepletion of <b>drICE</b> from these lysates is sufficient to remove most measurable in vitro apoptotic activity, and that re-addition of exogenous <b>drICE</b> to such immunodepleted lysates restores apoptotic activity. We conclude that, at least in S 2 cells, <b>drICE</b> can be the sole caspase effector of apoptosis...|$|E

Drosophila IAPs (D-IAP 1 and D-IAP 2) and a baculovirus-derived IAP, Op-IAP, physically interact with and inhibit the anti-apoptotic activity of Reaper, HID, and Grim, three genetically defined inducers of apoptosis in Drosophila, while human IAPs, c-IAP 1, c-IAP 2, and X-IAP interact {{with a number of}} different proteins including specific {{members of the}} caspase family of cysteine proteases which are crucial in the execution of cell death. We have examined whether insect-active IAPs can inhibit apoptosis induced by selected caspases, Drosophila <b>drICE,</b> Sf-caspase- 1, and mammalian caspase- 3, in insect SF- 21 cells. D-IAP 1 inhibited apoptosis induced by the active forms of all three caspases tested and physically interacted with the active, but not the proform of <b>drICE.</b> MIHA, the mouse homolog of X-IAP and an effective inhibitor of caspase- 3, also interacted with and blocked apoptosis induced by active <b>drICE</b> but was relatively ineffective in blocking Sf-caspase- 1. Op-IAP and D-IAP 2 were unable to inhibit effectively any of the active caspases tested and failed to interact with <b>drICE.</b> The Drosophila IAPs and Op-IAP, but not MIHA, blocked HID-initiated activation of pro-drICE. We conclude that D-IAP 1 is capable of inhibiting the activation of <b>drICE</b> as well as inhibiting apoptosis induced by the active form of <b>drICE.</b> In contrast, D-IAP 2 and Op-IAP are more limited in their inhibitory targets and may be limited to inhibiting the activation of caspases...|$|E
40|$|Baculoviruses induce {{widespread}} apoptosis in invertebrates. To {{better understand}} the pathways by which these DNA viruses trigger apoptosis, {{we have used a}} combination of RNA silencing and overexpression of viral and host apoptotic regulators to identify cell death components in the model system of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report that the principal effector caspase <b>DrICE</b> is required for baculovirus-induced apoptosis of Drosophila DL- 1 cells as demonstrated by RNA silencing. proDrICE was proteolytically cleaved and activated during infection. Activation was blocked by overexpression of the cellular inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins DIAP 1 and SfIAP but not by the baculovirus caspase inhibitor P 49 or P 35. Rather, the substrate inhibitors P 49 and P 35 prevented virus-induced apoptosis by arresting active <b>DrICE</b> through formation of stable inhibitory complexes. Consistent with a two-step activation mechanism, proDrICE was cleaved at the large/small subunit junction TETD 230 -G by a DIAP 1 -inhibitable, P 49 /P 35 -resistant protease and then at the prodomain junction DHTD 28 -A by a P 49 /P 35 -sensitive protease. Confirming that P 49 targeted <b>DrICE</b> and not the initiator caspase DRONC, depletion of <b>DrICE</b> by RNA silencing suppressed virus-induced cleavage of P 49. Collectively, our findings indicate that whereas DIAP 1 functions upstream to block <b>DrICE</b> activation, P 49 and P 35 act downstream by inhibiting active <b>DrICE.</b> Given that P 49 has the potential to inhibit both upstream initiator caspases and downstream effector caspases, we conclude that P 49 is a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor that likely provides a selective advantage to baculoviruses in different cellular backgrounds...|$|E

Using RNA interference in an ecdysone-responsive Drosophila cell line, we show that <b>drice</b> up-regulation is essential for apoptosis induced by ecdysone. We also show that <b>drice</b> expression is specifically controlled by the ecdysone-regulated transcription factor BR-C.

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, the {{induction}} of apoptosis requires three closely linked genes, reaper (rpr), head involution defective (hid), and grim. The products of these genes induce apoptosis by activating a caspase pathway. Two very similar Drosophila caspases, DCP- 1 and <b>drICE,</b> have been previously identified. We now show that DCP- 1 has a substrate specificity that is {{remarkably similar to}} those of human caspase 3 and Caenorhabditis elegans CED- 3, suggesting that DCP- 1 is a death effector caspase. <b>drICE</b> and DCP- 1 have similar yet different enzymatic specificities. Although expression of either in cultured cells induces apoptosis, neither protein was able to induce DNA fragmentation in Drosophila SL 2 cells. Ectopic expression of a truncated form of dcp- 1 (ΔN-dcp- 1) in the developing Drosophila retina under an eye-specific promoter resulted in a small and rough eye phenotype, whereas expression of the full-length dcp- 1 (fl-dcp- 1) had little effect. On the other hand, expression of either full-length <b>drICE</b> (fl-drICE) or truncated <b>drICE</b> (ΔN-drICE) in the retina showed no obvious eye phenotype. Although active DCP- 1 protein cleaves full-length DCP- 1 and full-length <b>drICE</b> in vitro, GMR-ΔN-dcp- 1 did not enhance the eye phenotype of GMR-fl-dcp- 1 or GMR-fl-drICE flies.

40|$|AbstractIn Drosophila oogenesis, the {{programmed}} {{cell death}} of germline cells occurs predominantly at three distinct stages. These cell deaths are subject to distinct regulatory controls, as cell death during early and midoogenesis is stress-induced, whereas the cell death of nurse cells in late oogenesis is developmentally regulated. In this report, we show that the effector caspase <b>Drice</b> is activated during cell death in both mid- and late oogenesis, but that the level and localization of activity differ depending on the stage. Active <b>Drice</b> formed localized aggregates during nurse cell death in late oogenesis; however, active <b>Drice</b> was found more ubiquitously and {{at a higher level}} during germline cell death in midoogenesis. Because <b>Drice</b> activity was limited in late oogenesis, we examined whether another effector caspase, Dcp- 1, could drive the unique morphological events that occur normally in late oogenesis. We found that premature activation of the effector caspase, Dcp- 1, resulted in a disappearance of filamentous actin, rather than the formation of actin bundles, suggesting that Dcp- 1 activity must also be restrained in late oogenesis. Overexpression of the caspase inhibitor DIAP 1 suppressed cell death induced by Dcp- 1 but had no effect on cell death during late oogenesis. This limited caspase activation in dying nurse cells may prevent destruction of the nurse cell cytoskeleton and the connected oocyte...|$|E
40|$|The cleaved-Caspase- 3 {{antibody}} is {{a popular}} tool in apoptosis research in Drosophila. Because the antibody was raised against cleaved human Caspase- 3, {{it was assumed that}} it detects cleaved <b>DRICE</b> and DCP- 1, Caspase- 3 -like effector caspases in Drosophila. However, as shown here strong immunoreactivity persists in apoptotic models doubly mutant for <b>drICE</b> and dcp- 1. In contrast, mutants of the apoptosome components DRONC (Caspase- 9 -like) and ARK (Apaf- 1 related) do not label with cleaved-Caspase- 3 antibody. By peptide blocking experiments and further genetic studies, we provide evidence that the cleaved-Caspase- 3 antibody recognizes multiple proteins including DCP- 1 and likely <b>DRICE,</b> but also at least one additional unknown protein, all of which require DRONC for epitope exposure. The unknown substrate may be involved in non-apoptotic functions of DRONC. Because the cleaved-Caspase- 3 antibody not only detects cleaved Caspase- 3 -like proteins in Drosophila, but also other proteins in a DRONC-dependent manner, it is more accurate to consider the cleaved-Caspase- 3 antibody as a marker for DRONC activity, rather than effector caspase activity...|$|E
40|$|During larval {{development}} in Drosophila melanogaster, transcriptional activation of target genes by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (dSREBP) {{is essential for}} survival. In all cases studied to date, activation of SREBPs requires sequential proteolysis of the membrane-bound precursor by site- 1 protease (S 1 P) and site- 2 protease (S 2 P). Cleavage by S 2 P, within the first membrane-spanning helix of SREBP, releases the transcription factor. In contrast to flies lacking dSREBP, flies lacking dS 2 P are viable. The Drosophila effector caspase <b>Drice</b> cleaves dSREBP, and cleavage requires an Asp residue at position 386, in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane stalk.

As mutations within caspases are identified in various human diseases, the study of caspase mutants will help to elucidate how caspases interact with other components of the apoptosis pathway and how they may contribute to disease. <b>DrICE</b> is the major effector caspase in Drosophila required for developmental and stress-induced cell death.

This suggests that compensatory proliferation is induced by dying cells as part of the apoptosis program. Here, we provide genetic evidence that the Drosophila initiator caspase DRONC governs both apoptosis execution and subsequent compensatory proliferation. We examined mutants of five Drosophila caspases and identified the initiator caspase DRONC and the effector caspase <b>DRICE</b> as crucial executioners of apoptosis. Artificial compensatory proliferation induced by coexpression of Reaper and p 35 was completely suppressed in dronc mutants. Moreover, compensatory proliferation after γ-irradiation was enhanced in <b>drice</b> mutants, in which DRONC is activated but the cells remain alive.

To define the pathway by which FHV triggers apoptosis in this model invertebrate system, we investigated the potential role of Drosophila apoptotic effectors during infection. Suggesting the involvement of host caspases, the pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) prevented FHV-induced cytopathology and prolonged cell survival. RNA interference-mediated ablation of the principal Drosophila effector caspase <b>DrICE</b> or its upstream initiator caspase DRONC prevented FHV-induced apoptosis and demonstrated direct participation of this intrinsic caspase pathway. Prior to the FHV-induced activation of <b>DrICE,</b> the intracellular level of inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) protein DIAP 1, the principal caspase regulator in Drosophila melanogaster, was dramatically reduced. DIAP 1 was depleted despite z-VAD-fmk-mediated caspase inhibition during infection, suggesting {{that the loss of}} DIAP 1 was caused by an upstream FHV-induced signal.

Three C. elegans genes play major roles in controlling the execution of the cell death program (Miura and Yuan, 1996). ced- 3 and ced- 4 are required for all programmed cell death in C. elegans. The ced- 9 gene represses programmed cell death induced by ced- 3 and ced- 4 (Shaham and Horvitz, 1996 a). Genetic studies of cell death in C. elegans favor the idea that ced- 9 acts upstream of ced- 3 (Shaham and Horvitz, 1996 b), and that the anti-apoptotic function of the ced- 9 gene product partly depends on the ced- 4 product (Shaham and Horvitz, 1996 a). The amino acid sequence of CED- 3 is homologous to the mammalian interleukin- 1 b converting enzyme (ICE), with 28 % amino acid identity (Yuan et al., 1993). Overexpression cells.

40|$|Caspases are {{a highly}} {{specialized}} class of cell death proteases. Since they are synthesized as inactive full-length zymogens, activation [...] {{at least of}} effector caspases {{and to some extent}} also of initiator caspases-requires a proteolytic cleavage event, generating a large and a small subunit, two of each forming the active caspase. The proteolytic cleavage event generates neo-epitopes at both the C-terminus of the large subunit and the N-terminus of the small subunit. The cleaved Caspase- 3 (CC 3) antibody was raised against the neo-epitope of the large subunit and thus detects only cleaved, but not full-length, Caspase- 3. Although raised against human cleaved Caspase- 3, the CC 3 antibody cross-reacts in other species and detects cleaved caspases, most notably <b>DrICE</b> and Dcp- 1, in Drosophila. This protocol describes the procedure for use of the CC 3 antibody to detect caspase activity in larval imaginal discs in Drosophila...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe Drosophila Apaf- 1 related killer {{forms an}} apoptosome in the {{intrinsic}} cell death pathway. In {{this study we}} show that Dark forms a single ring when initiator procaspases are bound. This Dark-Dronc complex cleaves <b>DrICE</b> efficiently; hence, a single ring represents the Drosophila apoptosome. We then determined the 3 D structure of a double ring at ∼ 6. 9  Å resolution and created {{a model of the}} apoptosome. Subunit interactions in the Dark complex are similar to those in Apaf- 1 and CED- 4 apoptosomes, but there are significant differences. In particular, Dark has “lost” a loop in the nucleotide-binding pocket, which opens a path for possible dATP exchange in the apoptosome. In addition, caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) form a crown on the central hub of the Dark apoptosome. This CARD geometry suggests that conformational changes will be required to form active Dark-Dronc complexes. When taken together, these data provide insights into apoptosome structure, function, and evolution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Op-IAP protein {{from the}} {{baculovirus}} Orgyia pseudotsugata M nucleopolyhedrovirus (OpMNPV) is highly effective at inhibiting apoptosis {{triggered by a}} variety of different stimuli in lepidopteran cells as well as in several different mammalian cell types, suggesting that it functions at a highly conserved step in the apoptotic pathway. However, the mechanism by which Op-IAP inhibits apoptosis is unclear. Since some IAP proteins can bind and inhibit caspases, we tested whether Op-IAP could inhibit the activity of caspases from Drosophila melanogaster. We found that recombinant Op-IAP protein was not able to bind or directly inhibit the activity of the Drosophila caspases DRONC, <b>DrICE,</b> or DCP- 1 in vitro. In addition, expression of Op-IAP was unable to inhibit apoptosis triggered by either actinomycin D or UV light in D. melanogaster S 2 cells. Surprisingly, Op-IAP expression in S 2 cells enhanced apoptosis caused by baculovirus infection, but did not cause increased sensitivity to either actinomycin D or UV damage-induced apoptosis. The observation that Op-IAP cannot inhibit these insect caspases suggests that it functions by a mechanism that does not involve direct caspase inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Although {{essential}} in mammals, in flies {{the importance of}} mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization for apoptosis remains highly controversial. Herein, we demonstrate that Drosophila Omi (dOmi), a fly homologue of the serine protease Omi/HtrA 2, is a developmentally regulated mitochondrial intermembrane space protein that undergoes processive cleavage, in situ, to generate two distinct inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) binding motifs. Depending upon the proapoptotic stimulus, mature dOmi is then differentially released into the cytosol, where it binds selectively to the baculovirus IAP repeat 2 (BIR 2) domain in Drosophila IAP 1 (DIAP 1) and displaces the initiator caspase DRONC. This interaction alone, however, is insufficient to promote apoptosis, as dOmi fails to displace the effector caspase <b>DrICE</b> from the BIR 1 domain in DIAP 1. Rather, dOmi alleviates DIAP 1 inhibition of all caspases by proteolytically degrading DIAP 1 and induces apoptosis both in cultured cells and in the developing fly eye. In summary, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} in flies that mitochondrial permeabilization not only occurs during apoptosis but also results in the release of a bona fide proapoptotic protein...|$|E
40|$|In Drosophila, {{activation}} of the apical caspase DRONC requires the apoptotic protease-activating factor homologue, DARK. However, unlike caspase activation in mammals, DRONC activation is not accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Drosophila encodes two cytochrome c proteins, Cytc-p (DC 4) the predominantly expressed species, and Cytc-d (DC 3), which is implicated in caspase activation during spermatogenesis. Here, we report that silencing expression of either or both DC 3 and DC 4 {{had no effect on}} apoptosis or {{activation of}} DRONC and <b>DRICE</b> in Drosophila cells. We find that loss of function mutations in dc 3 and dc 4, do not affect caspase activation during Drosophila development and that ectopic expression of DC 3 or DC 4 in Drosophila cells does not induce caspase activation. In cell-free studies, recombinant DC 3 or DC 4 failed to activate caspases in Drosophila cell lysates, but remarkably induced caspase activation in extracts from human cells. Overall, our results argue that DARK-mediated DRONC activation occurs independently of cytochrome c. Loretta Dorstyn, Kathryn Mills, Yuri Lazebnik, and Sharad Kuma...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the mechanism(s) {{by which}} dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons are eroded in Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{critical}} for effective therapeutic strategies. By using the binary tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -Gal 4 /UAS-X RNAi Drosophila melanogaster system, we report that Dmp 53, basket and <b>drICE</b> gene knockdown in dopaminergic neurons prolong life span (p < 0. 05; log-rank test) and locomotor activity (p < 0. 05; &# 967;² test) in D. melanogaster lines chronically exposed to (1 mM) paraquat (PQ, oxidative stress (OS) generator) compared to untreated transgenic fly lines. Likewise, knockdown flies displayed higher climbing performance than control flies. Amazingly, gallic acid (GA) significantly protected DAergic neurons, ameliorated life span, and climbing abilities in knockdown fly lines treated with PQ compared to flies treated with PQ only. Therefore, silencing specific gene(s) involved in neuronal death might constitute an excellent tool to study the response of DAergic neurons to OS stimuli. We propose that a therapy with antioxidants and selectively "switching off" death genes in DAergic neurons could provide a means for pre-clinical PD individuals to significantly ameliorate their disease condition...|$|E

40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} {{and specific}} protein kinases can initiate signal transduction pathways leading to programmed cell death. The specific protein phosphatases regulating apoptosis {{have been more}} elusive. Using double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), the role of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) in cellular signaling was investigated. Knockdown of A or C subunits individually or of combined B subunits led to concurrent loss of nontargeted PP 2 A subunits, suggesting that PP 2 A is an obligate heterotrimer in vivo. Global knockdown of PP 2 A activity or specific loss of redundant B 56 regulatory subunits caused cell death with the morphological and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis in cultured S 2 cells. B 56 :PP 2 A-regulated apoptosis required caspases and the upstream regulators dark, reaper, head involution defective, and dp 53. In Drosophila embryos, knockdown of B 56 -regulated PP 2 A activity resulted in apoptosis and failure of gastrulation, an effect that was blocked by concurrent RNAi of the caspase <b>Drice.</b> B 56 -regulated PP 2 A activity appears to be required upstream of dp 53 to maintain a critical proapoptotic substrate in a dephosphorylated, inactive state, thereby preventing apoptosis in Drosophila S 2 cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} {{regulatory}} RNAs that are between 21 and 25 nucleotides {{in length and}} repress gene function through interactions with target mRNAs [1, 2]. The genomes of metazoans encode {{on the order of}} several hundred miRNAs [3], but the processes they regulate have been defined for only two in C. elegans[4, 5]. We searched for new inhibitors of apoptotic cell death by testing existing collections of P element insertion lines for their ability to enhance a small-eye phenotype associated with eye-specific expression of the Drosophila cell death activator Reaper. Here we report the identification of the Drosophila miRNA mir- 14 as a cell death suppressor. Loss of mir- 14 enhances Reaper-dependent cell death, whereas ectopic expression suppresses cell death induced by multiple stimuli. Animals lacking mir- 14 are viable. However, they are stress sensitive and have a reduced lifespan. Mir- 14 mutants have elevated levels of the apoptotic effector caspase <b>Drice,</b> suggesting one potential site of action. Mir- 14 also regulates fat metabolism. Deletion of mir- 14 results in animals with increased levels of triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol, whereas increases in mir- 14 copy number have the converse effect. We discuss possible relationships between these phenotypes...|$|E
