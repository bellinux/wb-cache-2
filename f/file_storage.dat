2500|$|A pool {{can also}} contain volumes (also known as zvols), {{which can be}} used as block storage devices by other systems. An example of a volume would be an iSCSI or Fibre Channel target for another system, used to create NAS, a SAN, or any other ZFS-backed raw block storage capability. The volume will be seen by other systems as a bare storage device which they can use as they like. Capabilities such as snapshots, redundancy, [...] "scrubbing" [...] (data {{integrity}} and repair checks), deduplication, compression, cache usage, and replication are operational but not exposed to the remote system, which [...] "sees" [...] only a bare <b>file</b> <b>storage</b> device. Because ZFS does not create a <b>file</b> <b>storage</b> system on the block device or control how the storage space is used, it cannot create nested ZFS datasets or volumes within a volume.|$|E

2500|$|Disk {{formatting}} {{is usually}} {{done by a}} utility program supplied by the computer OS manufacturer; generally, it sets up a <b>file</b> <b>storage</b> directory system on the disk, and initializes its sectors and tracks. Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked (marked as [...] "bad sectors") so that the operating system does not attempt to use them. This was time consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process. When floppy disks were often used, disks pre-formatted for popular computers were sold. The unformatted capacity of a floppy disk {{does not include the}} sector and track headings of a formatted disk; the difference in storage between them depends on the drive's application. Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity (for example, 2 MB for a standard 3½-inch HD floppy). It is implied that this should not be exceeded, since doing so will most likely result in performance problems. DMF was introduced permitting 1.68 MB to fit onto an otherwise standard 3½-inch disk; utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such.|$|E
