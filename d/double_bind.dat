25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} {{use of the}} <b>double</b> <b>bind</b> {{occurred in}} early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a <b>double</b> <b>bind</b> by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E

Ayyaz himself realized the Portuguese were a formidable naval force whom he {{did not wish to}} hostilize. He could not, however, reject Hussain for fear of retaliation from the powerful Sultan of Gujarat - besides obviously Hussain's own forces now within the city. Caught in a <b>double</b> <b>bind,</b> Ayyaz decided to only cautiously support Hussain.|$|E

When these paradoxes are turned into <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> they have a distinctly disabling impact upon the partners and the processes of development. The two main causes of <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> are an inability to withdraw from the no win choices of paradox, and an interdiction against discussing the existence of the paradox. A number of examples of <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> in development and their causes are discussed and a series of suggestions to improve the practices of development are made...|$|R

25|$|A {{qualitative}} {{review of}} previous literature looking at self-report data suggests {{that men and}} women use impression management tactics in the corporate world that are consistent with stereotypical gender roles when presenting themselves to others. This research proposes that women are put in a <b>double</b> <b>bind</b> where those who portray themselves as more communal and submissive are overlooked for leadership positions and women who try to utilize male tactics (such as being more aggressive) receive negative consequences for violating normative gender roles. To change this dynamic the authors suggest that managerial positions should be re-advertised to highlight the feminine qualities needed for a position and staff training should involve a segment accentuating gender issues in the office to make everyone aware of possible discrimination.|$|E
500|$|Burrell's {{study found}} women {{consistently}} rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points {{during her first}} lady years. Jacobson's study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response. Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a [...] "site" [...] for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity. In particular anderson states {{there has been a}} cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox. Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband's very public infidelity. University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the <b>double</b> <b>bind,</b> who though able to live in a [...] "both-and" [...] world of both career and family, nevertheless [...] "became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible", leading to her being placed in a variety of no-win situations. Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself. University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms.|$|E

2500|$|The novel's title {{refers to}} a plot device that is {{repeatedly}} invoked in the story. Catch-22 starts {{as a set of}} paradoxical requirements whereby airmen mentally unfit to fly did not have to do so, but could not actually be excused. According to the novel, people who were crazy were not obliged to fly missions, but anyone who applied to stop flying was showing a rational concern for his safety and was, therefore, sane and had to fly. By the end of the novel, it is invoked as the explanation for many unreasonable restrictions. The phrase [...] "Catch-22" [...] has since entered the English language, referring to a type of unsolvable logic puzzle sometimes called a <b>double</b> <b>bind.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A French {{psychologist}} pivotally {{involved in}} early psychological screening of First Hundred candidates in Antarctica {{which he describes}} as being a collection of <b>double</b> <b>bind</b> requirements. Duval is assigned to accompany the Mars mission and is treated as an observer {{rather than as a}} member of the team during the early events of Red Mars. His aloof personality enforces this ostracism and also subverts his relationships with others, but in time it becomes clear that Duval is struggling with his own psychological issues perhaps more than anyone else from the expedition. [...] During the first disappearance of the farm team, he is invited by Hiroko to flee with the farm team and establish Zygote, the first hidden colony. [...] Duval desperately wants to return to Provence as he remembers it, although after visiting as a part of the Martian diplomatic mission to Earth, he becomes even more homesick. [...] Duval falls in love with Maya Toitovna and guides her through particularly challenging psychological episodes throughout most of the series, dying late in Blue Mars of heart arrhythmia when Maya displays signs of very heavy temporary memory loss.|$|E

5000|$|The {{field of}} neuro-linguistic {{programming}} also {{makes use of}} the expression [...] "double bind". Grinder and Bandler (both of whom had personal contact with Bateson) asserted that a message could be constructed with multiple messages, whereby {{the recipient of the}} message is given the impression of choice—although both options have the same outcome at a higher level of intention. This is called a [...] "double bind" [...] in NLP terminology, and has applications in both sales and therapy. In therapy, the practitioner may seek to challenge destructive <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> that limit the client in some way and may also construct <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> in which both options have therapeutic consequences. In a sales context, the speaker may give the respondent the illusion of choice between two possibilities. For example, a salesperson might ask: [...] "Would you like to pay cash or by credit card?", with both outcomes presupposing that the person will make the purchase; whereas the third option (that of not buying) is intentionally excluded from the spoken choices.|$|R
5000|$|Derrida in the middle-phase of {{his career}} re-visits {{negative}} theology in his Comment ne pas parler - Dénégations (1987; How to Avoid Speaking - Denials (1989)). Robert Magliola explains at length the several ways—most of them adapted from Talmudic tactics—that Dénégations uses to disrupt or [...] "confound" [...] possible structural solidarity with negative theology (Derrida was a Sephardi Jew very appreciative of his ancestry). Via many examples from Derrida's text, Magliola demonstrates how these Derridean tactics work. A partial list of these tactics: (1) ambiguous narrative modes, voices, and citations, so the voice of any utterance may conceal another that {{it may or may}} not be quoting; (2) subversive footnotes that destabilize rather than reinforce the text's body; (3) <b>double</b> <b>binds,</b> so assertions in parts of the essay are designed to contradict other parts; (4) aberrant reinscription, so <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> proliferate in the text, implying a symploké (GK-"crossing") that precedes the binds themselves: thus Derrida's often-cited différance originaire is itself a double bind; (5) Trace-words such as sceau, filtre, prétend, etc., that neither mean nor do not mean what they meant in his earlier oeuvres.|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{important}} writing students will be tasked with in their college careers calls upon them to approximate the writing styles academics and professionals use to shape and advance their respective fields. Many disciplinary values are encoded within the such texts. Learning these styles can be difficult for students who lack the experience and ingrained habits that their instructors may take for granted. In most cases, college writers are outsiders peeking in from the outskirts of academic and professional discourse. Also, the “Expert Blind Spot” (Ambrose et. al) can make college instructors oblivious to the nuances of the writing styles they take for granted, which can make acquisition of those styles difficult for their students. These factors can lead to students feeling that different courses/disciplines are giving them contradictory lessons in writing, which often leads them {{to pay more attention}} to the differences in teachers instead of the differences in disciplinary habits. These conflicts or contradictions in instruction can become “double binds,” which are intractable roadblocks caused by the inability to reconcile two contrary commands or signals. This project utilizes Genre Theory, Activity Theory, and research in writing across the disciplines to examine conflicts and <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> students face in the disciplinary writing classroom and what role writing prompts play in ameliorating or exacerbating those difficulties. It does so by tracing across four disciplines (philosophy, psychology, nursing, and biology) several common conflicts and <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> encountered at the intersection between ideal academic writing and the realities of the classroom environment (and in the case of one chapter, the complicated boundary between academia, the classroom, and the workplace). This dissertation illuminates common conflicts and <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> inherent in disciplinary writing instruction and makes an argument for effective writing prompt design as an important mediating tool in promoting effective thoughtful student writing. When students know what the rules of the assignment are, they can act more confidently within those boundaries and more easily gain disciplinary awareness and confidence as authors and agents...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>double</b> <b>bind</b> {{occurs when}} an {{individual}} faces two or more contradictory demands, in which a successful response to one demand means a failed response to the other. A gender specific <b>double</b> <b>bind</b> occurs due to social expectations about different roles, such as when traits positively associated with leadership conflict with traits stereotypically associated with femininity. Women in leadership positions experience a <b>double</b> <b>bind</b> situation {{as a result of}} the biases identified by role congruity theory that traps women into a bind of meeting the demands of both leadership and being a woman. Within the gender <b>double</b> <b>bind,</b> women are harshly judged or not seen as a [...] "good fit" [...] in leadership positions. Two biases, descriptive and prescriptive, result from this perceived dichotomy between leadership and femininity. Descriptive bias occurs when women leaders are stereotyped for having less leadership potential simply because of their gender, whereas prescriptive bias occurs because leadership is typically seen as a masculine desire, leaving women leaders typically evaluated less favorably because they are seen as violating a traditionally masculine desire. Put simply, descriptive bias is thinking, [...] "women are docile", and prescriptive bias is [...] "women should be docile". Both biases place female leaders into this <b>double</b> <b>bind,</b> as they are unable to express agentic behavior and emotions without negative consequences.|$|E

Since manager-employee relationships include a difference in power and often in age, workplace psychologists have used models based on transference theory to draw analogies between micromanagement relationships and dysfunctional parent-child relationships, e.g., that both often feature the frequent imposition of <b>double</b> <b>binds</b> and/or a tendency by the authority figure to exhibit hypercriticality. However, external factors such as organizational culture, severe or increased time or performance pressure, severe demands of the regulatory environment, and instability of managerial position (either specific to a micromanager's position or throughout an organization) may also play a role.|$|R
