This peculiar behavior on heating has long served as a useful test for Bence-Jones proteins in the urine of patients with multiple myeloma. When applied to serum, however, particularly to those sera where hyperproteinemia is associated with myeloma, the heat test has been found generally inadequate be-cause it does not sufficiently differentiate Bence-Jones proteins from the serum <b>euglobulins</b> (2, 3).

However, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods is limited because elevation of these biomarkers can also occur induced in other clinical conditions. The classical coagulation tests such as PT (prothrombin time), aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) or thrombin time are not very sensitive for hyperfibrinolysis, and influenced by numerous other variables.

The reviews of Leutscher (1) and more recently of Petermann (2) provide general discussions of the subject but leave one with the impression that while a great deal is known, little is understood. Perhaps one {{reason for this is that}} in themselves, groups of proteins such as a-, /~-, and y-globulins, <b>euglobulins,</b> macroglobulins, and even albumin have few intrinsic connotations other than their methods of preparation or detection. Many individual proteins, however, do have significance based on their known chemical or biological capacities. More recently individual constituents have been investigated and their variation correlated with pathological conditions. Immunoelectrophoresis has proven very useful in detecting and following such variation. Since first applied by Williams and Grabar to abnormal sera from myeloma patients (3), its effectiveness has been expanded to the study of a large selection of anomalies and diseases (4). Infectious diseases have not received such attention, however. Where attempts with human material have been made, reports have been inconclusive or, according to some, unimportant (5). Nevertheless, in view of published findings concerning the conventional electrophoretic profiles of plasma proteins in infectious disease, it seemed likely that immunoelectrophoresis would demonstrate some of the individual protein modifications. It also seemed that a productive approach would be the examination of carefully controlled experimental infections in laboratory animals before a study of human specimens, however carefully selected, from hospital wards.

With common glass a minimum is reached, and the activity reappears when larger amounts of glass are used. With pyrex glass the decrease continues. Addition of flufenamate to the solutions recover much of the missing activity suggesting the presence in the <b>euglobulin</b> precipitates of an inhibitor sensitive to flufenamic acid. Heating of plasma at 56 ??C rapidly destroys its ability to produce spontaneously active <b>euglobulin</b> precipitates while the capacity to elicit fibrinolytic activity by precipitation in the presence of dextran sulphate remains largely undisturbed suggesting a relative stability of the precursors of the intrinsic fibrinolytic system. Chemicals/CAS: dextran sulfate, 9011 - 18 - 1, 9042 - 14 - 2; flufenamic acid, 1977 - 00 - 0, 530 - 78 - 9; plasminogen activator, 9039 - 53 - 6; Dextran Sulfate, 9042 - 14 - 2; Dextrans, 9004 - 54 - 0; Flufenamic Acid, 530 - 78 - 9; Glass; Serum Globulin...|$|E
