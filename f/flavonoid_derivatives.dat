This compound is considered as a key synthon for the synthesis of new <b>flavonoid</b> <b>derivatives</b> designed as potential cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitors. The retrosynthetic approach via 3 ′-methylsulfonylacetophenone, which included three synthetic pathways, did {{not allow us to}} obtain the expected compound. However, a synthesis from 3 -mercaptophenol led to the desired acetophenone in three steps: thiophenol methylation, Friedel-Crafts acetylation and oxidation of the sulphide to the corresponding sulfone. The desired compound, 2 ′-hydroxy- 4 ′- methylsulfonylacetophenone, will be used as a synthon for the preparation of novel <b>flavonoid</b> <b>derivatives,</b> such as 2 ′-hydroxychalcones, flavanones, flavones, and flavonols...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature (angiogenesis) {{is a crucial}} stage in cancer progression and, indeed, angiogenesis inhibitors are now used as anticancer agents, clinically. Here we have explored the potential of <b>flavonoid</b> <b>derivatives</b> as antiangiogenic agents. Specifically, we have synthesised methoxy and 4 -thio derivatives of the natural flavones quercetin and luteolin, two of which (4 -thio quercetin and 4 -thio luteolin) had never been previously reported. Seven of these compounds showed significant (P< 0. 05) antiangiogenic activity in an in vitro scratch assay. Their activity ranged from an 86 % inhibition of the vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) -stimulated migration (observed for methoxyquercetin at 10 µM and for luteolin at 1 µM) to a 36 % inhibition (for thiomethoxy quercetin at 10 µM). Western blotting studies showed that most (4 out of 7) compounds inhibited phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor- 2 (VEGFR 2), suggesting that the antiangiogenic activity was due to an interference with the VEGF/VEGFR 2 pathway. Molecular modelling studies looking at the affinity of our compounds towards VEGFR and/or VEGF confirmed this hypothesis, and indeed the compound with the highest antiangiogenic activity (methoxyquercetin) showed the highest affinity towards VEGFR and VEGF. As reports from others have suggested that structurally similar compounds can elicit biological responses via a non-specific, promiscuous membrane perturbation, potential interactions of the active compounds with a model lipid bilayer were assessed via DSC. Luteolin and its derivatives did not perturb the model membrane even at concentrations 10 {{times higher than the}} biologically active concentration and only subtle interactions were observed for quercetin and its derivatives. Finally, cytotoxicity assessment of these <b>flavonoid</b> <b>derivatives</b> against MCF- 7 breast cancer cells demonstrated also a direct anticancer activity albeit at generally higher concentrations than those required for an antiangiogenic effect (10 fold higher for the methoxy analogues).

In vitro binding assays using recombinant mouse PrP (rMoPrP) aggregates revealed that the 4 -dimethylamino-substituted styrylchromone derivative (SC-NMe 2) had higher in vitro binding affinity (Kd = 24. 5 nM) and capacity (Bmax = 36. 3 pmol/nmol protein) than three other <b>flavonoid</b> <b>derivatives</b> (flavone, chalcone, and aurone). Fluorescent imaging using brain sections from mouse-adapted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mBSE) -infected mice demonstrated that SC-NMe 2 clearly labelled PrPSc-positive prion deposits in the mice brain. Two methoxy SC derivatives, SC-OMe and SC-(OMe) 2, also showed high binding affinity for rMoPrP aggregates with Ki values of 20. 8 and 26. 6 nM, respectively. In vitro fluorescence and autoradiography experiments demonstrated high accumulation of [125 I]SC-OMe and [125 I]SC-(OMe) 2 in prion deposit-rich regions of the mBSE-infected mouse brain.

We demonstrate that LY 294002 induces a specific G 1 block in asynchronously growing cells leading to an almost complete inhibition of cell proliferation after three days of treatment. When melanoma cells are released from a nocodazole-induced G 2 /M block, LY 294002 is shown to delay and greatly restrain the G 1 /S transition. The inhibitor is able to exert its action {{as long as it is}} added during the G 1 progression and before the cells enter in S phase. We report that the LY 294002 -induced G 1 arrest is closely correlated to inhibition of CDK 4 and CDK 2 activities leading to the impairment of pRb phosphorylation which normally occurs during G 1 progression. While the inhibition of CDK 4 may be attributed at least in part to the decline in CDK 4 protein level, CDK 2 activity reduction is rather due to the up-regulation of the CDK inhibitor p 27 Kip 1 and to its increased association to CDK 2...|$|R

We have previously shown the involvement of LtrMDR 1, a P-glycoprotein-like transporter belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, in miltefosine resistance in Leishmania. Here we show that overexpression of LtrMDR 1 increases miltefosine efflux, leading to a decrease in drug accumulation in the parasites. Although LtrMDR 1 modulation might be an efficient way to overcome this resistance, a main drawback {{associated with the use of}} P-glycoprotein inhibitors is related to their intrinsic toxicity. In order to diminish possible side effects, we have combined suboptimal doses of modulators targeting both the cytosolic and transmembrane domains of LtrMDR 1. Preliminary structure-activity relationships have allowed us to design a new and potent <b>flavonoid</b> <b>derivative</b> with high affinity for the cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains. As modulators directed to the transmembrane domains, we have selected one of the most potent dihydro-beta-agarofuran sesquiterpenes described, and we have also studied the effects of two of the most promising, latest-developed modulators of human P-glycoprotein, zosuquidar (LY 335979) and elacridar (GF 120918). The results show that this combinatorial strategy efficiently overcomes P-glycoprotein-mediated parasite miltefosine resistance by increasing intracellular miltefosine accumulation without any side effect in the parental, sensitive, Leishmania line and in different mammalian cell lines.
