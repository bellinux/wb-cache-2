5|$|Beshear called another special {{legislative}} session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall {{in the state}} budget. Later, Beshear amended the call to include the <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state by statute. With the threshold lowered from 60 votes {{for a constitutional amendment}} to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget and the <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> bills both passed in the 10-day session.|$|E
5|$|From 1998 onwards, the Copa Libertadores was {{sponsored}} by Toyota and {{became known as the}} Copa Toyota Libertadores. That same year, Mexican clubs, although affiliated to CONCACAF, started taking part in the competition thanks to quotas obtained from the Pre-Libertadores which pitted Mexican and Venezuelan clubs against each other for two slots in the group stage. The tournament was expanded to 34 teams and <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> were introduced by an agreement between CONMEBOL and Toyota Motor Corporation. All teams that advanced to the second stage of the tournament received $25,000 for their participation.|$|E
5|$|Industry representatives {{complained that}} the final rule overstated the {{environmental}} effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of ILUC as an unfair penalty to domestic corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. ethanol production. The 2011 limit for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol failed, unless current carbon intensity was reduced. Oil industry representatives {{complained that the}} standard left oil refiners with few options, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, with its accompanying tariff. CARB officials and environmentalists counter that time and <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> will allow produces to adapt.|$|E
40|$|In two-tier {{heterogeneous}} networks (HetNets), picocells can {{be offered}} an <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> {{in order to}} offload traffic from high-power macrocell which is usually overload. This becomes important {{in order to maintain}} efficient operation of the network and generate benefit tradeoff between macrocell and picocells. The benefit to picocells comes from the <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> of macrocell and the benefit to macrocell is achieved reducing the load and saving spectrum. However, two important challenges are posed in this cooperation: 1) How much <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> can be offered by macrocell, and 2) how much offloading traffic volumes can be admitted by the picocells. In this paper, we propose a novel game based approach for data offloading scheme to determine the amount of <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> a macrocell should offer to picocells and to determine how much traffic each picocell should admit from macrocell. In our proposal, a two-stage non-cooperative Stackelberg game theory is applied to optimize the strategies of both macrocell and picocells in order to maximize both of their utilities. I...|$|R

5|$|The {{rules of}} the House of Representatives {{required}} that the final two days of the chamber's session be reserved for overriding any vetoes by the governor. Beshear hoped that the House would suspend the rules, as they had in previous years, in order to consider bills to increase funding to public defenders, create a transportation authority to oversee bridge-building projects in Louisville and Henderson, and provide various <b>economic</b> <b>incentives,</b> including a package intended to lure a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race to Kentucky Speedway. The House refused to suspend the rules, however, citing its desire to receive legislation {{in a timely manner}} in the future. The chamber allowed Beshear's one veto to stand and adjourned a day early.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{was elected}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 1979, under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. Brown was frequently {{out of the}} state, leaving Collins as acting governor for more than 500 days of her four-year term. In 1983, she defeated Republican Jim Bunning to become Kentucky's first woman governor. Her administration had two primary focuses: education and economic development. After failing to secure increased funding for education in the 1984 legislative session, she conducted a statewide public awareness campaign in advance of a special legislative session the following year; the modified program was passed in that session. She successfully used <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> to bring a Toyota manufacturing plant to Georgetown, Kentucky in 1986. Legal challenges to the incentives– which would have cost the state the plant and its related economic benefits– were eventually dismissed by the Kentucky Supreme Court. The state experienced record economic growth under Collins' leadership.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E

Evaluating <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> programs can help determine what works and what does not work for an individual state. The effectiveness of <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> programs is largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine how the IDED can measure the effectiveness and performance of its <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> programs. A performance evaluation methodology developed by Todd Calhoun was utilized to organize the economic development objectives of key IDED stakeholders into a Global Hierarchy. IDED program objectives were then linked to the Global Hierarchy to demonstrate that IDED objectives were in alignment with State objectives.
