25|$|During the 1950s, {{new drugs}} became {{available}} and {{were incorporated into}} treatment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>ill.</b> The new drugs effectively reduced severe symptoms, allowing the mentally ill to live in environments less stringent than institutions, such as halfway houses, nursing homes, or their own homes.

25|$|One type of {{institution}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> is a community-based halfway house.

25|$|As the 1840s progressed, Donizetti moved {{regularly}} between Naples, Rome, Paris, and Vienna {{continuing to}} compose and stage his own operas {{as well as}} those of other composers.

Eventually, by early 1846 he was obliged to be confined to an institution <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> and, by late 1847, friends had him moved back to Bergamo, where he died in April 1848.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{psychiatry}} and psychiatric nursing, although disjointed, {{can be traced back}} to ancient philosophical thinkers.

Some of the first known psychiatric care centers were constructed in the Middle East during the 8th century.

25|$|Although many {{argue that}} prisons {{have become the}} {{facilities}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>ill,</b> very few crimes point directly to symptoms of mental illness as their sole cause. Despite the disproportionate representation of mentally ill persons in prison, a study by American Psychological Association indicates that only 7.5 percent of crimes committed {{were found to be}} directly related to mental illness. However, some advocates argue that many incarcerations of mentally ill persons could have been avoided if they had been given proper treatment, which would be a much less costly alternative to incarceration.|$|E
25|$|The Democrat-dominated {{legislature}} established legal {{racial segregation}} in public facilities. To further this, in the 1880s it authorized a facility {{to serve the}} black mentally ill, the State Hospital in Goldsboro. In 1899 the legislature authorized an addition but did not appropriate sufficient funds. This operated until after passage of civil rights legislation requiring integration of public facilities. In addition, the hospital was affected by the 1970s movement to de-institutionalize care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>ill.</b> Most states have failed to adequately support community programs to replace such facilities.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{national}} systems of regulated asylums <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> <b>ill</b> had been established in most industrialized countries.

The United States housed 150,000 patients in mental hospitals by 1904. Germany housed more than 400 public and private sector asylums. These asylums were critical to the evolution of psychiatry as they provided places of practice throughout the world.|$|E
