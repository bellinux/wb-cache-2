50|$|A similar fallacy is the <b>double-barreled</b> <b>question.</b> It is {{committed}} when someone asks {{a question that}} touches upon more than one issue, yet allows only for one answer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Double-barreled</b> <b>questions</b> {{have been}} asked by professionals, {{resulting}} in notable skewed media reports and research pieces. For example, Harris Poll used <b>double-barreled</b> <b>questions</b> in the 1980s, investigating the US public opinion on Libya-United States relations, and American attitudes toward Mikhail Gorbachev.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>double-barreled</b> <b>questions</b> can be {{detected}} by {{the existence of the}} grammatical conjunction [...] "" [...] in them. This is not a foolproof test, as the word [...] "and" [...] can exist in properly constructed questions.|$|R
50|$|According to a 2016 survey {{published}} from The Gild, {{a global}} brand consultancy, British Gen Zers, defined here as those born 2001 and onwards, are {{more conservative than}} Millennials, Gen Xers and Baby Boomers with respect to marijuana legalization, transgender issues and same sex marriage. However, some argue that this study has several methodological problems such as non-random selection and <b>double-barreled</b> <b>questions,</b> rendering the study's findings unreliable in discerning the political ideologies of the generation.|$|R
5000|$|Buttering-up {{is a type}} of a <b>double-barreled</b> <b>question.</b> It {{happens when}} one of the {{questions}} is a question that the questioned person will want to answer [...] "yes" [...] to, and another that the questioner hopes will be answered with the same [...] "yes". For example, [...] "Would you be a nice guy and lend me five bucks?" ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>double-barreled</b> <b>question</b> (sometimes, double-direct question) is an {{informal}} fallacy. It is committed when someone asks {{a question that}} touches upon more than one issue, yet allows only for one answer. This may result in inaccuracies in the attitudes being measured for the question, as the respondent can answer {{only one of the}} two questions, and cannot indicate which one is being answered.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{questions}} {{may not be}} double-barreled but confusingly similar enough to a <b>double-barreled</b> <b>question</b> to result in similar issues. For example, the question [...] "Should the organization reduce paperwork required of employees by hiring more administrators?" [...] {{can be interpreted as}} composed of two questions: [...] "Should the organization reduce paperwork required of employees?" [...] and [...] "Should the organization hire more administrators?" ...|$|E
40|$|The {{acculturation}} {{paradigm of}} measuring assimilation, separation, integration and marginalization confuses dimensional and categorical conceptions of its constructs, fails to produce ipsative data from mutually exclusive scales, misoperationalizes marginalization as distress, mismeasures biculturalism using <b>double-barreled</b> <b>questions</b> instead of computing it from unicultural measures, and then tends to misinterpret and miscite this faulty science. Extensive published but widely uncited data {{cast doubt on}} claims that integration is preferred by minority groups or is beneficial for them. Such salient but unseen problems suggest that the community of acculturation researchers is biased and blinded by an ideology, probably the commendable ideology of liberalism, which advocates freedom of choice, tolerance, plurality, and redress of harm. Phenomenological observations that challenge the paradigm include the absence of studies of majority group acculturation, the well-replicated fact that minorities never prefer pure uniculturalism, the indistinctiveness of cultures, and the predominance of researchers, theory and data from similar Anglo-Saxon settler societies (USA, Australia, Canada) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has contributed}} to the methodological {{development}} in the field of assistive technology and has generated new knowledge about the effectiveness and the service delivery process when powered mobility devices are provided to adult first time users in a Nordic context. Some of the results have been used to investigate the relationship between the three key elements of Donabedianâ€™s conceptual model when scooters are provided to users from two Nordic countries, Denmark and Norway. As most of the results from the psychometric testing of the SATS and NOMO 1. 0 were above the recommended levels, both instruments can be reliably administered in studies among adult users of powered mobility devices in Nordic context. The factor analysis of the need for assistance and frequency scales of the NOMO 1. 0 identified unidimensionality for the first scale and multi-dimensionality for the other. However, further psychometric testing is required for the NOMO 1. 0 regarding the validity. As for the SATS, the instrument needs to go through a basic investigation of its validity. There is a need to consider the wording of the items in order to avoid, for example, <b>double-barrel</b> <b>questions.</b> A factor analysis should be carried out in order to establish the dimensionality and {{to see if there is}} a need for item reduction. In other words, a revision of the instrument is needed. Concerning the NOMO 1. 0, (further validity studies) a confirmatory factor analysis is needed. Reliability and validity studies are needed for the study-specific questionnaires used in the SATS study. All three instruments need to be psychometrically tested in other user groups of assistive devices than powered mobility devices and in other cultures than the Nordic countries. Supporting previous research, this thesis showed that the powered mobility device interventions increase mobility-related participation in daily life among adult users in a Nordic context. Mobility became easier for several aspects, and buying groceries and go for a walk/ride were carried out more frequently. Men, scooter users, and users with poor self-reported health seem to benefit the most from the interventions. Assessments and administrative work were accomplished in almost all the cases, while the other steps of the service delivery process were carried out to a various degree when scooters were provided to users in Denmark and Norway. More time was spent on assessments, administration and total time in the Danish sample. The user satisfaction with different aspects of the service delivery process was high. However, there was no association between time spent in the service delivery process and use satisfaction and effectiveness. The finding that there were differences in time spent on the service delivery process between samples from two countries with structural differences confirm the assumption that structure of the services predicts the time spent in the service delivery process. Different rules regulating the area seem to be an important explanation for the time differences. The expected association between the structure, the time spent in the service delivery process and the outcomes in terms of user satisfaction with the service delivery process and effectiveness was not found...|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} a <b>double-barreled</b> <b>question</b> would be the following: [...] "do you think that {{students}} should have more classes about history and culture?" [...] This question asks about two different issues: [...] "do you think that students should have more classes about history" [...] and [...] "do you think that students should have more classes about culture?" [...] Combining both questions into one makes it unclear what exactly is being measured, and as each question may elicit a different response if asked separately there is an increased likelihood of confusing the respondents. In other words, while some respondents would answer [...] "yes" [...] to both and some [...] "no" [...] to both, some would like to answer both [...] "yes and no".|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for Ben Shapiro's, Primetime Propaganda, Di Bona is asked if the accusation by many conservatives that [...] "Hollywood is a leftist town" [...] and leftist political perspectives dominate scripted television shows is accurate. Di Bona responds that it is [...] "probably accurate, and I'm happy about it." [...] This is a <b>double-barreled</b> <b>question,</b> however, because it is asking if Hollywood is a politically left-wing town and if leftist ideologies dominate scripted shows. Shapiro used Di Bona's answer as evidence in his book that producers, executives and writers {{in the entertainment industry}} discriminate against conservatives and are using television to promote a socialist political agenda. Di Bona responded by accusing [...] "Shapiro of misrepresentation, saying he never revealed his political agenda." [...] Suffice it to say, Di Bona agrees with the idea that Hollywood tends to be populated by left-wing individuals and that this therefore reveals that scripted shows push a leftist political agenda and that Hollywood discriminates against conservatives.|$|E
