5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential <b>files,</b> {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed <b>files</b> have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed <b>files</b> vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative <b>files,</b> like indexed <b>files,</b> have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative <b>files</b> also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of tools {{intended}} specifically to decrypt <b>files</b> locked by ransomware, although successful recovery may not be possible. If the same encryption key is used for all <b>files,</b> decryption tools use <b>files</b> for which there are both uncorrupted backups and encrypted copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. Free ransomware decryption tools can help decrypt <b>files</b> encrypted by the following forms of ransomware: AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse, BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CryptoMix, CrySiS, EncrypTile, FindZip, Globe, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt, Stampado, SZFLocker, TeslaCrypt, XData.|$|E

5|$|What the {{transfer}} really did was {{ensure that the}} <b>files</b> would {{be placed in the}} CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 CIA Operational <b>Files</b> exemption—is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the <b>files</b> within.

5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration <b>files</b> available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration <b>files</b> themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration <b>files</b> other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E

The <b>file</b> name is found in the deleted <b>file</b> search, but not in the lost <b>file.</b> This is because in most <b>file</b> systems the <b>file</b> name and date/times are stored on disk and are only marked for re-use by the system, and not completely removed.|$|R

40|$|While the I/O {{functions}} {{described in}} the MPI standard included shared <b>file</b> pointer support from the beginning, the performance and portability of these functions have been subpar at best. ROMIO [1], which provides the MPI-IO functionality for most MPI libraries, to this day uses a separate <b>file</b> to manage the shared <b>file</b> pointer. This <b>file</b> provides the shared location that holds the cur-rent value of the shared <b>file</b> pointer. Unfortunately, each access to the shared <b>file</b> pointer involves <b>file</b> lock management and updates to the <b>file</b> contents. Further-more, support for shared <b>file</b> pointers is not universally available because few <b>file</b> systems support native shared <b>file</b> pointers [5] and a few <b>file</b> systems do not support <b>file</b> locks [3]. Application developers rarely use shared <b>file</b> pointers, even though many ap-plications can benefit from this <b>file</b> I/O capability.

5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF <b>files</b> {{in favor of}} LNK <b>files</b> and PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut <b>files</b> install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E

5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system <b>files.</b> The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system <b>files</b> instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system <b>files</b> out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of <b>files,</b> and determine whether certain types of <b>files</b> are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E
