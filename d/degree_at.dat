40|$|This study prospectively reviews a {{consecutive}} {{series of}} 228 primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures utilizing {{a technique to}} optimize knee flexion. The main features include: (1) {{the use of a}} “patellar friendly” femoral component and reduced thickness patellar components, (2) patient individualized adjustment of the femoral component rotation set strictly to the anterior-posterior femoral axis, (3) a rigorous flexion compartment debridement to remove non-essential posterior femoral bone with a Z-osteotome, and (4) incorporation of a rapid recovery protocol with features to promote knee flexion. Results were categorized into three groups: low pre-op flexion (90 degrees and below), regular pre-op flexion (91 - 125 degrees), and high pre-op flexion (126 degrees and above). Average flexion in the low flexion group improved by 20 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 6 weeks, 28 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 3 months, 31 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 1 year, and 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 5 years. In the regular flexion group, average flexion improved by 2 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 6 weeks, 10 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 3 months, 12 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 1 year, and 13 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 5 years. Finally, in the high flexion group, average flexion decreased by 7 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 6 weeks, regained preoperative levels at 3 months, and increased by 3 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 1 year and 4 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> 5 years. In summary, a technique that emphasizes patellofemoral kinematics can consistently improve flexion in TKA in short and long-term follow-up...|$|R
