5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E

Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot.|$|E
500|$|Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich {{also criticized}} the booing. According to Park: [...] "We get nothing — not a dime for this. Brother, I'm sick". Other players were more sanguine. Dryden didn't lash {{out at the}} fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, but I can {{understand}} it. The fans wanted us to do real good, and they're frustrated we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|E
500|$|... "People in the {{industry}} treated me like I didn't deserve to be spoken to and I was some unwanted object. I couldn't speak English fluently and people made fun of me for that. So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> find it hard to deal with praise. Today, when people say that I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... It scares me." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>Guess</b> This <b>Is</b> Goodbye is {{the fifth}} {{installment}} in The Emo Diaries series of compilation albums, released October 24, 2000 by Deep Elm Records. As with all installments in the series, the label had an open submissions policy for bands to submit material for the compilation, {{and as a result}} the music does not all fit within the emo style. As {{with the rest of the}} series, <b>I</b> <b>Guess</b> This <b>Is</b> Goodbye features mostly unsigned bands contributing songs that were previously unreleased.|$|R
500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes {{up to me and}} says, 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV all the time and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Lochte said he {{was pleased}} with his {{performance}} at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships but feels that he can improve his times before the 2012 Olympics. [...] "Getting five gold medals is definitely great, but the times that I went, I know I could go a lot faster," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are a lot of}} places in my races that I messed up on that I could have changed and gone faster, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> have a whole year to make sure I have those perfect swims." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{began to}} appear in small-budget films which did well with critics, such as 1997's drama Inventing the Abbotts, set in the late 1950s, in which she played the part of Eleanor, one of three daughters of the town millionaire, Lloyd Abbott. About her performance, {{director}} Ron Howard said, [...] "She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity. She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> stored that information {{in the back of my}} brain".|$|E

500|$|... "The song is sort {{of about}} transformation, so I took that in a nature kind of way, the way nature deals with transformation. It's {{basically}} about coming from a very poisoned place to an empowerment, a place of strength. I've always had this fear of moths, and I subconsciously wrote this thing with these moths in it, so <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> {{have to deal with}} it. They're furry and they carry dust. I found out in old mythology they are supposed to represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E
500|$|Grigorieva {{had signed}} with Gibson's music label {{prior to the}} album's release. The music project {{was made by the}} film {{production}} company Icon Entertainment, owned by Gibson. She wrote all of the songs on the album, and received a credit as producer with Gibson listed as executive producer. Grigorieva explained the choice of title for the album, in an interview with IndieLondon, [...] "Well, one of the tracks on the album is called Beautiful Heartache ... everybody has a heartbreak {{at some point in their}} lives. It’s how you deal with it that’s important. So, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> was drawn to that notion for the album title." ...|$|E
500|$|In the former, {{the young}} man, Elmer Cowley, incited by an {{imagined}} slight ("He {{thought that the}} boy who passed and repassed Cowley & Son's store ...must be thinking of him and perhaps laughing at him" [...] when in reality, [...] " [...] had long been wanting {{to make friends with}} the young merchant...") tries twice to tell George off but is unable to communicate his feelings either time, finally physically assaulting the young reporter. The story ends with Cowley telling himself, [...] " [...] 'I showed him...I guess I showed him. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> showed him I ain't so queer", a proclamation obviously laced with dramatic irony.|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem says while the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> {{had to go to}} that place to get to this one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E
500|$|... "After a while I {{got sick}} of wearing tons of jewelry—I wanted to clean myself off. I see my new look as very {{innocent}} and feminine and unadorned. It {{makes me feel}} good. Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Everett True said in 1989, [...] "Nirvana songs {{treat the}} banal and {{pedestrian}} {{with a unique}} slant". Cobain {{came up with the}} basic components of each song (usually writing them on an acoustic guitar), as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl [...] "have a big part in deciding on how long a song should be and how many parts it should have. So I don't like to be considered the sole songwriter". When asked which part of the songs he would write first, Cobain responded, [...] "I don’t know. I really don't know. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> start with the verse and then go into the chorus".|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|Derulo {{explained}} {{that he did not}} believe in the possibility of [...] "It Girl" [...] to be the next single from Future History. However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation of who I am and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1962, after Hendrix was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I {{came out of that}} place with sixteen dollars left." [...] According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber: [...] "Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence." ...|$|E
