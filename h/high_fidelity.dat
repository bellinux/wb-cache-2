Alumni include Cyrus Vorhis, producer of Bulletproof Monk, Kung Fu Panda, Robin Hood and the Emmy-nominated miniseries Sleeper Cell and Todd Louiso, director of Love Liza and actor in Apollo 13, <b>High</b> <b>Fidelity</b> and other films. Andy Biersack, lead vocalist of Black Veil Brides also attended this school.|$|E
5|$|The NAD 3020 is {{an iconic}} stereo {{integrated}} amplifier by NAD Electronics, {{considered to be}} one of the most important components in the history of <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> audio. Launched circa 1978, this highly affordable product delivered a good quality sound, which acquired a reputation as an audiophile amplifier of exceptional value. By 1998, the NAD 3020 had become the most well known and best-selling audio amplifier in history.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} {{physical}} dividers between the sites occupied by individual oligonucleotides, {{a very limited}} space {{on the surface of}} the microarray (one oligonucleotide sequence occupies a square 25×25μm) and the requirement of <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> of oligonucleotide synthesis dictate the use of site-selective 5'-deprotection techniques. In one approach, the removal of the 5'-O-DMT group is effected by electrochemical generation of the acid at the required site(s). Another approach uses 5'-O-(α-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl) (MeNPOC) protecting group, which can be removed by irradiation with UV light of 365nm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{subwoofer}} enclosure {{made for}} home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45cm) driver to provide servo control {{information to the}} amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from <b>High</b> <b>Fidelity</b> magazine.|$|E
5|$|In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses {{because of}} a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To {{compensate}} for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes– the genome is split into smaller molecules– thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes because of the <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> of their replication enzymes. Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.|$|E

25|$|The {{complete}} technical {{disclosure of}} the Columbia LP by Peter C. Goldmark, Rene' Snepvangers and William S. Bachman in 1949 {{made it possible for}} a great variety of record companies to get into the business of making long playing records. The business grew quickly and interest spread in <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> sound and the do-it-yourself market for pickups, turntables, amplifier kits, loudspeaker enclosure plans, and AM/FM radio tuners. The LP record for longer works, 45rpm for pop music, and FM radio became <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> program sources in demand. Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales. The industry flourished.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of papillomaviruses {{is thought to}} be slow compared to many other virus types, but there are no experimental measurements currently available. This is probably because the papillomavirus genome is composed of genetically stable double-stranded DNA that is replicated with <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> by the host cell's DNA replication machinery.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{teleportation}} {{with additional}} a priori {{information about the}} input state achieves <b>higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> than teleportation of a completely unknown state. However, perfect teleporation of two nonorthogonal input states requires {{the same amount of}} entanglement as perfect teleportation of an unknown state, namely one ebit. We analyze how well two-state teleportation can be achieved using every degree of pure-state entanglement. We find the <b>highest</b> <b>fidelity</b> of "teleportation" that can be achieved with only classical communication but no shared entanglement.

40|$|Two ground {{simulation}} software {{are used to}} model the SMAP spacecraft dynamics. The CAST software uses a <b>higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> model than the ADAMS software. The ADAMS software models the spacecraft plant, controller and actuator models, and assumes a perfect sensor and estimator model. In this simulation study, the spacecraft dynamics results from the ADAMS software are used as CAST software is unavailable. The main source of spacecraft dynamics error in the <b>higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> CAST software {{is due to the}} estimation error. A signal generation model is developed to capture the effect of this estimation error in the overall spacecraft dynamics. Then, this signal generation model is included in the ADAMS software spacecraft dynamics estimate such that the results are similar to CAST. This signal generation model has similar characteristics mean, variance and power spectral density as the true CAST estimation error. In this way, ADAMS software can still be used while capturing the <b>higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> spacecraft dynamics modeling from CAST software...|$|R
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>Fidelity</b> premiered at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood. The post-party {{was held}} at the Sunset Room where Tenacious D performed.

25|$|Some synthetases also mediate a editing {{reaction}} to ensure <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> of tRNA charging. If the incorrect tRNA is added (aka. the tRNA {{is found to}} be improperly charged), the aminoacyl-tRNA bond is hydrolyzed.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} in breeding site fidelity {{and focused on}} Anseriformes, especially Anatidae. <b>Higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> ratio in females than in males is an interesting pattern of breeding site fidelity in this bird group.

This study is aimed at describing this phenomenon and discussion of factors affecting fidelity ratio. Among, the most important factors, {{the importance of the}} previous breeding success and environmental conditions is underlined.

In theory, the [...] "High Fidelity" [...] in VistaVision's trademark strongly implied high-fidelity sound, but, in reality, the system provided only <b>higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> Technicolor prints (after the 1955 revision of Technicolor's dye-transfer printing process), not <b>higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> sound.

25|$|In 1951, at the {{beginning}} of the post-World War II <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> (hi-fi) popularity, the Audio Engineering Society (AES) developed a standard playback curve.

This curve was defined by the time constants of audio filters and had a bass turnover of 400Hz and a 10,000Hz rolloff of −12dB.|$|E

A lower fidelity model is used to select specific samples to construct the decision boundary corresponding to a <b>higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> model. This selection is based on two schemes. The first scheme selects samples within an envelope constructed from the lower fidelity model. The second technique is based on the detection of regions of inconsistencies between the lower and the <b>higher</b> <b>fidelity</b> decision boundaries.
