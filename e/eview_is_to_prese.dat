40|$|Abstract The {{endothelium}} is {{now recognized}} as an endocrine organ that acts to maintain vascular homeostasis regulating the vascular tone and structure. The endothelial cells synthetize a variety of mediators among them, the main agent is the nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator. NO exerts its protective role preventing leukocyte adhesion and migration, expression of adhesion molecules, platelet aggregation, cell proliferation, and promoting the relaxation of smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, endothelial dysfunction present in many chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, is characterized by reduced NO bioavailability. Thus, a few decades ago, measurement of endothelial function has emerged as valuable tool that provides insights in the pathophysiological mechanisms, opportunity to identify early disease and cardiovascular risk, preventing future events or avoiding the progression of the disease. Diabetic patients, particularly, have <b>been</b> a target <b>to</b> apply this technique, mainly because this condition has been related with an impairment of endothelium-dependent dilation and {{it is believed that}} the endothelium dysfunction is the basis of diabetes complications such as coronary artery disease and accelerated atherosclerosis. In addition, cardiovascular complications represent the leading cause of morbidity and death in diabetes mellitus. Besides pharmacological therapy, lifestyle modifications have been recommended by specific organizations as a strategy to improve the endothelial function or even prevent the development of diabetes. The aim of this mini <b>eview</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> give an update about the importance of endothelium, most common non-invasive technique to evaluate its function, and to summarize some mechanisms involved in endothelial dysfunction and the beneficial effects of exercise in diabetes mellitus...|$|R

40|$|This study {{consists}} of examining {{the effects of}} inflation on unemployment in Cameroon. Beginning from the hypothesis which says inflation has {{a negative effect on}} unemployment, the Philips curve model <b>was</b> chosen <b>to</b> verify this hypothesis. From the results of this study, the anticipation errors influence negatively the evolution of unemployment rate in Cameroon in such away, if the inflation rate increases, the unemployment rate reduces. The reverse is true that is if the inflation reduces the unemployment rate increases. This negative relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate is witnessed in Cameroon like in the study carried out by Philips in (1958). but here the coefficient of anticipation errors is weak, so the degree of influence will also be weak. Economics agencies will find it difficult in capturing the effect of inflation on employment. The estimated equation gives the natural value of unemployment and the potential inflation rate. As concerns natural unemployment, it <b>is</b> estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 0. 6 % and the potential inflation rate <b>is</b> estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 21. 25 %. this means that if markets function normally, the unemployment rate in Cameroon will be 0. 6 % for 21. 25 % of inflation rate.

We begin with a discussion of the key empirical characteristics of financial data. Next, we formulate tests of standard asset pricing models in the framework of the general linear regression model. We then move on to a discussion of time series methods for modeling stationary data. We are then in a position to model the volatility in financial data. We observe volatility, particularly, in the returns on financial assets over short (weekly or daily) holding periods. Our focus will be on the ARCH/GARCH class of volatility models and on estimating models of time-varying risk premia in the stock and bond markets. We then briefly discuss time series methods for modeling non-stationary data. This will allow us to model long-run relationships between financial time series.
