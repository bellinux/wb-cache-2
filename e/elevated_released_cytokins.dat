40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} study was used to {{investigate}} flow and the dispersion of elevated emissions over and {{in the wake of}} both generic building groups and a real industrial site. Much research has been previously carried out on low level releases passing through extensive building arrays, but very little has treated <b>elevated</b> <b>releases.</b> The objective of the present research was to investigate the requirements of 'practical' models to predict dispersion from <b>elevated</b> <b>releases</b> above an industrial complex. The experiments were carried out in the EnFlo wind tunnel at the University of Surrey in simulated neutral and stable boundary layers at 1 : 500 scale. The behaviour of the mean flow and turbulence in array wakes was compared with predictions from an analytical, three dimensional, eddy viscosity model. The model was successful when arrays were aligned normal to the approach flow but, as it did not treat the secondary flows associated with roof vortex systems, it was not adequate for other wind directions. The measurements showed that when roof vortex systems were prominent they created strong mean streamline deflections downwards over the wake, leading to velocity excess rather than deficit within {{the central part of the}} wake. Diagonal wind directions produced the higher ground level concentrations, or the greater reduction in effective stack height, for all the building groups studied. This correlated well with the measured mean streamline deflections. Dispersion measurements in the stable boundary layer for releases below 1. 5 building heights were very similar to those made in the neutral boundary layer, but the building effect appeared larger in the stable boundary layer for the higher releases. This latter feature probably resulted from interactions with the boundary layer edge in the relatively shallow stable layer. Analysis of extensive measurements in the neutral boundary layer showed that a group of buildings could be adequately represented by a single, effective building of appropriate dimensions as far as the maximum ground level concentrations were concerned. However, the size of the effective building was a function of array orientation relative to the wind. Vertical plume spread in <b>elevated</b> <b>releases</b> was unaffected by the presence of the buildings. Streamline deflections or downwash, which caused the mean height of a plume to reduce, were the predominant cause of increased ground level concentrations in the array wakes. In situations where the plume was significantly entrained into the wake, the lateral plume spread was enhanced. A modified Gaussian plume model including downwash and enhanced lateral spread represented the resulting concentration field quite well...|$|R

30|$|The {{addition}} of Cd pigment to the samples {{in the present}} investigation {{does not lead to}} an <b>elevated</b> <b>release.</b> However, concerning the long-term behavior, it might be possible that Cd from artists’ paints is mobilized either by oxidation of sulfide to sulfate or by dissolution at lower pH values. The mobilized Cd (Cd 2 +) will then be transferred via the soil–plant pathway (intake by crops) or via the soil–water pathway leaching, i.e., the outflow of Cd from the top soil. The underlying processes are described in detail elsewhere [34]. In this paper, the behavior of Cd in soil was investigated. The quantity of Cd arising from artists’ paints calculated in the restriction dossier, amounting to 110  kg per year [17], is negligible compared to other sources of Cd to agricultural soils (almost 120 tons/a).|$|R

The approach is valid for homogeneous turbulence and for situations of uniform mean wind speed, and for practical purposes, to <b>elevated</b> <b>releases</b> that occur in neutral stability conditions without strong buoyancy. To simulate and compare the results of this approach against observed ground-level crosswind-integrated concentration two eddy diffusivities are considered. The first eddy diffusivity depends on the distance from the source while the second one assumes a constant value independent of the source distance.

40|$|Moraxella catarrhalis is {{the second}} most common cause of {{bacterial}} exacerbation of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Contrary to that fact, {{little is known about the}} interaction between this pathogen and the human bronchial epithelium. The present study analyses whether M. catarrhalis is able to evoke an inflammatory immune response in bronchial epithelial cells and which pattern recognition receptors, signal transduction pathways and other regulation mechanisms are involved in such a potential activation. The results of this study showed that an infection of human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS- 2 B) with M. catarrhalis induced a secretion of many different inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. In detailed investigation of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), it was found that M. catarrhalis induced a time- and dose-dependent secretion in these cells. Furthermore, M. catarrhalis-infected bronchial epithelial cells showed a clearly activation of the mitogen-activeted protein kinases (MAPK) ERK 1 / 2, p 38 and JNK as well as of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The inhibition of MAPK-phoshorylation of p 38 and ERK 1 / 2 and activation of NF-kappaB reduced the <b>cytokin</b> <b>release</b> by M. catarrhalis. Interestingly, M. catarrhalis of the cells, lead to a decrease in global histone deacetylase expression and activity which was associated with an augmented <b>cytokin</b> <b>release.</b> The toll-like receptors TLR 2 and TLR 4 are involved in lung epithelial cell response to M. catarrhalis and the specific M. catarrhalis Lipooligosaccharide has been identified as a TLR 4 ligand.

Sensitivity analyses have shown that, for an upwardly directed or <b>elevated</b> <b>release,</b> the trajectory taken can be sensitive to the correlations used for entrainment of air or for the rainout fraction. For example, with a high entrainment of air, the code may predict that the plume will be buoyant and follow an upward path, whereas with a lower value, a denser plume may result which will quickly fall to the ground, leading to qualitatively different results.

A bacterium isolated from a Demodex mite {{from a patient}} with papulopustular rosacea (PPR) was previously shown to provoke an immune response in patients with PPR or ocular rosacea thus suggesting a possible role for bacterial proteins in the etiology of this condition. Objectives: To examine the response of neutrophils to proteins derived from a bacterium isolated from a Demodex mite. Methods: Bacterial cells were lysed and proteins were partially purified by AKTA-FPLC. Isolated neutrophils were exposed to bacterial proteins and monitored for alterations in migration, degranulation and cytokine production.

40|$|The role of soluble receptors for TNF-α (sTNF-Rs) as {{markers of}} virus-induced host {{responses}} was studied {{by the use}} of murine model infections. A marked elevation in serum levels of sTNF-R 75, but not sTNF-R 55, was found 1 day after infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), an early increase was also revealed, but peak levels of sTNF-R 75 were observed later temporally related to maximal T cell-mediated anti-viral activity. Analysing different well characterized knockout mice, it was found that <b>elevated</b> <b>release</b> of sTNF-R 75 into serum early after VSV infection was independent of T cells, whereas interferon (IFN) -α/β seemed to be a major mediator. In contrast, increased release of sTNF-R 75 into serum 8 days post-LCMV infection was mediated via T cells but independently of both CD 40 ligand and IFN-γ. A simple correlation between release of sTNF-Rs in vivo and macrophage activation in vitro was not present.

METHODS: NG-nitro-L-arg inine methylester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of NO synthase, partially inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxation evoked in phenylephrine-precontracted rings by isoproterenol and abolished relaxation mediated by forskolin 0. 2 mumol L- 1. RESULTS: In rings without endothelium, isoproterenol and forskolin were less effective relaxants and L-NAME {{had no effect}} on the responses. In methylene blue-treated rings isoproterenol- and forskolin-induced relaxation were prevented in both endothelium-intact and -denuded rings, but the inhibitory effect of methylene blue were significantly more in rings with endothelium than in those without. On the other hand, relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside was not inhibited by L-NAME, but was inhibited by methylene blue in both the endothelium-intact and -denuded rings. The concentration-relaxation curves to sodium nitroprusside after methylene blue were identical for rings with and without endothelium.

40|$|Abstract. Brugia pahangi {{infection}} in the canine rear limb results in marked lymphatic duct and popliteal lymph node pathologic changes. Limb edema is variably associated with infection and does not correlate well with duct or node lesions. To understand the mechanisms of limb edema, lymph node cells were collected by sequential biopsy following infection and examined for production of inflammatory mediators. Lymph node cells from a litter of dogs selectively bred with {{a high incidence of}} edema formation (82 %) demonstrated spontaneously released histamine and prostaglandin E 2 levels higher than those of closely related nonedema-forming dogs (0 – 20 %) and/or control dogs. These edema-forming dogs also showed <b>elevated</b> <b>release</b> of tumor necrosis factor-a when cells were cultured with Brugia antigen. Toluidine blue staining of infected lymph node sections revealed that the edema-forming dogs had higher numbers of mast cells than infected lymph nodes of nonedema-forming dogs. Our earlier studies of dogs infected in lymph ducts affer-ent to the popliteal lymph node and in the capsule of the node itself with Brugia pahangi showed marked changes in lymphatic duct structure that included dilation and rechan-nelization, as well as variable loss of function as indicated by dye leakage from ducts.

We show here that synapses displaying an increased strength either after posttetanic potentiation (PTP) or through {{activation of the}} phospholipase-C-diacylglycerol pathway share characteristic properties with intrinsically strong synapses, such as (i) pronounced short-term depression (STD) during high-frequency stimulation; (ii) a conversion of that STD into a sequence of facilitation followed by STD after a few conditioning stimuli at low frequency; (iii) an equalizing effect of such conditioning stimulation, which reduces differences among synapses and abolishes potentiation; and (iv) a requirement of long periods of rest for reconstitution of the original STP pattern. These phenomena are quantitatively described by assuming that {{a small fraction of}} "superprimed" synaptic vesicles {{are in a state of}} <b>elevated</b> <b>release</b> probability (p ∼ 0. 5). This fraction is variable in size among synapses (typically about 30 %), but increases after application of phorbol ester or during PTP. The majority of vesicles, released during repetitive stimulation, have low release probability (p ∼ 0. 1), are relatively uniform in number across synapses, and are rapidly recruited. In contrast, superprimed vesicles need several seconds to be regenerated. They mediate enhanced synaptic strength at the onset of burst-like activity, the impact of which is subject to modulation by slow modulatory transmitter systems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{investigated}} {{the role of}} neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. A fluorometric assay was developed for the in vitro quantification of NET release and used to assess relative levels in chronic periodontitis patients, indicating <b>elevated</b> <b>release</b> under several stimulatory conditions compared with controls. Studies also demonstrated that challenge with periodontitis-associated bacteria evoked differential NET release. In addition, an extensive panel of periodontal pathogens was screened for two potential virulence traits that may confer a survival advantage when challenged with NETs. Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) secretion, capable of degrading NETs, and resistance to killing by histone, a core structural and antimicrobial protein within NETs, were both shown to be relatively common characteristics possessed by pathogens associated with severe disease. Additionally, an in vivo study demonstrated DNase activity in plaque and GCF during the development of experimental gingivitis. Further studies examined the association between neutrophil reactive oxygen species production and NET release implicating a regulatory role for myeloperoxidase generated hypochlorous acid in NET production. In conclusion, the results contained within this thesis indicate a putative role for NETs in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and highlight a high prevalence of potential counter-NET mechanisms in certain periodontal organisms.

This project investigated the nutrient release from two soils, one disturbed and one undisturbed.

It is still unclear whether loss of glucose homeostasis in these patients (partly) results from a dysregulation of beta cells. This study examines HADHSC expression in purified rat beta cells and investigates whether its selective suppression <b>elevates</b> insulin <b>release.</b> Beta cells expressed the highest levels of HADHSC mRNA and protein of all examined tissues, including those with high rates of mitochondrial beta-oxidation. On the other hand, beta cells expressed relatively low levels of other beta-oxidation enzymes (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short, medium, and long chain and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2). HADHSC expression was sequence-specifically silenced by RNA interference, and the effects were examined on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion following 48 - 72 h of suppression. In both rat beta cells and in the beta cell line INS 1 832 - 13, HADHSC silencing resulted in <b>elevated</b> insulin <b>release</b> at low and at high glucose concentrations, which appeared not to be caused by increased rates of glucose metabolism or an inhibition in fatty acid oxidation. These data indicate that the normal beta cell phenotype is characterized by a high expression of HADHSC and a low expression of other beta-oxidation enzymes.

Transcripts of LjEβOS were induced in L. japonicus plants infested with two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae), coinciding with increasing emissions of (E) -β-ocimene {{as well as other}} volatiles, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate and (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene, by the infested plants.

Administration of human recombinant ICAM- 1 in BV 2 cells and wild-type mice brains induced NEP expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In co-culturing with BV 2 cells under Aβ 42 exposure, knockdown of ICAM- 1 expression on hUCB-MSCs by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the induction of NEP in BV 2 cells as well as reduction of added Aβ 42 in the co-cultured media. By contrast, siRNA-mediated inhibition of the sICAM- 1 receptor, lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1), on BV 2 cells reduced NEP expression by ICAM- 1 exposure. When hUCB-MSCs were transplanted into the hippocampus of a 10 -month-old transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease for 10, 20, or 40 days, NEP expression was increased in the mice brains. Moreover, Aβ 42 plaques in the hippocampus and other regions were decreased by active migration of hUCB-MSCs toward Aβ deposits.

The addition of a selective COX- 2 inhibitor SC- 58635 and COX- 2 gene knock down with the siRNA blocked ET- 18 -O-CH 3 -induced apoptosis, suggesting that COX- 2 induction by this drug is causally linked to its apoptosis inducing activity.

ET- 18 -O-CH 3 treatment resulted in <b>elevated</b> <b>release</b> of 15 d-PGJ 2 and DNA binding and transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Based on these findings, it is likely that ET- 18 -O-CH 3 induces COX- 2 expression and production of 15 d-PGJ 2 which may mediate the ET- 18 -O-CH 3 -induced apoptosis in MCF 10 A-ras cells...|$|R
40|$|Anisakiasis is a {{zoonosis}} due {{to infection}} with the nematode Anisakis (A.) simplex. Humans represent an accidental host after ingesting raw fish infected with A. simplex. A. simplex larvae {{lead to a}} robust host immune response mostly at gastro-intestinal level and, usually, T helper (h) 2 lymphocytes play a protective against this nematode. However, larvae can elude immunity triggering activation of T regulatory (Treg) cells, which, in turn, suppress Th 2 responses via production of interleukin (IL) - 10. According to our own experience {{in the area of}} Bari (south Italy) where anisakiasis is endemic, chronic urticaria (CU) is very often associated to A. simplex infection. The cytokine profile in CU patients with Anisakis infection is characterized by an <b>elevated</b> <b>release</b> of interferon-γ and IL- 17, while IL- 10 production is very low. This pattern of pro-inflammatory cytokine response was consistently detectable in patients who underwent a raw fish free diet regimen over a period of six months. In the light of the above considerations, we hypothesize that treating these patients with polyphenols it may be beneficial in terms of activation of Treg cell function. In fact, polyphenols have the capacity to expand Treg cell response in vitro. In this regard, activation of human Treg cells, by analogy to other helminthiasis, may lead to a reduction of allergic/inflammatory reaction in the course of human anisakiasis...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of the immunological cascades of the innate immune system activated by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) have allowed the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory properties of adjuvants. Thus, the combinatorial use of adjuvants with specific, complementary functions is investigated to achieve tailored immune responses to subunit vaccines. We have previously shown how combinatorial administration of chitosan and cholera toxin B or muramyl-di-peptide (MDP) intranasally, but not intramuscularly, can allow small doses of MDP which, when administered alone cannot adjuvantise Helicobacter pylori urease (rUre), achieve an immunomodulatory effect through the specific physiological effect of chitosan. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if in the context of rUre the adjuvantising effect of MDP could be realized via the intramuscular route by combination with aluminium hydroxide, as compared with the routinely used veterinary adjuvant combination of alum and Quil-A. Serum IgG kinetics were comparable between the two adjuvant combination groups. However, the alum + MDP combination afforded higher antigen-specific recall responses in splenocyte cultures, associated with <b>elevated</b> <b>release</b> of the type I immune response cytokines IFN-gamma and IL- 2. This data suggests that the adjuvanticity of MDP can be modulated in the context of alum in a manner dissimilar to that of Quil-A, achieving a balancing effect on the responses elicited by alum adjuvantisation...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to quantify the net emissions of key greenhouse gases (GHG) - notably, CO{sub 2 } and CH{sub 4 } - from hydropower reservoirs in moist temperate areas within the U. S. The rationale for this objective is straightforward: if net emissions of GHG can be determined, it would be possible to directly compare hydropower to other power-producing methods on a carbon-emissions basis. Studies of GHG emissions from hydropower reservoirs elsewhere suggest that net emissions can be moderately high in tropical areas. In such areas, warm temperatures and relatively high supply rates of labile organic matter can encourage high rates of decomposition, which (depending upon local conditions) can result in <b>elevated</b> <b>releases</b> of CO{sub 2 } and CH{sub 4 }. CO{sub 2 } and CH{sub 4 } emissions also tend to be higher for younger reservoirs than for older reservoirs, because vegetation and labile soil organic matter that is inundated when a reservoir is created can continue to decompose for several years (Galy-Lacaux et al. 1997, Barros et al. 2011). Water bodies located in climatically cooler areas, such as in boreal forests, could be expected to have lower net emissions of CO{sub 2 } and CH{sub 4 } because their organic carbon supplies tend to be relatively recalcitrant to microbial action and because cooler water temperatures are less conducive to decomposition...|$|R
