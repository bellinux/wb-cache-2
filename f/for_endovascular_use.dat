40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} {{technique}} <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> treatment <b>using</b> a fenestrated stent-graft {{in a patient}} with ascending aortic rupture {{in the setting of}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Case Report: A 62 -year-old woman had undergone mastectomy and radiotherapy twice for breast cancer and then coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She developed sternal osteomyelitis 5 years after the CABG. Sternectomy and negative-pressure wound drainage were performed, but the infection did not resolve. Ascending aortic rupture occurred 5 months after sternectomy. Endovascular therapy was considered the only effective means of achieving hemostasis. A custom-designed fenestrated stent-graft was deployed from the ascending aorta to the proximal descending aorta via a femoral artery approach without transient cardiac arrest. Bleeding completely stopped after surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the inflammatory activity subsided on antibiotic therapy. At 7 months after surgery, the patient’s recovery has been uneventful. Conclusion: Rupture of the ascending aorta associated with infection was successfully treated by stent-graft repair. The use of a custom-made, fenestrated stent-graft was an effective, lifesaving procedure for the management of this ascending aortic lesion.

40|$|AbstractObjectives to {{evaluate}} the intra- and interobserver variability in measurements of the aorta and iliac arteries in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) considered <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair <b>using</b> computed tomography angiography (CTA). Methods {{the diameter of the}} neck, aneurysm, right and left iliac artery were measured by 5 observers in 10 consecutive patients. Measurements were performed on hard copy using a ruler and on a workstation using an electronic calliper. Results the intraobserver variability showed a decrease going from hard copy to workstation in the standard deviation of the differences of the paired observations for the neck from 3. 54 mm to 1. 18 mm; for the aorta from 4. 16 to 1. 72 mm; for the right iliac from 1. 87 to 1. 01 mm; for the left iliac from 2. 07 to 0. 87 mm. The interobserver variability showed a similar decrease for the neck in all ten pairs of observers; for the aorta in two, for the right iliac and left iliac in five. However, the difference between observers regularly exceeded 2 mm. Conclusion the use of a workstation and electronic callipers results in lower intra- and interobserver variability. However, the results still show a clinically relevant difference between the observers. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automatic observer-independent measurement technique...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{define the}} {{reproducibility}} of a protocol {{for the analysis}} of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) morphology for clinical and research purposes. Methods: A protocol for the comprehensive assessment of preoperative AAA morphology based on formal systematic review and expert opinion featured 114 morphological parameters (maximum and minimum diameters, cross-sectional areas, vessel lengths, volumes, angulation, and calcification and tortuosity indices) in each of 3 regions: the neck, sac, and access vessels. To validate the protocol, 4 observers measured these variables on the preoperative computed tomographic angiograms from 50 patients (45 men; mean age 75 years, range 52 – 89) scheduled <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> aneurysm repair <b>using</b> software for 3 -dimensional image reconstruction. One observer performed repeated measurements. The intra- and interobserver variabilities were calculated for all parameters; measurement time for all 114 features was recorded.

Feasibility of coiling depended on the judgment of the interventionist based on DSA, or the actual suitability during a coiling attempt. For CTA and MRA two experienced neuroradiologists determined the presence of an aneurysm and judged suitability <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> treatment <b>using</b> common criteria, like dome-to-neck ratio and absence of branches originating {{from the base of the}} aneurysm. The observers were blinded to the results of other imaging examinations. Pooled sensitivity of CTA for the detection of aneurysms was 91.5  % (95  % CI, 85.0 – 95.5) and specificity was 94.4  % (95  % CI, 79.0 – 99.0). Pooled sensitivity of MRA for the detection of aneurysms was 95.4  % (95  % CI, 89.8 – 98.1) and specificity was 83.3  % (95  % CI, 66.5 – 93.0).

40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} {{technique}} <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> treatment <b>using</b> Zenith aortic cuff extenders delivered via a left common carotid artery (CCA) approach {{in a patient}} with a large symptomatic ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm. Case Report: A 78 -year-old man with recent stroke developed worsening exertional dyspnea and chest pain 4 years following coronary artery bypass grafting. Imaging demonstrated a bovine arch and an 8 - 312 -cm ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm that was compressing the pulmonary arteries. The treatment strategy was to deliver a Zenith aortic cuff to seal the ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm via a left CCA approach. With the patient under general anesthesia, the left CCA was exposed and a transverse arteriotomy was made to introduce the Zenith aortic cuff sheath; the distal CCA was clamped to prevent catheter-related embolization. With its nosecone removed, a 32 - 336 -mm Zenith aortic cuff was delivered to the ascending aorta via the left CCA and positioned under transient cardiac arrest initiated with intravenous adenosine. A total of 3 Zenith aortic cuffs {{were placed in the}} ascending aorta to successfully exclude the pseudoaneurysm. The patient tolerated the procedure well; follow-up imaging showed successful pseudoaneurysm exclusion without endoleak. Conclusion: Ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm is a formidable clinical challenge {{due in part to the}} significant operative stress in a conventional surgical repair, as well as limited endovascular treatment options. Because there are no approved <b>endovascular</b> devices <b>for</b> ascending aortic aneurysm repair, clinicians may have to rely on endograft components designed for abdominal aortic aneurysms to treat lesions in the ascending aorta.

However, stabilization and optimal shaping of microcatheters are sometimes difficult. Our {{aim was to}} introduce “tailor-made” microcatheter shapes for coil embolization using three-dimensional (3 D) printed vessel models. MethodSince August 2014, we have been investigating the use of 3 D printed models of intracranial arterial aneurysms to produce optimally shaped microcatheters <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> coil embolization. <b>Using</b> Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine data obtained from preoperative cerebral angiography, a vessel model was produced with a 3 D printer using acrylic resin. Preoperative planning of microcatheter navigation and shaping were performed using the 3 D vessel models. Before the procedure, microcatheter mandrels were bent manually to the intended angle, referring to the vessel model, and then sterilized. The 3 D vessel models were also sterilized with plasma and used during the procedure. ResultsTwenty-six patients (27 aneurysms) were treated using a total of 48 microcatheters shaped while referring to the 3 D printed vessel model. Of the 48 catheters, only 9 (19 %) required modification of the initial shape due to inappropriate positioning of the catheter. Only 29 % of the catheter placements required repositioning due to catheter kick back. There were no procedure-related complications, including aneurysm rupture. The responses from assistants to a questionnaire administered after the embolizations on {{the usefulness of the}} technique were favorable. ConclusionsTailor-made shaping of microcatheters may facilitate easier and safer procedures in coil embolization of intracranial aneurysm...|$|R
40|$|Between 1995 and 2005, {{the number}} of aortic aneurysms treated {{annually}} <b>using</b> <b>endovascular</b> techniques (EVAR) increased from 0 to 50, including all aortic stages. Our organization includes a large team of surgeons, a stock of three complete families of endoprostheses (straight, conical and bifurcated), a mobile trolley with accessories (arterial introducer/introducer sheath, guide wire, catheters, balloons, etc.) and an appliance on wheels for intravascular ultrasound examination (IVUS).

Presentation of case: A 78 -year-old male presented with a 20 -hour history of abdominal pain, secondary to a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) thromboembolic occlusion diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) angiography. Following confirmation of bowel viability at laparotomy, <b>endovascular</b> intervention <b>using</b> combined thrombolysis, angioplasty and thromboaspiration was performed.

Discussion: We discuss the role of biphasic CT in diagnosis of AMI, and review the evidence <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> interventions now increasingly used in the emergent management of thromboembolic AMI. Conclusion: Early diagnosis using CT angiography is essential, as it is highly sensitive in detecting a visceral arterial occlusion.

40|$|Currently, two {{treatment}} options for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are available: conventional open surgical repair and endovascular minimally invasive repair.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} anatomical suitability {{and application}} rate <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair {{of patients with}} a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA). METHODS: The Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm trial is a multicenter randomised trial comparing open with endovascular treatment in patients with a RAAA (International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) 66212637). Between April 2004 and January 2006, all consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of a RAAA at presentation were assessed prospectively. Anatomical suitability <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair was based on use of an aorto-uni-iliac endovascular graft and assessed in patients with a proven aortic rupture on CT angiography (CTA). RESULTS: In 128 / 256 patients, presenting with clinical suspicion of a ruptured aneurysm, RAAA was diagnosed. 105 patients were brought to a trial center and CTA confirmed RAAA in 83 patients. In 38 of 83 patients (45. 8 %) with positive CTA, the anatomy of the aorta and iliac arteries was considered suitable <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair. Exclusion from endovascular repair was due to unsuitable infrarenal neck or iliac anatomy (37 and 8 patients respectively). Overall, endovascular treatment was applicable in 38 / 128 patients (29. 7 %) with a RAAA in the Amsterdam region and in 38 out of 105 patients (35. 5 %) admitted to the trial centers. CONCLUSION: In this prospective cohort of all patients with a RAAA in the Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm Trial region, the suitability <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair in patients with a RAAA confirmed on CTA is 45. 8 %, but the application rate was lowe...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundPenetrating {{injuries}} to the axillary and subclavian vessels {{are a source}} of significant morbidity and mortality. Although the endovascular repair of such injuries has been increasingly described, an algorithm <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> versus conventional surgical repair has yet to be clearly defined. On the basis of institutional endovascular experience treating vascular injuries in other anatomic locations, we defined an algorithm for the management of axillosubclavian vascular injuries. Subsequently, a near decade long experience with the management of axillosubclavian vascular injuries was retrospectively analyzed, so as to more accurately assess the true feasibility of endovascular treatment in these patients. MethodsWe defined a management algorithm that included (1) indications, (2) relative contraindications, and (3) strict contraindications <b>for</b> the <b>endovascular</b> repair of axillosubclavian vascular injuries. Anatomic indications <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair were restricted to relatively limited axillosubclavian injuries (pseudoaneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas, first-order branch vessel injuries, intimal flaps, and focal lacerations). Relative contraindications <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair included injury to the axillary artery’s third portion, substantial venous injury (eg, transection), refractory hypotension, and upper extremity compartment syndrome with neurovascular compression. Strict contraindications to endovascular repair included long segmental injuries, injuries without sufficient proximal or distal vascular fixation points, and subtotal/total arterial transection. Within the context of these definitions, we retrospectively reviewed 46 noniatrogenic subclavian and axillary vascular injuries in 45 patients identified by a prospectively maintained computer registry during a 9 -year period. Presentations were reviewed concurrently by two endovascular surgeons, and potential candidates <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> management were defined. ResultsAmong 46 total case presentations and among the 40 patients who maintained vital signs on presentation, 17 were potentially treatable with endovascular therapy. Among the cohort of 40 presentations, the most common contraindications to endovascular therapy were hemodynamic instability (n = 10), vessel transection (n = 7), and no proximal vascular fixation site (n = 3). ConclusionsDespite growing enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair of {{injuries to}} the axillary and subclavian vessels, realistic clinical presentation and anatomic locations restrict the broad application of this technique at present. In our experience, less than but approaching 50 % of all injuries encountered could be addressed with an endovascular approach.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{survival}} and outcomes of endovascular versus open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in New York State (NYS). MethodsWe used the NYS discharge dataset Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) to analyze the outcomes of elective admission for nonruptured (International Classification of Diseases– 9 th revision [ICD- 9] 441. 4) open aneurysm repair (38. 44) and endovascular aneurysm repair (39. 71) during the years 2000 - 2002. The ICD- 9 code <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair was introduced in late 2000, thus capturing 3 months of empiric data for 2000. ResultsThere has been a significant increase in the number of AAA procedures performed in NYS (comparing before and after 2000 : average, 1419 vs 1701; P =. 0001), temporally coinciding with the implementation of training programs after US Food and Drug Administration approval of endovascular grafts and the new payment code. From 2000 to 2002 the number of NYS hospitals performing endovascular repairs increased from 24 to 60. By 2002 there were more endovascular repairs being performed than open repairs (871 vs 783). The target population for these surgical interventions showed interesting differences. In 2002, women had a 43 % chance of receiving an endograft, whereas men had a 55 % probability. The <b>use</b> of <b>endovascular</b> repair over the observation period was relatively constant in patients younger than 65 years. In patients older than 65 years, and especially those older than 75 years, <b>endovascular</b> <b>use</b> increased substantially, so that by 2002 older patients were more likely to undergo endovascular repair than open repair. Patients who underwent endovascular repair had significantly more hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia than did patients who underwent open repair. Yet the mean length of stay <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> procedures was approximately 3. 6 days, and for open procedures was about 10. 3 days, across all 3 years (P = <. 0001). Moreover, patients who underwent endovascular repair had statistically fewer postoperative complications and significantly lower mortality. In-hospital mortality in 2001 was 3. 55 % for open repair and 1. 14 % <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair (P =. 0018), and in 2002 these rates were 4. 21 % versus 0. 8 % (P <. 0001), respectively. ConclusionThis dataset suggests that endovascular AAA repairs are being performed in a patient poplation with a higher frequency of comorbidities. However, endovascular repairs still are associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality, fewer postoperative complications, and a dramatically shorter length of stay. These results suggest that, despite the rapid diffusion of this new technique, early perioperative outcomes may be superior to those with conventional open repair. However, prospective clinical studies are needed to confirm these insights, and such studies may require the infrastructure of consortia of hospitals or society-based registries...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{patients}} with large abdominal aortic aneurysms, randomized trials have shown an initial overall survival benefit <b>for</b> elective <b>endovascular</b> repair over conventional open repair. This survival difference, however, {{was no longer}} significant {{in the second year}} after the procedure. Information regarding the comparative outcome more than 2 years after surgery is important for clinical decision making. METHODS: We conducted a long-term, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing open repair with endovascular repair in 351 {{patients with}} an abdominal aortic aneurysm of at least 5 cm in diameter who were considered suitable candidates for both techniques. The primary outcomes were rates of death from any cause and reintervention. Survival was calculated with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 178 patients to undergo open repair and 173 to undergo endovascular repair. Six years after randomization, the cumulative survival rates were 69. 9 % for open repair and 68. 9 % <b>for</b> <b>endovascular</b> repair (difference, 1. 0 percentage point; 95 % confidence interval [CI], - 8. 8 to 10. 8; P= 0. 97).
