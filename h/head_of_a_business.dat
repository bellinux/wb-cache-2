50|$|Most women {{belonged to}} the peasantry, and worked {{alongside}} their husbands doing agricultural work. Women were known to manage farms or businesses {{in the absence of}} their husbands or sons. Among the upper classes of society, a woman usually did not work outside the home, and instead supervised the servants of the household and her children's education. Women belonging to families wealthy enough to hire nannies to help with childcare frequently worked as perfume-makers, and also were employed in courts and temples, as acrobats, dancers, singers, and musicians, which were all considered respectable pursuits for upper-class women. Women belonging to any class could work as professional mourners or musicians, and these were common jobs. Noblewomen could be members of the priesthood connected to either a god or goddess. Women could even be at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> as, for example, the lady Nenofer of the New Kingdom, and could also be a doctor, like the lady Peseshet during the Fourth dynasty of Egypt.|$|E

In the first two volumes of the series, L'héritier and Le Groupe W, Largo, a young and handsome orphan, is propelled to the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> empire, Group W, after his adoptive father Nerio is murdered, and goes through a lot of troubles to preserve his inheritance and avenge Nerio. The following albums are more or less based on the same basic plot: someone is trying to harm Largo's company or to take control of it from him, and he has to fight that someone to ensure the survival of his holdings. Almost every story arc involves corrupt authority figures of a type which Nerio easily manipulated, but Largo confronts from the viewpoint of an [...] "everyman".|$|E

An acutely gifted classicist, {{he came to the}} <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> that was successful in traditional terms but now moved into uncharted terrain. By themselves, specialist academic works and the undependable bible trade could not meet the rising costs of the Dictionary and Press contributions to the University Chest. To meet these demands, OUP needed much more revenue. Cannan set out to obtain it. Outflanking university politics and inertia, he made Frowde and the London office the financial engine for the whole business. Frowde steered Oxford rapidly into popular literature, acquiring the World's Classics in 1906. The same year saw him enter into a so-called [...] "joint venture" [...] with Hodder & Stoughton to help with the publication of children's literature and medical books. Cannan insured continuity to these efforts by appointing his Oxford protégé, the Assistant Secretary Humphrey S. Milford, to be Frowde's assistant. Milford became Publisher when Frowde retired in 1913, and ruled over the lucrative London business and the branch offices that reported to it until his own retirement in 1945. Given the financial health of the Press, Cannan ceased to regard scholarly books or even the Dictionary as impossible liabilities. [...] "I do not think the University can produce enough books to ruin us," [...] he remarked.|$|E

60|$|I will confess, however, that I have no very full {{sympathy with}} the new Anti-Semitism which is merely Anti-Socialism.

In other words, I have much more sympathy for the Israelite we are beginning to reject, than for the Israelite we have already accepted. I have more respect for him when he leads some sort of revolt, however narrow and anarchic, against the oppression of the poor, than when he is safe at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great money-lending <b>business</b> oppressing the poor himself. It is not the poor aliens, but the rich aliens I wish we had excluded. I myself wholly reject Bolshevism, not because its actions are violent, but because its very thought is materialistic and mean. And if this preference is true even of Bolshevism, it is ten times truer of Zionism. It really seems to me rather hard that the full storm of fury should have burst about the Jews, at the very moment when some of them at least have felt the call <b>of</b> <b>a</b> far cleaner ideal; and that when we have tolerated their tricks with our country, we should turn on them precisely when they seek in sincerity for their own.|$|R

Additional materials about the Rosenbloom family {{are available in the}} Rosenbloom Family Collection, AR 11136. Joan Adams, née Bloch, was born in 1932, as one of three children of Beatrice Exstein and Henry R. Bloch. The Einstein family was born in Buttenwiesen, in Bavaria (Germany). Samuel Einstein and Babette Sänger lived there with five children: Simon, Rudolph, Abraham, Hannah and Elias. Four of Samuel’s und Babette’s children moved to the United States {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. After their arrival in New York or Philadelphia the Einsteins established themselves in Macron, Georgia. In 1959 Abraham and Elias were involved in the founding of the congregation Temple Beth Israel in Macron, and Elias became its first president. Henry Exstein was born in Reckendorf (Germany) in 1811. One of his four children was Hiram Exstein (1844 - 1915). Hiram had seven children with Julia Abrams. One of these children was Henry L. Exstein (1876 - 1958), who married Beulah Einstein in 1905. The wedding of Beulah Einstein, Joan Adams’s grandmother, and Henry L. Exstein connects the history of the Einstein family and the Exstein family. Beulah Einstein lived from 1881 to 1974. Henry L. and Beulah had two children: Beatrice (1906 - 1974) and Henry L. Jr. (1908 - 1979). Beatrice married Henry R. Bloch and they had three children, Barbara, Joan and Henry R. Jr. The ancestors of the Bloch family lived in Germany. In 1928 Beatrice Exstein married Henry R. Bloch, the son of Bertha Rosenbloom’s (1877 - 1934) and Moses G. Bloch’s (1865 - 1952). Moses G. had six siblings. His father had moved from Hechingen (Germany) to Valparaiso (Indiana) in 1860 and twenty years later from Valparaiso to Toledo (Ohio). Moses G. Bloch (1865 - 1952) married Bertha Rosenbloom. She was born in 1878 and was the daughter of Marcus Rosenbloom (1849 - 1919) and Rosa Rosenbloom (née Kohn) (1855 - 1940). Marcus and Rosa lived in Syracuse (New York), where Marcus had a firm called ‘Rosenbloom & Sons’. Marcus was born in Syracuse, the son of Solomon (possibly Solamon) Rosenbloom (1822 - 1896) and Hannah Rosenbloom (1827 - 1884), born in Geroldshausen, Bavaria (Germany). Solomon and Hannah immigrated to the United States from Bavaria, Germany, in 1846. Solomon became <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> family <b>business</b> in Syracuse.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to add to our {{knowledge}} of the composition and exercise of management control systems (MCSs). The study focused on a Thai-owned chicken processing company in Thailand. Although most previous studies on MCSs have examined the use of MCSs as developed in mainly English-speaking countries in the West, there are some studies set in emerging economies in South and Southeast Asia around Thailand. These have found <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> factors that affect the composition and exercise of MCSs. These factors include national culture, employers’ and employees’ demographic characteristics, ethnic tensions, political intervention, and liberalisation and privatisation. Thailand was chosen for this study because the author is Thai and because few previous studies had been done about Thailand. Thailand has been influenced significantly by Western ideas but differs from many of its South and Southeast Asian neighbours, such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, in having maintained a much greater degree of formal political autonomy than these countries. Its national culture differs from these neighbouring places. The researcher took an ethnographic approach to her study. Empirical materials were collected about the Saha Farms Company, <b>a</b> large family <b>business,</b> with the cooperation of the owners, including the founder, who is still the chairman. Methods included non-participant observation, semi-structured and unstructured interviews, examination of documents, such as websites, newspapers and graduation booklets, and informal social contacts, such as conversations over a meal. The materials were interpreted to obtain <b>an</b> in-depth knowledge <b>of</b> the social life that underpins MCSs exercised in the Company. The findings indicate that some factors from previous studies, namely national culture and demographic characteristics, are relevant to the Saha Farms Company’s MCSs. They also indicate that other factors not identified in previous studies are important; for example, being <b>a</b> family <b>business,</b> competition in the markets for labour and custom, and labour laws have influenced and shaped the Company’s MCSs. All <b>of</b> these reflect <b>a</b> Thai culture that is unique, unspoilt by European colonialism, and still rooted in three fundamentals, namely the nation, Buddhism and the monarchy. Conversely other factors found in previous studies, such as ethnic tensions, political intervention, and liberalisation and privatisation, seem not to be relevant in the Saha Farms Company. The findings of this research could be extended further in future research to obtain <b>a</b> broader picture <b>of</b> MCSs in use in Thailand. For example, these findings could be compared with the MCSs in <b>a</b> Thai family <b>business</b> in which the founder is no longer involved. <b>A</b> Thai non-family <b>business</b> and <b>a</b> Thai subsidiary or Thai <b>head</b> office <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international <b>business</b> could be studied; or a company based in an urban area...|$|R
