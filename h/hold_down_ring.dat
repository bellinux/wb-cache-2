40|$|The {{effect of}} {{friction}} at {{the connection of}} the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) aft skirt and the mobile launch platform (MLP) <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> posts was analyzed. A simplified model of the shuttle response during the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) buildup was constructed. The model included the effect of stick-slip friction for {{the rotation of the}} skirt about the spherical bearing. Current finite element models assume the joint is completely frictionless in rotation and therefore no moment is transferred between the skirt and the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> posts. The model was partially verified against test data and preliminary parameter studies were performed. The parameter studies indicated that the coefficient of friction strongly influenced the moment on the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> posts. The coefficient of friction had little effect on <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> post vertical loads, however. Further calibration of the model is necessary before the effect of friction on the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> post horizontal loads can be analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Källsner and Girhammar [1] have {{presented}} a new plastic design method for wood-framed shear walls at ultimate limit state. This method allows the designer {{to calculate the}} load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading stud is not anchored against uplift. The anchorage system of shear walls is provided by anchor bolts in the bottom rail and <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> at the leading stud. Anchor bolts provide horizontal shear continuity between the bottom rail and the foundation. <b>Hold</b> <b>downs</b> are directly connecting the vertical leading stud to the foundation. Sometimes <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> are not provided and only the bottom rail is anchored to the substrate. In this case the bottom row of nails transmits the vertical forces in the sheathing to the bottom rail (instead of the stud) where the anchor bolts will further transmit the forces into the foundation. In this report <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> have been experimentally studied {{with respect to the}} strength and stiffness of the connection. Four different types of <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> have been tested. The specimen was subjected to tension load applied to the stud. Four tests series are presented. Each series was divided into different sets according to the type of fastener used with the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> device. The results show that the failure load is higher when <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> with anchor bolts are used, up to ten times higher than the anchorage that uses only screws or nails. The failure mode vary with the type of <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> and the type of fasteners used. The tests showed three primary failure modes: failure of the stud when a bolt is used as the fastener between <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> device and stud, failure due to pull-out of the screws or nails from the rail and failure due to failure or pull-out of screws or nails from stud. Also, failure of the stud itself occurred in some tests caused by some defect of the timberGodkänd; 2012; 20120116 (giucap...|$|R
