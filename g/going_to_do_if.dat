500|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan {{reviewed}} the episode for his website [...] "Heart of Stone". He {{felt that the}} main Odo/Kira plot was [...] "contrived" [...] in that the female Founder stole a Maquis ship {{and set up the}} entire situation simply to attempt to convince Odo to return to his people. He said that the Nog and Sisko plot was [...] "lightweight but amiable", and he gave the episode an overall score of 2.5 out of 4. Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for the website TrekNation, and also questioned the main plot. She wrote [...] "what was the shapeshifter <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> someone OTHER than Kira was in the runabout with Odo? Did she sit around and wait {{for the two of them}} to leave the station together?" [...] She had further concerns about the direction of the Odo and Kira relationship, and described the romance as a [...] "cop-out". She thought that Odo's declaration of his feelings felt forced, but that the plot featuring a crystal creature attacking a crew member reminded her of something from [...]|$|E
2500|$|As the {{television}} ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically {{during the fourth}} season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986â€“87 {{in a bid to}} win back viewers. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie [...] "Dishpan Man" [...] Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained {{for the duration of the}} fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of , and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season. [...] In what was supposed to be the final episode, [...] "The Grey Team" [...] (although [...] "Without Reservations" [...] was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses what they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team. [...] The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, [...] "fini".|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't {{know that}} they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this. <b>If</b> I had I'd have died before I'd have written that note," [...] he added rather lamely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>if</b> {{you really}} <b>do</b> {{make up your}} mind it is good-bye. I don't know what you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but <b>if</b> you're in the {{neighbourhood}} at any time come in and see us." ...|$|R

5000|$|Mellencamp {{wrote one}} song {{specifically}} for Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel, {{which is the}} exact room where Johnson recorded in November 1936. He told the San Antonio Express-News, [...] "It's called 'Right Behind Me' or 'Right Behind Us,' I haven't decided yet. I wrote it just for this room. I {{could have done this}} in my studio.

6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "No, Nettie; I behaved rudely to HIM. Yes! Besides, if he behaved rudely, {{he was no}} gentleman. It's {{a contradiction}} in terms, don't you see?

6000|$|... "So you are, my dear. If {{you were}} not {{it would not be}} well for you to do as you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> you were giddy and harum-scarum, and devoted to rank and wealth and that sort of thing, it would not be well for you to marry a {{commoner}} without fortune.

6000|$|Speaking in English to an English-speaking {{audience}} {{one name}} comes close upon the Bible, Shakespear.
