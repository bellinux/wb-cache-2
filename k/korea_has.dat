As of 2014, the country has nine cultural and one natural World Heritage Sites, with 15 added to the provisional list; and there are 17 items registered as UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{with the}} European Union in 2014 have {{increased}} both unions to pressure post-Soviet states {{to join their}} integration unions. Both sides have accused each other of carving spheres of influence. Members of the union, especially Russia have tried to diversify their trade by signing economic agreements with China, Iran and Turkey. Trade with North and South <b>Korea</b> <b>has</b> also risen.|$|E

5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North <b>Korea</b> <b>has</b> tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E
5|$|The CHA classifies {{cultural}} heritage into five major categories (state-designated heritage, city and province-designated heritage, {{cultural heritage}} material, registered cultural heritage, undesignated cultural heritage) {{and these are}} divided further into subcategories. Besides tangible cultural heritage, South Korea aims to preserve its intangible cultural heritage as well, including folk customs, music, dance and handicraft. The program also includes Living National Treasures, persons who possess {{the knowledge and skills}} important to pass down intangible cultural heritage to new generations. South <b>Korea</b> <b>has</b> founded several educational centers throughout the country and established a university, specifically dedicated to heritage preservation.|$|E
5|$|Being the South's {{first line}} of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in <b>Korea</b> <b>has</b> made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E

50|$|Since the Korean War (1950-1953), North and South <b>Korea</b> <b>have</b> confronted {{each other}} over the Korean Demilitarized Zone, with a {{permanent}} American garrison force situated in the south. Factual reporting can be a casualty of this cold war. Journalists and media experts in South <b>Korea</b> <b>have</b> concluded that political hostility distorts media coverage.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, South <b>Korea</b> <b>had</b> 9,063 ROTC cadets from 109 universities.|$|R
5|$|North <b>Korea</b> <b>has</b> set up {{specific}} government {{objectives for}} tobacco control {{and there is}} a national agency to implement them, with eight full-time staff members. Although there is no free of charge smoking cessation quitline that callers could phone and discuss their problems, most health-care facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and nicotine replacement therapy. Costs are covered for the patient partially or in full by the state. In addition to regular health-care clinics, there are 11 specialized anti-smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids.|$|E
5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South <b>Korea</b> <b>has</b> been the most {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film {{is based on a}} series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{relationship}} with South <b>Korea</b> <b>has</b> been strained due to Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly {{over the issue}} of comfort women. These women were essentially sex slaves, and although there is no exact number on how many women were subjected to this treatment, experts believe it could be in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Between 1910–1945, the Japanese government rebuilt Korean infrastructure, introduced over 800,000 Japanese immigrants onto the peninsula, and carried out a campaign of cultural suppression through efforts to ban the Korean language in schools and force Koreans to adopt Japanese names. With the surrender of Japan and the Axis at the end of WWII in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was once again independent. Despite their historical tensions, in December 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology, taking responsibility for the issue and paying money to the surviving comfort women. Today, South Korea and Japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship. Since the 1990s, the Korean Wave has created a large fanbase in East Asia, but most notably in Japan. Japan is the number one importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and films, but this was only made possible after the South Korean government lifted the 30-year ban on cultural exchange with Japan that had been in place since 1948. Korean pop cultural products' success in the Japanese market is partially explained by the borrowing of Japanese ideas such as the star-marketing system and heavy promotion of new television shows and music. Korean dramas such as Winter Sonata and Coffee Prince, as well as K-pop artists such as BIGBANG and SHINee are extremely popular with Japanese consumers. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2017 G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for North Korean aggression in the region. Both leaders restated their commitment to solving the comfort women dispute, building positive relations in the region, and pressuring China to be more assertive with North Korea as it continues to test nuclear weapons and isolate themselves further form the international community.|$|E
