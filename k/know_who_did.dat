5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

After Marty takes a forbidden bite from his sister Dara Lynn's chocolate Easter rabbit {{and refuses to}} own up, his mother is disappointed. She tells him: [...] "Dara Lynn don't know who ate the ear off her candy rabbit and I don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it, but Jesus knows. And right this minute Jesus is looking down with the saddest eyes on the person who ate that chocolate." [...] Marty's very religious mother teaches him that people should not sin or they will be [...] "separated forever from God's love." ...|$|E
500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "The Head and the Hair" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season 1 DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) is visibly upset that someone added paper in the regular garbage and demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it, as NBC recycles. Jack and Kenneth show up. Jack apologizes for throwing the paper in the regular garbage, which results in Pete telling him to go through the garbage by hand and [...] "fish out anything that's recyclable", as Jack is dressed as a page, in which he is participating on [...] "Bottoms Up" [...] day.|$|E

5000|$|Three other {{attacks on}} Indian {{settlements}} took place within two days: at the South Spit (Eureka), at South Fork Eel River (Rohnerville), and at Eagle Prairie (Rio Dell). Gunther said, [...] "It was never publicly <b>known</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the killing, yet secretly the parties were pointed out." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{first season}} of Veronica Mars {{features}} a different [...] "case of the week" [...] each episode, and the season-long mystery of Lilly Kane's murder. In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. Thomas said that at the beginning of the season, [...] "I know the broad strokes, I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it, I know how it was done, I know the big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to dole out to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1987, Bakshi set up {{a meeting}} with Judy Price, the head of CBS's Saturday morning block. Three days before the meeting, Bakshi, Kricfalusi, Naylor, Tom Minton, Eddie Fitzgerald and Jim Reardon met to brainstorm. Bakshi remembers, [...] "My car was packed to the windows. Judy was my last stop before driving cross country back to New York to my family." [...] Price {{rejected}} Bakshi's prepared pitches, but asked what else he had. He told her that he had the rights to Mighty Mouse, and she agreed to purchase the series. However, Bakshi did not own the rights and did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did.</b> While researching the rights, he learned that CBS had acquired the entire Terrytoons library in 1955 and forgotten about it. According to Bakshi, [...] "I sold them a show they already owned, so they just gave me the rights for nothin'!" ...|$|E
500|$|Santer {{explained}} that the killer [...] "may be revealed to the audience rather than the Square", preserving secrecy as the crew began filming episodes to be transmitted after the live broadcast. Actress Charlie Brooks, who plays Archie's former lover Janine Butcher, found the secrecy difficult to work with, explaining: [...] "In the episodes to be shown afterwards, you’re being told to look or speak a certain way, but not why." [...] Santer confirmed that the cast found the episode challenging, stating: [...] "They are as desperate to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it as the viewers", though believed they were all capable of coping with {{the pressure of the}} live episode. He {{explained that}} the cast typically film scenes in one take anyway, and observed that several EastEnders actors had formerly appeared in live broadcasts for other series. Cast members had just two dress rehearsals in advance of the live episode, and only one read-through of the entire episode.|$|E
5000|$|Kane {{interviewing}} for {{an article}} for Liberty (December 1938) told the interviewer that, [...] "Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it first. The credit always seemed {{to go to the}} inventor with the best publicity agent. The little man, too engrossed in his beloved work to advertise his exploits, was simply lost in the shuffle.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Edith, [...] "he has not confessed. But words {{drop from}} him which make us {{sure that he}} <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it. I am certain that he saw it done.

5000|$|People {{began to}} notice the {{graffiti}} appearing on walls all over downtown, recognizing the strange phrases, but no one <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> them. Basquiat and Diaz claimed they could sometimes do thirty on a busy day. Sometimes the SAMO© graffiti would refer to its own spread, as in a large, mural sized, multiple choice graffiti: ...|$|R
500|$|Plans to {{broadcast}} {{the first ever}} live episode of EastEnders were announced by the BBC on 15 September 2009. Santer initially refrained from discussing the episode's plot, but commented that it would resolve a [...] "big storyline" [...] which would [...] "keep the audience (as well as the cast and crew) guessing until the very last moment." [...] Santer confirmed that Archie's killer would be revealed in the live episode, and that their identity would be kept secret until the night of broadcast, even from the cast member playing them. The EastEnders cast and crew had two weeks to rehearse the episode prior to its live transmission. The script was issued {{on the afternoon of}} 5 February 2010, written by Simon Ashdown. The first read-through took place on 8 February 2010, though producers held back the part of the script revealing Archie's true killer. Ten different possible endings were scripted and rehearsed, each showing one character confessing to the murder. The ten characters were Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), Max Branning (Jake Wood), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), Peggy and Stacey. Santer reiterated that the actor playing the killer would only be told so thirty minutes before the broadcast. He explained that the killer [...] "may be revealed to the audience rather than the Square", preserving secrecy as the crew began filming episodes to be transmitted after the live broadcast. Brooks, who plays Archie's former lover Janine, found the secrecy difficult to work with, explaining: [...] "In the episodes to be shown afterwards, you're being told to look or speak a certain way, but not why." [...] Santer confirmed that the cast found the episode challenging, stating: [...] "They are as desperate to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it as the viewers." [...] Actor Charlie Clements, who played Bradley Branning, announced in November 2009 that he would be leaving the soap in 2010. It was later revealed that Bradley would make his last appearance in [...] "EastEnders Live", urged to flee Walford by his father Max and uncle Jack after becoming the prime suspect in the investigation into Archie's murder.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Kenneth Walton, {{the head}} of the FBI's Detroit office, told The Detroit News he knew what {{happened}} to Hoffa. “I’m comfortable I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it, but it’s never going to be prosecuted because… we would have to divulge informants, confidential sources.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No. They're not unkind to them, {{except as}} they are just to him. They {{probably}} represent fairly enough the average thinking and feeling about the matter; the thing they'll have to meet all their lives and get used to. But I wish I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> this Abstract article; I should like to thank him." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to a question in October 2015 about the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 shootdown and the U.S. intelligence community's [...] "confident" [...] assessment that pro-Russian separatists shot it down, Trump responded, [...] "Putin and Russia say they didn't do it, the other side said they did, no one really <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it, probably Putin <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it. Possibly it was Russia but they are totally denying it." [...] In the second presidential debate, Trump said {{that he did not know}} whether Russia is trying to influence the U.S. presidential election through hacking; he was however personally briefed on Russia's role in the hacks by U.S. officials. In the first presidential debate, Trump pondered that [...] "it could be Russia, but it could also be China"; he had at that time also been briefed about and discussed extensively with US intelligence officials the Russian government's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.|$|R

Why has he left his home and his work while his name is thus in people's mouths?" ...|$|R

5000|$|The German major {{appeared}} {{confused and}} asked Harper what the message meant. Harper said, [...] "In plain English? Go to hell." [...] The choice of [...] "Nuts!" [...] rather than something earthier was typical for McAuliffe. Vincent Vicari, his personal aide at the time, recalled that [...] "General Mac {{was the only}} general I ever <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not use profane language.
