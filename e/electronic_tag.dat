It may be simply covered by a rubber flap, {{or it may be}} an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only {{allowing}} pets to exit.

40|$|This review will {{compare the}} habitat {{preference}} and behavior via <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> studies {{with respect to}} the seven principal market species of tuna. Qualitative data analysis will include (but are not limited to) : horizontal migration (time cues, distance and cues to migrate), vertical habitat use in relation to physiology (short-term vertical migrations), depth distributions, aggregations and various tolerances to oceanographic conditions (e. g. temperature and dissolved oxygen). The results will review available <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> data and provide a concise reference point for scientists studying tuna to use in their research. This review will also have important implications for management of tuna worldwide. Important physiological and life history traits can be ascertained via <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> of tuna. There is considerable uncertainty as to the relationship between physiological processes and life history, but if information can be garnered via <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging,</b> there may be ways to increase the effectiveness of conservation and management strategies (Young et al. 2006). This review may also help with a reevaluation of Marine Protected Areas (MP As) due to data from <b>electronic</b> <b>tags</b> related to fish movement. With respect to the highly migratory status of tuna, a review of <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> studies may help to re-evaluate stock boundaries, thus providing more adequate protection of stocks from overfishing. Also, <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> data may help managers acquire more accurate abundance estimates from comparing tracking data with longline fishing gear data (Ward and Myers 2005). Moreover, a review of <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> studies to date can determine if recommendations for future investigation made from previous studies have been initiated and/or completed. Furthermore, a review of current <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> studies may increase returns of archival tags due to increased education and publicity. New technologies have also been developed or redesigned, which may help gather more accurate data and increase returns of data from the individual tags. The data gathered from <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> studies not only provides data specific to tuna fisheries, it also gathers data on oceanographic conditions, which may further our understanding of the physical processes governing our oceans as well as how those processes affect fish and other living organisms in the world 2 ̆ 7 s oceans...|$|R
