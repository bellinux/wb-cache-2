500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all this way, I ought to give myself one more shot at it. I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>looked</b> at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} written by singer-songwriter Alicia Keys and samples R singer Loleatta Holloway's [...] "We're Getting Stronger" [...] from Holloway's 1976 debut LP. Keys had {{requested}} {{to be a part}} of Houston's album and Houston decided she wanted to work with Keys after hearing her perform at one of Clive Davis' parties.

2500|$|At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Nas {{confirmed}} he was collaborating on {{an album}} with reggae singer Damian Marley which {{was expected to}} be released in the fall of 2009. Nas said of the collaboration in an interview [...] "I was a big fan of his father and of course all the children, all the offspring, and Damian, I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>looked</b> at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. I always liked how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and always kind of pushed each other, I always liked the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but when I worked with Damian, the whole workout was perfect". A portion of the profit was planned to go towards building a school in Africa. He {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "too early to tell the title or anything like that". The Los Angeles Times reported that the album would be titled Distant Relatives.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, he felt squeamish about {{recording}} it, {{much less}} releasing it, because he disliked {{the idea of}} capitalizing on a tragedy. But after he played it for his wife Denise and for his producer, Keith Stegall, and it met with their approval, Jackson went into the studio to record [...] "Where Were You" [...] that week.

5000|$|The {{availability}} of separate tracks {{from the original}} Beatles multi-tracks (due to release of Rock Band) have made fresh investigation of the Beatles personnel data possible.

When it came time to record it, John played the electric piano instead of Paul.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the impression of}} two paintings by the Danish painter Vilhelm Hammershøi (1864 - 1916) on Rilke, "Self-Portrait" from 1889 and "Portrait of a Young Girl" from 1892, which is {{a portrait of the}} artist's fiancée Ida Ilstedt. Rilke admired the Danish poet Jens Peter Jacobsen (1847 - 1885). The <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> serves as a common point of reference both of the visual arts and of literature. When he visited Copenhagen during his stay in Sweden in 1904 Rilke was influenced by his admiration for Jens Peter Jacobsen. Rilke had gained access to the art collection of Alfred Bramsen, Hammershøi's patron. Thus he got the opportunity to see others of Hammershøi's works. Here comes the analysis of two paintings. The conscious <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>of</b> the two persons was what Rilke was interested in. In "Self-Portrait" a concentrated and objective view; in the Portrait of Ida Ilsted an innocent and meaningless open view somewhere between inside and outside. The two portraits thus thematize the conscious view that Rilke admired at Jacobsen. The works highlight the importance <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> view in later works of Rilke and in the Letters on Cézanne...|$|R

5000|$|In August 2012, Hamm said [...] "The Other Woman" [...] was his {{favorite}} episode of the fifth season of Mad Men, and spoke about the reaction to Joan's storyline: When Other Woman" [...] aired, people were sort of outraged by the Joan storyline, like, [...] "Oh my God, how could she do that?
