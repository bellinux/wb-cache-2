Two new schemes are proposed: (1) New Scheme 1 —the <b>losses</b> are <b>allocated</b> {{only for the}} locational charges and (2) New Scheme 2 —the <b>losses</b> are <b>allocated</b> for both locational and non-locational charges. Both methods use justified distribution factors to evaluate the transmission line flows more accurately. The transmission <b>losses</b> are <b>allocated</b> among the market users by integrating the generalized generation justified distribution factors and generalized load justified distribution factors with the modified pro-rata method. The proposed approach is tested on the 10 -machine IEEE 39 -bus (New England) system to prove its effectiveness.

30|$|The key {{characteristic}} of the LCA is the possibility, but not the requirement, of investor ownership (Dean and Geu 2008). Investors may obtain ownership by purchasing common stock, preferred stock, or some other equity instrument. By comparison, patron ownership is manifested by the right and obligation to supply or deliver a given commodity such as corn or chicken. Similar to NGCs, member patrons may face substantial supply and non-redeemable equity requirements to facilitate scale economies in processing. As two distinct types of owners, member patrons and member investors receive a return on patronage and investment, respectively. However, the ULCAA contains an allocation constraint, which states member patrons must be allocated at least 50 % of the profits and losses to preserve the cooperative nature of the entity. Thus, the ULCAA departs from other cooperative state law innovations in Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa, and Tennessee, where the percentage of profits and <b>losses</b> <b>allocated</b> to member patrons may decrease to 15 %, as well as Wisconsin, which set the floor at 30 % (Geu and Dean 2009 b).|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). In a {{deregulated}} power distribution system with distributed generation, end users should be allocated the appropriate cost of energy transactions for fair and effective operation. One of the common practices is to allocate the cost of power losses to distributed generators (DGs) and consumers based on their effective share. According to the network configuration, DGs and consumers could have positive or negative impacts on a system's overall loss. This paper addresses the effect of power distribution system reconfiguration on each user's share of loss. The overall system <b>loss</b> and maximum <b>allocated</b> <b>loss</b> are considered in the two competing objectives to be minimized.

5000|$|In the United States, {{the legal}} {{definition}} of a defined contribution plan is a plan providing for an individual account for each participant, and for benefits {{based solely on the}} amount contributed to the account, plus or minus income, gains, expenses and <b>losses</b> <b>allocated</b> to the account (see [...] ). Examples of defined contribution plans in the United States include individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans. In such plans, the employee is responsible, to one degree or another, for selecting the types of investments toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated. This may range from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined mutual funds to selecting individual stocks or other securities. Most self-directed retirement plans are characterized by certain tax advantages, and some provide for a portion of the employee's contributions to be matched by the employer. In exchange, the funds in such plans may not be withdrawn by the investor prior to reaching a certain age—typically the year the employee reaches 59.5 years old-- (with a small number of exceptions) without incurring a substantial penalty.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{that the author}} has seen to date, Berry[1] and Perkins & Teng[2], concerning the accrued retrospectively rated premium focuses on calculating the asset in bulk by policy year, but not by policyholder account.

Another way to view this process is to first allocate (or calculate) the ultimate <b>loss</b> and <b>allocated</b> <b>loss</b> adjustment expense by individual policy and then calculate the resulting accrued retrospectively rated premium by individual policyholder plan or account. Such an approach would have strong intuitive appeal, since average retrospective rating parameters may change over time due to market pressures or a changing mix of business. This paper describes a method that was developed to calculate the accrued retrospectively rated premium using this approach...|$|R

5000|$|Credit {{enhancement}} is key {{in creating}} a security that has a higher rating than the underlying asset pool. Credit enhancement can be created, for example, by issuing subordinate bonds. The subordinate bonds are <b>allocated</b> any <b>losses</b> from the collateral before <b>losses</b> are <b>allocated</b> to the senior bonds, thus giving senior bonds a credit enhancement. As a result, {{it is possible for}} defaults to occur in repayment of the underlying assets without affecting payments to holders of the senior bonds. Also, many deals, typically those involving riskier collateral, such as subprime and Alt-A mortgages, use over-collateralization as well as subordination. In over-collateralization, the balance of the underlying assets (e.g., loans) is greater than the balance of the bonds, thus creating excess interest in the deal which acts as a [...] "cushion" [...] against reduction in value of the underlying assets. Excess interest can be used to offset collateral losses before <b>losses</b> are <b>allocated</b> to bondholders, thus providing another credit enhancement. A further credit enhancement involves the use of derivatives such as swap transactions, which effectively provide insurance, for a set fee, against a decrease in value.|$|R
