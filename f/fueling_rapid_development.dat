50|$|Andrushivka {{gradually}} {{increased in}} size and population. By 1798 it has population of 1046 people, a working distillery with two boilers, three water mills, one on horse-drawn. By the mid nineteenth century, Andrushevka had a tannery, distillery and bi-weekly fairs. Agricultural practice, however, was the chief source of income and soil and climatic conditions were favorable for growing sugar beet, and with the availability of large reserves of land it <b>fueled</b> the <b>rapid</b> <b>development</b> of sugar industry in Andrushivka Raion. Initially there was one small plantation on the left bank of the Huyvy, known as Yatsyukoviy. Laborers came from the surrounding villages and beet was extracted by primitive methods, using horses and oxen. The growth of the population let to a demand for tertiary employment, builders and other jobs which were often carried out seasonally, and the hiring peasants from surrounding villages rose steadily after the abolition of serfdom in 1861.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} crime and {{conflict}} has changed and continues to evolve. The now and future war is and will be influenced by irregular combatants – non-state soldiers – that utilize technology and networked doctrine to spread their influence across traditional geographic boundaries. This era shift in political and social organization, <b>fueled</b> by <b>rapid</b> <b>developments</b> of technology and exploitation of network organizational forms, blurs the distinctions between crime, terrorism and warfare. The resulting transitional period – a Dark Renaissance – benefits a range of non-state actors: drugs cartels, street gangs, terrorists, and warlords. Criminal organizations appear {{among the first to}} adapt to the new operational context resulting from this shift. This paper examines the journey of street gangs, one type of transnational criminal organization – the drug cartel – and warlords through this evolution. Respectively, these entities provide direct and indirect challenges to the solvency of nation-state institutions, potentially emerging as new war-making entities...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of fourth-generation wireless technologies has <b>fueled</b> the <b>rapid</b> <b>development</b> of cellular networks, significantly increasing the energy consumption and the expenditures of mobile network operators (MNOs). In addition, network underutilization during low-traffic periods (e. g., night zone) has motivated {{a new business}} model, namely, infrastructure sharing, which allows the MNOs to have their traffic served by other MNOs in the same geographic area, thus enabling them to switch off part of their network. In this paper, we propose a novel infrastructure-sharing algorithm for multioperator environments, which enables the deactivation of underutilized base stations during low-traffic periods. Motivated by the conflicting interests of the MNOs and the necessity for effective solutions, we introduce a game-theoretic framework that enables the MNOs to individually estimate the switching-off probabilities that reduce their expected financial cost. Our approach reaches dominant strategy equilibrium, which is the strategy that minimizes the cost of each player. Finally, we provide extensive analytical and experimental results to estimate the potential energy and cost savings {{that can be achieved}} in multioperator environments, incentivizing the MNOs to apply the proposed scheme...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Investigation of the Ni-YSZ cermets for anode {{supported}} solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFC) prepared by extrusion or powder injection moulding process, sintered and reduced of NiO-YSZ. Design/methodology/approach: Density examination, shrinkage examination, {{transverse rupture strength}} tests, microstructure examination. Findings: Results of the rheological and torque investigations have essential importance for further search of the optimum feedstock to injection moulding machines and extruders making forming possible of shapes for fuel cells anodes, which require in addition debinding of the binder, sintering, and reduction. Practical implications: The proposed technological solutions for fabricating anodes as tubes or flat shapes will make connecting the cells into packets possible which will allow increasing the cell power.

40|$|China’s {{unprecedented}} {{economic growth}} path {{over the last}} two decades has been paralleled by an exponential growth in the consumption of natural resources and in pollution. Initially, China mainly exploited domestic resources to <b>fuel</b> its <b>rapid</b> industrial <b>development.</b> But over the last decade, increasing shares of China’s natural resources consumption and environmental impacts relate to peripheral regions, including sub-Saharan Africa. China’s environmental impacts in peripheral regions seem in line with World-Systems Theory predictions for ascending world powers. This paper assesses the extent to which the World-Systems Theory idea of ‘environmentally unequal exchange’ between ascending world powers and peripheral economies reflects current behaviour of Chinese governmental authorities and companies in sub-Saharan Africa. It concludes that the theory only partly does so. Behaviour of Chinese governmental authorities and firms is conditioned and guided by environmental norms, as well. World-Systems Theory has to make conceptual space for such new environmental behaviour of ascending world powers, to understand the contemporary and future world-systems. At the same time, China has a long way to go before becoming the ‘green’ exemplar for the world to follow...|$|R
40|$|A {{network of}} coastal {{observatories}} {{is being built}} around the United States. While the motivations for developing these systems do not originate from marine sanctuaries per se, the sanctuaries stand to gain an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from real-time data and nowcasting/forecasting models. The construction of the observatories is being <b>fueled</b> by the <b>rapid</b> <b>development</b> in three enabling observational technologies. These technologies include (1) data acquisition systems that track the international constellation of IR and ocean color satellites; (2) nested grids multi-static SeaSonde surface current radars; and (3) a growing fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles. These observational assets are coupled to nowcast/forecast data assimilative models. These systems will allow the mean behavior in marine ecosystems to be defined while also providing real-time data that will allow adaptive sampling. The ability to adaptively sample the environment will allow scientists to make shrewd decisions about when and where to sample. Given this, developing the new approaches to measure critical biological processes and the geographic boundaries of those processes. This should be a key focus for the marine biology community and will alter how scientists approach scientific questions. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{challenge}} of a green energy economy that could offer the chance to escape from our dependence on fossil <b>fuels,</b> the <b>rapid</b> <b>development</b> of materials science and technology is vital. Nowadays, advanced devices that convert and store energy are the focus of intensive research that is being carried out along various avenues and Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in combination with fuel cells and supercapacitors hold the promise for a clean solution for an electric future. Currently, {{there are a number of}} efforts underway to develop lithium cells by using renewable resources, to simplify the fabrication processes to lower the costs, and to use water as solvent to reduce the environmental impact. An increased attention is also devoted to the recycling of spent LIBs even though the assessment of the real balance between the economic and environmental impact of this process is still matter of debate. In this respect, a novel and original Li-ion cell architecture is here successfully developed for the first time by exploiting the use of carbonized cellulose nanofibrils as both conductive binder and current collector substrate. The cellulose nanofibrils are also used as a reinforcing agent for the preparation of an unconventional composite polymer electrolyte as separator. The truly solid lab-scale Li-ion cell, assembled in a "pouch cell", demonstrates remarkably stable cycling characteristics upon prolonged cycling at ambient temperature. The outstanding results are obtained along with the implementation of a pilot line procedure, comprising the spray coating and water-based papermaking techniques. Noteworthy, the battery components after use can be fully recovered using paper recycling techniques, which will definitely open up a truly new way of conceiving advanced sustainable batterie...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of immigrants into host societies has been a topic of longstanding interest in the sociology of migration, whereas the study of transnationalism has only emerged {{in the last few}} years. Globalization, <b>fueled</b> by the <b>rapid</b> <b>development</b> of transportation and communication technologies, {{has been one of the}} principal factors in the rise of transnationalism. The aim of this study is to clarify the links between the immigrants' integration into the host society and the transnational activities in which they get involved. The initial hypothesis of this study was that immigrants' involvement in narrow transnational activities is linked to their weaker integration into Quebec society. To test this hypothesis, a series of interviews was conducted with members of the Dominican community of Montreal. These Dominicans were involved in varying levels of transnational activities within political, economic, and cultural spheres. The interviews were aimed at determining the integration process experienced by the different interviewees. The results of this study showed, in contrast to the hypothesized predictions, that involvement in transnational activities was not linked to lesser levels of integration. In fact, the Dominicans involved in the most intensive transnational activities revealed a capacity to integrate into the receiving society as easily as other Dominicans, often showing a greater dynamism in their integration. Involvement in intensive transnational activities seems to show a capacity on the part of some immigrants to grow and develop in two universes at the same time, that of the receiving and that of the sending society...|$|R

40|$|Private {{universities}} in Bangladesh are composed with students from all portion of society. Students {{from rural areas}} {{as well as from}} city areas. But one unique feature that private universities contains that it offers its students job oriented degree and in doing so they create a situation where students found themselves at a crossroad between westernized lifestyle and traditional culture of the country. However, neither the problem of radicalization nor student radicalization is new in Bangladesh, the thing which is new is the students from westernized and job oriented education institutions are engaging with violent acts. This new phenomenon has challenged the traditional understanding that students from Madrasas (religious seminaries) for radicalization and terrorist acts. The characteristics of radicalization is not much different than other part of the world, {{in the sense that it}} has multiple causes that drives an individual towards radicalization. But the radicalization of students does differ in the context. Therefore, on the first stage we tried to look at the structural causes where students find themselves everyday. On this part, this paper has looked on the political causes, causes that can arise from institution where they belong and tried to find out how they see their future given the present political structure. Followed by the anti social causes how they perceive their economical situation and assessing their level of radical view, where this paper has asked questioned which is typically hold by extremist organization and individuals. The quantitative survey suggests that there is a complex mixture of political grievances strengthened not by socio-economic factors but by intolerance for different view. On the second stage this paper conducted qualitative survey to unearth the source of intolerance and why and how students get radicalized. The data finding showed that the students follows a pattern of bottom up approach which is fueled by political violence and intolerance in the national level coupled with source of grievances form outside the country and in the global situation. Modernization lead the families towards a crossroad between modernization and traditional structure, but most importantly the radicalization process is altogether <b>fueled</b> by <b>rapid</b> <b>development</b> in the interpersonal communication sector...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityThe {{field of}} {{bioinformatics}} and computational biology is currently experiencing a data revolution. The exciting prospect of making fundamental biological discoveries is <b>fueling</b> the <b>rapid</b> <b>development</b> and deployment of numerous cost-effective, high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies. The {{result is that}} the DNA and protein sequence repositories are being bombarded with new sequence information. Databases are continuing to report a Moore's law-like growth trajectory in their database sizes, roughly doubling every 18 months. In {{what seems to be a}} paradigm-shift, individual projects are now capable of generating billions of raw sequence data that need to be analyzed in the presence of already annotated sequence information. While it is clear that data-driven methods, such as sequencing homology detection, are becoming the mainstay in the field of computational life sciences, the algorithmic advancements essential for implementing complex data analytics at scale have mostly lagged behind. Sequence homology detection is central to a number of bioinformatics applications including genome sequencing and protein family characterization. Given millions of sequences, the goal is to identify all pairs of sequences that are highly similar (or ``homologous'') on the basis of alignment criteria. While there are optimal alignment algorithms to compute pairwise homology, their deployment for large-scale is currently not feasible; instead, heuristic methods are used at the expense of quality. In this dissertation, we present the design and evaluation of a parallel implementation for conducting optimal homology detection on distributed memory supercomputers. Our approach uses a combination of techniques from asynchronous load balancing (viz. work stealing, dynamic task counters), data replication, and exact-matching filters to achieve homology detection at scale. Results for a collection of 2. 56 M sequences show parallel efficiencies of ~ 75 - 100 % on up to 8 K cores, representing a time-to-solution of 33 seconds. We extend this work with a detailed analysis of single-node sequence alignment performance using the latest CPU vector instruction set extensions. Preliminary results reveal that current sequence alignment algorithms are unable to fully utilize widening vector registers. Department of Computer Science, Washington State Universit...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between mothers, scientific experts and food advertisers in the turn-of-the-century United States. Industrialization and urbanization created a thriving consumer society in the early 20 th century, {{and at the same}} time created a new national community of women. Before the industrial revolution, women could not participate in American political debate, and their role in public society and connection to the larger world remained limited. This began to change in the 19 th century as social action and consumerism brought women outside the home, and conversely, brought the outside world into the domestic sphere through the media of magazines, advertisements and child-rearing manuals. I argue in this thesis that women nationwide eagerly engaged in new, public expressions of their motherhood beginning in the late 19 th century. By examining the records of women's clubs as well as editorials and letters written by women, I present a picture of their conceptions of their roles as workers and mothers. Acting to improve public health and child welfare, mothers projected their concerns, fears and desires for their own children into the work they did in public. In particular, women joined together in clubs to lobby for pure food legislation, create libraries and parks, and educate their fellow mothers about how to raise healthy children. Their work was a huge success overall, lauded by local governments and highly publicized in the press. I posit that the visibility of women's work and concerns ultimately implicated them, however, in oppressive webs of consumerism and scientific dominance. Food companies and scientific experts began to aggressively re-inscribe the concerns of publicly active women onto all mothers, distorting and exploiting those concerns to promote their own interests. Advertisers and manual writers successfully learned to manipulate the burgeoning market of public mothers by adopting their narratives of child welfare to incite fear. Their tactics were wildly successful, and <b>fueled</b> the <b>rapid</b> <b>development</b> of the food industry, supporting the introduction of hundreds of new processed and packaged foods in the market. Moreover, manuals and advertising homogenized American motherhood by precipitating notions of "the right way" to raise children which excluded all other methods as ignorant or even dangerous. By examining food advertisements and expert narratives in conjunction with records of women's work, I unpack the complex, multi-directional links of influence between the three...|$|R
