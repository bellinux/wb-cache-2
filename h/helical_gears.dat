5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double <b>helical</b> <b>gears.</b> An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
25|$|The drive {{within the}} casing is {{provided}} by a train of spur gears. Accessories are arranged {{on both sides of}} the driveshaft entry, in reducing order of their speed. The gears are usually plain spur gears, running in roller bearings. Idler gears are commonly used between them, to increase the spacing between accessories. <b>Helical</b> <b>gears</b> are sometimes used for the high-torque drives, typically the starter, as these give smoother running. However <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> also generate an end-thrust, which then requires a more complicated thrust bearing to support them.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the face}} of {{extensive}} research into the theoretical basis and performance characteristics of <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> design, a complete mathematical description {{of the relationship between}} the design parameters and the performance matrices is still to be clearly understood because of the great complexity in their interrelationship. The objective of this work is to conduct a comparative study on <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> design and its performance based on various performance metrics through finite element as well as analytical approaches. The theoretical analysis for a single <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> system based on American Gear Manufacturing Association (AGMA) standards has been assessed in Matlab. The effect of major performance metrics of different <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> tooth systems such as single, herringbone and crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> are studied through finite element approach (FEA) in ANSYS and compared with theoretical analysis of <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> pair. Structural, contact and fatigue analysis are also performed in order to investigate the performance metrics of different <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> systems. The benefit of such a comparison is quickly estimating the stress distribution for a new design variant without carrying out complex theoretical analysis as well as the FEA analysis gives less scope for manual errors while calculating complex formulas related to theoretical analysis of gears. It will significantly reduce processing time as well as enhanced flexibility in the design performance...|$|R

The numbers of meshing tooth are discussed during <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> pair meshing process, thus the length of total contact lines is determined easily. It is difficult to calculate contact stress by existing formula because this kind gear is non-standard. A calculating formula is derived which can calculate contact stress of <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> with asymmetric involutes in this paper.

40|$|Abstract. The two gears of {{the double}} circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> is a mesh of a concave/convex combination. Because the {{curvature}} is close to each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size of the gear module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> set at a pressure angle of 24 °. Firstly, this paper would redefine a new double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> according to the discontinuousness tooth profile molded line {{of the double}} circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> and unchangeable pressure angle and explain the improvements in the design and stress analysis of the tooth especially since the double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> has no limitation in the minimum number of teeth. Thus, the decrease in the driving gears’ number of module and can further increase the reduction gear ratio. For heavily-loaded planetary gear reducer, it’s quite obvious in the miniaturizing and high torque superiority. This paper also used certain winch’s speed reducer as example to explain that the change of the pressure angle can reduce contact stress by 3 %~ 40 % and also enhances the torque ability by 3 %~ 40 %...|$|R

The parametric modeling and transient dynamic analysis of a <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> pair in a crane reducer are performed. Transient stresses and strains of the gear pair throughout the engagement process are obtained and the worst meshing location can be determined.

These may be coarser dog engagement straight cut gears instead of synchronised <b>helical</b> <b>gears,</b> for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement.

50|$|Double <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> and {{herringbone}} gears are similar, but {{the difference}} is that herringbone gears do not have a groove in the middle like double <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> do. Double <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> by using two sets of teeth that are set in a V shape. A double helical gear {{can be thought of as}} two mirrored <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> joined together. This arrangement cancels out the net axial thrust, since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can remove the need for thrust bearings. However, double <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.|$|E
