5|$|The Intergroups in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} political groups around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an <b>Intergroup</b> must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).|$|E
25|$|According to this hypothesis, <b>intergroup</b> {{conflict}} {{represents an}} opportunity for men {{to gain access to}} mates, territory, and increased status. As such, conflicts may have created selection pressures for psychological mechanisms in men to initiate <b>intergroup</b> aggression. In women, <b>intergroup</b> conflict substantially increases the risk of sexual assault by outgroup men, and may have created selection pressure for psychological mechanisms that bias women against outgroup men.|$|E

25|$|To {{the extent}} {{that a person is}} fearful of social {{encounters}} with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending {{on the nature of the}} antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, <b>intergroup</b> contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or <b>intergroup</b> anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Consensual {{discrimination}} {{is driven by}} the need for accuracy and reflects stable and legitimate <b>intergroup</b> status hierarchies (e.g., favouring a high-status in-group because it is high status).|$|E
25|$|Groups are {{important}} {{not only because they}} offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their social identity. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences <b>intergroup</b> behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to <b>intergroup</b> discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group. On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society. <b>Intergroup</b> discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intergroup</b> accommodation: Speaker {{perceives}} interlocutors as older, which triggers {{negative stereotypes}} about their ability. The speaker makes accommodations based on perceptions about the interlocutor’s ingroup, {{rather than the}} person themselves.|$|E
25|$|To {{investigate}} {{the salience of}} religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some {{studies have shown that}} greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups. These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of <b>intergroup</b> bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup derogation). Evidence supporting religious <b>intergroup</b> bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in individuals who are high in religiosity.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} and sociobiology have also discussed and produced theories for some specific forms of male aggression such as sociobiological theories {{of rape and}} theories regarding the Cinderella effect. Another evolutionary theory explaining gender differences in aggression is the Male Warrior hypothesis, which explains that males have psychologically evolved for <b>intergroup</b> aggression {{in order to gain}} access to mates, resources, territory and status.|$|E
25|$|During the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak, some {{organizations}} grouped staff {{into separate}} teams, and rotated the teams between {{primary and secondary}} work sites, with a rotation frequency equal to the incubation period of the disease.

25|$|As {{humans are}} a highly social species, {{there are many}} {{adaptive}} problems associated with navigating the social world (e.g., maintaining allies, managing status hierarchies, interacting with outgroup members, coordinating social activities, collective decision-making).

25|$|Following {{a social}} {{identity}} approach, Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens). Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural {{environment in which}} one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected {{to others in the}} world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of prosocial behaviors and values, including: <b>intergroup</b> empathy, valuing diversity, social justice, environmental sustainability, <b>intergroup</b> helping, and a felt responsibility to act. Subsequent research has examined variables that influence the model such as: participation in a college course with global components, perception of one’s global knowledge, college professors' attitudes toward global citizenship, belief in an intentional worlds view of culture, participation in a fan group that promotes the identity, use of global citizen related words when describing one's values, possible self as a global citizen, religiosity and religious orientation, threat to one’s nation, interdependent self-construal prime, perception of the university environment, and social media usage.|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary {{psychologist}} Satoshi Kanazawa {{has argued}} that an important cause of <b>intergroup</b> conflict may be the relative availability of women of reproductive age. He found that polygyny greatly increased the frequency of civil wars but not interstate wars. Gleditsch et al. did not find a relationship between ethnic groups with polygyny and increased frequency of civil wars but nations having legal polygamy may have more civil wars. They argued that misogyny is a better explanation than polygyny. They found that increased women's rights were associated with less civil wars and that legal polygamy had no effect after women’s rights were controlled for.|$|E
25|$|One such {{expedition}} {{that left}} {{objects in the}} archaeological record was the de Soto Entrada of the early 1540s, which encountered many Late Mississippian groups. This expedition spent almost four years trekking from Florida up to the eastern Tennessee region, down through Alabama, across Mississippi to Eastern Arkansas, through Northern Louisiana and into Texas, before doubling back to Arkansas and down the Mississippi to Mexico {{by way of the}} Gulf of Mexico. These groups were extinct by the time Europeans colonized West Virginia, either becoming victims of European diseases, which at times had as much as a 90% death rate among Native American populations, or migrating to other areas to avoid <b>intergroup</b> warfare such as the Iroquois wars to control the fur trade.|$|E
25|$|Groups of the Fort Ancient and Monongahela {{cultures}} {{lived in}} the western part of the state (and in the adjoining states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and Kentucky) along the Ohio River and its tributaries. Late Fort Ancient (1400 to 1750) and Late Monongahela (1580 to 1635) peoples began consolidating their villages into larger settlements with more defensive measures such as wooden palisades during this time. Archaeologists suggest that this means that <b>intergroup</b> strife had increased, with the smaller settlements amalgamating into larger entities for mutual protection. These cultures were very similar and were both influenced by Mississippian cultures to their south and west. Exotic trade items from the Mississippian regions have been found in excavated Fort Ancient and Monongahela villages. These items include shell gorgets from Eastern Tennessee, a head pot similar to those produced in the Central Mississippi Valley by the peoples of the Middle Mississippian Parkin and Nodena Phases, and pottery with motifs and decoration methods connected with Angel Phase sites in the Lower Ohio Valley. Such items made their way into this region through long established native trade routes.|$|E

Both homosexual and heterosexual people thought of asexuals as not only cold, but also animalistic and unrestrained. A different study, however, found little evidence of serious discrimination against asexuals because of their asexuality. Asexual activist, author, and blogger Julie Decker has observed that sexual harassment and violence, such as corrective rape, commonly victimizes the asexual community. Sociologist Mark Carrigan sees a middle ground, arguing that while asexuals do often experience discrimination, it is not of a phobic nature but [...] "more about marginalization because people genuinely don't understand asexuality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other ways to {{decrease}} youth exclusion include increased intergoup {{contact between the}} differing social positions of the excluders and the excluded. Benefits of inclusion have indeed been measured by sociologists. One such experiment researched elementary aged children to record their personal views on prejudice and social exclusion.

Integration of peer groups helps lessen xenophobic reactions to others and fosters inclusion among all members of a society.
