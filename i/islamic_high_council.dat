50|$|Thomas B. Marsh was the {{original}} president of the traveling <b>high</b> <b>council</b> which, in practice, was initially subordinate to the <b>high</b> <b>council</b> of Zion.

Later, as the traveling <b>high</b> <b>council</b> evolved and began {{to be known as}} the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, it acquired equal status with the presiding <b>high</b> <b>council</b> and both were subordinated to the First Presidency. When the <b>high</b> <b>council</b> of Zion was dissolved after the church members were expelled from Missouri, the <b>high</b> <b>council</b> organized at the new church headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois, where it functioned as the presiding <b>high</b> <b>council</b> of the church, overseeing appeals from <b>high</b> <b>councils</b> in outlying stakes.|$|R
