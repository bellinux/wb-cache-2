5|$|To a {{significant}} extent, the royal administration had achieved territorial stability by battening onto minsters. Well might late tenth-century polemicists blame kings of Wessex and their magnates, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Vikings, for despoiling the Church's resources. The scars of the Viking raids had healed, but the secularization of minsters continued on its slow, consistent course.|$|E
5|$|Though a small {{shrine in}} the temple complex, the Vimala temple is {{important}} to the Goddess-oriented Shakta and Tantric worshippers, who revere it <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> main Jagannath shrine. Vimala is considered to be the Tantric consort of Jagannath and a guardian of the temple complex. Devotees pay respect to Vimala before worshipping Jagannath in the main temple. Food offered to Jagannath does not get sanctified as Mahaprasad until it is also offered to Vimala. The Goddess-oriented festival of Durga Puja in the Hindu month of Ashvin (October) is celebrated for sixteen days at Vimala, culminating with Vijayadashami.|$|E

At least six kindreds existed, and they {{continued}} to call themselves 'Quendi', considering those who went away as deserters. Some of these tribes later also journeyed westward, intermingling with the Nandor, and a few even reached Beleriand, though usually remaining in unfriendly relationship with the Sindar.|$|E

25|$|Both sides surpassed 500 {{in their}} innings in this two-day match, which {{included}} four centuries and expensive bowling figures {{on either side}} – as Jason Gillespie was the most economical, with an analysis reading 22–3–80–0. Essex batted first at Chelmsford after winning the toss, and Will Jefferson added 140 for the first wicket with Alastair Cook before being bowled by Michael Kasprowicz. However, the second-wicket partnership was worth <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first. Cook slashed 33 fours and one six {{on his way to}} 214 – which would have been his highest first class score if the match had had first class status – and added 270 with Ravinder Bopara.|$|E
25|$|Along with New Zealand {{adopting}} a radical direction of economic practice, Parliament passed a new Immigration Act {{into law in}} 1987. This would end the preference for migrants from Britain, Europe or Northern America based on their race, and instead classify migrants on their skills, personal qualities, and potential contribution to New Zealand economy and society. The introduction of the points-based system came under the National government, which pursued this policy-change <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous Labour Party administration. This system resembled that of Canada, and came into effect in 1991. Effectively the New Zealand Immigration Service ranks the qualities sought in the migrants and gives them a priority using a points-based scale. In 2010 the new Immigration Act replaced all existing protocols and procedures.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{claim that}} the new 421-a program will cost city taxpayers <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> old plan. The IBO found that the new 421-a plan would cost add $120 million per year, or $1.2 billion over ten years, to the overall cost of the program. This is {{compared}} to the old program that would have cost $7.2 billion over ten years. The Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development, an interest group that advocated for non-profits and affordable housing groups, claimed that the city needed that extra money {{to make up for}} expected cuts in federal funding to the city over the next year, and that luxury development companies should have to pay full taxes on the property, not get a deduction. Meanwhile, Democratic State Senator Gustavo Rivera claimed that the rents would not be low enough for residents in his Bronx state senate district {{to take advantage of the}} program. Senator Brad Hoylman stated that the dollars devoted to the 421-a program should instead go directly to creating affordable housing.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{received}} a tweet on June 30 from Michael Tran in Michigan asking {{him if he}} had ever used steroids. He responded [...] "No", that same day.

Half the stuff on the list I can't even pronounce." [...] Later, Davis would say that he believed Roger Maris's 61 home run season was the true single-season home run record, due to the steroid scandal surrounding Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire.|$|E

[...] Unusually warm, cloudy, and humid climatic conditions and above-average rainfall lasted two months later than average (through November), during critical stages of the rice crop's maturation. This weather pattern triggered [...] "a massive release of disease spores at the exact time that rice plants were most susceptible to infection."

[...] Only {{a small part of the}} fertilizers applied in agriculture is used by plants. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus ends up in rivers, lakes and the sea, where excess amounts stress aquatic ecosystems. For example, fertilizer which discharges from rivers into the Gulf of Mexico has damaged shrimp fisheries because of hypoxia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of El Gran Cairo, in March 1517, was {{without a doubt}} a crucial moment in the Spanish perception of the natives of the Americas: until then, nothing had resembled the stories of Marco Polo, or the promises of Columbus, which prophesied Cathay, or even the Garden of Paradise, just past every cape or river. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> later encounters with the Aztec and Inca cultures, El Gran Cairo resembled the conquistadors' dreams.

2500|$|Thomas Benton {{claims that}} because shy people [...] "have a {{tendency}} toward self-criticism, they are often high achievers, {{and not just in}} solitary activities like research and writing. Perhaps <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> drive toward independent achievement, shy people long to make connections to others often through altruistic behavior." [...] Susan Cain describes the benefits that shy people bring to society that US cultural norms devalue. Without characteristics that shy people bring to social interactions, such as sensitivity to the emotions of others, contemplation of ideas, and valuable listening skills, there would be no balance to society. In earlier generations, such as the 1950s, society perceived shyness as a more socially attractive trait, especially in women, indicating that views on shyness vary by culture.|$|E
