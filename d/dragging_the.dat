5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.|$|E
5|$|In Metroid Prime Hunters, the Nintendo DS's top screen shows Samus's HUD as {{seen from}} her visor, which {{displays}} the amount of remaining ammunition for the currently selected weapon along with her health; in multiplayer games, the number of kills and time remaining in the round are also shown. The bottom touchscreen displays the radar. When using the default control scheme, movement is controlled using the D-pad, and aiming is controlled by <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> stylus along the touchscreen.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a hand holding a magnifying glass. By clicking and <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the battle, Waller {{captured}} at least 500 men, around 100 of these re-enlisting with him. Additionally, more than 100 Royalist soldiers were killed. Together, the men lost represented nearly half of Hopton's infantry forces in the south. Waller, on the other hand, lost around ten men and gained much reputation for his success. Waller put his prisoners to work <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> horse carcasses from the church, dismantling the scaffoldings inside, and burying their fallen comrades near the northern wall of the building. All of the captured men were then marched to Farnham tied together in pairs.|$|E
5|$|The Beagle now {{sailed to}} {{southern}} Patagonia, and on 19 April an expedition including FitzRoy and Darwin {{set off to}} take boats {{as far as possible}} up the Santa Cruz river, with all involved taking turn in teams <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> boats upstream. The river cut through a series of rises then plateaux forming wide plains covered with shells and shingle, and Darwin discussed with FitzRoy his interpretation that these terraces had been shores that had gradually raised in accordance with Lyell's theories. Several of the smaller rheas were seen in the distance, but were too elusive to catch. The expedition approached the Andes but had to turn back.|$|E

5|$|Tyler and the Kentish men {{advanced}} to Canterbury, entering the walled city and castle without resistance on 10 June. The rebels deposed the absent Archbishop of Canterbury, Sudbury, {{and made the}} cathedral monks swear loyalty to their cause. They attacked properties in the city with links to the hated royal council, and searched the city for suspected enemies, <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> suspects {{out of their houses}} and executing them. The city gaol was opened and the prisoners freed. Tyler then persuaded a few thousand of the rebels to leave Canterbury and advance with him on London the next morning.|$|E
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E

50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{propulsion system}} must achieve two things. First, the thrust from the propulsion system must balance <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> of <b>the</b> airplane when the airplane is cruising. And second, the thrust from the propulsion system must exceed <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> of <b>the</b> airplane for the airplane to accelerate. In fact, {{the greater the}} difference between the thrust and <b>the</b> <b>drag,</b> called <b>the</b> excess thrust, the faster the airplane will accelerate.|$|R
40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> {{force on}} {{discrete}} objects with circular cross section moving slowly through a spherical granular medium. Variations in {{the geometry of}} <b>the</b> <b>dragged</b> object change <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> force only by a small fraction relative to shape effects in fluid <b>drag.</b> <b>The</b> <b>drag</b> force depends quadratically on the object’s diameter as expected. We do observe, however, a deviation above the expected linear depth dependence, and {{the magnitude of the}} deviation is apparently controlled by geometrical factors...|$|R
5|$|The game, which largely {{follows the}} action RPG and hack and slash {{gameplay}} of previous {{games in the}} series, sees players alternate between the roles of Sora and Riku. Alternating between characters is done via the 'Drop' system. During gameplay, a Drop Gauge gradually depletes over time, though it can be replenished with items. When the gauge completely empties, control will switch to the other character, though players may also opt to drop manually at any time. Drop Points, which are earned by defeating enemies and completing optional objectives, can be spent on bonuses {{that can be used}} until the next time the character drops, such as a slower Drop Gauge or increased attack or defense. The game reuses the Command Deck system from Birth by Sleep, in which players can customize a deck filled with various actions, spells, and items that can be quickly selected. There are also several new elements added to the gameplay. Flowmotion allows players to move quickly about by performing actions such as bouncing off walls, grinding on rails and spinning around poles. Reality Shift is a system the player can use on certain objects or weakened opponents involving a touch-screen activated minigame unique to each world. These include <b>dragging</b> <b>the</b> screen to fling a target like a catapult, touching hidden words to take control of enemies, and playing a small rhythm-based game to cause fireworks to appear.|$|E

They also made the v1.1 patch available for download. The gaming press lauded Bungie's handling of the situation, praising their decision to take the financial hit and recall the game.|$|E
2500|$|In fluid dynamics, <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> {{coefficient}} (commonly denoted as: , [...] or [...] ) is a {{dimensionless quantity}} {{that is used}} to quantify <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> or resistance of an object in a fluid environment, such as air or water.
