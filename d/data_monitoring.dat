25|$|The {{extraction}} of conjugated estrogens from the urine of pregnant mares {{led to the}} marketing in 1943 of the first HRT treatment, Premarin. From that time until 1975, estrogen was administered without supplemental progesterone or progestin. A study from Kaiser Permanente by Dr. Harry Ziel demonstrated that {{in the absence of}} progesterone, patients were at increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen therapy. After this, progestin was supplemented in women who had not received surgical hysterectomy, to reduce the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. This was followed by the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 2002. However, the arm of the WHI receiving combined Estrogen and Progesterone therapy was closed prematurely by its <b>Data</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Committee (DMC) due to perceived health risks, although the trial arm was stopped only a full year after the data suggesting increased risk became manifest. In 2004, the arm of the WHI in which post-hysterectomy patients were being treated with estrogen alone was also closed by the DMC.|$|E

This paper analyzes the abnormal types appearing in safety <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> of shield method construction, and points out its caused by the environmental quantity anomaly, structure form change, misreading mistake, instrument error, and human negligence. Based on the test {{and analysis of the}} abnormal <b>monitoring</b> <b>data,</b> it considers the <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> as abnormal value if the <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> beyond the confidence interval.

Based on the {{long-term}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> of Donghai Bridge, span length {{changes of the}} main channel of the bridge was estimated with the expansion joint displacement <b>data</b> <b>monitored,</b> and the correlations between span changes and the environmental factors, which are temperature and wind load, were analyzed. Results show that temperature is the main factor influencing the span change, while the correlation between span changes and wind load is weak so can be ignored. The linear regression model established between span changes and the structure effective temperature {{can be used to}} estimate the interval of bridge span changes and examine the correctness of the expansion joint <b>data</b> <b>monitored.</b> Moreover, the regressive model of accumulated expansion joints displacement and time history can provide valuable information for design, maintenance and replacement of the expansion joints...|$|R

These <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> include radiation exposure, air, groundwater, meteorology, vadose zone, subsidence, and biota data. Although some of these media (radiation exposure, air, and groundwater) are reported in detail in other Bechtel Nevada (BN) reports (Annual Site Environmental Report [ASER], the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants [NESHAP] report, and the Annual Groundwater Monitoring Report), they are also summarized in this report to provide an overall evaluation of RWMS performance and environmental compliance. Direct radiation <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> indicate that exposure at and around the RWMSs is not above background levels. Air <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> indicate that tritium concentrations are slightly above background levels. Groundwater <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> indicate that the groundwater in the uppermost aquifer beneath the Area 5 RWMS has not {{been affected by the}} facility. Meteorology data indicate that 2001 was an average rainfall year: rainfall totaled 150 mm (5. 9 in) at the Area 3 RWMS and 120 mm (4. 7 in) at the Area 5 RWMS. Vadose zone <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> indicate that 2001 rainfall infiltrated less than one meter (3 ft) before being returned to the atmosphere by evaporation. Soil-gas tritium <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> indicate slow subsurface migration, and tritium concentrations in biota were lower than in previous years.
