500|$|The pilot {{episode of}} Sit Down, Shut Up {{was written by}} series creator Mitchell Hurwitz and {{directed}} by Dwayne Carey-Hill. It was originally written by Hurwitz in 2000, but he [...] "kept it in a drawer for a long time" [...] and brought it out when he needed money. The idea for the series {{was based on the}} Australian situation comedy of the same name. He pitched his adaption to different networks that were interested in the concept, but they turned it down, because the characters were [...] "way too broad and way too self-centered and oblivious," [...] and they told him that he had to rewrite it. The Fox network picked it up in April 2008 under the name Class Dismissed, later changed to Sit Down, Shut Up. Hurwitz's adaption was originally planned to be live-action like its counterpart, but he decided to make it an animated series to [...] "avoid some work". He chose to use real images as backgrounds after he saw Mo Willems' Knuffle Bunny in a book store. He then contacted Willems to design the characters <b>for</b> <b>Sit</b> Down, Shut Up. The images for the school were taken at a school next door to the Rough Draft Studios, the series' animation studio. Production of the series halted in June 2008, when the writers found out that they would be {{under the jurisdiction of the}} IATSE Animation Guild, instead of Writers Guild of America (WGA). A month later, the writers and the production company, Sony Pictures, reached an agreement saying that the writers would still be covered by the IATSE, but their contract would be the same as the WGA's in certain areas. This made Sit Down, Shut Up the only primetime animated series on Fox not to be covered by the WGA. During this process, head writer Bill Oakley left the series.|$|E

Members sabotaged factory equipment and broke into factory offices and trade union headquarters.

40|$|SummaryBoth {{rhinitis}} (ARIA) {{and asthma}} (GINA) guidelines recommend allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) {{tailored to the}} specific levels of severity of each disease. Real world studies evaluating congruence between these recommendations and prescribing practice in the single patient with comorbidity are lacking. An observational polycentric study {{was carried out in}} 518 patients recruited from 34 allergy centers throughout Italy. A questionnaire was administered to each consecutive patient over a span of four months. Taking into account guideline recommendations for both diseases, concomitant in the same patient, three subsets resulted: patients not eligible <b>for</b> <b>SIT</b> (11 %); patients eligible <b>for</b> <b>SIT</b> for one disease only (60 %); patients eligible <b>for</b> <b>SIT</b> for both diseases (29 %). SIT was prescribed in 257 (49. 6 %) subjects. The level of SIT prescription was about 50 % in all three groups. Consistent with the ARIA guidelines, a correlation between the prescription of SIT and the severity of rhinitis was documented (r= 0. 87; p= 0. 001). An association with asthma severity was found (p= 0. 02), but the trend was inconsistent with the GINA recommendations. Young age was the most important factor <b>for</b> <b>SIT</b> prescription both in the eligible for one disease and in the eligible for both diseases subset. The tendency towards worsening of symptoms was a factor <b>for</b> <b>SIT</b> in the eligible for one disease subset. In mite allergic patients with rhinitis and asthma comorbidity, the severity of rhinitis and the young age are the most important factors driving the SIT prescription. The congruence of SIT prescription was better for the ARIA than GINA guidelines...|$|E
