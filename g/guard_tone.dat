50|$|North American Bell 103-style modems (300 bit/s) were {{incompatible}} with UK in-band signalling (the modem tones would disconnect the call) unless a <b>guard</b> <b>tone</b> is provided. Most of these (now-obsolete) modems {{did not support}} any command set and were unusable for international calls.|$|E

50|$|The <b>guard</b> <b>tone</b> is {{sent by the}} {{answering}} modem after it has sent the answer tone. It is a single continuous tone with a frequency of either 1800 Hz or 550 Hz, sent {{at a level of}} -6dB or -3dB, respectively, below the level of the transmitted data signal power.|$|E
50|$|A {{refinement}} {{added to}} some System 4 blue boxes was an anti-acknowledgement-echo <b>guard</b> <b>tone.</b> Because {{the connection between}} the telephone and the telephone network is two-wire, but the signalling on the international circuit operates on a four-wire basis (totally separate send and receive paths), signal-acknowledgement tones (single pulses of one of the two frequencies from {{the far end of the}} circuit after receipt of each digit) tended to be reflected back at the four-wire/two-wire conversion point. Although these reflected signals were relatively faint, they were sometimes loud enough for the digit-receiving circuits at the far end to treat them as the first bit of the next digit, messing up the phreak's transmitted digits.|$|E
50|$|Level discipline, {{setting the}} tone output levels at the remote control, affects the {{reliability}} of a tone remote. Audio levels set too low may cause the transmitter to drop out when speech peaks occur. The combination of voice and signaling tones is supposed to lie in a balance. If everything is set ideally, a notch filter at the base station blocks the steady 2,175 Hz tone from going out on the air. Proper levels for tone remote systems are 0dbm for the high level tone, -10dbm for the function tone and -30dbm for the low level <b>guard</b> <b>tone</b> (Motorola's older manuals often confused technicians with some levels listed as high as +14dbm! Analog telephone circuits used by tone remote systems normally only allow 0dbm as a maximum) All levels are based on 600 ohm impedance termination at the radio itself and needed gain after a long circuit to bring the levels {{back up to the}} levels noted above.|$|E

5000|$|Tone remotes send {{commands}} to a base station using function tones, {{a series of}} two tones in sequence. The first tone is 2,175 Hz and is 100-300 milliseconds in length. The most common second tone is 1,950 Hz. The most commonly used tone sequence in tone remote controls is the channel 1 transmit command. The default for this command consists of a high-level 2,175 Hz followed by a lower-level 1,950 Hz. A continuous, low-level 2,175 Hz tone follows. Voice is multiplexed over the tone. So long as the 2,175 Hz tone is present, the transmitter remains on. An audio notch filter removes the 2,175 Hz low-level tone from the actual transmit audio. General Electric Mobile Radio called the high-level tone, '"Secur-it tone", and called the low-level tone [...] "hold tone." [...] In the industry, the low-level continuous tone is often called, low-level <b>guard</b> <b>tone.</b> The low-level tone is present {{at the same time}} as transmitted voice.|$|E
40|$|The {{underlying}} waveform {{has always}} been a shaping factor for each generation of the cellular networks, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for the 4 th generation cellular networks (4 G). To meet the diversified and pronounced expectations upon the upcoming 5 G cellular networks, here we present an enabler for flexible waveform configuration, named as filtered-OFDM (f-OFDM). With the conventional OFDM, a unified numerology is applied across the bandwidth provided, balancing among the channel characteristics and the service requirements, and the spectrum efficiency is limited by the compromise we made. In contrast, with f-OFDM, the assigned bandwidth is split up into several subbands, and different types of services are accommodated in different subbands with the most suitable waveform and numerology, leading to an improved spectrum utilization. After outlining the general framework of f-OFDM, several important design aspects are also discussed, including filter design and <b>guard</b> <b>tone</b> arrangement. In addition, an extensive comparison among the existing 5 G waveform candidates is also included to illustrate the advantages of f-OFDM. Our simulations indicate that, in a specific scenario with four distinct types of services, f-OFDM provides up to 46 % of throughput gains over the conventional OFDM scheme.

The direst of all terrors was in possession of her--terror of the unknown. There was no fear of her interfering, and no fear of her hearing what they said so long as they were careful to speak in <b>guarded</b> <b>tones.</b> Julian set the example by lowering his voice.|$|R
60|$|About {{two hours}} after Sir Percival rose from the luncheon-table to receive his solicitor, Mr. Merriman, in the library, I left my room alone {{to take a walk}} in the plantations.

Thinking it best not to disturb them by {{appearing}} on the stairs, I resolved to defer going down till they had crossed the hall. Although they spoke to each other in <b>guarded</b> <b>tones,</b> their words were pronounced with sufficient distinctness of utterance to reach my ears.|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”Efficient pilot {{designs are}} vital as they improve system {{performance}} and resource utilization, especially in multiinput multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency divison multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Most {{of the existing}} pilot designs do not consider in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalance whose detrimental effects become more severe since the technology and applications are pushing towards smaller semiconductor node, smaller chip, cheaper equipment, and larger modulation order. This paper studies the impact of I/Q imbalance on the pilot designs, and presents several new pilot designs for equivalent channel estimation of MIMO OFDM systems with frequencydependent I/Q imbalances. Advantages of the proposed designs are illustrated through simulation and analytical results in terms of estimation accuracy, error rate, overhead efficiency, and generality with the transmission formats (preamble-based or pilot-data-multiplexed systems, with or without null <b>guard</b> <b>tones).</b> I...|$|R
50|$|Mobiles would {{originate}} calls {{by sending}} a burst of connect tone, to which the base station responded with a burst of seize tone. The mobile would then respond with its identification, consisting of its area code and last four digits of the phone number sent at 20 pulses per second, just as in inward dialing but {{with the addition of}} rudimentary parity checking. Digits are formed with a pulsetrain of alternating tones, either connect and silence (for odd digits) or connect and guard (for even digits). When the base station received the calling party's identification, it would send dialtone to the mobile. The user would then use the rotary dial, which would send the dialed digits as an alternating 10 pps pulse train (originally, directly formed by the rotary dial) of connect and <b>guard</b> <b>tones.</b>|$|R
60|$|As they {{approached}} nearer and nearer {{to what was}} conceived {{to be the most}} critical point in the passage, the canoes got closer together; so close, indeed, that le Bourdon and Gershom might communicate in very <b>guarded</b> <b>tones.</b> The utmost care was taken to avoid making any noise, since a light and careless blow from a paddle, {{on the side of a}} canoe, would be almost certain, now, to betray them. Margery and Dorothy could no longer control their feelings, and each rose in her seat, raising her body so as to bring her head above the gunwale of the canoe, if a bark canoe can be said to have a gunwale at all. They even whispered to each other, endeavoring to glean encouragement by sympathy. At this instant occurred the crisis in their attempt to escape.|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”Multiple input {{multiple}} output (MIMO) orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) systems facilitate {{high data rate}} wireless communications, and require reliable channel estimates to fully materialize their advantages. The semiconductor downscaling trend has exacerbated device impairments such as inphase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalances which cause inter-carrier interferences in OFDM systems which cannot be remedied by increasing signal power. Different RF chains of MIMO branches can cause different I/Q imbalances which further complicates MIMO OFDM channel estimation. This paper proposes several pilot designs for the estimation of the combined responses of MIMO frequency-selective channels and frequency-dependent I/Q imbalances. The proposed designs require much smaller pilot overhead than the existing designs, and also provide estimation mean-squares error optimality (under white noise) and general applicability to preamble as well as pilot-data-multiplexed symbols in MIMO systems with or without null <b>guard</b> <b>tones.</b> Performance analyses and simulation results corroborate advantages of the proposed designs.

60|$|The Pathfinder had {{no sooner}} given these {{directions}} than the near approach of their enemies rendered profound silence necessary. The Iroquois {{in the river}} were slowly descending the stream; keeping of necessity near the bushes which overhung the water, while the rustling of leaves and the snapping of twigs soon gave fearful evidence that another party was moving along the bank, at an equally graduated pace; and directly abreast of them. In consequence of {{the distance between the}} bushes planted by the fugitives and the true shore, the two parties became visible to each other when opposite that precise point. Both stopped, and a conversation ensued, that may be said to have passed directly over the heads of those who were concealed. Indeed, nothing sheltered the travellers but the branches and leaves of plants, so pliant that they yielded to every current of air, and which a puff of wind a little stronger than common would have blown away. Fortunately the line of sight carried the eyes of the two parties of savages, whether they stood in the water or on the land, above the bushes, and the leaves appeared blended in a way to excite no suspicion. Perhaps the very boldness of the expedient alone prevented an immediate exposure. The conversation which took place was conducted earnestly, but in <b>guarded</b> <b>tones,</b> as if those who spoke wished to defeat the intentions of any listeners. It was in a dialect that both the Indian warriors beneath, as well as the Pathfinder, understood. Even Jasper comprehended a portion of what was said.|$|R
5000|$|Gentleness is {{a strong}} hand with a soft touch. It is a tender, {{compassionate}} approach toward others' weaknesses and limitations.

[...] "When my daughter was young, she used to love to squeeze my hand {{as hard as she}} could, trying to make it hurt. She could squeeze with all her might, but it never hurt.

60|$|And {{then she}} told me, as we sat by the fire and hearkened to the rising gusts, of how this change had fallen upon my uncle. All last winter he had been dark and fitful in his mind. Whenever the Roost ran high, or, as Mary said, {{whenever}} the Merry Men were dancing, he would lie out for hours together on the Head, if it were at night, or {{on the top of}} Aros by day, watching the tumult of the sea, and sweeping the horizon for a sail. After February the tenth, when the wealth-bringing wreck was cast ashore at Sandag, he had been at first unnaturally gay, and his excitement had never fallen in degree, but only changed in kind from dark to darker. He neglected his work, and kept Rorie idle. They two would speak together by the hour at the gable end, in <b>guarded</b> <b>tones</b> and with an air of secrecy and almost of guilt; and if she questioned either, as at first she sometimes did, her inquiries were put aside with confusion. Since Rorie had first remarked the fish that hung about the ferry, his master had never set foot but once upon the mainland of the Ross. That once--it was in the height of the springs--he had passed dryshod while the tide was out; but, having lingered overlong on the far side, found himself cut off from Aros by the returning waters. It was with a shriek of agony that he had leaped across the gut, and he had reached home thereafter in a fever- fit of fear. A fear of the sea, a constant haunting thought of the sea, appeared in his talk and devotions, and even in his looks when he was silent.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Brent {{collaborated with}} Nova Scotia-based luthier Brian Dean {{to design a}} grand concert {{mandolin}} he named 'PÃ¤hkinÃ¤', which is Finnish for 'nut', {{a reference to the}} walnut top of the instrument. Among the instrument's many distinctive features are the walnut/maple/spruce wood combination, a zero fret, a semi-lute construction with minimal bracing, a built-in <b>tone</b> <b>guard</b> with a sound pressure relief hole cut into the back, and ornate f-holes which reach around the sides of the instrument. Dean has since built a 10-string version of this model nicknamed 'KumÃ­', which is currently Brent's primary acoustic instrument. In 2016, Vermont-based luthier Adam Buchwald built him a 5-string, fanned fret electric mandolin.|$|R
60|$|The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, {{were still}} more easily recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, {{from that of}} the desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief, gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the {{scrupulously}} inornate clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them;--a <b>guarded</b> lowness of <b>tone</b> in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.--Very often, in company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon the public in two battalions--that of the dandies and that of the military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and smiles; of the second frogged coats and frowns.|$|R
