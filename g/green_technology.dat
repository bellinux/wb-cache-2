2500|$|Social ecologists, also {{considered}} {{a kind of}} socialist anarchist, often criticize the main currents of anarchism for their focus and debates about politics and economics instead of a focus on eco-system (human and environmental). This theory promotes libertarian municipalism and <b>green</b> <b>technology.</b> Anarcho-primitivists often criticize mainstream anarchism for supporting civilization and modern technology which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation. [...] They instead advocate the process of rewilding or reconnecting with the natural environment. Veganarchism is the political philosophy of veganism (more specifically animal liberation) and green anarchism. This encompasses viewing the state as unnecessary and harmful to both human and animals, whilst practising a vegan diet.|$|E

40|$|Competences for <b>green</b> <b>technologies</b> in Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs) are {{becoming}} increasingly urgent from a global perspective. We define NIC as countries which undergo rapid economic growth with a corresponding change in economic structure from mostly agricultural societies to a society dominated by the industrial sector and increasing services. <b>Green</b> <b>technologies</b> open up opportunities for reducing emissions; the prospect of exporting them can provide incentives for NICs to develop them as key technologies for their economies. In addition, this could trigger further demand for <b>green</b> <b>technologies</b> in both low-income economies and traditional member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In order to assess the challenges associated with this, a benchmarking exercise is performed and its benefits and limitations discussed. From a conceptual point of view, technological benchmarking of <b>green</b> <b>technologies</b> (sustainability benchmarking) can be distinguished from capability benchmarking. For both types of benchmarking, a top-down perspective (overall level of the economy) and a sectoral bottom-up perspective (focusing on the important field of industrial energy efficiency technologies) is taken. Traditional OECD countries and Newly Industrializing Countries are benchmarked in this process, complemented with a look, in selected cases, to low-income economies. We focus on energy-related <b>green</b> <b>technologies</b> though a broader view occurs also on other <b>green</b> <b>technologies</b> like material efficiency or water efficiency. The empirical analysis shows {{a wide range of}} results. From a top-down view, {{it can be seen that}} some NICs have been catching up and are in the same benchmark clusters as a variety of traditional OECD countries. In the more detailed bottom-up view, this trend is also starting for industrial energy efficiency technologies; however it is not as pronounced yet, as on the more aggregated level of all <b>green</b> <b>technologies.</b> The comparisons between capability benchmarking and sustainability benchmarking show some parallels, but also differences. By and large, countries with a higher capability are also receiving a higher evaluation with regard to sustainability benchmarking. However, the variations within each capability cluster and group also show that other factors are important. Looking into these factors and their role for explaining the differences and dynamics for green innovation, provides room for further research...|$|R
