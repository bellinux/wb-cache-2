The salivary cortisol and ratings of stress, sleepiness and fatigue were followed at three hour intervals in 25 sound engineers: 13 working very fast forward-rotating shifts and 12 working very fast backward-rotating shifts. Cortisol was assessed with radioimmunological kits. The participants reported for stress symptoms and filled sleep diary. Cortisol retained the typical diurnal pattern. The rotation direction interacted with the shift significantly {{and as a result}} higher cortisol values during the morning and night shifts in the backward rotating group were found as well as worse quality of sleep. Higher salivary cortisol during morning and night shifts and worse quality of sleep in engineers working very fast backward-rotating shifts may be an indication for insufficient recovery.

The {{analysis}} focused upon a variety of the topic opening markers, their frequency, and correlations between them and types of topic shift. As a result, six kinds of topic opening markers were observed.

40|$|Objective: To prospectively {{study the}} {{association}} of night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change and lifestyle behaviors. Methods: Workers participating in the Netherlands Working Conditions Cohort Study (2008 and 2009) (N = 5951) reported night and <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> weight and height. Groups included stable night or <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> from day work to night or <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> from night or <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> to day work, and no night or <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in 2008 and 2009. Regression analyses were used to study association changes in night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change and changes in lifestyle behaviors. Results: A larger weight change was seen in normal-weight workers changing from day to <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> ([beta] = 0. 93 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 01 to 1. 85) compared with stable no shift workers.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} find out the work load of matrons under <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in a special nursing home for the elderly (SNH), six healthy female matrons volunteered to {{participate}} in the present study. For each subject, care working time, heart rate, walking steps, estimated energy expenditure and working time in different postures were determined during day <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (540 min) and night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (960 min). Although the time on duty, working and recess were significantly longer in night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> than day <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> the percentages of working and recess time to duty time were nearly the same regardless of <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> The longest care <b>work</b> in each <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was individual care of residents in the SNH.

40|$|<b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> is a {{major feature}} of modern work practices. It {{involves}} individuals working at times considered unconventional for most workers, such as at night. Although the community often benefits from such <b>work</b> practices, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> can be hazardous, for both the workers and the community. The thesis reviews the main problems of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> especially when involving night work. These are: an increased risk for accidents and errors; increased sleepiness and fatigue due to difficulties sleeping; increased health problems; and disruption to family and social life. Strategies to limit the risk associated with these hazards are also reviewed, and include using knowledge of circadian principles to plan shift schedules, sleeping schedules and meal times; planned napping; consideration of the work environment; and newer techniques such as using bright lights and melatonin. While this information is known to the research community, it has not filtered down to many <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> workplaces and thus has had little if any positive effect on actual <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> practices. For a change in <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> practices to occur, the research knowledge must become available to every <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> workplace, as must some incentive or motivation to ensure that workplaces make the necessary changes. The Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) laws provide such a framework.

Using a recently developed exposure assessment tool, this study examined the association between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity among Canadian women from two studies: a cohort of university alumni, and a population-based study. Self-administered questionnaire data were used from healthy, currently employed females in a population-based study, the Ontario Women's Diet and Health case-control study (n = 1611 controls), and from a subset of a of university alumni from the Canadian Study of Diet, Lifestyle, and Health (n = 1097) cohort study. Overweight was defined as BMI≥ 25 to < 30, and obesity as BMI≥ 30. Reported occupation was converted to occupational codes and linked to a probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> value derived from Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics data. Regular evenings, nights, or rotating <b>work</b> comprised <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> Polytomous logistic regression estimated the association between probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> categorized as near nil, low, medium, and high probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> on overweight and obesity, controlling for detected confounders. In the population-based sample, high probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was associated with obesity (reference = near nil probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> OR: 1. 88, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 3. 51, p = 0. 047). In the alumni cohort, no significant association was detected between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and overweight or obesity. As these analyses found a positive association between high probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> exposure and obesity in a population-based sample, but not in an alumni cohort, it is suggested that the relationship between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity is complex, and may be particularly susceptible to occupational and education-related factors within a given population...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: While {{some studies}} have {{suggested}} associations between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity, few have been population-based or considered multiple shift schedules. Since obesity is linked with several chronic health conditions, understanding which types of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> influence obesity is important and additional work with more detailed exposure assessment of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is warranted. Methods: Using multivariate polytomous logistic regression, we investigated the associations between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (evening/night, rotating and other shift schedules) and overweight and obesity as measured by body mass index cross-sectionally among 1561 men. These men had previously participated as population controls in a prostate cancer case-control study conducted in northeastern Ontario from 1995 to 1999. We obtained information on <b>work</b> history (including <b>shift</b> <b>work),</b> height and weight from the existing self-reported questionnaire data. Results: We observed an association for ever (vs. never) having been employed in rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> for both the overweight (OR [odds ratio] = 1. 34; 95 % CI [confidence interval]: 1. 05 – 1. 73) and obese (OR = 1. 57; 95 % CI: 1. 12 – 2. 21) groups. We also observed nonsignificant associations for ever (vs. never) having been employed in permanent evening/night shifts. In addition, we found a significant trend of increased risk for both overweight and obesity with increasing duration of rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> Conclusion: Both the positive association between rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity and the suggested positive association for permanent evening/night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> {{in this study are}} consistent with previous findings. Future population-based research that is able to build on our results while examining additional <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> characteristics will further clarify whether some shift patterns have a greater impact on obesity than others...|$|R

40|$|Background. <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> is {{associated}} with sleep and health problems. Tolerance to <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is reported to decrease with age. <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> tolerance {{should be considered in}} different <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> populations. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship between age, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> exposure, <b>shift</b> type, and morningness and sleep/health problems in oil rig shift workers. Material and methods. A total of 199 workers participated. They worked either two weeks of 12 -h day shifts (n = 96) or two weeks of swing shifts (n = 103) (one week of 12 -h night shifts followed by one week of 12 -h day shifts), followed by four weeks off work. The workers filled out questionnaires on demographics, work, sleep, and health. Results. We found no significant associations between age or years of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> exposure and any of the sleep, sleepiness, or health parameters. There was a significant association between shift type and sleep duration, showing that swing shift workers had longer sleep duration than day shift workers. In addition, we found a significant association between the interaction age*, shift type, and sleep duration, where sleep duration was negatively associated with age for the swing shift workers and positively associated with age for the day shift workers. There were significant associations between morningness and sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and insomnia. Conclusions. Older workers may tolerate <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> well. Age, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> exposure time, and shift type seemed not to affect <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> tolerance in this population.

40|$|Background: Environmental factors play a {{prominent}} role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) aetiology. <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> has previously been associated with increased RA risk in females. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential association, including a dose-response association, between permanent night <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and day-oriented <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and risk of developing anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) -positive and ACPA-negative RA. Methods: The present report is based on a population-based, case-control study with incident cases of RA (1951 cases and 2225 controls matched by age, gender and residential area). Using logistic regression, occurrence of RA among subjects who have been exposed to different kinds of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was compared with that among those who have never been exposed by calculating the OR with a 95 % CI. Results: Rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and day-oriented <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> increased the risk of developing ACPA-positive RA (OR 1. 3, 95 %[*]CI 1. 0 to 1. 7 and OR 1. 3, 95 %[*]CI 1. 0 to 1. 6), but not ACPA-negative RA. Permanent night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> appeared to be a protective factor both against ACPA-positive RA (OR 0. 7, 95 %[*]CI 0. 6 to 0. 9) and ACPA-negative RA (OR 0. 8, 95 %[*]CI 0. 6 to 1. 0). For both subsets of RA, significant trends showed a lower risk of developing RA with increasing duration of permanent night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (p value for trend 0. 002 vs 0. 04). Conclusions: Sleep restriction as a consequence of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is associated with several biological effects among which changes in melatonin production may be involved.

40|$|CONTEXT: Although the {{metabolic}} {{health effects of}} <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> have been extensively studied, a systematic synthesis of the available research is lacking. This review aimed to systematically summarize the available evidence of longitudinal studies linking <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with metabolic risk factors. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search was performed in 2015. Studies were included if (1) they had a longitudinal design; (2) <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was studied as the exposure; and (3) the outcome involved a metabolic risk factor, including anthropometric, blood glucose, blood lipid, or blood pressure measures. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eligible studies were assessed for their methodologic quality in 2015. A best-evidence synthesis was used to draw conclusions per outcome. Thirty-nine articles describing 22 studies were included. Strong evidence was found for a relation between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and increased body weight/BMI, risk for overweight, and impaired glucose tolerance. For the remaining outcomes, there was insufficient evidence. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> seems {{to be associated with}} body weight gain, risk for overweight, and impaired glucose tolerance. Overall, lack of high-methodologic quality studies and inconsistency in findings led to insufficient evidence in assessing the relation between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and other metabolic risk factors. To strengthen the evidence, more high-quality longitudinal studies that provide more information on the <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> schedule (e. g., frequency of night shifts, duration in years) are needed. Further, research to the (mediating) role of lifestyle behaviors in the health effects of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is recommended, as this may offer potential for preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> is a {{defining}} occupational feature of nursing and midwifery professions. It has various adverse effects that could ultimately affect building {{and maintaining a}} healthy nursing and midwifery workforce. Firstly, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> interrupts people‟s daily routines; therefore, it may lead to poorer lifestyle factors that increase one‟s risk of being overweight or obese. Secondly, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> {{is reported to be}} one of the occupational risk factors for low back pain, which is a common problem among nurses. Aim This research aims to examine the association between <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> body mass index(BMI) and low back pain (LBP) among nurses and midwives recruited from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Methods To understand the impact of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> on BMI, both cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies were undertaken using data from the Nurses and Midwives‟ e-cohort Study (NMes). The NMeS is a longitudinal population-based study recruiting nurses and midwives from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom; and it is conducted completely electronically from recruitment to follow-up. There were 10, 120 total registrants, of whom, 7604 registrants completed survey 1 and 5280 registrants completed survey 2. The average follow-up period was two years. Two cross-sectional studies were carried out to explore the effects of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in general and specific shift types (rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and night-only <b>shift</b> <b>work)</b> on BMI. A longitudinal cohort study was undertaken to better understand the causal relationship between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and BMI. Similarly, a second longitudinal study was conducted to investigate the association between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and LBP, which also included an interaction analysis of the combining effects of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and overweight/obesity on LBP. Detailed statistical methods used for each study were discussed in each paper. Results The results from the two cross-sectional studies showed that almost 60 % of the recruited nurses and midwives were overweight or obese. Shift workers were at higher risk of being overweight and obese compared to day workers (aRR: 1. 15, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 28, p = 0. 013; aRR: 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 30, p = 0. 02, respectively). Regarding the specific shift types, rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was found to be associated with both overweight and obesity (aRR: 1. 02, 95 % CI 1. 004 – 1. 03 p = 0. 007; aRR: 1. 02, 95 % CI 1. 004 – 1. 04, p = 0. 02, respectively); and night-only <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was only found to be associated with obesity (aRR: 1. 02, 95 % CI 1. 002 – 1. 04, p = 0. 031), but not associated with being overweight. The adjusted relative risk (1. 02) was small, which may not reflect clinical significance although the results were statistically significance. Furthermore, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is consisted of many different kinds of schedules including rotating shift and night-only shift. Therefore, it was decided to further test the association between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in general (including any kind of shift schedules) and BMI using a longitudinal study design, which found a decrease in BMI among those participants who maintained day work and especially among those who changed from <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> at Survey One (S 1) to day work at Survey Two (S 2) (decrease in BMI of 3. 02) during the two years‟ follow up; an increase in BMI among those participants who maintained <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and those who changed from day work at S 1 to <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> at S 2 (p < 0. 001). These studies demonstrate that <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is significantly associated with overweight/obesity/increase in BMI; and overweight or obesity is reported to have an impact on LBP. Therefore, in the longitudinal study of examining the association between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and LBP, the impact of the interaction between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and overweight/obesity on LBP was also examined. The results showed that shift workers were at higher risks of developing LBP compared to day workers (aOR: 1. 15, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 40, p = 0. 03). The [shift schedule * BMI classification] interaction showed that shift workers who were overweight and obese were more likely to develop LBP than day workers (overweight: aOR: 1. 23, p < 0. 01; obesity: aOR: 1. 34, p < 0. 01). Conclusion Shift workers were at higher risk of being overweight or obese and developing LBP compared to day workers. Whilst <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> cannot be avoided in nurses and midwives, interventions targeting weight reduction and LBP prevention should be tailored to the specific work settings. If the adverse effects of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> can be mitigated with strategic intervention, the potential workforce implications of these morbidities may be prevented...|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> sleep disorder are insomnia and excessive sleepiness associated with working (and sleeping) at non-standard times. <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> sleep disorder is {{also associated with}} falling asleep at work.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{information}} technology (IT) professionals’ perception towards shift-based work pattern used by globally distributed software development (GDSD) firms in Sri Lanka, in terms of the effects of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> on them and strategies they used to cope with <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A self-administered survey questionnaire was chosen as the mode for data collection. Descriptive statistics and factor analysis were used for data analysis. Findings – The findings led to identifying the characteristics of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> environment, benefits and drawbacks of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> for IT professionals, strategies used by IT professionals to cope with <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> and their overall evaluation of the <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> environment. Research limitations/implications – The results of the questionnaire survey provided access to breadth of experience. If qualitative data had also been obtained they could have provided depth by adding insight and substance to the questionnaire survey. Practical implications – The findings of the study suggest that <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> creates problems for IT professionals’ health that call for improvements in the areas that are deleterious while retaining or enhancing those that are beneficial for the shift-based workforce. Social implications – The paper provides an understanding of the consequences of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> for the rhythm of minds and bodies, families and social lives and the routines of rest of the community, and ways to cope with <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> may help the industry to flourish at large. Originality/value – Minimal literature has been found specific to the cohort of IT professionals engaged full-time in GDSD on shift basis with respect to their view of it and issues related to their employment arrangement. It is expected that the findings of this study will provide insight into benefits, challenges and issues associated with <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> to allow individuals and organizational leaders to better understand and utilize shift-based work pattern in GDSD. Further, it is expected that the findings of this study will be a source of general guidance in stimulating future research in this area...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the cases of}} 3 female health operators with implanted copper IUDs, developing menometrorrhagia some months after an increase of the working time in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Unit (1. 5 T), that progressively disappeared when the previous organization, involving <b>discontinuous</b> <b>work</b> <b>shifts</b> at MRI, was re-established. No known factors possibly related to menometrorrhagia were evidenced in the 3 operators, supporting the hypothesis of a role of the exposure to the electromagnetic fields (EMF) induced by the MRI system in symptoms induction. The possible mechanism remains unsettled, but menometrorrhagia might be triggered by a phlogistic stimulus caused by EMF, possibly the low-frequency currents induced in the wires of the IUD during {{the movements of the}} operator inside the static magnetic field generated by the MRI permanent magnet. Until now, the problem of possible interactions between copper IUDs and EMF induced by MRI has been considered in patients undergoing imaging, but the possible risk in MRI Units operators has been largely neglected. To our knowledge, the occurrence of menometrorrhagia is not routinely checked in health surveillance of MRI operators, so these symptoms can pass unnoticed, especially if they are transitory. Therefore, underreporting is rather possible. The cases described here support the need for further research on this topic, especially considering the progressive diffusion of more powerful MRI scanners (3 T and more), and of the interventional magnetic resonance imaging, both potentially involving higher EMF exposures, and a large number of MRI female operators, possibly using IUDs. The possibility that MRI operators with implanted metallic IUDs can be included in the group of "workers at particular risk" according to the EU Directive 2004 / 40 /EC should be considered...|$|R

The relation between rotating night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and ischemic stroke is unclear. The Nurses’ Health Study, an ongoing cohort study of registered female nurses, assessed in 1988 {{the total number of}} years the nurses had <b>worked</b> rotating night <b>shifts.</b> The majority (69 %) of stroke outcomes from 1988 to 2004 were confirmed by physician chart review. The authors used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relation between years of rotating night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and ischemic stroke, adjusting for multiple vascular risk factors. Of 80, 108 subjects available for analysis, 60 % reported at least 1 year of rotating night <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> There were 1, 660 ischemic strokes. Rotating night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was associated with a 4 % increased risk of ischemic stroke for every 5 years (hazard ratio[*]=[*] 1. 04, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 01, 1. 07; Ptrend[*]=[*] 0. 01). This increase in risk was similar when limited to the 1, 152 confirmed ischemic strokes (hazard ratio[*]=[*] 1. 03, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 99, 1. 07; Ptrend[*]=[*] 0. 10) and may be confined to women with a history of 15 or more years of rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> Women appear to have a modestly increased risk of stroke after extended periods of rotating night <b>shift</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examined}} the relationship between perceived adaptation to <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and shift-related problems. A total of 608 male operators at nuclear power plants completed a set of validated questionnaires including {{a modified version of the}} Standard Shiftwork Index, which covered adaptation to <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> fit to job content, chronotypes, chronic fatigue, sleep, naps, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> locus of control (SHLOC), psychological health, social/family life, daytime sleepiness, workload, alertness on the job, and lifestyle factors. Participants were divided into two groups according to their perceived level of adaptation to <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> The good adaptation group showed better outcomes than the poor adaptation group in terms of fit to job content, chronic fatigue, daytime sleep before night shifts, social and family disruption, SHLOC, psychological health, and alertness during night shifts (ps< 0. 001). Operators who reported good adaptation also took a more frequent, longer nap and more cigarettes during night shifts (ps< 0. 05).
