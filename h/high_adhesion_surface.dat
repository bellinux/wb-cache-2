40|$|Ice {{adhesion}} {{is mainly}} dictated by surface properties, and water wettability is frequently correlated with ice adhesion strength. However, these established correlations {{are limited to}} <b>high</b> ice <b>adhesion</b> and become invalid when the ice adhesion strength is low. Here we carried out an experimental study to explore the relationships between low ice adhesion strength and room temperature surface properties. A variety of room temperature properties of 22 polymer-based hydrophilic and hydrophobic samples consisting of both low and <b>high</b> ice <b>adhesion</b> <b>surfaces</b> were analysed. The properties investigated include water adhesion force, water wettability, roughness, elastic modulus and hardness. Our results show that low ice adhesion strength does not correlate well with water contact angle and its variants, surface roughness and hardness. Low elastic modulus does not guarantee low ice <b>adhesion,</b> however, <b>surfaces</b> with low ice adhesion always show low elastic modulus. Low ice adhesion (below 60 kPa) of tested surfaces may be determinative of small water adhesion force (from 180 to 270 [*]μN). Therefore, measurement of water adhesion force may provide an effective strategy for screening anti-icing or icephobic surfaces, and surfaces within specific values of water adhesion force will possibly lead to a low ice adhesion...|$|R

Methods. Eight RP patients suffering from VMT {{were evaluated by}} means of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), anterior and posterior binocular examination, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), MP- 1 microperimetry (MP- 1), and full-field electroretinogram (ERG), before MIVS and ILM peeling and during the 36 -month follow-up.

Surgical procedure was performed following this schedule: surgical removal of crystalline lens (MICS), MIVS with 23 -gauge sutureless system trocars, core vitreous body removal, and balanced-sterile- salin-solution- (BSS-) air-gas (SF 6) exchange. Results. All patients presented visual acuity (VA) increase after MIVS. None of the patients developed ocular hypertension or vitreomacular adhesions during the 3 -year follow-up.

The highly stretchable wrinkled structure, which has been treated using both O 2 plasma and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solution methods, has been processed to produce <b>high</b> <b>adhesion</b> between the <b>surfaces</b> to prevent the metal from slipping off the flexible substrate. Therefore, there is no cracking or deformation of the metal bonding to the wrinkled structure when the micro/nano-electrodes are subject to stretching, bending, or even twisting. The prevalent material combination of silver as the conductor and PDMS as the flexible substrate has been chosen to explore the possibilities for development of strain-independent micro-electrode conductive wires. Silver, which is a commonly used conductor in flexible and microelectromechanical structure (MEMS) devices, has been used and studied extensively [11].

Moreover, biofilm matrices were also evaluated in terms of proteins and carbohydrates. Regarding <b>adhesion</b> to biotic <b>surfaces,</b> the interaction of C. tropicalis with host cells was determined using three different human epithelial cell lines: TCC-SUP (urinary bladder); HeLa (cervical carcinoma) and Caco- 2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma). Specifically, the degree of human cells damage and activity reduction induced by C. tropicalis adhesion and the role of Candida tropicalis aspartyl proteinases (SAPT) genes expression were assessed. Additionally, the influence of C. tropicalis biofilm cells with different ages (24 - 120 h) on TCC-SUP cells integrity was also studied. Another important Candida factor is its resistance to antifungal agents, which was also assessed and related with the expression of enzymes and hyphae formation. In summary, C. tropicalis strains were able to form biofilms in AU, in static or dynamic mode, although, with differences among strains. It is important to emphasize that human cells response to C. tropicalis adhesion, as well as SAPs production, is strain and cell line dependent. Additionally, it should be highlighted that C. tropicalis cells detached from biofilms are able to colonize human cells and cause injury and reduction of metabolic activity. In addition SAPT 3 was highly expressed compared to other SAPT genes.

Our force-distance curve shows that during chondrogenic differentiation, adhesion force gradually increases to the maximum at the 12 th day, but this value is slightly {{lower than that of}} NC, and then the value decreases as differentiation continues. Adhesion force corresponds to the change of R a. Our data demonstrate a trend of adhesion force that is in accordance with R a in the process of chondrogenic differentiation. Quantity and distribution of cell surface proteins directly affects R a data[25]. Surface particle numbers increased, causing the cell membrane to be uneven and rough thereby increasing R a.
