5|$|Modern cottage garden {{plants are}} {{typically}} flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use <b>heirloom</b> or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these {{may not have}} been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants. In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, modern roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with modern virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance. Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though many of the old favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world.|$|E
