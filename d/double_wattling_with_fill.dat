50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>wattled</b> {{cassowary}} (Casuarius casuarius) is {{the most}} popular species in captivity and it is fairly common in European and American zoos, where it is known for its unmistakable appearance. Only Weltvogelpark Walsrode has all three species of cassowary in its collection, with the others being the single wattled cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus) and Bennett's cassowary (Casuarius bennetti), both of which are endemic to the tropical rainforest of New Guinea. The second is the smallest species and also known as the dwarf cassowary. If subspecies are recognized, Weltvogelpark Walsrode has Casuarius bennettii westermanni and Casuarius unappendiculatus rufotinctus.|$|R
25|$|During winter insects, {{birds and}} {{marsupials}} are {{hosted by the}} black <b>wattle</b> <b>with</b> the aid of their supplies of nectar in their leaf axials. These creatures provide an important predatory role to deal with tree die back caused by scarab beetles and pasture pests.|$|R
6000|$|The {{chickens}} chirped incredulously, {{and passed}} on. The insulted bird reddened in the <b>wattles</b> <b>with</b> indignation, and strutting {{up to the}} patriarch of the entire barn-yard, repeated his assertion. The patriarch nodded gravely, as if the feat were an every-day affair, and the other continued: ...|$|R

25|$|The Australian Defence Medal is a {{circular}} medal of cupro-nickel. The obverse features a stylised {{version of the}} Commonwealth Coat of Arms (as used on the Australia Service Medal 1939–45) with a sprig of <b>wattle</b> <b>with</b> the top outer edge inscribed with the words ‘The Australian Defence Medal’.|$|R
50|$|The North Island kōkako, Callaeas wilsoni has blue wattles (although this colour {{develops}} with age: in {{the young}} of this bird they are actually coloured a light pink). The South Island kōkako, Callaeas cinereus, by contrast has largely orange <b>wattles,</b> <b>with</b> only {{a small patch of}} blue at the base.|$|R
5000|$|A few {{species are}} widely grown as ornamentals in gardens; {{the most popular}} perhaps is A. dealbata (silver <b>wattle),</b> <b>with</b> its {{attractive}} glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is erroneously known as [...] "mimosa" [...] in some areas where it is cultivated, through confusion with the related genus Mimosa.|$|R

6000|$|During {{the course}} of the gale nearly the whole length of the hempen cable, of 120 fathoms, was veered out, besides the chain-moorings, and, for its preservation, the cable was {{carefully}} [...] "served", or <b>wattled,</b> <b>with</b> pieces of canvas round the windlass, and with leather well greased in the hawse-hole, where the chafing was most violent.|$|R
5000|$|Sunday Island {{vegetation}} includes {{stands of}} manna gum, coastal banksia, coastal tea tree and golden <b>wattle,</b> <b>with</b> tussock grass and bracken. The island supports swamp wallabies {{as well as}} managed populations of the introduced hog deer and fallow deer. [...] The surrounding intertidal mudflats form an important feeding habitat for thousands of migratory waders that visit Corner Inlet each year.|$|R
50|$|The oak frame, {{typical of}} the period, rests on a base of red {{sandstone}} surrounded by a now dry moat. The main beams of the house are stiffened with smaller timbers and <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>wattle</b> and daub.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are seven}} ringforts {{surrounding}} Aughnacliffe, of which Sonnagh {{is the best}} preserved; they are better thought of as protected homesteads rather than military structures. While house type varied, most were made of wood and were usually of post and wattle construction. The walls of the houses consisted of a <b>double</b> row of <b>wattle</b> spaced about 20cm apart <b>with</b> a cavity <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> straw and bracken for insulation. The roof was thatched with straw and held up with wooden posts. The fort's walls gives their name to the townland: sonnach is Irish for [...] "palisade." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{was buried}} in a grave {{especially}} arranged by the men he had commanded — situated beneath a clump of Australian <b>wattles,</b> <b>with</b> a large wooden cross bearing his name at its head — with full military honours in a ceremony, attended by his commanding officer Colonel Campbell and his staff, representatives {{of all of the}} regiments comprising the Sixth W.A.M.I., conducted by regimental chaplain and Reid's old friend, Mr. Collick.|$|R
50|$|Māori myth {{refers to}} the kōkako in several stories. In one notable story, a kōkako gave Māui water as he fought the sun by <b>filling</b> its plump <b>wattles</b> <b>with</b> water and {{offering}} it to Māui to quench his thirst. Māui rewarded kōkako for its kindness by stretching its legs until they were lean, long and strong, so that kōkako could easily leap through the forest to find food.|$|R
5000|$|The {{houses and}} {{buildings}} {{of ordinary people}} were typically timber framed. The frame was usually <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>wattle</b> and daub but occasionally with brick. [...] These houses were also slower to adopt the latest trends, and the great hall continued to prevail.|$|R
50|$|The South Island kōkako (Callaeas cinereus) is a perhaps-extinct forest bird {{endemic to}} the South Island of New Zealand. Unlike its close {{relative}} the North Island kõkako it had largely orange <b>wattles,</b> <b>with</b> {{only a small}} patch of blue at the base, and was also known as the orange-wattled crow (though it was not a corvid). The last accepted sighting in 2007 was the first considered genuine since 1967, although there have been several other unauthenticated reports.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a large}} bird, some 63-74 cm in length, {{and similar}} in general {{appearance}} to a slim turkey with thin neck and small head. Pipile jacutinga is mainly black with a bluish gloss; it has a conspicuous white wing patch bearing 3 neat rows of tiny black dots. The large crest is whitish, {{and it has a}} red throat <b>wattle</b> <b>with</b> a dark blue patch at the front. Its naked whitish eye-ring and black-feathered face and forehead are unique in its genus. The legs and feet are red.|$|R

50|$|Acacia euthycarpa is a shrub {{or small}} tree species that is endemic to {{southern}} Australia. It shares its common names of wallowa or reed-leaf <b>wattle</b> <b>with</b> a similar species Acacia calamifolia. It usually grows as a shrub to between 2 and 4 metres high, but certain forms may be small trees up to 10 metres high. The linear phyllodes {{are up to}} 10 cm long, dull green or grey green and have sharply pointed hooked tips. The globular golden flowerheads appear in 2-4 headed racemes between August and October, followed by curved seedpods that are up to 15 cm long.|$|R

50|$|In birds, wattles {{are often}} an {{ornament}} for courting potential mates. Large <b>wattles</b> are correlated <b>with</b> high testosterone levels, good nutrition {{and the ability}} to evade predators, which in turn indicates a potentially successful mate. It has also been proposed that ornamental organs such as <b>wattles</b> are associated <b>with</b> genes coding for disease resistance.|$|R
50|$|The main {{building}} {{itself is a}} heavy timber frame structure sided in clapboard on a stone foundation. The walls are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>wattle</b> and daub. Three chimneys pierce the gabled roof, covered with asphalt shingles. It is divided into an east (two stories) and west (one and a half stories) section, itself with a kitchen wing on the west.|$|R

50|$|The Oxford Old English Game has a back angled 45° {{towards the}} ground and has {{approximately}} 30 different colour varieties. It is a small bird with lots of feathers on the plumage. The head is small with a big, strong beak, single comb, small thin earlobes and <b>wattles</b> <b>with</b> large eyes. The wings have a large surface area and the bird's legs are and short. They have four toes ending in long, curved nails {{that need to be}} trimmed often. The bird has a very even muscle distribution and has been described as being 'an excellent table bird'. A quarter-sized bantam exists. This bantam breed is the smallest bantam that exists.|$|R

60|$|The {{trial was}} a new {{experience}} to Lisle, and he felt the exhilaration of it as, remembering his instructions, he strove to hold his mount. Gladwyne's horse was a length ahead of him, the wind lashed his face, and {{the thrill of the}} race grew keener when he swept over the first fence, hard upon the flying chestnut's heels. He dropped another length behind as they crossed the next field and labored over the sticky plowing; then there was a low fence and ditch, a narrow meadow, and then the hurdles Nasmyth had mentioned, filling a gap in a tall thorn hedge. They were <b>wattled</b> <b>with</b> branches which projected a foot or so above them.|$|R
