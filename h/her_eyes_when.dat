5|$|Taking {{place in}} 1997, {{the story begins}} when Laura Harris is {{contacted}} by Los Angeles police, receiving a disturbing message: her father, Dr. Richter Harris, has gone on a mass murdering spree and barricaded himself in the hospital. Laura rushes {{to the scene of}} the crime, desperate to find an explanation for the well-respected doctor's actions. Upon entering the hospital, she is so horrified at the murdered bodies lying about the halls that she covers <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>When</b> she uncovers them again, she finds herself in an unknown medieval castle. Unwilling to give up her search, Laura continues through the dark corridors of the castle. While attempting to find her father, she experiences a series of flashbacks of her mother being stabbed to death. Laura's father (taking the form of apparitions) warns her to leave, saying that staying too long means being stuck in the alternate reality forever. He warns that he will soon become an emotionless monster and will eventually try to kill her. Still shaken, Laura proceeds to find her father.|$|E
25|$|When Vichitravirya dies young {{without any}} heirs, Satyavati asks her first son Vyasa to father {{children}} with the widows. The eldest, Ambika, shuts <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> she sees him, and so her son Dhritarashtra is born blind. Ambalika turns pale and bloodless upon seeing him, and thus her son Pandu is born pale and unhealthy (the term Pandu may also mean 'jaundiced'). Due to the physical challenges {{of the first two}} children, Satyavati asks Vyasa to try once again. However, Ambika and Ambalika send their maid instead, to Vyasa's room. Vyasa fathers a third son, Vidura, by the maid. He is born healthy and grows up {{to be one of the}} wisest characters in the Mahabharata. He serves as Prime Minister (Mahamantri or Mahatma) to King Pandu and King Dhritarashtra.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{conclusive}} {{identification of}} T. gondii in humans {{was in an}} infant girl delivered full term by Caesarean section on May 23, 1938, at Babies' Hospital in New York City. [...] The girl began having seizures at three days of age, and doctors identified lesions in the maculae of both of <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>When</b> she died at one month of age, an autopsy was performed. Lesions discovered in her brain and eye tissue {{were found to have}} both free and intracellular T. gondii. [...] Infected tissue from the girl was homogenized and inoculated intracerebrally into rabbits and mice; the animals subsequently developed encephalitis. Later, congenital transmission was found to occur in numerous other species, particularly in sheep and rodents.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, Lucy {{has very}} deep feeling; {{you may see}} it in the painful {{flushing}} of her cheek, and the downcast look of <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>when</b> <b>her</b> mother and sister expose themselves. I really believe that that poor girl has more to endure than most people.' ...|$|R
60|$|She raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> dully <b>when</b> {{the doctor}} came in. She was cowed and broken.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{look she}} gave me when I said these words, and {{especially}} the flash of <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> I spoke of my being a sea-soldier, made me feel strong enough to tear that sea-monster's arm in twain, and to sail away with the lovely creature for whom my heart was beginning to throb." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Ruth rose up, {{still and}} pale. There was fear in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> {{she looked at}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's hard to say. Not that Englishman, surely. She hates him. Jonathan might. You {{should see}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> he is mentioned." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think there}} were tears in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> I left her, but I could not see clearly, for mine also had {{suddenly}} grown dim.|$|E
60|$|After a {{while she}} dried <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>when</b> I came home she {{told me all about}} it.|$|R
60|$|They {{stared at}} one another {{for a moment and}} then she looked away. She kept <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted <b>when</b> she spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "In fact," [...] said Louise to Beth, in {{the privacy}} of the latter's chamber, [...] "I'm getting rather worried over Aunt Jane's evident {{weakness}} for our Cousin Patsy. Once or twice today I caught a look in <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> she looked at Patsy that she has never given either you or me. The Irish girl may get the money yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Carrie said nothing, {{but there}} was faith and {{confidence}} in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> she turned them for a moment upon her husband as he spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|Regina put her {{handkerchief}} to <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>when</b> {{the maid}} had discreetly retired. [...] "Oh," [...] she said softly, [...] "I am afraid {{this is very}} wrong." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a frenzy}} of fear, Alroy, quite forgetting the spectre, turned and pressed his hand over <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>When</b> he again looked round the {{apparition}} was invisible.|$|E
60|$|Alice Deringham {{was pale}} and very quiet, though there was an intentness in <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>when</b> Horton stopped close by her she looked at him.|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} after Ethelberta's {{reception}} at Enckworth, an improved stanhope, driven by Lord Mountclere himself, climbed up the hill until it was opposite her door. A few notes from a piano softly played reached his ear as he descended from his place: on being shown in to his betrothed, he could perceive that she had just left the instrument. Moreover, a tear was visible in <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> she came near him.|$|R
60|$|Little {{by little}} Minnie and he were growing almost formal towards each other. She {{had lost her}} taste for being read to in the evenings and had {{developed}} a habit of pleading a headache and going early to bed. Sometimes, catching <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> she was not expecting it, he surprised an enigmatic look in it. It was a look, however, which {{he was able to}} read. It meant that she was bored.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{a pretty}} little creature," [...] said Miss Emily, [...] "but that is all I know; modest--blushing to <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> a {{stranger}} speaks to her." ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{there was}} silence. She {{looked at me}} with some return of that half fearsome curiosity which had first come into <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> I made my request.|$|E
60|$|And {{he remembered}} the strange change in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> he had watched the shadow of horror and death and blood fade away before the natural {{emotions}} of youth and life and hope.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> brightened <b>when</b> {{she saw the}} mayflowers he carried. She {{came and}} took them from him, and her hands touched his, sending a little thrill of joy through him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I have,' rejoined Arthur, {{rubbing his}} hands. 'Oh dear! How {{handsome}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> looked <b>when</b> she was stooping over him! Such long lashes, such delicate fringe! She--she--looked at me so soft.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!" [...] she says, and I see her {{nostrils}} spread and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> snap <b>when</b> she said it, too.|$|R
6000|$|While Rafaravavy was {{speaking}} Ranavalona {{put her hand}} over <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>When</b> the former ceased, she did not remove the hand, but said, in a tone which the poor girl could not quite understand-- ...|$|E
6000|$|She had {{not spoken}} yet, nor even lifted <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>When</b> she did so, however, she raised them level with his, showed all her white teeth--they were small and cruel-looking--and said smilingly in his own dialect:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The quick, more gentle {{word was}} already on her lips, the look of mute apology was {{struggling}} to <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>when</b> to her astonishment the praefect, without a word, was {{down on his knees}} before her.|$|E
6000|$|Therewith she was pinioned by {{two large}} hands, and a bandage was made fast over <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>when</b> she shrieked out, [...] "Mr. Fellowes! Oh! where are you?" [...] she was answered-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Maytera Marble, a [...] "chem" [...] (sentient robot) from The Book of the Long Sun. She {{has gone}} blind, and asks Horn to find <b>her</b> an <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> {{he returns to}} the Whorl.|$|R
50|$|After asking Magneto {{which of}} their philosophies was right, Karima helps Magneto {{to revive the}} Professor from his coma and defends him against Joanna Cargill's murder attempt. Karima tries to stop Cargill by bombarding her with {{microwave}} radiation, but her physical invulnerability proves {{to be too much}} for her, and Cargill severely damages her. Magneto manages to stop Cargill from killing Xavier by firing a surgical laser into <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> Exodus shows up and after trying to kill Magneto, engages the Professor in a fight on the astral plane.|$|R
60|$|But she did {{not move}} a muscle, and he was called to the stand by the chairman. She turned to her father, and the tears rushed up into <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> he rested his hand on hers.|$|E
60|$|Mannering {{stood as}} though turned to stone. The woman watched him eagerly. She {{waited for him}} to speak--in vain. A sudden mist of tears blinded her. She closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>When</b> she opened them Mannering was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll do that," [...] said David. [...] "He did it last time. My dear missis could scarce {{believe her}} ears when I told her I was converted, or <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> {{she saw the}} Bethel-flag and the temperance pledge." ...|$|E
6000|$|Susan got up {{and went}} to bed by [...] "God's time," [...] and {{regulated}} her own goings and comings by it. She served the meals, under protest, by Borden's time, and she had to go to church by it, which was the crowning injury. But she said her prayers by her own clock, and fed the hens by it; so that there was always a furtive triumph in <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> she looked at the doctor. She had got the better of him by so much at least.|$|R
60|$|She looked wistfully {{into his}} face, {{but he did}} not even guess what was her meaning. He knew the secret of his own love; {{but he did not}} know that Katie also had her secret. He had never dreamt that his faults, among all their ill effects, had paled her cheek, made wan her arm, silenced her voice, and dimmed <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>When</b> he had heard Katie cough, he had in nowise {{connected}} the hated sound with his own arrest. He had thought only of his own love.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll excuse me, sir," [...] he says, confidentially, when I {{show him}} the rooms in the lean-to, [...] "but {{this is a matter}} of experience. I'm a family man myself, with grown-up daughters of my own, and the natures of young women are well known to me. Make their rooms comfortable, and you make 'em happy. Surround their lives, sir, with a {{suitable}} atmosphere of furniture, and you never hear a word of complaint drop from their lips. Now, with regard to these rooms, for example, sir--you put a neat French bedstead in that corner, with curtains conformable--say a tasty chintz; you put on that bedstead what I will term a sufficiency of bedding; and you top up with a sweet little eider-down quilt, as light as roses, and similar the same in color. You do that, and what follows? You please <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> she lies down at night, and you please <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>when</b> she gets up in the morning--and you're all right so far, and so is she. I will not dwell, sir, on the toilet-table, nor will I seek to detain you about the glass to show her figure, and the other glass to show her face, because I have the articles in stock, and will be myself answerable for their effect on a lady's mind and person." ...|$|R
