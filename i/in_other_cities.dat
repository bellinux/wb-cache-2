This is unusual for a mid-sized city near large metro areas such as Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Nearby Akron, with a larger population than Youngstown and Warren combined, has no local television stations and relies on Cleveland for its local news.

5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics {{of the police department}} under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing the level of violence seen <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{students}} in Nashville {{had a chance to}} formalize their plans, events elsewhere brought renewed urgency to the effort. During the first week of February 1960, a small sit-in demonstration in Greensboro, North Carolina, grew into a significant protest with over eighty students participating by the third day. Although similar demonstrations had occurred previously <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities,</b> this was the first to attract substantial media attention and public notice. When Lawson's group met the subsequent Friday night, about 500 new volunteers showed up to join the cause. Although Lawson and other adult organizers argued for delay, the student leaders insisted that the time had come for action.|$|E

5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|In July 1877, {{a violent}} {{railroad}} strike began in Martinsburg, West Virginia, sparking riots in other American cities, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. In response, President Rutherford B. Hayes authorized {{the use of}} the military to put down the rioting. During the crisis, Tilley was temporarily transferred to , sailing up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C. Military leaders feared that rioters from Baltimore could travel to Washington to seize or damage vulnerable government targets. The troops defending Washington, including army, navy, and marines, were organized into a battalion of seven companies (Naval Brigade) under the command of Captain Edward Barrett; Tilley was placed in command of Company C. The precautions proved to be unnecessary, as the expected wave of rioters never materialized following the military's suppression of the strikers in Baltimore. Within a short time, the riots <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> were also quashed.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, the Tukwila City Council {{rejected}} a {{memorandum of agreement}} with Sound Transit that would have expedited processing of light rail permits issued by the city. Although the city council supported the Tukwila Freeway Route in 2001, the lack of service to Southcenter drove the rejection despite lobbying from elected officials <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities.</b> Despite fears that Tukwila's decision would jeopardize federal funding for the project, Sound Transit was granted its application for a $500 million commitment from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) later that month. The city council approved expedited permitting in 2004 after requesting Sound Transit increase the parking capacity at the future South 154th Street station and park and ride to 600 stalls, at an additional cost of $5 million.|$|E

5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities.</b> Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that he was going to say goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E
5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve was {{temporarily}} placed on hiatus for New Year's Eve 1999–2000.

Clark joined host Peter Jennings and ABC News reporter Jack Ford as correspondents for the festivities from Times Square. Clark took on a similar role on ABC 2000 Today as he did on New Year's Rockin' Eve, including conducting his traditional countdown alongside Ford at midnight on the East Coast. However, unlike New Year's Rockin' Eve, festivities from Times Square were also broadcast live across the entire country instead of tape-delayed for the West Coast, since the special broadcast midnight festivities <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cities</b> and time zones {{for the remainder of the}} night, as they had done throughout the day.|$|E

Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages.
