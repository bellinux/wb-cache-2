5|$|After the 2005–06 season, the Senators {{opted not}} to bring back Hašek, instead {{acquiring}} Martin <b>Gerber</b> to compete with Emery for the starter position. <b>Gerber</b> was the starter {{at the beginning of}} the season, but due to his poor play, Emery replaced him in mid-November.

5|$|<b>Gerber</b> set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. <b>Gerber</b> sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, <b>Gerber</b> stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. <b>Gerber</b> shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E
40|$|The GerA {{nutrient}} receptor alone triggers germination of Bacillus subtilis spores with l-alanine or l-valine, {{and these}} germinations were stimulated by glucose and K+ plus the GerK nutrient receptor. The <b>GerB</b> nutrient receptor alone did not trigger spore germination with any nutrients but required glucose, fructose, and K+ (GFK) (termed cogerminants) plus GerK for triggering of germination {{with a number}} of l-amino acids. <b>GerB</b> and GerA also triggered spore germination cooperatively with l-asparagine, fructose, and K+ and either l-alanine or l-valine. Two <b>GerB</b> variants (termed GerB*s) that were previously isolated by their ability to trigger spore germination in response to d-alanine do not respond to d-alanine but respond to the same l-amino acids that stimulate germination via <b>GerB</b> plus GerK and GFK. GerB*s alone triggered spore germination with these l-amino acids, although GerK plus GFK stimulated the rates of these germinations. In contrast to l-alanine germination via GerA, spore germination via l-alanine and <b>GerB</b> or GerB* was not inhibited by d-alanine. These data support the following conclusions. (i) Interaction with GerK, glucose, and K+ somehow stimulates spore germination via GerA. (ii) <b>GerB</b> can bind and respond to l-amino acids, although normally either the binding site is inaccessible or its occupation is not sufficient to trigger spore germination. (iii) Interaction of <b>GerB</b> with GerK and GFK allows <b>GerB</b> to bind or respond to amino acids. (iv) In addition to spore germination due to the interaction between GerA and GerK, and <b>GerB</b> and GerK, <b>GerB</b> can interact with GerA to trigger spore germination in response to appropriate nutrients. (v) The amino acid sequence changes in GerB*s reduce these receptor variants' requirement for GerK and cogerminants in their response to l-amino acids. (vi) GerK binds glucose, <b>GerB</b> interacts with fructose in addition to l-amino acids, and GerA interacts only with l-valine, l-alanine, and its analogs. (vii) The amino acid binding sites in GerA and <b>GerB</b> are different, even though both respond to l-alanine. These new conclusions are integrated into models for the signal transduction pathways that initiate spore germination...|$|R

40|$|The Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (<b>GERB)</b> {{instrument}} on the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite {{is dedicated}} to the accurate measurement of the energy fluxes of the reflected solar radiation and of the emitted thermal radiation at the Top Of the Atmosphere (TOA). The error on the TOA fluxes is dominated by the uncertainty on the Angular Dependency Models (ADM’s) that are used to convert the directional <b>GERB</b> radiances into hemispherically integrated fluxes. We validate the emitted thermal <b>GERB</b> TOA fluxes by comparing them with colocated fluxes from the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments on the polar Terra and Aqua satellites. For a given location on earth and a given time of day, the <b>GERB</b> viewing geometry is fixed, while the CERES viewing geometry is variable. Hence the statistical comparison of <b>GERB</b> and CERES fluxes yields a direct estimation of the <b>GERB</b> TOA flux accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Pericentromeric repeats {{have been}} claimed to mediate centric fusions through {{heterologous}} recombination of arrays of tandemly repeated and highly homogenized motifs. However, mammalian case studies are essentially restricted to pathologic fusions in human, {{or to the}} house mouse Roberstonian (Rb) races. We here provide an example in a wild gerbil rodent, Gerbillus nigeriae, which displays an extensive Rb polymorphism, with 2 n ranging between 2 n = 60 and 74. The distribution of two closely related repeats, <b>GERB</b> 1 and <b>GERB</b> 2 that were previously isolated by Volobouev et al. (Chromosoma 104 : 252 - 259, 1995) in this African species, were investigated in the genomes of seven individuals with various diploid numbers. Our results clearly show that <b>GERB</b> 1 and <b>GERB</b> 2 are organized in a non-random manner, with <b>GERB</b> 2 and <b>GERB</b> 1 being clearly juxtacentromeric and centromeric, respectively. Finally, cloning and sequencing revealed that, unlike <b>GERB</b> 2, <b>GERB</b> 1 monomers display a more homogeneous organization at both the nucleotide and structural levels. Altogether, our results point toward a pivotal role of <b>GERB</b> 1 repeats in the mediation of Rb fusions through heterologous recombination, with some evidence of subsequent loss of repeats after the Rb fusion {{during the course of}} evolution of metacentric elements. Moreover, the repeat pattern observed in G. nigeriae closely matches the organization and sequence structure of satellite DNAs described in human acrocentrics. Consequently, G. nigeriae appears as an additional model for the study of repeat evolution and its role in centric fusions and their consequences in mammals...|$|R
40|$|Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (<b>GERB)</b> is the {{broadband}} radiometer onboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) platform, launched {{at the end}} of August 2002 {{and still}} in commissioning phase. <b>GERB</b> data is planned to be used in many applications concerning Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) calculation. In order to evaluate the impact of clouds on ERB, a cloud detection is required and, at present, a cloud mask based on higher spatial and spectral resolution data acquired by Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the imager onboard the same MSG platform, is planned to be used in order to identify cloudy <b>GERB</b> soundings. As an alternative, a self-sufficient (only based on <b>GERB</b> data) method (OCA, the One-channel Cloudy-radiance-detection Approach) is proposed, as a time-saving and, probably, more suitable solution than the planned co-location approach. In this paper, preliminary results obtained by using several years of Meteosat data as well as <b>GERB</b> synthetic radiances (produced from Meteosat- 7 observations) are presented.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the impact exerted by the {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (<b>GERB)</b> on the throat and larynx status, the authors examined 39 children (main group), suffering from <b>GERB,</b> and 15 patients (control group), suffering from the chronic gastrointestinal tract pathology, who did not confirm <b>GERB.</b> All the patients underwent a 24 'hour рН-monitoring of the esophagus and laryngeal part of the throat and upper airways endoscopy. They discovered that for the children, suffering from the extraesophageal <b>GERB</b> (i. e. regurgitation of the sourreflux substance above the upper esophageal sphincter into the hypopharynx), it is also typical for chronic throat and larynx pathology: the endoscopy identified the accompanied pathology among 80 %, chronic pharyngitis among 62, 5 %, and their combination among 48 % of patients. Normalization of an mucous membrane of esophagus is highly likely to correlate (r = 0, 54, р< 0, 01) with the throat and larynx status normalization. Thus, {{it is very likely}} that <b>GERB</b> and its extraesophageal variant in particular plays a great role in pathogenesis of the throat and larynx disease development. This circumstance should be consider both in therapy of the patients with <b>GERB</b> and detection of pathologies in the ENT organs.

5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, <b>Gerber</b> {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. <b>Gerber</b> filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and <b>Gerber,</b> Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E

5|$|Bridgwater was {{developed}} during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and <b>Gerber</b> Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town.

5|$|Henry <b>Gerber</b> and the Society for Human Rights {{serve as}} direct {{links between the}} LGBT-related {{activism}} of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, {{a young man named}} Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, {{a man who had been}} a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States.|$|E

We present mean composites of top of atmosphere radiative fluxes for the period 2003 to 2006 for the model simulations and <b>GERB</b> data. Significant discrepancies between the <b>GERB</b> and model data have been identified and attributed to inadequate model representation of mineral dust aerosol and surface albedo over the Sahara, spatial organisation and diurnal variation of convective cloud over land and of the spatial extent of cirrus outflow. Time series of top of atmosphere radiation allow timely assessment of model errors and data artifacts; over the period 2003 - 2006 there have been changes in model parametrizations and <b>GERB</b> data processing that are noticeable in the variability.
