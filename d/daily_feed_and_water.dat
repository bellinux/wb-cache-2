Each experiment consisted of a 1 -wk acclima-tion under thermoneutrality (TN) (Ta = Tw = 21 C), a 4 -wk heat exposure or treatment period, and a 2 -wk recovery under TN. Each experiment involved 24 individually caged hens at the initial age of 29 wk (Experiment 1) or 30 wk (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, Tw of 18 or 27 C was provided to 12 birds per Tw regimen under a diurnal Ta of 27 to 35 C (daily mean of 31 C). In Experiment 2, Tw of 15, 19, 23, or 27 C was provided to six birds per Tw regimen under a diurnal Ta of 27 to 38 C (daily mean of 32. 5 C).

40|$|Heat {{stress is}} one of the major factors {{adversely}} affecting animal welfare and thus economic benefits of farms. This study was designed to determine the effects of two different spraying methods on goats exposed to high air temperatures. Thirty goats were divided into three groups for the trial (sprayed once per day, OTS; sprayed twice per day, TTS; and non-sprayed, Controls). Respiration and pulse rates, rectal and surface temperatures (from head and udder skin) were taken three times a day (08. 00 - 09. 00; 16. 00 - 17. 00 and 00. 00 - 01. 00) on hot summer days in July 2005 in a Mediterranean climate. Some behavioural aspects such as eating, ruminating, drinking, walking and resting, and <b>daily</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> consumption were regularly measured. Rectal temperatures, pulse and respiration rates, udder and head temperatures differed between the three groups. Rectal, head and udder temperatures and respiration and pulse rates increased at 16. 00 relative to 08. 00, and at 00. 00 had returned to the same level as at 08. 00.

40|$|In this study, aloe {{fermentation}} {{products were}} derived from mycelia from 3 mushrooms: Ganoderma lucidum (AG), Hericium erinaceum (AH), and Phellinus linteus (AP). Levels of aloin A and B increased with fermentation time. The highest levels were measured {{on the fifth day}} of fermentation. β-Glucan levels decreased with fermentation time. The safety of aloe fermentation products were examined in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were orally administered the three aloe fermentation products at dose levels of 1, 2 or 5 g/kg for single-dose toxicity test and 0. 5, 1, or 2 g/kg for repeated-dose toxicity test. There {{were no significant differences in}} body weight gain between vehicle control and AG-, AH- or AP-treated rats. Also, significant changes in <b>daily</b> <b>feed</b> intake <b>and</b> <b>water</b> consumption were not observed. In hematological analysis, none of the parameters were affected by aloe fermentation products with mushroom mycelia. This suggests that there are no negative effects on homeostasis and immunity. In blood biochemistry analysis, none of the markers were affected by feeding rats with AG, AH or AP. Similarly, there were no significant effects on markers for liver, kidney, skeletal and heart muscle functions. No remarkable lesions were observed in these organs at histopathology. Since there were no adverse effects of AG, AH and AP in single- or repeated-dose toxicity tests, even at higher doses than normal, we conclude that the aloe fermentation products with mushroom mycelia possess long-term safety and could be candidates as multifunctional nutrients for the improvement of intestinal function and immunity...|$|R
40|$|The growth rate, survival, <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> {{parameters}} of Mediterranean amberjack (Seriola dumerili Risso, 1810) cultivated in offshore cages in the Gulf of İskenderun (Hatay, Turkey) were investigated from July 2006 to March 2008. Two offshore cages (339 m 3) were placed {{at a depth}} of 10 m in a sheltered area 500 m off the coast. Juveniles (101. 97 ± 14. 54 g), caught with seine nets 400 - 1200 m from the coast, were stocked in the cages at 250 per cage. Fish in one cage, Group A, were fed commercial pellets for all 20 months whilst fish in the second cage, Group B, were fed pellets for the first 16 months and frozen sardines for the following four. The mean live weight, survival, <b>feed</b> conversion ratio, <b>daily</b> <b>feed</b> consumption, <b>and</b> <b>water</b> quality parameters were recorded monthly. Group B reached a significantly (p< 0. 05) greater weight (2785. 00 ± 64. 91 g) than Group A (2441. 14 ± 38. 13 g). Food conversion ratios ranged 1. 16 - 2. 46 for group A and 1. 10 - 2. 28 for group B, low when compared with other studies on amberjacks in the Mediterranean. Average mortality was 25 %, due to a Zeuxapta seriolae (Monogenea: Heteraxinidae) infection in December 2006 (20 %) and fish handling for measurement in June 2007 (~ 5 %). The farmed amberjacks had significantly higher protein and lipid contents than their wild counterparts {{at the end of the}} 20 -month feeding period. Amberjacks found frozen sardines more appealing than pellets, especially during the winter. In conclusion, it is advised to feed Mediterranean amberjack frozen sardines or other trash fish during the winter grow-out period. Their rapid growth rate, as well as their adaptability to farming, make offshore net cages a promising system for the aquaculture of this species...|$|R
40|$|The general {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the effect of high ambient temperature on the performance of does during lactation, specifically the following factors: average <b>daily</b> <b>feed</b> (ADFI) <b>and</b> <b>water</b> (ADWI) intakes, daily milk yield (DMY); milk composition: dry matter (DM), CP and gross energy (GE); doe BW (DW); individual kit weaning weight (IWW) and litter survival rate during lactation (SR). The study was undertaken comparing the performance of two groups of contemporary does reared under the same management, <b>feeding</b> regime <b>and</b> environmental conditions, except the environmental temperature and humidity. A total of 80 females were randomly allocated, at 60 days of age, into two identical and continuous rooms. In one room, the temperature was maintained permanently within the thermo-neutral zone (between 18 °C to 22 °C); thus, environmental conditions in this room were considered as comfort conditions. In the second room, the environmental temperature pattern simulated the daily temperature cycles that were characteristic of the summer in Mediterranean countries (24 °C at 0800 h, increasing up to 29 °C until 1100 h; maintenance at 29 °C to 31 °C for 4 h and decreasing to about 24 °C to 26 °C around 1700 h until 0800 h of the following day), which were considered as thermal stress conditions. Females followed a semi-intensive reproductive rhythm, first artificial insemination at 4. 5 months of age, with subsequent 42 -day reproductive cycles. Traits were recorded from a total of 138 lactations. Does were controlled up to the 5 th lactation. Data were analyzed using linear and linear mixed models. High ambient temperature led to a lower ADFI (− 9. 4 %), DW (− 6. 2 %) and IWW (− 8 %), but it did not affect ADWI. No significant difference was found either for DMY, milk composition (DM, CP and GE) and SR during the lactation period. Heat stress was moderate, and does were able to adapt to it behaviorally by decreasing feed intake (to reduce heat production), but also live weight, allowing them to preserve milk yield and composition for assuring litter survival. On the other hand, water consumption could not be the main animal mechanism to overcome heat stress...|$|R

By the end of the second week, feed consumption was higher in groups that were not subjected to heat stress (Groups D, E and F) than in those subjected to heat stress (Groups A, B and C). There was however no significant difference in feed consumption between birds treated with the two levels of ascorbic acid (AA) and those that were not, in both heat stressed and non stressed groups. Birds in heat stressed groups given ascorbic acid supplementation consumed more water than those not given any ascorbic acid. There was also no significant difference in weight of birds, egg production and egg weight between the groups except in birds that were not heat stressed and treated with 1000 g ascorbic acid whose eggs were significantly heavier (P < 0. 05). No significant difference was also observed in the mean egg weight between quail that were neither exposed to high temperatures nor treated with AA (Group D) and those that were exposed to high temperatures only (Group A), treated with AA only (Groups E and F) and exposed to high temperatures and treated with AA (Groups B and C). Following one week of the experiment, birds that were not exposed to heat stress but treated with 1000 mg of AA (Group F) had heavier eggs (P< 0. 05) than those that were heat stressed and given no AA (Group A) (P< 0. 05) and those that were heat stressed and given 200 mg AA (Group B) (P< 0. 05). After 2 weeks of experiment however, eggs from birds in Groups E and F were significantly heavier (P< 0. 01; P< 0. 001) than those from Group A. Birds exposed to heat stress and given 1000 mg AA (Group C) had heavier eggs (P< 0. 05) than those also exposed to heat stress but were not given AA (Group A). The eggs of birds exposed to heat stress and not given AA (Group A) were also significantly lighter (P< 0. 05) than those also not given AA but not expose to heat stress (Group D). Birds on heat stress given 200 mg AA similarly had lighter eggs(P< 0. 05) than those given the same level of AA but not heat stressed (Group E). There were no significant differences in the length and width of quail eggs between any of the six groups. Mean shell weight and thickness of quail eggs were however higher in birds given AA than in those not given but the differences were not significant except between birds in Group F and those in Group A (P< 0. 01) and Group B (P< 0. 01), respectively. No significant difference in internal egg quality as measured by Haugh unit was observed between any of the groups of the six groups. There was also no significant difference between any of the six groups in RBC count, Hb concentration, PCV%, MCV MCH, MCHC and WBC count except for a higher WBC count in Group F compared to Group A (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The switch of a calf {{from the}} {{monogastric}} status shortly after {{birth to the}} ruminant status should take place as uncomplicated as possible ensuring optimal growth. Nowadays calves receive hay, silage and concentrates additionally to milk very early in their lives {{in order to ensure}} early adaptation of the rumen to the components of the ration of the later dairy cow. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effects of different feedstuffs (chopped hay H, pelleted starter KF, chopped hay and pelleted starter KFH, pelleted starter and corn silage with 5 % straw KFMS, corn silage with 5 % straw MS) that were offered additionally to a milk replacer on growth of the calf and development of the rumen. Four of in total 20 crossbred calves (German Black Pied X Holstein-Friesian) were randomly assigned to one of the five different feeding strategies. The <b>daily</b> <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> uptake were recorded and bodyweights as well as wither heights and heart girth were determined on a weekly basis over a period of ten weeks. Blood samples were obtained on a weekly basis for evaluation of the health status and of the effects of different feedstuffs on blood parameters. Following slaughter the empty and full weights of the organs of the digestive tract were weighed. The dry content of the digesta of the particular organ was determined and samples of rumen juice were analysed for the following parameters: pH-value, D- and L-lactate, ammonium und short chain fatty acids. After macroscopical evaluation of the ruminal mucosa tissue biopsies of 3 cm² were obtained from two distinct localisations of the rumen, which were subsequently examined by microscope. The mean total dry matter uptake ranged – depending on the ration – between 0. 40 and 1. 27 kg/day. In calves fed concentrates in form of a starter, the dry matter uptake exceeded the one of calves being fed hay or corn silage. The latter differences are also reflected in the ME-uptakes (14. 5 - 24. 9 MJ/day) and the daily weight gains (0. 49 - 0. 95 kg/day). A positive correlation was found between the mean water uptake and the dry matter uptake. The blood parameters resembled the normal changes observed in calves in the first weeks of their lives. However, differences were observed in the levels of ß-hydroxybutyrate and urea as well as for the enzyme activity of the GLDH being the consequence of the different kinds of rations and their fermentation characteristics. The pH-value in rumen juice ranged from 5. 09 to 6. 62 with higher pH-values and lower lactate concentrations as well as levels of short chain fatty acids being observed in calves receiving hay and corn silage. Although calves fed KFH and KFMS showed a very small intake of roughage, pH in their rumen was somewhat higher than in calves fed solely starter. This suggests that even small amounts of roughage in the diet can enhance pH in rumen fluid. The visual examination of the rumen mucosa revealed irregular shaped, branched and clumped papillae as well as embedded hair and lesions in all calves fed concentrates. Except in few small areas papillae of calves receiving corn silage were very small or not present. In the ventral rumen sac as well as in the ventral blind sac calves fed KF, KFH and KFMS showed a higher papillae length and width but a lower papillae density than calves fed H. Furthermore the ratio of mucosa to serosa length was higher in calves fed KF, KFH and KFMS than in calves fed H and MS with calves in group MS showing the lowest ratio of mucosa to serosa length. Empty reticulorumen and liver were heavier in calves fed KF, KFH and KFMS than in calves fed H and MS. Although feeding calf starter additionally to milk replacer in calves led to higher daily weight gains and an advanced development and differentiation of the rumen, this strategy bears some risks. The preference of palatable calf starter led to reduced uptake of roughage and alterations of the ruminal mucosa that might be related to subacute rumen acidosis and/or a deficient “scratch factor”. In order to make favour of the beneficial effects of concentrates in the calf nutrition and to ensure a healthy rumen calves should receive roughage ad lib but limited amounts of concentrates...|$|E

Nine treatments were prepared by the combinations of MOO 1 + MOO 2 (0, 400, and 800 mg kg− 1; added per kg of feed) respectively: 0 + 0, 0 + 400, 0 + 800, 400 + 0, 400 + 400, 400 + 800, 800 + 0, 800 + 400, and 800 + 800. Eighteen chicks per treatment were divided in a completely randomized design into nine cages. Broiler weights were altered by the treatments at 21 d, when 400 + 400 had the highest weight, and on day 39, when the greatest weight was seen in broilers on treatments 800 + 0 and 800 + 400. Feed intake was affected by treatment on day 39, with broilers on 800 + 0 exhibiting the highest values. Water intake was influenced by the treatments on days 14, 21, 35, and 39, when 0 + 0 represented the lowest.

WEAN− and transported pigs had significantly higher N:L than CON pigs from 8 h through 16 h, however, all treatment groups were similar to CON pigs after 16 h irrespective of provision of <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> Blood glucose levels were lower in transported and/or weaned pigs than CON pigs after 16 h irrespective of the provision of <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> TRANS+ females had higher creatine kinase (CK) levels than males (p < 0. 05). After a 16 h transport period, TRANS− pigs had higher total plasma protein (TP) levels than all other treatment groups (p < 0. 05). Significant changes in behavior were observed during and after transportation, which could also be indicative of stress. Overall, transportation and weaning had a negative effect on performance, physiology and behavior (both during and post-weaning) of pigs, especially when <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> was not provided. Transporting pigs without <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> for more than 24 h was a welfare concern as indicated by changes in body weight and physiology measures of stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{northern}} hairy-nosed wombat, Lasiorhinus krefftii, {{is listed}} as critically endangered in Australia and is restricted to a single population of similar to 90 animals in central Queensland. The area receives low rainfall and is regularly subjected to periods of drought and therefore is at risk from wildfire. There is a clear link between good wet seasons {{and higher levels of}} reproductive activity. A long-term management goal of the L. krefftii recovery program has been to determine preferred <b>feed</b> of wombats <b>and</b> to gain acceptance of supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> by L. krefftii in order to mitigate the effects of drought and wildfire and potentially increase fecundity and survivorship rates in the population. Prior to this study, there had been several unsuccessful attempts to induce L. krefftii to take supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> but the current study, which was of a longer duration, has shown that L. krefftii will readily take supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> In addition, L. krefftii prefers certain feed types (Complete-O (primarily steam-flaked barley with molasses and lucerne and oaten chaff), and Town and Country pellet mix (primarily wheat, barley and sorghum, with canola and soybean meal)) and will visit sources of <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> on a nightly basis.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine growth promoter effects of Effective Microorganisms (EM) on Horro and Fayoumi chickens. This {{study was conducted}} at Agricultural Research Center and National Veterinary Institute (Debre Zeit). A total of 450 chickens (225 from each breed) were used in this study. Birds were grouped according to treatment groups: EM-treated (with feed, with <b>water,</b> with <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water)</b> <b>and</b> non-treated (only SRBC treated and Non-EM, Non-SRBC) controls. EM was given daily from the 3 rd week of age for 5 weeks. <b>Daily</b> <b>feed</b> intake <b>and</b> weekly body weight measurements were made. The finding shows that: (1) EM supplementation had no observable effect on mortality, weight gain and FCR in both breeds but Fayoumi had inherently higher body weight than Horro. This study did not consider the cellular arm of the immune response and EM response to infections with specific pathogens was not investigated, collectively demanding further research in these and other issues if EM has to be used as good feed additive...|$|R

To get the full text please contact the other at Aburaghd 69 @yahoo. comThe present study was conducted to characterize the yolk sac utilization in fast and slow-growing chicks, subjected to <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> deprivation. Two experiments were carried out; using two hundred fifty broiler chicks (Lohmann) in the first experiment and two hundred fifty layer chicks (Bowan} in the second one. Ten recently hatched chicks were immediately selected from each strain at random, individually weighed and then killed. The yolk sac was removed from the abdominal cavity and then weighed. The remaining 240 chicks from both groups were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four experimental groups as follows: (A) provided with water but no feed, (B) provided with feed but no water, (C) provided with neither <b>feed</b> nor <b>water</b> <b>and</b> (D) provided with both <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> deprivation continued for 48 h posthatch. Thereafter, all the groups were provided with normal <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> Body weight <b>and</b> yolk sac weight were measured for successive 6 days. Statistical analysis was carried out using general linear model procedure of Statistical analysis system. The obtained data indicated that, there was strain difference between broiler and layer chicks in yolk sac weight at hatch. Nevertheless, with the exception of day 3, the <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> restriction had no effect on the yolk sac weight and residual yolk utilization. The efficiency of the yolk uptake in broiler chicks was significantly higher compared to layer chicks during the first 2 days posthatch.
