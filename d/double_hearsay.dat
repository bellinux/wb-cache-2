500|$|While all of {{the direct}} {{evidence}} given by eyewitnesses supports {{the findings of the}} Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough. Proponents of this desertion theory frequently portray Burnham as a man who embellished facts and coerced eyewitnesses into falsifying statements. The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan, a cousin of Southern Rhodesia's first Prime Minister, Charles Coghlan. John Coghlan wrote to a friend, John Carruthers, on 14 December that year that [...] "a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him" [...] that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed (in 1899) that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord. This <b>double</b> <b>hearsay</b> confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded.|$|E
500|$|Colonial-era {{histories}} {{called this}} the Shangani Patrol, and hailed Wilson and Borrow as national heroes. Their last stand together {{became a kind}} of national myth, as Lewis Gann writes, [...] "a glorious memory, [...] own equivalent of the bloody Alamo massacre and Custer's Last Stand in the American West". The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes' column. While all of the direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough. The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is long after the event in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan to a friend, John Carruthers, that [...] "a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him" [...] that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord. This <b>double</b> <b>hearsay</b> confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded. Several well-known writers have used the Coghlan letter, as shaky as it is, as clearance to create hypothetical evidence in an attempt to challenge and revise the historical record.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hearsay is a statement, {{other than}} one {{made by the}} {{declarant}} while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove {{the truth of the}} matter asserted." [...] Per Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(a), a statement made by a defendant is admissible as evidence only if it is inculpatory; exculpatory statements made to an investigator are hearsay and therefore may not be admitted as evidence in court, unless the defendant testifies. When an out-of-court statement offered as evidence contains another out-of-court statement it is called <b>double</b> <b>hearsay,</b> and both layers of hearsay must be found separately admissible.|$|E
5000|$|Lieutenant Colonel Barry Wingard lead {{attorney}} {{from the}} Office of Military Commissions, {{published an article}} about citing hearsey evidence against his client. Lieutenant Colonel Wingard said [...] "Vague charges {{made it difficult to}} defend his client after he was assigned in October to represent a Kuwaiti named Fayiz al-Kandari". In trying to prepare his case, Lieutenant Colonel Wingard said: [...] "There simply is no evidence other than he is a Muslim in Afghanistan at the wrong time, other than <b>double</b> and triple <b>hearsay</b> statements, something i have never seen as justification for incarceration, let alone eight years." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>hearsay</b> is a hearsay {{statement}} that contains another {{hearsay statement}} itself. For example, a witness wants to testify that [...] "a very reliable man {{informed me that}} Wools-Sampson told him". The statements of the very reliable man and Wools-Sampson are both hearsay submissions {{on the part of}} the witness, and the second hearsay (the statement of Wools-Sampson) depends on the first (the statement of the very reliable man). In a court, both layers of hearsay must be found separately admissible. In this example, the first hearsay also comes from an anonymous source, and the admissibility of an anonymous statement depends upon the discharge of an additional legal burden of proof.|$|E

On 7 July 2011 in Belfast High Court, Lord Justice Michael Higgins directed a retrial of the civil claims against Mr Murphy. He questioned evidence surrounding emails from US undercover agent David Rupert while overturning the judgment on Murphy.The paucity of the email evidence, the lack of consistency in the emails or at least ambiguity, the possibility of initials referring to someone other than Murphy {{and the fact that they}} refer on occasions to <b>double</b> <b>hearsay</b> considerably weakened the emails as evidence, he said.|$|E
5000|$|However, Reyes {{was ordered}} disqualified by the First Division of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) over her {{citizenship}} status. In its ruling, the COMELEC cited the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003, claiming that Reyes {{was still an}} American citizen and she had failed to renounce her citizenship. In addition, the ruling notes that Reyes did not submit sufficient evidence {{that she had been}} resident in Marinduque for at least one year, citing documents which point to her term as Provincial Administrator. [...] The ruling was affirmed by the COMELEC en banc on May 14, 2013. But Commission on Election Chairman Sixto Brillantes in his dissenting opinion pointed that the evidence presented by Velasco's camp is a <b>double</b> <b>hearsay</b> and inadmissible since it was never sworn nor authenticated by the issuing officer and it was taken in an internet blog of unknown blogger.|$|E
