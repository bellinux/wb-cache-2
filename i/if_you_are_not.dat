25|$|Irish Terriers {{are good}} with people. They have a highly {{developed}} sense of loyalty {{and it is}} important that they have a strong responsible leader, for whom they have natural respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise; do not get one <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> prepared to walk it. They enjoy training, new tasks are easily mastered with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used – instead use distraction and reward the behaviour you want. It is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one should look for a person who has experience with terriers.|$|E

Harvard president Josiah Quincy III relieved Very of his duties, referring to a [...] "nervous collapse" [...] that required him to be left in the care of his younger brother Washington Very, himself a freshman at Harvard.

500|$|The song is {{a breakup}} lament {{dealing with the}} theme of commitment. Its title refers to the turning point of a {{relationship}}. The lyrics address a relationship {{in a state of}} tension and uncertainty: [...] "We've reached the climax / We're together / Now we're undone / Won't commit so we choose to run away / Do we separate?" [...] Usher sings in a pleading falsetto and a plaintive tone on the song, alternating restrained vocals and anguished howls. In an interview for V-103, Usher stressed that [...] "Climax" [...] focuses more on the complication of relationships rather than sex, saying that [...] "it's really about the ultimate experience or lack thereof. Or the finale of an experience of love and life. When you're in a relationship and it has kinda reached the climax of where it can go, you gotta let it go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> going to commit." [...] He viewed that his falsetto vocals and the song's tone give the song a sexual feel with music that works as a [...] "double entendre".|$|E

500|$|Bruce Abramski, {{a former}} Roanoke, Virginia, police officer, {{offered to buy}} his uncle, Angel [...] "Danny" [...] Alvarez, a {{resident}} of Pennsylvania, a Glock 19 handgun at a police discount. Agreeing, Alvarez sent Abramski a check, for $400, which stated [...] "Glock 19 handgun" [...] in the memo line. Abramski proceeded to purchase the gun, and filled the required ATF Form 4473. Question 11.a. on the form asks: “Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.” Abramski's {{answer to this question}} was yes. After passing the background checks, and receiving the gun, Abramski contacted a federally licensed firearms dealer (FFL) in Pennsylvania, which conducted its own background check on Alvarez and then proceeded to transfer the gun to Alvarez through the FFL. Completing the transaction, Abramski deposited the check and received a receipt from Alvarez. Later, Abramski was suspected of committing a bank robbery, and his house was searched by Federal agents who found the receipt.|$|E
500|$|Peckham {{often was}} in {{conflict}} with his subordinate bishops, mainly because of his efforts to reform them, but Peckham's own attitude and handling of his clergy contributed to the problem. He once wrote to Roger de Meyland, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield [...] "These things need your attention, but you have been absent so long that you seem not to care. We therefore order you, on receipt of this letter, {{to take up residence}} in your diocese, so that—even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> competent to redress spiritual evils—you may at least minister to the temporal needs of the poor." [...] The historian Richard Southern says that Peckham's disputes with his suffragan bishops were [...] "conducted in an atmosphere of bitterness and perpetual ill-will", which probably owed something to a [...] "petulant strain in Peckham's character". Peckham's conflicts started because his own ideals were those of a Franciscan, but most of his clergy were concerned with more mundane and materialistic affairs. These strains between the archbishop and his subordinates were intensified by clashes over ecclesiastical and secular authority, as well as Edward's great need for income.|$|E
