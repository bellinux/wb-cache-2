40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{increasing}} labour market participation of married women with children can be understood as a process of gender <b>despecialization</b> which is not in accordance with the propositions of the production theoretic approach to household behaviour. The idea {{of this paper is to}} show that [...] by extending the production theoretic model beyond the limits of neoclassical thinking [...] it is possible to explain non-specialization within the framework of the economic approach to family behaviour so that it is not necessary to have recourse to "non-economic" reasoning. In order to do this a linear model of time use and consumption within families is developed. This model explains processes of specialization and <b>despecialization</b> within families in a context of restrictions in the labour market, consumption demands and characteristics of the consumption technology of the household. A multidimensional time concept is used. Implications of joint consumption are taken into account. The method consists in simulating alternative constellations of data starting from a linear optimization model which is based on the tradition of the Lancasterian theory of consumption. The results show that non-specialization is not in contrast to conclusions which can be drawn from production theoretic modelling.

A collection of core bytecodes provide critical and independent functionality while a collection of specialized bytecodes is meant to improve {{on the performance of}} some of the core bytecodes. This study identifies 67 specialized bytecodes and shows the impact of their removal by despecializing them into semantically equivalent core bytecodes. A detailed analysis of the effects of <b>despecialization</b> on execution efficiency and classfile size was performed. The effects on the SPEC JVM 98 Benchmark Suite were analyzed for various subsets of the despecialized bytecodes using three distinct Java virtual machines. When all 67 bytecodes were despecialized, the average slow down across all benchmarks and virtual machines was 2. 1 percent, while the single largest performance loss for any one benchmark was 12. 7 percent. In some cases, a speedup was observed. An analysis of the impact of <b>despecialization</b> on class file size was also conducted. It was found that the average class file size increased by approximately 6 percent when 67 specialized bytecodes were removed.

We have recreated an ancestor {{to one of these}} subbranches (granzyme) using phylogenetic inference, gene synthesis, and protein expression. This ancestor has two unusual properties. First, it has broad primary specificity encompassing the entire repertoire of novel primary specificities found in its descendents. Second, unlike extant members that have narrow primary specificities, the ancestor exhibits tolerance to mutational changes in primary specificity-conferring residues—that is, structural plasticity. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis studies indicate that these unusual properties are due to a particularly wide substrate binding pocket. These two crucial properties of the ancestor not only distinguish it from its extant descendents but also from the trypsin-like proteases that preceded it. This indicates that a <b>despecialization</b> step, characterized by broad specificity and structural plasticity, underlies evolution of new primary specificities in this protease superfamily...|$|E

Nevertheless, the empirical analysis carried out on the Italian competitiveness in the flowers and plant sector has shown, in the comparison between 1994 - 1995 and 2004 - 2005, an apparent improvement of the comparative advantage thanks to an export growth rate far higher than the correspondent import rate.

This has been achieved by controlled alterations in the electrochemical environment of these living cells, both by a selective modification of the ionic concentrations of an isotonic amphibian Ringer solution, and by the electromagnetic induction of pulsating current having specific waveform parameters. Laser flow microfluorometry shows that the modified Ringer solution is able, per se, to partially trigger the process {{in the same time}} interval that certain induced current waveforms can significantly affect the number of cells in the so-called dedifferentiated state. It has also been found that, for a given waveform, the repetition rate appears to {{have a significant effect on}} the rate of cell change. Preliminary automated image analysis of cell smears suggests that dedifferentiated and normal cells have the same integrated optical density but different nuclear areas. In conclusion, it appears that, after the initial electrochemical trigger, the early stage of the process, when the cells move from a state of specialized function to one of less specific activity, is the unfolding of their chromatin supercoil, not involving DNA synthesis. Then cytofluorometry allowed us to identify, for the first time, fundamental modifications which occur in the cell nucleus under electromagnetic exposure. Journal ArticleResearch Support, U. S.

40|$|The {{underneath}} {{motivation of}} this study is based on the findings confirming that specialisation is non neutral on a country's growth performance. Consequently, it seems important to analyse the evolution of specialization patterns along the process of economic development. The scope of the paper is twofold: first of all, it aims at understanding if the evolution of employment specialisation is reflected in the same manner in trade specialisation patterns. Secondly, it explores the link between the degree of specialization on one side and cross country GDP per capita performance on the other. The paper challenges other empirical studies present in the specialization literature and contributes by presenting simultaneously the evolution of sectoral dispersion patterns emerging from employment and trade data. The sample of countries (32 world economies on different stages of economic development), the time span (1980 onwards) and the sectoral composition of the two datasets are retained constant. By comparing the results obtained with various inequality indicators, including a wide range of absolute and relative measures, we demonstrate the relevance of the methodological setting used for the assessment of economic activity dispersion. Next, we perform nonparametric and semiparametric estimations in order to reveal the `specialization curve' which describes the evolution of specialization along the development path. We find a support for nonlinear relationship between the two dimensions of specialization and GDP per capita levels, with a tendency towards <b>despecialization</b> in the initial phase of economic growth. comparative advantage, industrial specialisation, trade specialisation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease (HD) causes {{progressive}} atrophy to the striatum, {{a critical}} node in frontostriatal circuitry. Maintenance of motor function {{is dependent on}} functional connectivity of these premotor, motor, and dorsolateral frontostriatal circuits, and structural integrity of the striatum itself. We aimed to investigate whether {{size and shape of}} the striatum as a measure of frontostriatal circuit structural integrity was correlated with functional frontostriatal electrophysiological neural premotor processing (contingent negative variation, CNV), to better understand motoric structure-function relationships in early HD. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and electrophysiological (EEG) measures of premotor processing were obtained from a combined HD group (12 presymptomatic, 7 symptomatic). Manual segmentation of caudate and putamen was conducted with subsequent shape analysis. Separate correlational analyses (volume and shape) included covariates of age, gender, intracranial volume, and time between EEG and MRI. Results: Right caudate volume correlated with early CNV latency over frontocentral regions and late CNV frontally, whereas right caudate shape correlated with early CNV latency centrally. Left caudate volume correlated with early CNV latency over centroparietal regions and late CNV frontally. Right and left putamen volumes correlated with early CNV latency frontally, and right and left putamen shape/volume correlated with parietal CNV slope. Conclusions: Timing (latency) and pattern (slope) of frontostriatal circuit-mediated premotor functional activation across scalp regions were correlated with abnormalities in structural integrity of the key frontostriatal circuit component, the striatum (size and shape). This was accompanied by normal reaction times, suggesting it may be undetected in regular tasks due to preserved motor 2 ̆ 2 performance. 2 ̆ 2 Such differences in functional activation may reflect atrophy-based frontostriatal circuitry <b>despecialization</b> and/or compensatory recruitment of additional brain regions...|$|E
40|$|The European {{integration}} process has always since markedly {{characterized by the}} increasing incidence of Intra-Industry Trade. This has been theoretically justified {{on the grounds of}} the new approaches emerging in international trade literature, based on imperfect competition and differentiated products. In recent years another distinctive economic feature of European Union is the importance gained by the so called â€œcultural and creative sectorsâ€, which are often studied and monitored by reports for their great growth potential. We provide here a systematic decomposition of world trade in â€œcultural/creative goodsâ€ for the year 2009 (using harmonised bilateral flows for some 213 products defined as â€œcultural productsâ€ by UNESCO, 2009) into three trade types: inter-industry, intra-industry (IIT) in horizontally versus vertically differentiated products. We show that the world trade in cultural goods is significantly characterised by two-way trade of vertically differentiated products. Moreover we specifically focus on the Italian peculiarities in the â€œcultural tradeâ€: therefore we first work out which ones of the world countries are the â€œtop exportersâ€ of these categories of products and then we compute an indicator of the Italian goodsâ€™ quality relative to each of these competitors. Not surprisingly, we find that the most important bilateral IIT intensities in cultural products are observed in Europe. However the presence of developing countries is not unimportant. This can be explained partly to as a consequence of the increasing level of trade integration among some Asian countries and as a consequence of an increasing <b>despecialization</b> of firstly industrialized countries in the production and trading of these products. Finally, with reference to the relative quality of Italian cultural products compared with that of the other top-exporters in these sectors, we find that Italian performance are good relative to those of emerging countries (such as China and India), but not as much if compared to other European countries (such as Germany, France and United Kingdom) ...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{agglomeration}} indicators in the Sicilian Local Labour Systems Objectives - This paper {{examines the}} links among productive specialization, {{variety of the}} economic environment and knowledge spillovers {{on the basis of}} the territorial analyses present in the current literature. With the aim of identifying localization benefits in a particular area, some aspects of business settling are compared with trends in the development of economic activities and, particularly, with agglomeration process of the firms. Methods and Results The empirical analysis will be carried out pointing to the dynamics of employment consequent to the effects of the externalities above mentioned. Employment data are taken from the Manufacturing and Service Censuses of the years 1981, 1991 and 2001 and refer to the 77 Sicilian Local Labour Systems. Precisely, data pertain to the following sections of the classification ATECO 2002 : Mining and quarrying (C), Manufacturing (D) and Total private services (G, H, I, J, K). We consider some suitable economic indicators to depict the characteristics of concentration: _ localization ratios for studying the evolutionary trends in specialization for different types of economic activity; _ diversity measures, based on a Hirschman-Herfindahl index, suggesting the presence of Jacobs-type dynamic externalities or, on the contrary, the operativeness of MAR dynamic effects; _ competition indices to gather information about the competition levels of the markets depending on their structure; _ agglomeration indices, to measure the geographic concentration of the economic activity connected to high and/or increasing industrial concentration levels in the adjacent LLS. Conclusions The agglomeration process results from inter-sector links, easing the diffusion of innovations thanks to the variety of urban contexts. Agglomeration forces appear to be outweighed, especially since 2001, by the influence of co-agglomeration factors due to the presence, in the same local reality, of small-sized enterprises belonging to different sectors. Owing to the increasing interdependence among sectors, these effects caused a redistribution of employment among the different groups of economic activities. The indexes showed how, during the inter-census gaps, a <b>despecialization</b> trend took over, bringing local production structures constantly closer to the average regional values. ...|$|E
40|$|Since 1990, {{profound}} {{structural changes}} {{in the organization of}} local government have taken place in Denmark: Changes in the political structure (with the consolidation of political committees), in the administration (with the consolidation of departments and internal decentralization), and at the level of institutions (with decentralization from the administrative unit to the institutions). At the center of the changes are <b>despecialization</b> and decentralization. The longterm goal is to improve service, increase efficiency, share responsability, create a more holistic orientation, as well as to increase the public's influence. A research project has been started to document effects of these changes and to find explanations for them. The research project is still in progress, but initial results show that effects of the structural changes can already be seen in some instances and {{that it is possible to}} discern patterns in the relationship between specific structural changes and the changed attitude of local government. However, the research also shows that the goals have not yet been completely reached. One explanation for this may be that different cultures, norms, and values are slowing down the implementation of the changes. To reach the stated goal, it appears necessary to change the perspective of the actors in the organization (i. e., the employees). In Denmark, most of the employees in local government are "professionals," as the term is defined by social science. One way of dealing with cultures, norms, and values is to view professions as the creator of these cultures. Norms and values of professionals are mostly formed outside the organization, but expressed through structures and cultures within the organization. This provides an opportunity to combine structural and cultural approaches to the analysis of organizational development. One of our main theses in the project is that {{changes in the}} organization of local government require changes in the professionals' way of thinking and acting. The discussion of the relationship between professions and organizational development will be used to improve the models for change in the reorganization of Danish local government...|$|E
40|$|The {{regional}} economic integrations, bilateral trade agreements (BTAs), {{and other international}} strategic alliances have affected countries' dynamic comparative advantages and specialization. Whether there are systematic changes in the comparative advantage and specialization of trade in the East-Asian countries has been a crucial issue for the future development of the East-Asian economic integration. One {{of the most important}} issues in the international trade is exchange rate. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a simple empirical preposition that once converted to a common currency; national price levels should be equal. In spite of the relatively large body of literature examining the PPP theory for developed countries, relatively few researches have studied the proposition for developing countries, which have various distinctive international policies and degrees of liberalization such as the East Asian countries. This dissertation has a title: "Shift in Comparative Advantage, Dynamic Market and Purchasing Power Parity in the East Asia". The dissertation aims to examine economic integration, comparative advantages and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of the East Asian countries. It consists of 12 chapters. The all ten research questions are answered in the entire ten chapters (Chapter 2 - 1 1). Chapter 1 is introduction. Chapter 2 discusses the evolution of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). From the background of establishment and the evolution in organizational structure of the ASEAN, we find that the ASEAN has changed its focus from political to economic interests. Parallel with the proliferation of economic regionalism {{in the world and the}} period of active trade liberalization in the 1980 s and 1990 s, the ASEAN has pushed economic cooperation forward. Chapters 4 - 7 and 1 1 deal with comparative advantage. In chapter 4, we analyze the shifts in patterns of comparative advantage of the ASEAN 5 (Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines) as a single entity, Japan, Korea and China (abbreviated as the ASEAN+ 3) by applying statistical method. The ASEAN countries have shown the most dynamic change in the pattern of comparative advantage, followed by China, Korea and Japan. This chapter also indicates that comparative advantage must be considered in the dynamic sense instead of static one. This is elaborated further in the following three chapters (5 - 7) and Chapter 1 1. In chapter 5, we discuss a more theoretical issue on the relationship between a country's factor endowments and its comparative advantage. We find that China, Indonesia and Thailand have comparative advantage in unskilled /aftor-intensive industries, meanwhile only Japan has comparative advantage in technology-intensive industries for the last two decades in East Asia. This chapter also indicates the dynamic specialization and recognition of the Flying Geese (FG) pattern in East Asia, which is minutely examined in Chapters 6 and 7. The dynamic specialization and convergence in trade patterns of the East Asian countries are represented in Chapter 6. The East Asian countries have shown <b>despecialization</b> together with convergence in their patterns of comparative advantage. This indicates the existence of intra-regional trade in the region examined further in Chapter 9. Chapter 7 analyzes the FG pattern in East Asia. We point out that the FG pattern is recognized in the case of the East Asian region. The industries in the first round of the FG pattern are unskilled /a^or-intensive industries, followed by human capital intensive industries in the second round and technology-intensive industries in the third round. Chapter ll shows a case study i. e. structure of protection in Indonesian manufacturing sector. This chapter uses the Indonesian Input-Output (10) tables and data on tariffs to calculate a degree of protection, namely effective rate of protection (ERP) by Balassa (1971). Indonesian industrial and trade policies remind us of the statement of a supporter of trade liberalization; 'good times mean bad policies and bad times mean good policies'. Effective rate of protection (ERP) analysis shows that Indonesian manufacturing sector has become more liberal after the Asian financial crisis. Chapters 3, 8 and 9 are related to the dynamic market of East Asian countries. In Chapter 3, we examine the regional trade in the ASEAN region. In inter-regional trade, there have been shifts in the destinations of the ASEAN countries' exports. Although Japan, the EU and the NAFTA are still dominant trade partners, China (Mainland), Hong Kong and Taiwan have increasingly become important destinations to the ASEAN countries' exports. The intra-regional trade in the ASEAN region has been larger (intense) than expected, given the ASEAN's importance in world trade, excepting Cambodia. Chapter 8 describes the analysis of the East Asian countries' dynamic export market. Constant Market Shares (CMS) method is applied. The constant share norm seems powerful in explaining a country's exports performance since the mid 1980 s. The proliferation of regionalism and economic integrations in the beginning of 1990 -s caused the change in trade pattern. However, we point out that that the change in trade pattern happened only in the short period (in the beginning of economic integrations) i. e. 1990 - 1995 in the case of the EU, the North East Asia and the ASEAN 5 and 1995 - 2001 in the case of the NAFTA. Chapter 9 analyzes the phenomenon of intra- and inter-industry trade in both intra- and inter-regional trade in East Asia. By using a modified intra- and inter-industry trade measures (incorporating intra- and inter-regional trade), we find that intra-regional trade increased significantly in the case of the East Asia and the NAFTA. As the importance of the intra-industry trade increases, the dominance of inter-industry trade decreases in the East Asia. Intra-industry trade in intra-regional trade has larger increases than that in inter-regional trade in the East Asia. In Chapter 10, we examine the PPP hypothesis in the cases of the East Asian countries. The three widely used methods in analyzing PPP i. e. univariate time series of Real Exchange Rate (RER); multivariate regression; and Johansen framework of multivariate cointegration give the same conclusion that the PPP hypothesis does not hold in the strong sense in the case of all selected East Asian countries. In general, the Balassa-Samuelson effect plays significant role in causing deviation away from PPP. Chapter 1 2 represents concluding remarks. Several commonanalytical tools are applied, such as Trade Intensity (TI) index, Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage (RSCA), Spearman Rank Correlation, Trade Balance Index (TBI), Econometric model, Constant Market Shares (CMS), Intraregional trade (IRT) and Intra-industry trade (Ha) and Effective Rate of Protection (ERP). However, we have contributed to the empirical analytical tools in international economics and applied them in the dissertation. First, we make a new method in analyzing the long run convergence of comparative advantage between two countries, i. e. by testing the stationarity of Spearman' s rank correlation coefficients between two countries' Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage (RSCA) (Chapter 4). Second, we describe the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model in the General Equilibrium framework. We also represent the four common diagrams in one figure to show the clear relationships between production and consumption general equilibriums. Third, we introduce dummy variables (across countries and across industries) in the econometric model, which is commonly applied to examine countries' dynamic specialization (Laursen, 1998; Worz, 2005) (Chapter 6). Fourth, by combining RSCA and Trade Balance Index (TBI), we make a new analytical tool, namely 'products mapping', which is suitable for analyzing the 'flying geese' (FG) pattern (Chapter 7). The FG pattern is one of the well-recognized models to be strongly considered in explaining economic development in East Asia. Kaname Akamatsu firstly introduced the model in the 1930 s, as an analogous sequential development or catching-up process of manufacturing industries in developing countries. By applying the new analytical tool, we examine empirically the FG pattern in East Asia. Fifth, we refine the CMS method by Learner and Stern (1970) (Chapter 8). Many researchers have tried to explain factors underlying countries' export performance. Paper by Tyszynski (1951) provides a fundamental analytical tool, which has been famous as Constant Market Shares (CMS). The more comprehensive and applicable version of the CMS is proposed by Learner and Stern (1970). However, the Learner and Stern's version has several shortcomings as noted by Richardson (1971 a, 1971 b), and Fagerberg and Sollie (1987). In this dissertation, we derive a new version of the Learner and Stern's and applies it to examine the export performance of several regions and countries. Sixth, we modify the formula of inter-industry trade and intra-industry trade by Grubel and Lloyd (1975) to deal with the phenomena of inter-regional trade and intra-regional trade (Chapter 9). This modified formula is referred to as Regional Intra-industry Trade index. Weapply the three analytical tools on PPP; univariate time series, multivariate regression and Johansen cointegration framework (Chapter 1 0). We examine structure of production and calculate the effective rates of protection in Indonesian manufacturing sector (Chapter 11). Chapter 1 Introduction 1. 1. Background 1. 2.
