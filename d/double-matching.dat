High piezoelectric (d(33) > 1000 pC/N) and electromechanical coupling (k(33) > 0. 8) {{properties of the}} single crystal with an optimized fabrication process involving the photolithography technique have been demonstrated to be suitable for wide-bandwidth (>= 70 %) and high-sensitivity (insertion loss = 20 MHz) {{ultrasound transducer}}s using piezoelectric ceramic and single crystal materials. It shows that this phased-array transducer has potential to improve the resolution of biomedical imaging, theoretically. Based on the hypothesis of resolution improvement, this phased-array transducer is capable for small animal (i. e. mouse and zebrafish) studies.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a basic premise of prospect theory: that the valuation of {{gains and losses}} is separable. In prospect theory, gain-loss separability implies that a mixed gamble is valued by summing the valuations of the gain and loss portions of that gamble. Two experimental studies demonstrate a systematic violation of the <b>double-matching</b> axiom, an axiom that is necessary for gain-loss separability. We document a reversal between preferences for mixed gambles and the associated gain and loss gambles [...] mixed gamble A is preferred to mixed gamble B, but the gain and loss portions of B are preferred to the gain and loss portions of A. The observed choice patterns are consistent with {{a process in which}} individuals are less sensitive to probability differences when choosing among mixed gambles than when choosing among either gain or loss gambles. risky choice, prospect theory, mixed gambles, double matching, probability weighting function...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we explore}} a new {{networking}} mechanism with smart glasses, through which users can express their interest and connect to a target simply by a gaze. Doing this, {{we attempt to}} let wear-able devices understand human attention and intention, and pair devices carried by users according to such attention and intention. To achieve this ambitious goal, we propose a proof-of-concept sys-tem iGaze, a visual attention driven networking suite: an iGaze glass (hardware), and a networking protocol VAN (software). Our glass, iGaze glass, is a low-cost head-mounted glass with a cam-era, orientation sensors, microphone and speakers, which are em-bedded with our software for visual attention capture and network-ing. A visual attention driven networking protocol (VAN) is care-fully designed and implemented. In VAN, we design an energy efficient and highly accurate visual attention determination scheme using single camera to capture user’s communication interest and a <b>double-matching</b> scheme based on visual direction detection and Doppler effect of acoustic signal to lock the target devices. Us-ing our system, we conduct a series of trials for various application scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

40|$|This brief {{introduces}} a broadband <b>double-matching</b> (DM) solver called fast simplified real frequency technique (FSRFT). FSRFT {{is essentially a}} greatly accelerated variant of the well-known classical simplified real frequency technique (SRFT). The basic idea that turns the classical SRFT into a 'fast' SRFT relies on two main approaches: the selective target data approach (STDA) and the constraint optimization approach (COA). STDA constructs an optimization target data set formed of only critically selected target data whose element number is equal to or slightly greater than {{the order of the}} system unknowns n plus 1, {n}+ 1. In order to exhibit speed performance comparison between SRFT and FSRFT, an example design is considered. An exemplary DM problem, dealing with an {n}= 6 th order low-pass Chebyshev-type equalizer design to match the given generator and load impedances, has been solved by SRFT within 29 s using 90 target data in a typical computer - e. g., Intel 2. 20 -GHz i 7 CPU with 8 -GB RAM. On the other hand, the same problem has been solved by the newly proposed FSRFT within only 0. 6 s using only n+ 1 = 7 critically selected target data in the same computer. FSRFT introduced herein works in any domain, i. e., lumped, distributed, and mixed...|$|E

40|$|A Best-Matching Protocol {{can give}} a company an upper hand in the {{supplier}} selection process by determining which one best satisfies the pre-defined quality and cost requirements. The Best-Matching Protocol developed enables better matches for geometrical specifications (e. g., physical components) as compared to random matches based on the evaluation of a new performance measure, Best-Fit Index [1], for which a small value is desired. Two statistical distributions, normal and uniform, {{were used for the}} generation of part specifications of physical components. A statistical analysis corroborated that the performance of the Best-Matching Protocol in yielding better matches for geometrical specifications, within allowed tolerance ranges, was consistent across both distributions. A <b>double-match</b> was also implemented using as input the normally-distributed matching results from the manufacturing scenario and the cost of different suppliers to produce and deliver the components. Finally, the Economic Value of a Match (EVM) enables the selection of the supplier(s) that better meet the quality and cost requirements.

All-cause mortality was analyzed {{as a function of}} baseline cholesterol and statin use in both the general and the matched sample. Results 1209 patients (40. 4 %) received a statin. During a follow-up of 13, 740 patient-years, 360 statin users (29. 8 %) and 573 (32. 1 %) statin non-users died. When grouped according to total cholesterol levels as low (≤ 3. 6  mmol/L), moderate (3. 7 – 4. 9  mmol/L), high (4. 8 – 6. 2  mmol/L), and very high (> 6. 2  mmol/L), we found improved survival with very high as compared with low cholesterol levels. This association was present in statin users and non-users in both the general and matched sample (p <  0. 05 for each group comparison). The negative association of total cholesterol and mortality persisted when cholesterol was treated as a continuous variable (HR 0. 83, 95 %CI 0. 77 – 0. 90, p <  0. 001 for matched patients), but it was less pronounced in statin users than in non-users (F-test p <  0. 001).

40|$|Current {{accounts}} of sentence comprehension invoke {{the notion of}} retrieval interference as a primary determinant of difficulty during processing [1 - 2]. Specifically, similarity between constituents (e. g., NP feature-overlap) has been argued to interfere when people resolve subject-verb or anaphoric dependencies [3 - 7]. We ask whether similarity-based interference effects arise {{as a function of}} multiple NPs in the discourse that overlap in gender and/or number. We take a novel approach by examining interference effects at the second NP rather than downstream after “maintaining” multiple NPs [6 - 8], using ERPs to establish quantitative and qualitative processing consequences. We used the empty category PRO to introduce two NPs, only the second NP could be PRO controller (e. g., “While [PRO] talking to the waitresses, the man/men/woman/women inspected the menu”). If feature overlap affects processing of the second NP, most interference should occur under gender- and number-matching NPs. Because this interference crosses the subject-object distinction, we predicted that interference would elicit a P 600 effect, the effect most reliably associated with syntactic processing difficulties [9]. Methods: During EEG recording, 24 participants read 160 grammatical sentences (40 per condition) in a 2 (gender: match, mismatch) x 2 (number: match, mismatch) factorial design where the first clause introduced the object-NP and had PRO as subject, and the matrix clause introduced the controller of PRO. Subject and object NPs could overlap in gender and/ or number. We fully counterbalanced 160 male/female singular/plural gender-definitional nouns as object NPs, and as critical NP always ‘woman/man/girl/boy’ (or plural form). Sentences were mixed with 156 fillers and presented word by word (300 ms duration, 200 ms blank), followed by intermittent comprehension questions (85 % response accuracy). Results: Across all electrodes, a significant gender by number interaction was observed (500 - 800 ms window [9]; F(1, 23) = 6. 02, p<. 05), due to a robust P 600 effect of number-mismatch in the gender- match conditions (M=- 1. 18, F(1, 23) = 8. 04, p=. 01), that did not occur in the gender-mismatch conditions (M=-. 17, F(1, 23) =. 18, ns). No distributional effects were observed. Conclusions: The P 600 effect for <b>double-match</b> NPs suggests that interference was driven by similarity contingent upon matching gender and number. Our results testify to the strength of gender-cues during incremental processing, consistent with memory-based {{accounts of}} discourse comprehension [2 - 7]. The results suggest that when features maximally overlap, the subject NP may be momentarily considered as an anaphor for the more distinctive (i. e., first-mentioned and semantically richer) object NP. Alternatively, the P 600 may reflect increased discourse complexity stemming from similar NPs [10]. Our results imply a central role for interference during comprehension, even of simple grammatical sentences.
