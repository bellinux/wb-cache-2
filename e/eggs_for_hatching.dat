6000|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Few things perplex me {{more than}} this {{question}} between Governor Gamble and the War Department, {{as to whether the}} peculiar force organized by the former in Missouri are State troops or United States troops. Now, this is either an immaterial or a mischievous question. First, if no more is desired than to have it settled what name the force is to be called by, it is immaterial. Secondly, if it is desired for more than the fixing a name, it can only be to get a position from which to draw practical inferences; then it is mischievous. Instead of settling one dispute by deciding the question, I should merely furnish a nest-full of <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>hatching</b> new disputes. I believe the force is not strictly either [...] "State troops" [...] or [...] "United States troops." [...] It is of mixed character. I therefore think it is safer, when a practical question arises, to decide that question directly, and not indirectly by deciding a general abstraction supposed to include it, and also including a great deal more. Without dispute Governor Gamble appoints the officers of this force, and fills vacancies when they occur. The question now practically in dispute is: Can Governor Gamble make a vacancy by removing an officer or accepting a resignation? Now, while it is proper that this question shall be settled, I do not perceive why either Governor Gamble or the government here should care which way it is settled. I am perplexed with it only because there seems to be pertinacity about it. It {{seems to me that it}} might be either way without injury to the service; or that the offer of the Secretary of War to let Governor Gamble make vacancies, and he (the Secretary) to ratify the making of them, ought to be satisfactory.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} illumination on the hatching of eggs of one strain of Artemia franciscana Kellogg, 1906 and two strains of parthenogenetic Artemia (Branchiopoda, Anostraca). The following light parameters were used: colour (red, blue, and white light, having different intensities in the range 22 - 27 mu mol E/m(2) per s, corresponding with different wavelengths in the range 400 - 700 nm), and additionally (Experiment I) duration of light exposure (varying between 15 min and continuous light) or (Experiment 2) timing of light exposure (from the 1 st to the 13 th hour of incubation of <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>hatching).</b> Continuous darkness was included as negative control. Hatching percentage was determined after 24 and 48 h, and additionally after 72 h in Experiment 2. For all samples a relatively short exposure to light (6 h or less) during the initial hours of incubation maximally triggered the hatching process; I h of light had highest efficiency when given during the 4 th hour of incubation of <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>hatching,</b> and less so when supplied earlier or later. Lower sensitivity was observed for the red light spectral region (600 - 700 nm), with mostly limited differences between blue (400 - 500 nm) and white (400 - 700 nm) light. Differences between samples could be linked to factors such as chorion thickness, pigmentation, storage conditions, diapause status and genotypic differences in general, but to what extent each of these factors contributes to the variability among the strains needs to be studied by analysing a more comprehensive set of samples. The fact that the inter-strain differences observed in our study were only of quantitative nature nevertheless suggests that light triggers hatching in Anemia eggs through {{a process that is}} consistent throughout the genus.

Based on storage period, eggs were divided into 5 groups as group 1 (0 - 3 days), group 2 (4 - 6 days), group 3 (7 - 9 days), group 4 (10 - 12 days), and group 5 (13 - 15 days). The influence of storage period on hatchability of fertile eggs and early, middle, and late period embryonic mortality rates was found significant (P< 0. 01).

All birds are exposed to cadmium in their natural habitats, {{but in the case}} of water fowl the exposure seems to be much higher as a result of the contact with polluted bottom sediments. It is confirmed that reproductive disturbances of wild waterfowl have this etiology and avian eggs are considered to be sensitive indicators of heavy metal contamination in environmental monitoring. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of cadmium injected in ovo to chicken and Muscovy duck <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>hatching</b> results and lysosomal hydrolases activity in blood plasma of one-day hatchlings. Cadmium was injected on day 4 of incubation to hens egg in the increasing dose ranging from 0 to 24 µg per egg. For ducks eggs, the injection was done on day 6 of incubation with doses 0 - 30 µg per egg (recalculated into higher egg weight). The results obtained indicate that cadmium ions applied in ovo at the dose 3 µg per egg were embryotoxic for hens embryos and markedly reduced hatchability (20 %) as compared to the control group (45 %). In ducks, the significant adverse effect of cadmium was observed for the dose 7. 5 µg per egg which reduced hatchability from 52. 3 % observed for control group to 31, 9 % (P< 0. 05).

Hybrid Bovans Brown <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>hatching</b> intended for keeping in cages had lower weight and lower fertilization and hatching rate of fertilized eggs than eggs for keeping on litter. At the end of 18 th week of rearing of pullets Isa Brown and Bovans Brown reared in cages had significantly lower body weight compared to pullets reared on litter. In pullets housed in cages feed consumption in 126 days was significantly higher compared with pullets reared on litter. During the rearing of pullets mortality was not recorded.

40|$|The project {{provided}} {{the assistance of}} an expert in ostrich production and marketing, who visited Namibia between 15 March and 11 April 1992. Following discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Veterinary Department, the Department of Wildlife, Conservation and Research, ostrich producers, processors and feed suppliers, and visits to ostrich farms, research stations, a tannery and an abattoir, a report was prepared analysing {{the current state of}} the industry, and the policy options open to your Government for its further development. Ostrich farming began in the early 1980 s and has expanded very rapidly. Government monitoring and control has developed piecemeal and involves three departments in two ministries. The collection and analysis of statistics in respect of the industry is, however, inadequate. The main product at the present time is fertile <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> <b>hatching,</b> and the main market the USA. The inflated price paid for eggs - an egg for export is worth as much as a 14 -month old bird on the local market - is an incentive to increase production of eggs alone as rapidly as possible. The market for eggs will not, however, be unlimited and their export is helping create a situation whereby the purchasing countries will soon be able to provide their own stock. The inflated market for eggs is detrimental to the long-term future of the ostrich industry in Namibia. The ostrich industry is currently growing much faster than would be possible without egg exports, but it is developing without the equipment and expertise for incubating and rearing large numbers of chicks on which a long-term industry will need to be based. This concentration on the export of reproductive material has severely curtailed the operation of secondary industries and the development of product marketing. On the other hand, Namibia can anticipate a significant share of a long-term market if the industry in the country develops correctly in the next few years. It must, however, be ready to face competition from many other countries. Moreover, a collapse in prices, due to a falling demand for reproductive material, would have a severe effect on production, unless measures are taken to promote investment in long-term capacity for the production and processing of slaughter birds. The immediate challenge is to provide for the transition between egg export and such production. It is therefore recommended that your Government recognise the ostrich industry as part of a broader agricultural sector and allocate resources, particularly in the research and veterinary areas, accordingly. Legislation should be enacted to replace the present ad hoc arrangement of exemptions to laws and regulations, and a Species Management Plan needs to be prepared in order to avoid any problems with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is recommended that a policy be adopted to promote the gradual passage from the live export market to a rearing and processing industry, by the imposition of an export quota linked to the industry's annual reproductive capacity, thereby encouraging investment in incubation and rearing technology for the birds that are not exported. Great care needs to be taken in establishing the quota level...|$|E

We investigated the presence of young-of-the-year bighead carp in an irrigation canal network of Northern Italy and the environmental conditions associated with spawning in 2011 - 2015. The adult bighead carp population of the canal network was composed by large, likely mature, individuals with an average density of 45. 2 kg/ha (over 10 fold more than in the main river). The 29 juvenile bighead carp found were 7. 4 - 13. 1 cm long (TL) and weighed 9. 5 - 12. 7 g. Using otolith-derived spawning dates we estimated that these juveniles were 94 - 100 days old, placing their fertilization and hatch dates in mid-to-end-June. Using this information in combination with thermal and hydraulic data, we examined the validity of existing models predicting the onset of spawning conditions and the viability of egg pathways to elucidate spawning location of the species. While evidence of reproduction was not found every year, we determined that potentially viable spawning conditions (annual degree-days and temperature thresholds) and pathways of <b>egg</b> drift suitable <b>for</b> <b>hatching</b> are present in short, slow-flowing canals...|$|R
40|$|Information from 150 females was {{obtained}} {{during the year}} 1998 - 99 to investigate status of backyard chicken in Chitral. Estimated human population and number of backyard birds in Chitral were 0. 295 and 0. 747 million, respectively. Average household flock size was 23. 14 ± 1. 97 birds, representing 8. 04 ± 1. 23, 6. 83 ± 1. 13, 5. 67 ± 0. 85 and 2. 60 ± 0. 27 number of Saso, Desi (non-descript indigenous chicken), Rhode Island Red (RIR) and Fayumi birds, respectively. Household flock size and per capita available birds were higher in double than in transitional crop zone. Training status of the farmers, vaccination schedule and crop production zone affected egg production and mortality in backyard chickens. Average mortality in a flock was 13. 56 ± 1. 38 %, representing higher mortality (P< 0. 05) in Saso as compared to non-descript indigenous Desi chicken. Total annual number of eggs obtained by a household from backyard chicken was 2975. 95 ± 71. 22 eggs, representing 378. 28 ± 17. 45 and 128. 61 ± 21. 14 eggs per capita and per bird, respectively. Saso chicken (176. 22 ± 21. 23 eggs) as compared to non-descript indigenous Desi chicken (58. 83 ± 5. 27 eggs) produced higher number of eggs per bird. Average number of <b>eggs</b> used <b>for</b> <b>hatching</b> purpose and per capita eggs consumed was 56. 34 ± 3. 37 and 137. 68 ± 23. 61, respectively. Mixed rearing practice of exotic birds with Desi chicken resulted in non-broodiness problem that adversely affected hatching performance as reported {{by most of the}} farmers. Proper health coverage, provision of training in poultry production, higher flock size, introduction of exotic birds, avoiding haphazard breeding and reduction in mortality were suggested as key factors for better backyard chicken productivity in Chitral...|$|R
40|$|Background: Among various feed {{additives}} currently used in poultry nutrition, {{an important role}} is played by bioactive substances, including prebiotics. The beneficial effect of these bioactive substances on the gastrointestinal tract and immune system give rise to improvements in broiler health and performance nutrition, thus increasing the productivity of these birds. An innovative method for introducing bioactive substances into chickens is the in ovo injection into <b>eggs</b> intended <b>for</b> <b>hatching.</b> The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the development of histomorphological parameters of the duodenum and productivity in chickens injected in ovo with the prebiotic DiNovo® (extract of Laminaria species of seaweed, BioAtlantis Ltd., Ireland) on d 12 of incubation, under large - scale, high density poultry production conditions. Results: There was no significant impact of the injection of DiNovo® prebiotic on the production parameters of broiler chickens (body weight, FCR, EBI and mortality) obtained on d 42 of rearing. No significant impact of the DiNovo® injection on the duodenum weight and length was observed, as well as on the CSA, diameter and muscular layer thickness of the duodenum. The in ovo injection of DiNovo® significantly increased the width of the duodenal villi (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) and crypt depth (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) of chickens on d 21 of rearing. Other histomorphological parameters of duodenal villi at d 42 of chickens rearing such as: the height, width, and cross section area of villi were significantly greater in chickens from the control group compared to those from the DiNovo® group (P[*]<[*] 0. 05 and P[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusions: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that injection of DiNovo® prebiotic into the air chamber of egg significantly influences the histomorphological parameters on d 21 of rearing without negatively affecting productivity in chickens at the end of rearing...|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{methods for}} the control of nematodes, {{such as the use}} of plant {{secondary}} metabolites, can be explored for integrated pest management systems. The objective of this work was to assess the best solvent for obtaining allyl isothiocyanate from Crambe abyssinica leaves, and the effects of this extract on Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica. Dry leaves of C. abyssinica at 200 mg L- 1 were used to prepare extracts by using water (by infusion and grinding), acetone, water + ethanol (hydroalcoholic extraction), methanol, hexane, and chloroform as solvents. Following the evaporation of the solvents, the residue was resuspended in water for use in the experiments. Distilled water and chemical nematicide were used as control treatments. Once the most effective extracts were defined, the following dosages of dried crambe leaves were used: 0, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg L- 1. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify the allyl isothiocyanate present in the extracts. After the solvents evaporated, the residues were eluted with water and used in assays with 200 <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> the <b>hatching</b> test or 200 second stage juveniles (J 2) for mobility and mortality tests. The hydroalcoholic extract was the most effective in reducing the hatching of M. incognita and M. javanica juveniles, by 71. 6 and 74. 4 percentage points, respectively. The mortality of M. incognita and M. javanica in the hydroalcoholic extract was 93. 2 and 64. 4 %, respectively, followed by the methanol extract (17. 6 and 34 %) and the extract obtained by grinding (9. 2 and 28 %). The hydroalcoholic extract at 250 mg L- 1 showed high nematicidal effect. The HPLC analysis of the extracts revealed that only the methanol and hydroalcoholic extracts had allyl isothiocyanate, indicating that the inhibitory effects on the hatching, mobility, and mortality were not solely attributed to the presence of this compound...|$|R
40|$|The {{anthelmintic}} {{effect of}} acetone leaf extract and fractions of Anogeissus leiocarpus was investigated {{to determine the}} relative efficacy of the components as anthelmintic against Haemonchus contortus (Rudolphi). The fractions were obtained by solvent-solvent group separation of the leaf extract. The fractions were evaluated for ovicidal and larvicidal activity by egg hatch inhibition assay and larval development viability assay. Best-fit LC 50 values <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> <b>hatch</b> test were 0. 360, 0. 316, 0. 093, 0. 219 and 0. 196 mg/ml for the crude acetone extract, hexane, chloroform, butanol, and 35 % water in methanol fractions, respectively. While the best-fit LC 50 values for larval development and viability test were 0. 509, 0. 162, 0. 186, 0. 288 and 0. 130 mg/ml for the crude acetone extract, hexane, chloroform, butanol, and 35 % water in methanol fractions, respectively. The 35 % water in methanol fractions was the more active on larvae, although differences in activity between fractions were not significant (p> 0. 05).

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{to investigate the}} susceptibility pattern of Haemonchus contortus to commonly used anthelmintics (albendazole, tetramisole, ivermectin, and triclobendazole) was conducted between June and September 2009. Adult H. contortus parasites were collected from a total of 30 sheep slaughtered at Jimma municipal abattoir. The anthelmintics were assessed <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> <b>hatch</b> inhibition ability against H. contortus eggs. The eggs (500 eggs/ml) were incubated with different concentrations (0. 25, 0. 125, 0. 0625, 0. 03125, and 0. 015625 mu g/ml) at 26 A degrees C <b>for</b> 48 h. <b>Egg</b> <b>hatching</b> inhibition of different anthelmintics at different concentrations was recorded.

40|$|Dengue {{transmission}} has {{not always}} been confined to tropical areas. In some cases, this has been due to a reduced geographic range of the mosquitoes that are able to carry dengue viruses. In Australia, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes once occurred throughout temperate, drier parts of the country but are now restricted to the wet tropics. We used a computer modelling approach to determine whether these mosquitoes could inhabit their former range. This was done by simulating dengue mosquito populations in virtual environments that experienced 10 years of actual daily weather conditions (1998 – 2007) obtained for 13 locations inside and outside the current tropical range. We discovered that in areas outside the Australian wet tropics, Ae. aegypti often becomes extinct, particularly when conditions are too cool for year-round egg-laying activity, and/or too dry <b>for</b> <b>eggs</b> to <b>hatch.</b> Thus, despite being a global pest and disease vector, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are naturally vulnerable to extinction in certain conditions. Such vulnerability should be exploited in vector control programs...|$|R
