Jets in {{crossflow}} {{are of a}} {{high interest}} since they are central {{to a variety of}} indus-trial applications like fuel injectors, smokestacks, cooling of turbine blades and dilution holes in gas turbine combustors. The present work aims at performing an extensive exploration of the field generated by double tandem jets interacting with an oncoming crossflow. The jets are inclined (60 °) and variably but similarly elevated as discharged from nozzles whose height varied between 0 and 5 cm. The jet nozzles discharge a characteristic <b>industrial</b> <b>fume</b> under a temperature gradient of 100 K with reference to the surrounding atmosphere temperature.

40|$|International audienceThe {{valorization}} of precipitated carbonates is envisaged {{for industrial}} gases treatment {{in order to}} avoid waste disposal in landfills. In this paper, the valorization focuses on the desulfurization of fumes by carbonate materials through the semi-wet way. Three carbonated materials are tested: two industrial residues and a limestone of reference. Their composition and size distribution are comparable. Infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy are used to identify the evolution of mineral and surface composition. Multi-scale study highlights different behaviors between carbonate samples. Laboratory dissolution tests reveal that two industrial residues were clearly more soluble and have a final dissolution degree >= 90 %. The same carbonate materials were then tested at pilot scale. The unit can treat around 1, 000 - 2, 000 m(3) /h of <b>industrial</b> <b>fumes</b> enriched in SO 2 in semi-wet desulfurization process. Injection of H 2 O was tested at constant temperature and Ca/S ratios to optimize the process.

Calcium carbonates precipitated in brines show higher efficiency in SO 2 conversion rate (40 - 70 %) in comparison with other carbonate materials in semi-wet way, i. e. limestone or leached wastes (25 - 35 %). The combination of high dissolution rate of CaCO 3 particles with surface hydration appears as responsible for this performance...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{classes and}} types of chemicals, which {{contaminate}} soil, complicate the removal of many toxic compounds from the environment. For example, many soils are contaminated {{with one or more}} metals, radioactive and inorganic compounds. Large areas are polluted with recalcitrant organic substances that pose environmental problems due to their toxicity and tendency to disperse through wind and water errosion. Polycyclic aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous pollutants found in soil at wood preservation plants and gasworks. PAHs are chemical compounds that persist in the environment and thus cause pollution worldwide. Their persistence in the environment is due to their low water solubility. The major source of PAHs is from the combustion of organic material such as coal, tar, wood and rubber. PAHs have been detected {{in a wide variety of}} environmental samples including air, soil, sediments, water, oils, tars and foodstuff. Most people are exposed to PAHs when they breathe smoke, autoemissions or <b>industrial</b> <b>fumes.</b> Because PAHs are toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic to humans and animals, their elimination from the environment is of paramount importance. The estimated costs for the clean up of PAHs contaminated sites with conventional techniques such as incineration and landfilling are enormous. The search for alternative methods to restore polluted sites in a less expensive, less labour intensive, safe and environmentally friendly way is required. Such an alternative method is rhizoremediation, which is defined as the use of plants in association with microorganisms to degrade environmental pollutants such as PAHs. Microbial communities exposed to hydrocarbons become adapted, exhibiting selective enrichment and genetic changes resulting in an increased proportion of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and bacteria plasmid encoding hydrocarbon catabolic genes. Adapted microbial communities have higher proportions of hydrocarbon degraders that can respond to the presence of hydrocarbon pollutants. The aim of this study was to identify bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of Elusine coracana, Biddens pilosa, Brantha serratia and Cyperus esculentus grown in polluted and unpolluted soil and to evaluate the potential of bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of these plants grown in polluted soil for their ability to bioremediate Polycyclic aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Different concentrations (1 %, 3 % and 5 %) of naphthalene and acenaphthene (PAHs) were made and added to 500 ml Bacteriological agar. 1000 µl of bacterial suspensions were spread onto the surface of naphthalene and acenaphthene-based agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 OC. Results showed that Brevibacillus brevis, Brevindimonas versicularis, Vibrio vulnificus, Chryseo indologenes, Micrococcus spp, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas spinosa showed excellent growth in all concentrations in naphthalene based agar medium. However, Micrococcus spp and Pseudomonas spinosa showed limited growth in acenaphthene based agar medium. Amongst all these bacteria tested for their potential in utilizing PAHs, B. brevis, V. vulnificus, C. indologenes, B. stearothermophilus, and P. putida were the most promising for biodegradation of PAHs, since none of them were affected by any change in concentration either in naphthalene or acenaphthene.

Mn caused decrease of open field ambulation and rearing, Cd had no effect, whereas Pb caused decreased rearing and increased ambulation. Spontaneous cortical activity was shifted to higher frequencies with each metal. Cortical evoked potentials had lengthened latency, mainly with Mn and Cd; and increased frequency dependence with Cd and Pb but hardly with Mn.

Nevertheless, since 1800 it has opened up to innovation for reaching better performance. The ecological concretes are obtained with the addition of fly ash and silica <b>fume,</b> <b>industrial</b> waste consisting of micrometer-size particles such as those of the cement. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, these mineral additives have given the concrete a significant flowability, to the benefit of the casting workability. In the end of the century, mineral additives have made self-compacting concrete (SCC). It means that concrete is able to fill a formwork without vibration. Also synthetic micrometersized fibers give the concrete an uniformly distributed reinforcement. The polymeric fibers represent the new fiber-generation and they give fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) a prevention from cracking, but also a better durability in relation to an enhancement of the mechanical properties, toughness and ductility. Finally, there is a smaller scale with unparalleled performance: the nanometer-size, which is based on titanium dioxide nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. The first interaction allows concrete to access smart materials, giving the concrete selfcleaning and anti-pollution effect.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to remove arsenic from {{antimony}} trioxide by two techniques: first, by selectively volatilizing the more volatile arsenic trioxide from a mixed oxide sample; and, second, by selectively condensing the less volatile antimony tetroxide at high temperatures, leaving arsenic trioxide to condense out at a lower temperature. Thermodynamic analysis of the As-Sb-O system indicated that if arsenic and antimony oxides behave like pure solid phases, {{then there is no}} limitation to producing pure antimony oxide by these proposed techniques. The selective volatilization experiments {{were carried out}} at 379 degrees Celsius to 587 degrees Celsius, using both nitrogen and air as carrier gases and an <b>industrial</b> antimony trioxide <b>fume</b> containing 13. 8 wt pct As. The results showed it is difficult to achieve an arsenic content below 5. 0 wt pct using either air or nitrogen, and formation of solid solutions between arsenic and antimony trioxides appears to be the main barrier to the removal of arsenic. Selective condensation experiments were carried out in which a mixed oxide vapor was progressively cooled through a series of condensers over a controlled temperature profile. Injection of oxygen into the vapor improved separation, and antimony tetroxide containing as low as 0. 23 wt pct As was obtained.

Two <b>industrial</b> by-products, silica <b>fume</b> and Class F fly ash, were used separately and together with normal portland cement to produce three concrete mixes in addition to the control mix. The properties of both fresh and hardened concretes were examined in the laboratory. The freshly mixed concrete mixes were tested for slump, slump flow, and V-funnel flow. The hardened concretes were tested for compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity after exposing to 20, 35 and 50 °C. In addition, the initial surface absorption and the rate of moisture movement into the concretes were determined at 20 °C. The performance of the concretes in the fresh state was excellent due to their superior deformability and good segregation resistance. In their hardened state, the highest levels of compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity were produced by silica fume concrete. In addition, silica fume concrete showed the lowest level of initial surface absorption and the lowest rate of moisture movement into the interior of concrete. In comparison, the compressive strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity, initial surface absorption, and moisture movement rate of silica fume-fly ash concrete were close to those of silica fume concrete. Moreover, all concretes provided relatively low compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity when they were exposed to 50 °C.

40|$|Bladder cancer (BC) is {{the seventh}} most common cancer {{worldwide}} and its incidence {{has increased in}} the last 10 years. It is predominantly a disease of older males, with a median age at presentation of 60 - 65 years. There are geographical variations in incidence, in Europe the highest incidence rates for men are in northern Italy, Spain and Geneva, Switzerland. The etiology is well defined, with the most common association being cigarette smoking and other factors including exposure to dyes and some <b>industrial</b> solvents, exhaust <b>fumes.</b> Nearly 80 % of new cases originate from diffuse flat hyperplasia {{also referred to as}} low-grade intraurothelial neoplasia. They are typically of low histologic grade, growing as superficial papillary protrusions, and have high propensity for recurrence but they practically never invade the bladder wall or metastasize. The remaining 20 % of tumors are non-papillary and develop from severe displasia or carcinoma in situ (CIS), also termed high-grade intraurothelial neoplasia. About 10 - 15 % of low grade superficial papillary tumors progress to invade the bladder wall and may metastasize [1]. Both types of cancer are significant problem for public health: papillary tumors are not usually life threatening but because of their high recurrence rate, they contribute to bladder cancer’s rank as most expensive in terms of clinical management. Although about half of muscle-invasive tumors do initially respond cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the development of drug resistance is the major problem, and the disease progression in resistant tumors is rapid and uniformly fatal [2]. Many factors, such as chromosomal anomalies, genetic polymorphisms, genetic and epigenetic alterations, contribute to tumorigenesis and progression of bladder cancer. Several authors have reported that the detection of single genetic abnormalities can improve diagnosis and surveillance of the disease Different genes are well known to be involved independently in the development of BC, leading to loss of cell proliferation control (genes in FGFR 3 -p 53 pathway), apoptosis resistance (i. e. Survivn) and promoting Epithelial Mesenchimal Transition (EMT) (i. e. : CK 19, CK 20, E cadherin and CD 44). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are part of a class of small ribonucleic acid (RNAs). They are important regulatory molecules, involved in several cell processes, such as developmental timing, stem cell division and apoptosis. Dysregulated miRNAs have been identified in several human malignancies, including bladder cancer tissue samples, and may confer a “tumour signature” that can be exploited for diagnostic purposes. To determine whether there is a correlation between the genetic profile and the histo-pathological feature of BC in an Italian population, we genetically characterized 66 Italian patients affected by BC, analyzing both TP 53 and FGFR 3 mutational status, and CK 19 - 20, E cadherin, Survivin and CD 44 gene expression levels. We report also a prospective pilot study investigating the diagnostic ability of a two miRNAs in voided urine samples collected from patients with bladder cancer just prior to bladder tumour resection Survivin was significantly over-expressed (p= 0. 019) in invasive tumors related to CK 20 down-regulation (p= 0. 025). Using multivariate analysis we observed a significant positive relationship between CK 19 and CK 20 (p= 0. 0006), a significant association between E cadherin and CK 20 in both High Grade (HG) and Low Grade (LG) tumors (p= 0. 0064 and p= 0. 0000, respectively) and a strong positive association between Survivin and CD 44 (p= 0. 0000) only in HG tumors. TP 53 and FGFR 3 mutations showed a heterogenic distribution. Gene expression data obtained by RT-PCR on CD 44, E-cadherin and Survivin in urine sediments don’t show any significant value in discriminating BC patients from healthy donor group. On the contrary, the two miRNAs of interest were significantly up regulated in urine of BC patients than in healthy controls. Moreover, different statistical methods, like Discriminant Analysis (StatGraphics software) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), showed a really strong predictive value (around 89 % and 83 % respectively) using miRNA expression value together in discriminating BC patents from healthy group. Taken together, our findings on TP 53 and FGFR 3 mutational status support the well-known genetic heterogeneity of BCs. However our results put in evidence the role of CD 44, CK 20, CK 19 and Survivin on invasiveness ability and apoptosis resistance in HG tumors. The results on miRNA analysis provide rationale for further studies on validation of candidate miRNAs in voided urine and may potentially lead {{to the development of a}} non-invasive and sensitive test for bladder cancer diagnosis and recurrence surveillance...|$|R
40|$|Section I: The optimum {{conditions}} for the determination of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver and zinc by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (part B) were investigated. Elemental concentrations were determined in samples of animal organs (organs, muscle tissue, bone and wool), soils and plants (pasture species, natural vegetation and bryophytes). The historical development of non-flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (part C) was reviewed. Analytical methods using the carbon rod atomizer for the determination of elemental concentrations in natural water and tree ring-core samples were investigated. The analytical technique used for the determination of lead in whole blood involved dilution with 5 % Triton X- 100 followed by sample application (1 µl) to the carbon rod atomizer. A detection limit of < 0. 01 µg/ml Pb could be reached with a R. S. D. ~ £ 3 %. The effect of additives DTA and heparin, on signal profiles and analytical absorption curves was studied. Interferences and background absorption were also discussed. Section II: Lead levels in whole blood of New Zealand domestic animals using the carbon rod atomizer were investigated. Cats, dogs and sheep showed {{no significant differences in}} lead levels according to age whereas cattle (t= 4. 67 for 250 d. f.) and horses (t= 5. 81 for 256 d. f.) showed a very-highly significant (P≤ 0. 001) difference between those animals younger than 18 months compared with all other age groups. Generally there was little evidence for sex differentiation for the lead content in all animal groups investigated (although cattle showed a very-highly significant difference between male and female - neutered animals). Detectable differences of blood lead levels among different breeds were only found in dogs and cattle. Sheep dogs from rural areas showed a very-highly significant difference (t= 3. 1 for 80 d. f.) compared with pedigree dogs from city areas. It is suggested that this {{is a reflection of the}} reduced contact with lead pollution, predominantly from motor vehicle exhaust emissions, <b>industrial</b> smelter <b>fumes</b> and service station pollutants. The whole-blood lead concentrations of specific dogs, cattle and horses with suspected lead poisoning were also investigated. Section III: The lead content of whole blood of 62 sheep grazed continuously for 6 months near a major highway was 0. 90 µg/ml compared with 0. 20 µg/ml for 38 sheep from a nearby uncomtaminated area. Accumulation of lead was observed in livers (maximum concentration of 20. 0 ± 6. 0 µg/g wet weight), kidneys (cortex : 154. 0 ± 34. 0 µg/g w. w.) and bones (36. 5 ± 4. 6 µg/g w. w.) of these sheep. Edible muscle tissue showed only slight accumulation of lead. Four sheep from the contaminated area were placed in an uncontaminated paddock and the lead content of the whole blood decreased rapidly during the first 10 days and thereafter more slowly. After 185 days, the whole-blood lead levels had still not quite reached normal levels. Similar observations were noted in the lead content of soft organs which had approached but not reached background levels. The lead content of bones had not changed appreciably in this time. Animals from an uncontaminated area showed an immediate rise in the whole-blood lead level when placed near a major highway. Sheep placed in a concrete pen away from motor vehicle exhaust emissions showed a rise in lead levels of whole blood, livers, kidney (cortex) and bones when fed with forage cut from the verges of a busy highway. Sheep placed near a highway and fed with forage from an uncontaminated area showed an increase of lead levels in the whole blood, liver, kidney cortex and bones, comparable to that of the previous experiment. High lead levels were also observed in lung tissue. There was no evidence to suggest that lead is 'excreted' from the body organs or blood into the wool. Although washing removes a significant percentage of lead from the wool of sheep exposed to motor vehicle emissions, lead particulates adhere and become incorporated into the wool fibres, especially in the outer 2 - 4 cm of wool. The lead content of the outer 2 cm of wool showed a very highly significant (P≤ 0. 001) correlation with the whole-blood lead content. This suggests that it is apparently possible to use easily sampled wool material in place of whole blood to assess the lead burden of sheep. It was concluded that lead uptake by ingestion of polluted forage and by inhalation of airborne particulates are both mechanisms responsible for enhanced lead levels in sheep whole blood, livers, kidneys (cortex), bones and to some degree lungs. Section IV: Concentrations of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc were measured in soils and pasture species along a major motorway in New Zealand. Enhanced levels of all elements were found and correlated well with traffic densities. Concentrations in soil profiles decreased with depth and showed that the source of pollution was aerial deposition from motor vehicles. About a third of the aerial burden of each element was removable by washing of vegetation species. Highest accumulations of heavy metals were usually found on white clover and the lowest in paspalum grass. Elemental concentrations in pasture species were usually well correlated with traffic densities, particularly in the case of the grass, yorkshire fog. Plant/soil correlations for individual heavy metals were in general poorer than for relationships involving traffic densities and concentrations in plants or soils. It is considered that apart from lead build up of copper and cadmium should give the most concern because of their toxicity and high concentrations compared with background. Section V: The seasonal variation in lead content of Lolium perenne L. (perennial ryegrass) and Trifolium repens L. (white clover) leaves and roots at various distances along a transect across a moderately busy (less than 5000 motorvehicle/ 24 hours) New Zealand State Highway, north of Bulls was investigated. The influence of the particular seasonal wind direction upon the distribution of lead was indicated by the exponential decrease of lead content in soils and pasture species, resulting in elevated lead levels to a distance of at least 30 meters on either side of the highway. Significant lead accumulation occurred to a depth of 10 cm. Generally the lead content of the leaves exceeded that of the roots with onethird of the lead burden being removed by washing of the aerial parts of the plant. It was also observed that agricultural activities such as ploughing may prevent the accumulation of high lead levels in the upper most 5 cm of soil and thereby reducing the avaliability of lead to the supported pasture. Section VI: Cadmium, copper and zinc concentrations in vegetation, soils, water and stream sediments (part B), were measured in the vicinity of the Tui Mine, Te Aroha, New Zealand. Elemental levels in leaves of Beilschmiedia tawa (Benth. & Hook f.) tawa, reflected dispersion of windborne material around an ore treatment plant. Vegetation growing over an ore body showed very high concentrations of all 3 metals accumulated by the root systems. This mode of uptake could be easily differentiated from airborne deposition by the much lower proportion of the metal burden which was removable by washing. Analysis of tree ring-core sections showed again a dissimilar pattern between airborne deposition and accumulation of metals via the root system. With airborne accumulation, tree-cores showed a significant increase of levels towards the outside of the trunk. When elements were accumulated via the root system concentrations were appreciably uniform through the entire tree trunk. Stream sediments and waters showed very high base metal concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the mine. Soils end pasture species in a paddock adjacent to the former ore treatment plant associated with the base metal mine at Te Aroha, were analysed for cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc at the time of closure of the mine and then 12 months later (part C). Elevated levels of all four elements, particularly at the end of the pasture nearest to the source of contamination, had decreased considerably after 12 months. Analysis of elemental concentrations in soil profiles and in pasture species indicated loss of pollutants partly by leaching down the soil profile and by downslope leaching along the surface. Section VII: A comparison was made of the lead pollution derived from a New Zealand battery factory and smelter, and from motor vehicle emissions from a nearby major thoroughfare. Very elevated lead levels occurred to a depth of 12 cm in soils situated near the industrial complex. Lower lead levels, found to a depth of only 5 cm, and within 30 m of the thoroughfare, were derived from motor vehicle emissions. Elevated lead concentrations in pasture species indicated the widespread distribution of lead particulates from the complex. The higher lead content of leaves compared with roots reflected the overall efficiency of atmospheric deposition of lead compared with the alternative pathway via the soil and root systems. The proportion of lead removaole by washing from the various pasture species organs was always higher near the industrial complex than for those obtained from near the thoroughfare. It is suggested that this is related to the physical and/or chemical forms of lead at the two locations or to super-saturation of the soil by emissions from the industrial complex. Section VIII: The effect of lead on seedlings of Lolium perenne L. (perennial ryegrass) and Trifolium repens L. (white clover) was investigated by a series of pot trials involving a sterile silica sand substrate with varying amounts of added lead. Limiting amounts of lead were found after 14 weeks in all organs of both species for substrates containing over 1000 µg/g lead. These values were about 60 µg/g and 100 µg/g (dry weight basis) for leaves and roots of ryegrass. For clover, values of 80 µg/g, 85 µg/g and 100 µg/g were found in leaves,stolons and roots respectively. In both cases, significant uptake did not occur until 12 weeks after germination. High lead levels in the substrate reduced plant height. A content of 500 µg/g was sufficient to cause a 50 % reduction in height. Germination of seeds of both species was retarded by high lead levels in the substrate. After 35 days, germination was 100 % for lead-free substrates and only 20 % and 10 % for seeds of ryegrass and clover for substrates containing 1000 µg/g lead. When applied to the situation of pasture species growing adjacent to busy thoroughfares, the data indicates that ryegrass has a greater tolerance to lead than clover. Difficulties in maintaining the clover component in pastures adjacent to busy roadways can therefore be anticipated. Section IX: An investigation was made of the silver content of soils, stream sediments, waters and vegetation near a silver mine and treatment plant at Maratoto, New Zealand. Silver in soils showed elevated levels near the treatment plant (due to aerial fallout), and also in natural vegetation growing over the ore deposits. Pasture soils showed silver contamination derived partly from deposition from ore trucks and partly from flooding by mineralized stream sediments. Silver in pasture species reflected the same pattern. Silver levels in leaves and tree trunks of Beilschmiedia tawa (Benth. & Hook. f.) showed distinctly different mechanisms of uptake from aerial fallout and natural uptake by root systems. The silver content of stream waters and sediments, though anomalous near the deposits and treatment plant, showed a progressive decrease with increasing distance from the source. Section X: Cadmium, copper, lead, silver and zinc were determined in bryophytes from two mining areas in New Zealand. Background concentrations of all except copper in Hypnum cupressiforme (Hedw.) were lower than in the lowest background values obtained for Swedish specimens of this species. Near the 'dusty' treatment plant at Te Aroha, all bryophytes had high metal concentrations compared with the substrate, and indicated foliar uptake of airborne contaminants compared with uptake by bryophytes in mineralized areas due presumably to passive ion-exchange at the rhizoid-soil interface. Uptake of silver near a treatment plant at Maratoto, and uptake of heavy metals by the aquatic bryophyte Fissidens rigidulus (Hook. f. et. Wils.) were also investigated...|$|R
