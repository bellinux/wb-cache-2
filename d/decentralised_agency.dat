40|$|One of {{the main}} discussions {{surrounding}} the evolution of <b>decentralised</b> <b>agencies</b> in the European Union deals with questions of autonomy. This thesis fulfils two purposes: first, it searches for empirical evidence for the claim that EU agencies develop a de-facto autonomy independently from their formal autonomy and institutional design. Second, it tries to explain the development of different levels of informal autonomy between <b>decentralised</b> <b>agencies.</b> Based on four case studies ranging over a decade of agency development, the paper discusses the factors influencing informal autonomy: conflicts between the agencies’ multiple principles or network and reputation building efforts by the agencies’ directors? To achieve this aim, the paper draws on EU documents, as well as interviews with officials in institutions, member states and agencies. In the end it seems that an agency’s level of autonomy {{is a result of}} lobbying and reputation building by its Executive Director, influencing in turn the relations between the principals both in- and outside the agency’s management board. However, these dynamics are also influenced by external events, such as the financial and economic crisis...|$|R

From a political perspective, the fourth railway package will be seized to look at the different interests at stake when an EU agency is strengthened (or established). Further, the revision {{is one of the first}} opportunities for the institutions to apply the Common Approach on <b>Decentralised</b> <b>Agencies</b> and as a result, it should prove to be an interesting test case.

40|$|The {{question}} {{of the extent to}} which EU institutions can grant powers to EU <b>decentralised</b> <b>agencies</b> has been the subject of inter-institutional and academic debate for decades. Only in 2014 did the Court of Justice itself settle the issue, confirming the constitutionality of ongoing agencification and allowing for its future development. The present article identifies a number of lessons which the EU legislature should draw from the Court’s Short-selling ruling. In addition a number of issues which have not yet been resolved by the Court but which may pose themselves in the future are identified. These relate to the nature of the discretion afforded to EU agencies, the nature of the acts which they adopt (in light of Articles 290 and 291 TFEU) and the new trend of allowing for direct delegations of power between national authorities and their EU counterparts...|$|R
40|$|EMCDDA) {{was set up}} in {{the face}} of an {{escalating}} drug problem in the European Union and a lack of sound and comparable information on the subject at European level. Established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 302 / 93 on 8 February 1993, the Centre became fully operational in 1995. Its main goal is to provide ‘objective, reliable and comparable information at European level concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences’. The Centre’s tasks are divided into four categories: • collecting and analysing existing data; • improving data-comparison methods; • disseminating data; and • cooperating with European and international bodies and organisations, and with non-EU countries. The EMCDDA works exclusively in the field of information. Located in Lisbon, the EMCDDA is one of 11 <b>decentralised</b> <b>agencies</b> set up by the European Union to carry out specialised technical or scientific work. As such, the Centre is funded by the Community budget but is autonomous in its operations...|$|R
40|$|EU {{institutions}} increasingly {{rely upon}} opinions from scientific experts in <b>decentralised</b> <b>agencies</b> {{as the basis}} for EU-level legislation. At the same time, the role of private actors as drivers of integration is becoming more important as the availability of goods and services on the internal market depends upon proactive behaviour on their part. With regard to European governance, this expanding role of non-elected and non-governmental actors raises questions about democratic accountability and legitimacy. In early 2015, the European Commission modified the marketing authorisation for the emergency contraceptive brand ellaOne from prescription to non-prescription status. This decision was based upon a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and effectively made emergency contraception available over the counter in five EU Member States (MS). This case illustrates the importance of the scientific experts employed in EU agencies and raises questions regarding the role and influence of expert communities in EU policy-making. Departing from the theoretical framework of Epistemic Communities as a specific type of expert group, this thesis aims to better understand the role of scientific experts in EU medicines regulation by analysing eight semi-structured interviews with members of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the EMA...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, EU {{legislation}} has established {{a growing number of}} subsidiary bodies commonly referred to as EU <b>decentralised</b> <b>agencies.</b> Recent years have witnessed the conferral of increasingly significant powers to these bodies {{to the point where the}} successful implementation of many of the EU's policies is now dependent upon the activities of EU agencies. While EU agencies have become indispensable in terms of their practical importance, the lack of a legal basis in the EU Treaties to establish and empower new bodies as well as the lack of an adequate framework in secondary law means that there exists little control over EU agencies. This results in critical issues, such as the absence of clear criteria prescribing when an agency may be empowered to act and also the failure to consider the interests of the actors normally responsible for the implementation of EU law, such as the Member States and the Commission. Providing the first comprehensive overview of the development of agencification in the EU, this book explores the question: What are the political and legal limits to EU agencification? Analysing EU agencies from an institutional and constitutional perspective, the book traces the development of EU agencies, explores the different tasks they perform, investigates the limits to agencification, and discusses the legal basis for such agencies...|$|R
40|$|The 2014 Referendum on Scottish {{independence}} sparked {{debate on}} every dimension of modern statehood. Levels {{of public interest}} and engagement were unprecedented, as demonstrated by record-breaking voter turnout. Yet aside from Trident, the issue of security was relatively neglected in the campaigns, and there remains a lack of literature on the topic. In this volume Andrew Neal has collated a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives on security and constitutional change in Scotland and the UK, including writing from experts in foreign policy analysis, intelligence studies, parliamentary studies, and journalism. Security in a Small Nation provides an illuminating analysis {{of the politics of}} security. Its authors reflect on a number of related issues including international comparisons, alliances, regional cooperation, terrorism, intelligence sharing, democratic oversight, and media coverage. It has a particular focus on what security means for small states and democratic politics. The book draws on current debates about the extent of intelligence powers and their implications for accountability, privacy, and human rights. It examines the foreign and security policy of other small states through the prism of Scottish independence, providing unique insight into the bureaucratic and political processes associated with multi-level security governance. These contributions provide a detailed picture of the changing landscape of security, including the role of diverse and <b>decentralised</b> <b>agencies,</b> and new security interdependencies within and between states. The analysis presented in this book will inform ongoing constitutional debates in the UK and the study of other secessionist movements around the world. Security in a Small Nation is essential reading for any follower of UK and Scottish politics, and those with an interest in security and nationhood on a global scale. ...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{is a serious}} public health problem in Europe, and {{it is estimated that}} a large number of people are unaware of their infection [1 - 3]. HCV infection may lead to symptomatic chronic liver disease after many years of asymptomatic infection. Effective treatment is available for HCV infection; however, the efficacy for many genotypes remains low and therapy is prolonged, involving both weekly injections and daily oral medication, and can be associated with significant adverse effects [4, 5]. Where documented, injecting drug use is a major transmission route for HCV infections [1, 6, 7]. In many European countries, national surveillance of HCV infections has been established relatively recently.

50|$|The EMA {{operates}} as a <b>decentralised</b> scientific <b>agency</b> (as opposed to a regulatory authority) of the European Union and its main responsibility is the protection and promotion of public and animal health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and veterinary use. More specifically, it coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorised products and national referrals, developing technical guidance and providing scientific advice to sponsors. Its scope of operations is medicinal products for human and veterinary use including biologics and advanced therapies, and herbal medicinal products. The agency is composed of the Secretariat (ca. 600 staff), a management board, seven scientific committees (human, veterinary and herbal medicinal products, orphan drugs, paediatrics, advanced therapies and pharmacovigilance risk assessment) {{and a number of}} scientific working parties. The Secretariat is organised into five units: Directorate, Human Medicines Development and Evaluation, Patient Health Protection, Veterinary Medicines and Product Data Management, Information and Communications Technology and Administration. The Management Board provides administrative oversight to the Agency: including approval of budgets and plans, and selection of Executive Director. The Board includes one representative of each of the 28 Member States, two representatives of the European Commission, two representatives of the European Parliament, two representatives of patients' organisations, one representative of doctors' organisations and one representative of veterinarians' organisations. The Agency decentralises its scientific assessment of medicines by working through a network of about 4500 experts throughout the EU. The EMA draws on resources of over 40 National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of EU Member states.|$|R
40|$|The 1998 National Water Act {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{environmental}} legislative reforms promulgated in post apartheid South Africa that reflects international principles of good environmental practice while seeking to redress past inequity of access to natural resources. The Act incorporates a set of guiding principles agreed at the 1992 Dublin International Conference on Water and the Environment (ICWE), including: Integrated Catchment Management (ICM); stakeholder participation; devolution/decentralisation and placing aneconomic value on water. The reforms, which radically change the principles of ownership, access and use of water in South Africa, are internationally regarded as a pioneering attempt to regulate water use in ways that are environmentally sound and socially fair. A key element of the regulatory framework is the establishment of <b>decentralised</b> Catchment Management <b>Agencies</b> (CMAs) representing the interests of different water users, and funded by the levy on all water use of a Catchment Management Charge. Irrigation Boards, which represent the interests of the irrigation sector and manage the resource on the micro scale, are to be transformed into more inclusive Water User Associations. The paper presents empirical findings from a detailed study of the Inkomati Water Management Area, where the CMA process is most advanced. Detailed case studies of sub-catchments were undertaken to explore how the various existing and potential water users negotiate their future water use within the emerging framework of the CMA. Water use has been heavily developed in the catchment by industry, commercial forestry, and irrigated agriculture, and water scarcity now presents an obstacle to expansion of water supply for household use in black communities, for irrigation by black farmers, and for environmental conservation. Along with the formal positions of the institutions involved, the key issues of transformation are examined, and the ICWE principles are evaluated as a basis for designing regulation of water use.

40|$|A {{key problem}} {{in the field of}} {{architecture}} and urban planning since the 1960 s has been the marginal role played by the general public in directly shaping significant aspects of the built environment. This thesis draws on theories around participatory planning, and in particular, the seminal 1969 publication ‘Non-plan: An Experiment in Freedom’. Non-plan suggested the potential of digital technology to facilitate self-organising public participation in architectural design and urban planning, while also taking inspiration from consumer- responsive activities across commercial disciplines. Now, half a century later, advancing web-technologies are beginning to facilitate mass-participatory design as a commercial imperative, and nowhere is this trend more visible or revealing than in the development of consumer products. The aim of this thesis is therefore to use these developments in the consumer goods industry to investigate the implications and consequences of significantly <b>decentralising</b> architectural design <b>agency</b> through the use of social media. The thesis method is to undertake a comparative study of both the design disciplines of commercial architecture and consumer goods. Commercial architecture has inherited the selling imperative of the consumer goods industry; and, in this thesis, the commercial imperative towards mass-participatory consumer product design acts as a basis for a contemporary evaluation of architecture’s Non-plan theory. Throughout the research chapters interview content from notable architectural figures, as well as empirical exploration of mass-participatory design platforms, is combined with participatory planning theory and up-to-date information from relevant business and technology periodicals. Establishing a series of political and economic hurdles, as well as advantages to the emergence of mass-participation architecture, it is concluded that Non-plan’s free-market concept will come to present an increasingly viable approach to the practice of architectural design; given appropriate regulatory conditions, and {{against the backdrop of the}} rapidly developing culture and technologies encompassed by social media. In this context it is argued that architects will find themselves acting less as social interpreters, but more as stimulators, mediators and coordinators of a significantly larger, more insightful, and profoundly productive collective; one that is composed of participants from the general public...|$|R
