40|$|Task {{inhibition}} was {{explored in}} two experiments that employed a paradigm {{in which participants}} switched among three tasks. Two tasks required manual choice responses based on numerical judgment (parity or magnitude), whereas a third task required an unconditional <b>double-press</b> of both response keys. Both experiments showed that switching to a just-abandoned task (n- 2 task repetition) generally leads to a performance cost relative to switching to another task. Specifically, this task inhibition effect also occurred for the <b>double-press</b> task, suggesting inhibition of response mode. Prolonging the task-cuing interval showed that advance task preparation reduced only inhibition of the <b>double-press</b> task but not of the choice tasks (Experiment 1). Prolonging the response-cue interval led to a decrease of the inhibition effect in all tasks (Experiment 2), suggesting a time-based release of task inhibition. Together, the experiments support {{the notion of a}} response-related component of task inhibition...|$|R
