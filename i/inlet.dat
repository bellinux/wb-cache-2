5|$|At 2100UTC on August24, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for all of Florida south of the Jupiter <b>Inlet</b> {{on the east coast}} and south of Bonita Springs on the west coast; it also included Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Keys. Early on the next day, the tropical storm watch was upgraded to a warning, while the Florida Keys and the mainland from Ocean Reef to Bonita Springs were placed under a hurricane watch. Further north, {{a tropical}} storm watch was issued from the Jupiter <b>Inlet</b> to the Sebastian <b>Inlet.</b> Later on August25, the hurricane watch was switched to a warning, while a separate hurricane watch was issued from Golden Beach southward. At 1500UTC on August25, the tropical storm warning was extended northward to Sebastian <b>Inlet.</b> In addition, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued further north from Sebastian <b>Inlet</b> to Flagler Beach on the east coast and Bonita Springs to Tarpon Springs on the west coast. About six hours later, the tropical storm watch along the west coast of Florida was extended northward to the mouth of the Suwannee River on August25. The tropical storm watch, which now stretched from Bonita Springs to Tarpon Springs, was extended to Indian Pass on August26. Simultaneously, a hurricane watch was issued {{from the mouth of the}} Mississippi River in Louisiana to Indian Pass, Florida.|$|E

5|$|Five bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} across the Indian River <b>Inlet.</b> The first was a creosote timber trestle bridge built in 1934; its timbers deteriorated quickly in the maritime environment prevailing at the <b>inlet.</b> It {{was replaced by a}} concrete-and-steel swing bridge, the first to be named for Cullen, construction of which began in 1938. This swing bridge, which included a 4-foot (1.2-meter) pedestrian walkway and cost $165,900, opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28, 1940, but collapsed on February 10, 1948, succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the <b>inlet</b> bottom under its piers; a pickup truck on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collapse fell into the <b>inlet,</b> killing three men who drowned inside the truck. Another concrete-and-steel swing bridge completed in 1952, the second to be named for Cullen, also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 2004, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Cape Fear, southward to South Carolina. The watch was extended northward to Oregon <b>Inlet</b> later that day; the watch further extended to Chincoteague, Virginia. The tropical storm watch from Cape Lookout to Oregon <b>Inlet</b> was changed to a hurricane warning. A hurricane watch was subsequently put into effect for coastal areas from Oregon <b>Inlet</b> to the North Carolina/Virginia border, although by August 15 all advisories were discontinued. Flood watches were also placed into effect for portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 28 November, the PVA 80th Division {{attacked}} again with four regiments. At the <b>inlet,</b> the Chinese assault became a disaster as communications broke down while devastating fire from the anti-aircraft (AA) guns attached to the 57th Field Artillery Battalion swept the Chinese ranks. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, the PVA 238th and the 239th Regiment together had less than 600 soldiers. The attacks by PVA 240th Regiment, on the other hand, forced Maclean to order a retreat from the northern hills towards the <b>inlet.</b> On 29 November, the 1st Battalion managed to break through the Chinese blockade and reached the <b>inlet,</b> but Maclean disappeared as he mistook some Chinese soldiers as American. The Chinese finally stopped their attacks on {{the night of}} 29 November while waiting for fresh reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the current}} bridge, four other bridges have spanned the Indian River <b>Inlet,</b> opened in 1934, 1940, 1952, and 1965, the latter widened by an {{additional}} span added in 1976. All were known informally as the Indian River <b>Inlet</b> Bridge, and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The 1965 bridge, a steel girder bridge, was subject to scouring from the <b>inlet,</b> leading {{to the need to}} replace it. Initial plans for a tied-arch bridge over the <b>inlet</b> in 2004 were over budget, and 2006 plans for a 1,400-foot (427-meter) cable-stayed bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems. Construction of the current, 2,600-foot (792-meter) bridge began in 2008 as part of a design-build project, with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge. The current Indian River <b>Inlet</b> Bridge opened partially in January 2012 and completely in May 2012 at a cost of $150 million.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{characteristics}} method, the design method of axisymmetric multi-compression and quasi-isentropic compression <b>inlets</b> are developed. For the multi-compression <b>inlets,</b> the solution strategy of shock wave angle for the leasttotal pressure loss is designed. For quasi-isentropic compression <b>inlets,</b> the design criteria of wall of quasi-isentropic compression <b>inlets</b> is {{come up with that}} the left Mach lines starting from the wall should intersect at the lip. The wall of axisymmetric multicompression and quasi-isentropic compression <b>inlets</b> under the condition of mach 4 is designed, and the numerical simulation results calculated by FLUENT shows that the distribution of the shock waves meet the design requirements, which validates the design method of this paper. The comparative study of the two kinds of <b>inlets</b> shows that: the quasi-isentropic compression has the advantage of total pressure recovery, while the drag {{on the wall of the}} quasi-isentropic compression is similar with that of three shock compression...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{stormwater}} drain (highway drain or road gully in the UK) inlets: side <b>inlets</b> and grated <b>inlets.</b> Side <b>inlets</b> are located adjacent to the curb (kerb) and rely {{on the ability of}} the opening under the backstone or lintel to capture flow. They are usually depressed at the invert of the channel to improve capture capacity.|$|R
5|$|This {{bridge is}} {{named in honor}} and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to public service and {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River <b>Inlet.</b> In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the <b>inlet</b> and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the <b>inlet</b> since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the <b>inlet</b> waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, let us not forget the lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E
5|$|Until 1928, the Indian River <b>Inlet</b> was {{a natural}} {{waterway}} that shifted {{up and down a}} two-mile (3.2km) stretch of the coast. Dredging kept the <b>inlet</b> open in its current location between 1928 and 1937, and in 1938 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built jetties that hold it in place. With the <b>inlet</b> in a fixed place, it became possible after 1928 to build a bridge to span it, and the completion of the Ocean Highway in 1933 prompted Delaware to build a span to connect the northern and southern segments of the highway.|$|E

5|$|In North Carolina, {{hundreds}} of residents were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} Isabel <b>Inlet.</b> People who were not residents {{were not allowed to}} be on the Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured to see the new <b>inlet,</b> despite a 1-mile (1.6-km) walk from the nearest road. Initially, long term solutions to the Isabel <b>Inlet</b> such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered, though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the <b>inlet.</b> Coastal geologists were opposed to the solution, stating the evolution of the Outer Banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes. Dredging operations began on October 17, about a month after the hurricane struck. The United States Geological Survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island, a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane. On November 22, about two months after the hurricane struck, North Carolina Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened.|$|E
