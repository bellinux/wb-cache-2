500|$|Although {{the union}} members were getting less pay than promised, {{they did not}} lose {{their faith in the}} UMWA's ability to {{negotiate}} a settlement. Due to Trumka's efforts, the miners were able to keep their spirit and morale up during the strike. He knew that giving into the demands of Pittston would only lead to other mine companies revoking health care benefits. On August 20, 1989 Trumka was questioned by B. Drummond Ayers Jr., a local reporter from the New York Times, about how long he expected the strike to continue. Trumka responded to the question by saying, [...] "People keep asking <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>we</b> can hold out. The answer: one day longer than Pittston." [...] The strike continued until February 1990, when a settlement was agreed upon by both parties. The settlement was reached after taking the demands to court several times and after many ratifications were made. The miners of the Pittston Coal Company were able to once again receive health and retirement benefits.|$|E
500|$|Following the setback in Vienna and Berlin Crisis of 1961, {{as well as}} the Soviet {{decision}} to resume testing in August (attributed by Moscow to a changed international situation and French nuclear tests), Kennedy faced mounting pressure from the Department of Defense and nuclear laboratories to set aside the dream of a test ban. In June 1961, following stalled talks in Geneva, Kennedy had argued that Soviet negotiating behavior raised [...] "a serious question about <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>we</b> can safely continue on a voluntary basis a refusal to undertake tests in this country without any assurance that the Russians are not testing." [...] Whether or not the Soviet Union had actually conducted secret tests was a matter of debate within the Kennedy administration. A team led by physicist Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky reported that while the Soviet Union could have secretly tested weapons, there was no evidence indicating that it actually had. Panofsky's findings were dismissed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as [...] "assertive, ambiguous, semiliterate and generally unimpressive." ...|$|E
