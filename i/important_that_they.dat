5|$|On 1 December, Vandermaesen made a {{stand before}} Port Napoleon, {{defending}} {{the entrance to}} the town with his available regular troops and some small cannon. Keating attacked him, engaging the French front while a second attack by Madras sepoys outflanked the French line and disrupted it, allowing a successful frontal assault. With their defences breached the French fell back and on 2 December Decaen proposed a ceasefire, which was accepted. The following day Decaen surrendered, although with guarantees that he and the garrison would be repatriated and allowed to retain their personal arms and Eagles. Although some in the British force were unhappy with the terms of the surrender, the British commanders were relieved to have the invasion complete before the hurricane season began later in the month. The danger to the 70 ships in the British fleet from such a storm was serious and it was vitally <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> be in a safe harbour when the hurricane season began.|$|E
25|$|The long through ball: This is a long, {{and usually}} high, pass from a teams' own half, {{over the heads}} of the other team's defence. It is {{intended}} for the attacking players to chase and it is <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will have a good chance of winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small.|$|E
25|$|At first, Merengue Típico Cibaeño (traditional Cibanian merengue) {{was played}} on {{stringed}} instruments like the tres and cuatro, but when Germans {{came to the}} island in the late 19th century trading their instruments for tobacco, the accordion quickly replaced the strings as lead instrument. Típico groups play a variety of rhythms, but most common are the merengue and the pambiche. In the 1930s–50s a bass instrument was also often used. Called marimba, it resembles the Cuban marímbula, and is a large box-shaped thumb piano with 3-6 metal keys. The main percussion instruments, güira and tambora, {{have been a part}} of the ensemble since the music's inception, and are so <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are often considered symbolic of the whole country. The güira is a metal scraper believed to be of native Taíno origin, while the tambora is a two-headed drum of African origin. Together with the European accordion, the típico group symbolizes the three cultures that combined to make today's Dominican Republic.|$|E

25|$|Irish Terriers {{are good}} with people. They have a highly {{developed}} sense of loyalty {{and it is}} <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have a strong responsible leader, for whom they have natural respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise; do not get one {{if you are not}} prepared to walk it. They enjoy training, new tasks are easily mastered with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used – instead use distraction and reward the behaviour you want. It is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one should look for a person who has experience with terriers.|$|E
25|$|In general, two {{different}} light sources {{are needed in}} an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the ambient lighting for interventional procedures. Particular attention should {{be paid to the}} possibility to dim the lights. This is frequently needed during fluoroscopy or endoscopy. For the surgical lights it is most <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the OR table. If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the OR table. Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the angiography system determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head clearance height for the OR-light may be an issue. This makes lights a critical item in the planning and design process. Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required. Sometimes even a third light may be required, in cases where more than one surgical activity takes place at the same time, e.g. vein stripping of the legs.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1968, under what Sesame Street {{researchers}} Edward Palmer and Shalom Fisch called Lesser's [...] "able leadership", five three-day curriculum planning seminars were conducted in Boston. [...] The purpose of the seminars, attended by educational experts and the new show's writers and producers, was to ascertain which school-preparation skills to emphasize. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lesser's skills at encouraging collegiality were evident during the seminars. [...] Writer Louise Gikow reported that the real friction occurred between the educators present. [...] As Sesame Street songwriter Christopher Cerf reported, [...] "... ran meetings better than anyone I've ever seen. [...] He made everybody feel like they were <b>important,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> got listened to, and that their work {{ended up in the}} final product". [...] Davis noted that the seminars also served as a [...] "crash course in child development, psychology, and preschool education" [...] for the show's producers and writers. [...] According to researcher Robert W. Morrow, Lesser understood that in order to bring research about child development into the production process of Sesame Street, a close working relationship had to be created between the researchers and the producers. [...] Davis credited Lesser's [...] "informal, unpretentious, and collaborative" [...] manner with the creation of that close relationship.|$|E

500|$|Kean then alerted 5th Regimental Combat Team {{commander}} Colonel John L. Throckmorton {{to prepare}} a force from the 5th Infantry to attack Sobuk-san and retake it. On the morning of August 21, the 1st Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, attacked across the 24th Infantry's boundary and secured the southernmost ridges of the mountain against light North Korean resistance. That evening a strong force of North Koreans counterattacked and drove the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry off the mountain. At 12:00 on August 22, the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry again attacked the heights, and five hours later B Company seized the highest ridges. Kean now changed the boundary line between the 5th Regimental Combat Team and the 24th Infantry, giving responsibility for the southern ridges to the 5th, and Battle Mountain and P'il-bong to the 24th. During the night, the North Koreans launched counterattacks against the 1st Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, and prevented it from consolidating its position. On the morning of August 23, A Company tried to secure the high ground [...] southwest of the peak and link up with B Company, {{but was unable to}} do so. The North Koreans considered the Sobuk-san ridges so <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> committed substantial resources to defending them, and attacked the nearby 5th Regimental Combat Team daily.|$|E

In July 1995, more than 12,000 fans of the show attended a [...] "Men of Y" [...] event, which also featured fellow actors Eddie Cibrian, Shemar Moore and Don Diamont.

According to The Augusta Chronicle, by 1999, [...] "Wedding proposals, prom invitations and underwear-tossing fans are a part of everyday life for soap opera star Joshua Morrow", noting his fans to be [...] "trembling" [...] and [...] "starry-eyed" [...] in his presence. Nancy Dehart of The Spectator noted that his [...] "mostly female" [...] fans [...] "even seemed to know more about his soap opera life than he did", quoting a fan exclaiming, [...] "He's so sexy, I've got 100 pictures of him at home on my walls," [...] at another event.

2500|$|By {{the last}} quarter of the 17th century, the {{population}} of Birmingham was somewhere between 4,000 and 15,000. Birmingham's small arms manufacture continued and during the mid-to-late 17th century Birmingham smiths were renowned for their manufacture of quality weapons (Alexander Missen in his Travels on visiting Milan noted that [...] "fine works of rock-crystal, swords, heads of canes, snuffboxes, and other fine works of steel" [...] could be purchased in Milan but that [...] "they can be had better and cheaper in Birmingham"). There is no evidence that firearms were manufactured in Birmingham until the 1690s when the Office of Ordinance issued a warrant to [...] "pay John Smart for Thomas Hadley, and the rest of the Gunmakers of Birmingham, one debenture of four-score [...] and sixteen pounds eight shillings, dated ye 14th of July 1690", but it is unlikely that guns were not manufactured in Birmingham before that date. It is more likely that when Sir Richard Newdigate approached manufacturers in the town in 1689 with the notion of supplying the British Government with small arms, it was <b>important</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would need to be of high enough calibre to equal the small arms that were imported from abroad. After a successful trial order in 1692, the Government placed its first contract. On 5 January 1693 the [...] "Officers of Ordnance" [...] chose five local firearms manufacturers to initially produce 200 [...] "snaphance musquets" [...] per month over the period of one year, paying 17 shillings per musket, plus 3 shillings per hundredweight for delivery to London.|$|E
