5|$|Boron <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> the Universe {{and solar}} system due to trace {{formation}} in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials.|$|E
5|$|The serval is {{confined}} to Africa – it <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in southern Africa, where their range is reportedly expanding. In northern Africa, the serval is known only from Morocco and has been reintroduced in Tunisia, but is feared to be extinct in Algeria.|$|E

5|$|A circovirus—given {{the name}} raven circovirus or RaCV—was {{isolated}} from an Australian raven suffering from feather lesions in 2006. It has affinities with canary circovirus (CaCV) and pigeon circovirus (PiCV). Its clinical significance is unknown. Tick infestation <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> the Australian raven, with Ixodes holocyclus and Amblyomma triguttatum recorded. Lice and hippoboscid flies {{have been recorded}} yet little-researched, and an infestation by the fly Passeromyia longicornis was recorded in one nest.|$|E

5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1175 and 1490, Wells Cathedral {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. Much of the structure is in the Early English style and is greatly enriched by the deeply sculptural nature of the mouldings and the vitality of the carved capitals in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. The eastern end has retained much original glass, which <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> England. The exterior has the finest Early English façade and a large central tower.|$|E

5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{originally}} described by Micheli from Italy. It is considered native to southern and central continental Europe, {{as well as}} Macaronesia (the Azores and the Canary Islands), western Turkey, North Africa (Algeria), and western Asia (Iran). The fungus <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> central Europe, and is listed in the Red data book of Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Enlargement of the spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} mild and asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The skin is involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E
5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> cultivation as it is very hard to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E

5|$|Found {{mainly in}} Central and Southern Europe {{as well as}} North Africa, Boletus aereus <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> colder climates such as England, and {{classified}} as a vulnerable species in the Czech Republic. Boletus aereus can be locally abundant; {{it is the most}} common bolete in the woodlands of Madonie Regional Natural Park in northern Sicily. In contrast, it has been placed on a provisional Red List of endangered species of Montenegro. Boletus aereus has been reported from several other island ecosystems across the Mediterranean, such as Corsica, Cyprus, Lesvos, and Naxos.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication. It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance, virulence, and adaptive metabolic functions. Although horizontal {{gene transfer}} <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{it is one}} of 32 {{threatened}} species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention. It has been recorded from Czechoslovakia, and Poland, where it is mostly found in old-growth forests. It <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> northern Europe, where it has been found in Finland growing on Picea abies and Alnus incana, and in Sweden.|$|E

5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, C. graminis {{is widespread}} from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. It {{may also be}} found in central Asia and China. In Russia it may be found in the tundra zone from the Polar Urals to the Kolyma River, and in the nearby countries of Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. It is listed as vulnerable in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and in Germany it <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> one district, endangered in another.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, gout {{is twice}} as likely in males of African descent than those of European descent. Rates are high among Pacific Islanders and the Māori, but the disease <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> {{aboriginal}} Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies found that attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring. This {{has been attributed to}} seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity and temperature.|$|E
5|$|In the {{geologic}} record, the K–Pg {{event is}} marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K–Pg boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks.
