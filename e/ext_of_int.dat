The objective {{of the present study}} is to examine the antioxidant activity of methanolic and aq. <b>exts.</b> <b>of</b> leaves of Embelia tsjeriam-cottam(Roem. &Schult.) DC., Gomphostemma heyneanum Benth. var. heyneanum, Hackeria subpeltata (Willd.) Kunth and Nothapodytes nimmoniana (Graham) Mabb. which are extensively used by the tribes for curing cancer, arthritis, piles, dysentery, diarrhoea and skin problems. The DPPH radical scavenging activity, phosphomelybdenum assay and Fe (3) to Fe (2) reducing activity were employed in the present study to det. the antioxidant activity of these plants. The DPPH radical scavenging activity for the methanolic leaf <b>ext.</b> <b>of,</b> Hackeria subpeltata (Willd.) Kunth is significant when compared to the commonly used BHA followed by 99. 24 % at 517 nm (Methanolic <b>ext.</b> <b>of</b> Gomphostemma heyneanum Benth. var. heyneanum), 93. 90 % at 517 nm (Methanolic <b>ext.</b> <b>of</b> Embelia tsjeriam-cottam(Roem.

Preliminary phytochem. anal. <b>of</b> methanolic <b>exts.</b> <b>of</b> these plants indicated {{the presence of}} tannins, saponins, steroids, terpenoids, anthraquinones and phlobatonins.

The <b>ext.</b> <b>of</b> C. annum at 0. 004 % concn. showed no significant mortality, whereas 0. 024 % at 24 h observations showed 99 % mortality in case of Cx. quinquefasciatus and 96 % mortality in An. stephensi larvae.

40|$|Altered {{expression}} <b>of</b> the <b>INT</b> 6 gene, encoding the e subunit of the translational {{initiation factor}} eIF 3, occurs in human breast cancers, but how INT 6 relates to carcinogenesis remains unestablished. Here, {{we show that}} INT 6 {{is involved in the}} DNA damage response. INT 6 was required for cell survival following γ-irradiation and G 2 -M checkpoint control. RNA interference-mediated silencing <b>of</b> <b>INT</b> 6 reduced phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinases CHK 1 and CHK 2 after DNA damage. In addition, INT 6 silencing prevented sustained accumulation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) at DNA damage sites in cells treated with γ-radiation or the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin. Mechanistically, this result could be explained by interaction <b>of</b> <b>INT</b> 6 with ATM, which together with INT 6 was recruited to the sites of DNA damage. Finally, INT 6 silencing also reduced ubiquitylation events that promote retention of repair proteins at DNA lesions. Accordingly, accumulation of the repair factor BRCA 1 was defective in the absence <b>of</b> <b>INT</b> 6. Our findings reveal unexpected and striking connections <b>of</b> <b>INT</b> 6 with ATM and BRCA 1 and suggest that the protective action <b>of</b> <b>INT</b> 6 in the onset of breast cancers relies on its involvement in the DNA damage response.

40|$|The rMTC 6 - 23 {{cell line}} {{was derived from}} a calcitonin-producing rat {{medullary}} thyroid carcinoma. During characterization of these cells we discovered that they also synthesize and secrete neurotensin (NT), a tridecapeptide originally isolated from the hypothalamus and not previously associated with C cells. Immunoreactive NT (iNT) was measured with two antisera: HC- 8, which recognizes the COOH-terminal eight amino acids, and TG- 1, which binds the NH 2 -terminal region of NT. By use of these antisera, 2 M acetic acid extracts of rMTC 6 - 23 cells were found to contain 0. 7 [...] 5. 0 pmol <b>of</b> <b>iNT</b> per mg <b>of</b> cell protein. Successive fractionation <b>of</b> <b>iNT</b> from cell extracts by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatograpy, and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography showed at each step a peak <b>of</b> <b>iNT</b> that was indistinguishable from synthetic NT in its chromatographic behavior. Biologic activity <b>of</b> the <b>iNT</b> was confirmed by demonstrating the characteristic fall in arterial blood pressure in the rat after intravenous injection of material purified from rMTC 6 - 23 cells.

40|$|The <b>int</b> gene <b>of</b> {{bacteriophage}} P 2 is {{the only}} viral gene necessary for the integration of P 2 into the Escherichia coli host chromosome. This gene is situated between the phage attachment site, attP, and the repressor C gene, and is cotranscribed with C from the P, promoter, towards attP. The Pc promoter is negatively controlled by the cox gene, {{which is the first}} gene of the early operon. In vitro recombination assays have indicated that in P 2 an overproduction <b>of</b> <b>Int</b> is deleterious to the integrative process. We report here that the level <b>of</b> <b>int</b> expression is affected by several different mechanisms after transcriptional initiation. First, a partial transcription termination signal located between the int and C genes reduces the transcriptional readthrough by about 30 %. Second, the ribosome binding site and AUG codon <b>of</b> the <b>int</b> gene are located in a putative stem-loop structure, which may inhibit the initiation of translation. The nip] mutation (a G to A substitution at the 22 nd coding nucleotide <b>of</b> <b>int</b> which results in an increased efficiency of excision) is shown to relieve this inhibition, possibly through the formation of an alternative mRNA secondary structure. However, the third and probably most important control <b>of</b> <b>int</b> expression in P 2 seems to be that of posttranscriptional autoregulation. The binding site <b>of</b> the <b>Int</b> protein on int gene mRNA is shown to extend into the ribosome binding site <b>of</b> <b>int,</b> supporting our earlier proposed model of competitive binding between Int and ribosomes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{integrase}} (<b>Int)</b> proteins <b>of</b> coliphages HK 022 and λ, are phosphorylated {{in one or}} more {{of their}} tyrosine residues.
