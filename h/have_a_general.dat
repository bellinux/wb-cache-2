5|$|The {{small village}} of Titchwell shows {{the effect that}} {{wildlife}} visitors can have locally. It adjoins the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh, and a 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent £1.8million {{in the area in}} 1998.

5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> area of effect. Four Artes can be assigned to each character, and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E

25|$|Specialist search dogs {{including}} Springer Spaniels and Labradors {{are also}} used by the Dogs Unit to locate drugs or firearms and explosives.

25|$|The {{pyroxene}} group {{consists of}} 21 mineral species. Pyroxenes <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> structure formula of XY(Si2O6), where X is an octahedral site, while Y can vary in coordination number {{from six to}} eight. Most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+ to balance the negative charge on the backbone. Pyroxenes are common in the Earth's crust (about 10%) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks.|$|E

25|$|It is {{somewhat}} problematic {{that a large}} number of definitions have been given for the gamma function. Although they describe the same function, it is not entirely straightforward to prove the equivalence. Stirling never proved that his extended formula corresponds exactly to Euler's gamma function; a proof was first given by Charles Hermite in 1900. Instead of finding a specialized proof for each formula, it would be desirable to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> method of identifying the gamma function.|$|E
25|$|Every {{department}} of the university has a corresponding Student Union and all students belonging to the department {{have the right to}} register as members. The main objective of a student union is to solve students' problems that can either be related to academic life or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> political and social nature. Furthermore, Student Unions organize and support numerous activities such as political debates, educational lectures, cultural and artistic events, conferences, demonstrations, university occupacions and so on.|$|E

25|$|In Marx's {{critique}} of political economy, any labor-product has a value and a use value, {{and if it}} is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, most often expressed as a money-price. Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> utility, implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.|$|E
25|$|Members of the 2Fe-2S {{ferredoxin}} family <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> {{core structure}} consisting of beta(2)-alpha-beta(2), which includes putidaredoxin, terpredoxin, and adrenodoxin. They are proteins of around one hundred amino acids with four conserved cysteine residues {{to which the}} 2Fe-2S cluster is ligated. This conserved region is also found as a domain in various metabolic enzymes and in multidomain proteins, such as aldehyde oxidoreductase (N-terminal), xanthine oxidase (N-terminal), phthalate dioxygenase reductase (C-terminal), succinate dehydrogenase iron-sulphur protein (N-terminal), and methane monooxygenase reductase (N-terminal).|$|E

25|$|Any {{branch of}} an {{organization}} that is part {{of an organization}} banned by the central government of the PRC under state security reasons can be banned in Hong Kong at any time, and the Hong Kong government does not have to conduct any independent investigation. This provision was of particular concern because Mainland China does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> legal mechanism for defining a banned organization or political dissidents. One consequence of this is that it becomes somewhat harder to prosecute regular members of an organization disliked by the PRC, as it requires the central government {{to try to find a}} crime which the individual has committed.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} calculating creditable continuous coverage {{is available to}} the health plan under Title I. That is, 5 categories of health coverage can be considered separately, including dental and vision coverage. Anything not under those 5 categories must use the general calculation (e.g., the beneficiary may be counted with 18 months of general coverage, but only 6 months of dental coverage, because the beneficiary did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> health plan that covered dental until 6 {{months prior to the}} application date). Since limited-coverage plans are exempt from HIPAA requirements, the odd case exists in which the applicant to a general group health plan cannot obtain certificates of creditable continuous coverage for independent limited-scope plans such as dental to apply towards exclusion periods of the new plan that does include those coverages.|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund legal {{structures}} {{vary depending}} on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds {{are not subject to}} both entity-level and personal-level taxation. A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> partner. The general partner may be an individual or a corporation. The general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability. The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions. Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|E
