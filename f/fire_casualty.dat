In addition to the acute effects of smoke inhalation, inhalation of various kinds of toxic gas such as CO, HCI and organic chloride gases (phosgene, chlorethane and aclorein) which are frequently produced by combustion of synthetic construction materials, adsorbed in smoke particles or carried in fumes and deposit mainly into small airway region, {{may result in a}} chronic and irreversible inflammation in the peripheral broh-chopulmonary structures. We had an opportunity to examine, in their chronic stage, 83 subjects out of more than 400 casualties who had suffered from acute smoke inhalation and had been rescued in one of the largest tunnel fire accident in Japan on November 6, 1972. In an attempt to elucidate the chronic pulmonary function consequences in these victims we performed a series of medical examination including pulmonary function study.

50|$|A smartgun is {{a weapon}} (usually a handgun) {{fitted with a}} fire-control system. The {{defining}} feature of a smartgun {{is the ability to}} accurately convey where the weapon is aimed (usually via some sort of Head-up display), and, in the more advanced versions, to target itself within certain limitations set by the users. The purpose of such systems is to allow the precise aiming of automatic fire and the reduction of friendly <b>fire</b> <b>casualties,</b> as in the United States Army's real-world Land Warrior program.|$|R

50|$|Problematically, {{there were}} IFF {{incompatibilities}} {{that threatened to}} label friendly aircraft as foe for want of an IFF signal showing otherwise. The risk of mis-identification of targets and consequent friendly <b>fire</b> <b>casualties</b> rose significantly. Until the squadron was completely re-equipped with new aircraft using only centimetric radar, {{it was necessary to}} ensure that all fighter aircraft in the air at any one time had either VHF or S-Band equipment - never a mixture. The S-Band equipped Beaufighters were unable {{to make use of the}} VHF Radar Beacons. The changeover was not completed until August 1943, just prior to the squadron's departure to Sicily.|$|R
50|$|StGiNU (acronym for Stop the Genocide in Northern Uganda) is an {{advocacy}} group formed {{in the beginning of}} 2005 by Ugandans living in the United Kingdom.

30|$|In direct {{response}} to fire, small mammals must also attempt to either flee or shelter in place. According to Quinn (1979, 1990), animals that perished {{as a direct result}} of fire were sometimes burned and sometimes unburned. Typically, animal corpses are found in groups along roads and trails, in small clearings, or in small depressions in the ground, suggesting unsuccessful attempts at sheltering in place or an inability to outrun the fire. The worst of the immediate <b>fire</b> <b>casualties</b> were the dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes Baird), California mice (Peromyscus californicus Gambel), brush rabbits (Sylvilagus bachmani Waterhouse), and California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi Richardson) (Quinn 1979, 1990).|$|R
