5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> gang slaying.|$|E
500|$|The band {{contributed to}} Bosnian relief efforts to enhance {{humanitarian}} and {{public awareness of}} the issue, and Bono and Carter subsequently collaborated on the documentary Miss Sarajevo, which showcased the war-torn city during Carter's six months living there. In 1995, U2 and Eno wrote the song [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] as a response to [...] "the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of Sarajevo". One such act was a beauty pageant organized by Bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their [...] "lipstick and heels". During the pageant, all of the participants walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said, [...] "Don't let them kill us". [...] The winner of the pageant, 17-year-old Inela Nogić, later said the pageant [...] "was a crazy thing to do during a war. But we tried to live a normal life. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a defence mechanism we all had." [...] Years later, Bono said, [...] "It was pure Dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song." [...] Of the song's meaning, he said, [...] "Everywhere people had heard their call for help—but help never came. That was the feeling. I had tried to tackle subjects like this head-on, but I'd learnt a lesson. You have to try and make the same points, in a different, less direct, more surrealist way." [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] was recorded with Luciano Pavarotti and released as the first single from U2's side-project with Eno entitled Original Soundtracks 1; the record was released under the pseudonym [...] "Passengers".|$|E
2500|$|In August 2017, Rachel Sylvester {{reported}} in The Times that Johnson was ineffective and incoherent on major issues like North Korea and Qatar whilst on Brexit, {{he appeared to}} {{have no idea of}} what was required. His rhetoric seemed to suggest that the UK could dictate the terms [...] "as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> public school game rather than a negotiation on which the future of the nation depends." [...] Sylvester believed that both European ministers and White House officials regard him as a joke. This follows a Today programme interview in June on the Queens speech where, asked about the Government's answer to the [...] "burning injustices," [...] highlighted by Theresa May when she became prime minister, he showed a lack of understanding of the issues sufficiently serious to require prompting by Eddie Mair.|$|E

2500|$|The Cerro de Trincheras ("Trench Hill") is an archeological site, with petroglyphs, plazas and astronomical observatories. The exact {{purpose of}} the area has been disputed, but the area reached its height between 1300 and 1450 CE, when it had {{population}} of about 1,000, which made its living growing corn, squash, cotton and agave. Its largest structure is called La Cancha ("The Ballcourt"), {{which is at the}} base of the north side of the hill. It is a rectangular patio marked by rocks piled on its edges, measuring [...] Some researchers believe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ball court and others believe it was a kind of open air theater. On the hill itself is an observatory, which gives views of the area. Most of the area’s artifacts of stone and shell were found here. The Plaza de Caracol (Snail Plaza) is marked by a meter and a half high stone wall in an open spiral, most likely used for ceremonies.|$|E

One day when old Mr. Frewen {{was a young man}} of eighteen his father came home and said, 'Sandy, I bought a piano at Simon Ward's sale to-day. You're to go to-morrow and bring it home.'

60|$|These are {{the most}} {{remarkable}} doings of the ghost at Garpsdal, according to the evidence of Sir Saemund, Magnus, Gudrun, and all the household at Garpsdal, all of whom will confirm their witness with an oath, and aver that no human being could have been so invisible there by day and night, but rather that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> spirit that did the mischief. From the story itself it may be seen that neither Magnus nor any other person could have accomplished the like, and all the folk will confirm this, and clear all persons in the matter, so far as they know. In this form the story was told to me, the subscriber, to Samuel Egilsson and Bjarni Oddsson, by the minister himself and his household, at Garpsdal, 28th May, 1808. That this is correctly set down, after what the minister Sir Saemund related to me, I witness here at Stad on Reykjanes, 7th June, 1808.|$|E

Certainly the corner allotted to my own editorial business was of temporary assignment; I was there until we could find a more permanent office. The man {{had nothing to do with}} me or with the publishers; he had no manuscript, or plan for an article which he wished to propose and to talk himself into writing, so that he might bring it with a claim to acceptance, as though he had been asked to write it. In fact, he did not even look of the writing sort; and his affair with some other occupant of that anomalous place could have been in no wise literary. Probably <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> insurance business, and I have been left with the impression of fussiness in his conduct of it; he had to my involuntary attention an effect of conscious unwelcome with it.|$|E

Kitano takes out his female neighbor (Kotomi Kyono) and commits a bank robbery. Accomplishing his fantasies of acting like a movie star 'Beat' Takeshi, Kitano takes a journey into the absolutely bizarre, surreal world (an underground nightclub, night gun battles, and the catastrophe at a Boiling Point-, or Sonatine-like tropical island).|$|R
