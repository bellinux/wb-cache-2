25|$|In 1764 he {{was called}} {{to serve as the}} chair of {{mathematics}} at the University of Pavia, and he held this post with the directorship of the observatory of Brera in Milan, for six years. That is where Charles Burney met him; since Burney's Italian was not very <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, Boscovich obliged him speaking French.|$|E
25|$|Lanying {{wanted to}} come back to China after graduation. However, the {{political}} situation was not <b>good.</b> <b>At</b> <b>that</b> time, America needed a lot of scientists and wanted to keep international students. Many Chinese students were not allowed to go back home. Because of this situation, she decided to work in America for some time and learn more things and use them to develop her homeland in the future. By the recommendation of her professor in University of Pennsylvania, she decided to work as a senior engineer at the Sylvania Company which mainly worked for semiconductors. At that time, the company had failed many times in making mono-crystalline silicon. Lanying found out the problems and helped the company successfully making the silicon.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Padres {{general manager}} Joe McIlvaine stated the Padres {{would have never}} {{selected}} Hamilton if they knew his agent was Scott Boras. McIlvaine said of the situation, [...] "Basically, he lied to us. We had no idea. That's why half the time, you don't know who he represents. [...] very <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> His clients are very good about keeping their mouths shut." [...] McIlvaine retracted his comments about Hamilton and Boras after Boras threatened to sue McIlvaine.|$|E
50|$|Although on {{the surface}} the company {{appeared}} to be doing well, it had overextended itself financially and went bankrupt in 1807, a common fate of businesses importing <b>goods</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time. Lester died at Quebec City a few months later.|$|R
50|$|In {{many respects}} this Incoterm has {{replaced}} FOB in modern usage, although the critical {{point at which}} the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place.

50|$|In Paris, riders on the Metro may {{encounter}} coin-operated toilets {{in the underground}} stations; and even non-mechanized toilets occasionally have attendants who accept tips.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for Decca Records, not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist. He made his first recording in 1947, playing Brahms's First Violin Sonata with the violinist Georg Kulenkampff. He was insistent {{that he wanted to}} conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven's Egmont overture. Twenty years later Solti said, [...] "I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time and I was so excited. It is horrible, surely horrible– but by now it has vanished." [...] He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London, Haydn's Drum Roll symphony, in sessions produced by John Culshaw, with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades. Reviewing the record, The Gramophone said, [...] "The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution." [...] The Record Guide compared it favourably with EMI's rival recording by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the early}} years of their {{relationship}} were difficult, as Wrangler and Whiting struggled with Wrangler's homosexuality. When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, [...] "only around the edges, dear." [...] Wrangler explained in an interview : [...] "When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door when I got home at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her. So I finally said that's it. I went to her one night and said I'm never going to cheat on you again with anybody. So my sex life became very masturbatory. And I'm good at that-very <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> in fact.". The couple was married from 1994 until his death.|$|E
2500|$|At Castle Howard, the Earl of Carlisle had {{obtained}} The Adoration of the Kings previously {{created for the}} Grandmontines, which throws together some thirty figures on an architectural background, varied in detail, massive in shape and fanciful in ornament. This painting is now {{on display at the}} National Gallery, which bought it in 1911. [...] Gossaert surprises the viewer with pompous costume and flaring contrasts of tone. His figures, like pieces on a chess-board, are often rigid and conventional. The landscape which shows through the colonnades is adorned with towers and steeples in the minute fashion of Van der Weyden. After a residence of a few years at Antwerp, Gossaert took service with Philip of Burgundy, bastard of Philip the <b>Good,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time lord of Somerdyk and admiral of Zeeland. One of his pictures had already become celebrated: a Descent from the Cross (50 figures), on the high altar of Tongerlo Abbey.|$|E
50|$|The first Russian circumnavigation of {{the world}} was {{intended}} to establish a link with Russian possessions in America, the transport of <b>goods</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time being via Siberia (a journey lasting about two years). The second objective, which was not achieved, was to establish trade and diplomatic links with Japan. This expedition took place during the rule of emperor Alexander I (1777-1825).|$|R

40|$|People high in {{rumination}} are <b>good</b> <b>at</b> tasks <b>that</b> require persistence whereas people low in rumination are <b>good</b> <b>at</b> tasks <b>that</b> require flexibility. Here {{we examine}} real world {{implications of these}} differences in dynamic, team sport. In two studies, we found that professional male football (soccer) players from Germany and female field hockey players on the US national team were lower in rumination than were non-athletes. Further, low levels of rumination were associated with a longer career {{at a higher level}} in football players. Results indicate that athletes in dynamic, team sport might benefit from the flexibility associated with being low in rumination...|$|R
