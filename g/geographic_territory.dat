5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger King has used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in a defined <b>geographic</b> <b>territory.</b> This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a restructuring of its franchising system, tossing the old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 restructuring, led by a new director of operations, firmly placed the mantel of franchise oversight on the shoulders of the company.|$|E

25|$|The Hamas {{takeover}} of the Gaza Strip in 2007 {{was the first time}} since the Sudanese coup of 1989 that brought Omar al-Bashir to power, that a Muslim Brotherhood group ruled a significant <b>geographic</b> <b>territory.</b> However, the 2013 overthrow of the Mohammad Morsi government in Egypt significantly weakened Hamas's position, leading to a blockade of Gaza and economic crisis.|$|E
25|$|The terms Spain and the Spains {{were not}} interchangeable. Spain was a <b>geographic</b> <b>territory,</b> home to several kingdoms (Christian and Muslim), with {{separate}} governments, laws, languages, religions, and customs, {{and was the}} historical remnant of the Hispano-Gothic unity. Spain was not a political entity until much later, and when referring to the Middle Ages, one should not be confounded with the nation-state of today. The term The Spains referred specifically to a collective of juridico-political units, first the Christian kingdoms, and then the different kingdoms ruled by the same king.|$|E
25|$|Tech Valley {{began as}} a {{marketing}} name for {{the eastern part of}} the U.S. state of New York, encompassing the Capital District and the Hudson Valley. Originated in 1998 to promote the greater Albany area as a high-tech competitor to regions such as Silicon Valley and Boston, the moniker subsequently grew to represent the counties in New York between IBM's Westchester County plants in the south and the U.S.-Canadian border to the north, and has since evolved to constitute both the technologically-oriented metonym and the <b>geographic</b> <b>territory</b> comprising most of New York State north of New York City. The area's high technology ecosystem is supported by technologically-focused academic institutions including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute. Tech Valley grew from encompassing 19 counties straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway, and with heavy state taxpayer subsidy, has experienced significant growth in the computer hardware side of the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, and water- and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing, involving companies including IBM in Armonk and its Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, GlobalFoundries in Malta, and others. As of 2015, venture capital investment in Tech Valley had grown to US$163 million. Westchester County has developed a burgeoning biotechnology sector in the 21st century, with over US$1 billion in planned private investment as of 2016, earning the county the nickname Biochester.|$|E

500|$|Since 2003, Opus Dei has {{received}} world attention {{as a result}} of Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the novel. In The Da Vinci Code, Opus Dei is portrayed as a Catholic organization that is led into a sinister international conspiracy. In general, The Da Vinci Code has been sharply criticized for its numerous factual inaccuracies, by a wide array of scholars and historians. According to the Anglican Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, the novel is a [...] "great thriller" [...] but [...] "lousy history". For example, Silas, a major villain in The Da Vinci Code is a monk {{who is a member of}} Opus Dei—but in reality there are no monks in Opus Dei. The Da Vinci Code implies that Opus Dei is the Pope's personal prelature—but the term [...] "personal prelature" [...] does not refer to a special relationship to the Pope: It means an institution in which the jurisdiction of the prelate is not linked to a <b>geographic</b> <b>territory</b> but over persons, wherever they be. Nonetheless, Brown stated that his portrayal of Opus Dei was based on interviews with members and ex-members, and books about Opus Dei. An Opus Dei spokesman questioned this statement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of Islamic {{groups in the}} Gaza Strip has grown since the 1980s, especially as poverty has risen and fighting with Israel began in 2000. The efforts to impose Islamic law and traditions continued when Hamas forcefully seized control of the area in June 2007 and displaced security forces loyal to the secular President Mahmoud Abbas. After the civil war ended, Hamas declared the [...] "end of secularism and heresy in the Gaza Strip." [...] For {{the first time since}} the Sudanese coup of 1989 that brought Omar al-Bashir to power, a Muslim Brotherhood group ruled a significant <b>geographic</b> <b>territory.</b> Gaza human rights groups accuse Hamas of restricting many freedoms in the course of these attempts.|$|E

Simultaneously, the Circle of Magi has gone rogue, in part due to the events of Dragon Age II, and the Templar Order seceded from the Chantry to wage their own civil war on the mages.|$|E
2500|$|The Slavic {{settlements}} organized themselves along {{tribal and}} territorially based lines which {{were referred to}} by Byzantine Greek historians as [...] "Sklaviniai". The Sklaviniai continued to intermittently assault the Byzantine Empire, either independently, or aided by Bulgar or Avar contingents. Around 680 AD a [...] "Bulgar" [...] group (which was largely composed of the descendants of former Roman Christians taken captive by the Avars), led by Khan Kuber (theorized to have belonged to the same clan as the Danubian Bulgarian khan Asparukh), settled in the Pelagonian plain, and launched campaigns to the region of Thessaloniki. When the Empire could spare imperial troops, it attempted {{to regain control of}} its lost Balkan territories. By the time of Constans II a significant number of the Slavs of Macedonia were captured and transferred to central Asia Minor where they were forced to recognize the authority of the Byzantine emperor and serve in his ranks. In the late 7th century, Justinian II again organized a massive expedition against the Sklaviniai and Bulgars of Macedonia. Launching from Constantinople, he subdued many Slavic tribes and established the Theme of Thrace in the hinterland of the Great City, and pushed on into Thessaloniki. However, on his return he was ambushed by the Slavo-Bulgars of Kuber, losing a great part of his army, booty, and subsequently his throne. Despite these temporary successes, rule in the region was far from stable since not all of the Sklaviniae were pacified, and those that were often rebelled. The emperors rather resorted to withdrawing their defensive line south along the Aegean coast, until the late 8th century. Although a new theme—that of [...] "Macedonia"—was subsequently created, it did not correspond to today's <b>geographic</b> <b>territory,</b> but one farther east (centred on Adrianople), carved out of the already existing Thracian and Helladic themes.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we use {{a spatial}} {{competition}} model developed by Pal (1998) to analyze producer imposed retail price ceilings and producer assigned exclusive <b>geographic</b> sales <b>territories.</b> Two wholesale distributors are presumed to each have a single collection point respectively from which they supply retail outlets at many locations. Each wholesaler chooses the quantity to ship to each outlet and the retail prices attain market clearing levels. Given {{that the costs of}} shipping depend on distance, this system results in a kind of waste in that the products are not shipped exclusively from the nearest collection point. As pointed out by Matsumura (2002) this wasteful crosshauling can be prevented if the manufacturer assigns exclusive <b>geographic</b> <b>territories</b> to the distributors. But the costs of administering an exclusive territory system may well outweigh any savings in shipping costs. In this instance a manufacturer stipulated price ceiling may be the preferred alternative. By controlling not only the manufacturer price but also the retail priceat each location, the manufacturer can deter wasteful cross-hauling and expand the overall channel profit, while also conferring enlarged consumer surplus...|$|R

In a peacetime due to loss of a strategic direction fronts were transformed into military regions (districts) responsible for an assigned section of operations.|$|R
