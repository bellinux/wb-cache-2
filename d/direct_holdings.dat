40|$|The authors analyze a {{range of}} {{corporate}} governance variables as they pertain {{to a sample of}} bank holding companies (BHCs) and manufacturing firms. They find that BHCs have larger boards and that the percentage of outside directors on these boards is significantly higher; also, BHC boards have more committees and meet slightly more frequently. Conversely, the proportion of CEO stock option pay to salary plus bonuses as well as the percentage and market value of <b>direct</b> equity <b>holdings</b> are smaller for bank holding companies. Furthermore, fewer institutions hold shares of BHCs relative to shares of manufacturing firms, and the institutions hold a smaller percentage of a BHC's equity. These observed differences in variables suggest that governance structures are industry-specific. The differences, the authors argue, might be due to differences in the investment opportunities of the firms in the two industries {{as well as to the}} presence of regulation in the banking industry.

40|$|In many {{countries}} around the world, stock and real estate {{are the two most}} important asset classes in household portfolios. This is particularly the case in Australia where fund assets (very heavily weighted toward equity) in superannuation (Australia’s system of compulsory private pensions) now account for some $ 1. 3 trillion and are now third-ranked in the OECD in terms of the percentage of GDP (90. 9 %) after the Netherlands and Iceland and well above the OECD average of 71. 6 %. Of course, this excludes <b>direct</b> equity <b>holdings</b> and additional indirect equity holdings in the form of trusts. As shown in Table 1, we could conservatively argue that 82 % of the Australian population hold equity holdings indirectly in the form of superannuation and 34 % directly, with possibly another 3 % in the form of equity trusts, potentially representing up to 65 % of household financial assets and 13 % of all household assets. A similar situation exists with real estate, especially given that Australians have among the world’s highest rates of homeownership, with 67 % of households owning or purchasing their own home and 20...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of whether the trading of retail investors causes stock price anomalies. Our intent is to study settings in which retail investors are most likely to have influence on market prices. Previous research suggests that retail investors have more influence in small capitalization stocks, and argues that retail investors are most likely to be irrational. Most theories of stock price anomalies hypothesize the presence of irrational traders. Consequently, we focus on stock price anomalies in primarily small capitalization stocks. Our data are from the Australian Stock Exchange Clearinghouse. The Australian stock market is characterized by a high level of <b>direct</b> stock <b>holdings</b> by individual investors, further enhancing the likelihood of retail investors' influence. We investigate the Granger causality between investor category trading and stock prices, and display the relative trading volume of the investor categories. We conclude that retail investors are not responsible for stock mispricing. Since retail investors do not affect prices in this carefully selected environment, we infer that their trading is unlikely to influence stock market prices. Our conclusion has important implications for theories, particularly behavioral finance theories, that are dependent on the influence of retail investor trading in stock markets. retail investor, individual investor, asset pricing, behavioral finance,...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{main purpose}} of the study is to examine the {{influence}} of family directors on the firm performance of public listed companies (PLCs) in Malaysia. This study provides empirical evidence on the agency problems between controlling shareholders and minority interests in the concentrated ownership setting. Design/methodology/approach Samples of the study are 112 PLCs in year 2006. Two measures of firm performance are used: return on assets (ROA) and Tobin’s Q. Managerial ownership refers to the percentage shareholdings of executive directors with <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>holdings.</b> It was further categorized into family ownership and non-family ownership. Findings In relation to ROA, managerial ownership is found positively significant. The results also show that the positive relationship between managerial ownership is contributed by the managerial-non-family ownership.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{similarity}} {{of public and private}} real estate returns and risks over the long horizon using data for the U. S and the U. K. The results show evidence of a one-to-one relationship between publicly traded REIT performance and privately traded direct real estate investment performance in three out of four U.

The return volatilities generally do not differ significantly between the REIT and direct real estate markets regardless of investment horizon. The findings have important practical implications. First, they indicate that public and private real estate investments can be considered to work as good substitutes in an investment portfolio with several years investment horizon. Second, they suggest that REIT related ETFs and derivatives could be used to hedge risks caused by investors’ <b>direct</b> real estate <b>holdings</b> or by lending institutions’ mortgage lending inventory...|$|R

40|$|Swiss {{institutional}} investors hold approximately 19 % of their wealth in property, and {{the bulk of}} the allocation to property is housing. The financial reasons which are often given to motivate this investment strategy are twofold. Firstly, property returns are hypothesised to be lowly correlated with the returns on stocks and bonds, and the inclusion of property in portfolios of financial assets should lead to diversification benefits. Secondly, property is viewed as acting as an effective hedge against inflation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} empirically investigate these two assumptions on the basis of hedonic price indices for Geneva and Zurich apartment buildings. In particular, it is examined whether an investor who already holds Geneva (Zurich) housing should invest in the other canton. It is also investigated whether real estate funds should be included in the portfolio in addition to <b>direct</b> real estate <b>holdings.</b> The results suggest that housing is an effective portfolio diversifier but does not provide any better short term inflation-hedging effectiveness than financial asset...|$|R
5000|$|The {{total value}} of equity-backed {{securities}} in the United States rose over 600% in the 25 years between 1989 and 2012 as market capitalization expanded from $2,790 billion to $18,668 billion. Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000. Indirect participation {{in the form of}} retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time. [...] Rydqvist, Spizman, and Strebulaev attribute the differential growth in <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>holdings</b> to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} nature of capital inflows into Asia since {{the peak of the}} US dollar {{in the first quarter of}} 2002 and the policy {{responses}} to them. Portfolio equity flows have become more volatile and more responsive to global equity market developments. Inflows into local bond markets have become important, although they are often immeasurable, virtual investments through derivative instruments. In the market that shows the highest level of <b>direct</b> non-resident <b>holdings,</b> namely that of Indonesia, these seem quite sensitive to global equity volatility. The most important qualitative change over this period involved bank flows. In particular, foreign bank flows have returned to net inflows after five years of paydown after the 1997 - 98 financial crisis. Carry trades, although difficult to measure, appear to have become important, with notable growth in transactions in which a long position in one regional currency is taken against a short position in another one. Carry trades also show great sensitivity to global equity volatility. In the face of such increasingly volatile capital inflows, the authorities in the region have adopted both measures to encourage outflows and to discourage inflows. Outside of Korea, measures to encourage outflows have met with limited response owing to expectations of further strength in the domestic currency and, until recently, buoyant domestic equity markets. Some of the measures to discourage inflows have taken the form of making previous measures to discourage outflows more symmetric, while others have taken the form of reinstating much reduced or eliminated restrictions, while other have taken the form of new adaptations. These limits on capital inflows can be quite effective, but they set back the development of financial markets and clash with ambitions for internationalized currencies in the region...|$|R
