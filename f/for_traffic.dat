5|$|M-146 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that initially served as a bypass <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> going around Port Huron and as a short cut <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> between U.S. Highway25 (US 25) and M-21. Later it connected to the Blue Water Bridge before it was truncated to its final form. Segments of M-146 still exist today as state highways as part of Interstate94 (I-94) and I-69 and the Lapeer Connector.|$|E

40|$|In this article, the {{intersection}} of gender, <b>trafficking</b> <b>for</b> sexual exploitation, and use of digital communication technologies are analyzed {{based on data from}} the European Union (EU). Over the past two decades, an increase in trafficking in human beings in the EU has been accompanied by an increase in the development and availability of digital communication technologies. The first statistical analysis of trafficking in human beings (2008 - 2010) carried out by the European Commission found 23, 632 victims of human trafficking in the reporting member states. Eighty percent of victims were women and girls; 20 % were men and boys. The majority of the victims (62 %) were <b>trafficked</b> <b>for</b> sexual exploitation. Digital communication technologies are widely used <b>for</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>for</b> sexual exploitation, and more rarely <b>for</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>for</b> forced labor. This article concludes that the combination of gender, <b>trafficking</b> <b>for</b> sexual exploitation, and use of digital communication technologies has created a nexus of victimization for women and girls. Based on this analysis and other sources of information, the European region is the world’s leading region <b>for</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>for</b> sexual exploitation...|$|R

The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> crossing Long Bridge.|$|E

5|$|This {{entrance}} {{was expected}} to replace the need for Elisenberg Station, and was located {{in the middle of}} the Oslo Tunnel, between Nationaltheatret and Skøyen. Oslo Byes Vel and the Conservative, Red and Centre parties opposed the construction of the entrance, arguing that it would ruin the south-western corner of the Palace Park. The Conservative Party proposed building it further south, across Henrik Ibsens gate, either in Hansteens gate or in Parkveien near Oslo Commerce School, while the others wanted to open Elisenberg Station <b>for</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker.

Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold.|$|E
