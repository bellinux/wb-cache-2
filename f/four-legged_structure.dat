500|$|Following {{the release}} of No Line on the Horizon, U2 staged a {{worldwide}} stadium tour, titled the U2 360° Tour. Beginning on 30June 2009 in Barcelona, the tour visited Europe, North America, Oceania, Africa and South America from 2009 to 2011 and comprised 110 shows. The concerts featured a 360-degree stage that the audience surrounded. To accommodate this, a large <b>four-legged</b> <b>structure</b> nicknamed [...] "The Claw" [...] was built above the stage. At 50meters (165feet) tall, {{it was the largest}} stage ever constructed and twice the size of the previous largest set, which was used on The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour. The idea for the stage had been proposed to the group by the set designer Willie Williams {{at the end of the}} Vertigo Tour in 2006. The design was intended to overcome the staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker stacks on either side. Despite grossing over US$311million from 44shows over its first two legs, the tour was barely breaking even, with production costs of approximately US$750,000 per day. In 2010, U2's scheduled headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival 2010 and their North American leg were postponed until the following year after Bono suffered a serious back injury. By its conclusion in July 2011, U2 360° had set records for the highest-grossing concert tour with $736million in ticket sales, and for the highest-attended tour with 7.3million tickets sold.|$|E
500|$|The group {{embarked}} on the U2 360° Tour in June 2009; {{it was their}} first live venture for Live Nation under a 12-year, US$100million (£50million) deal signed the year prior, through which the company assumed control over the band's touring, merchandising, and official website. The U2 360° Tour concerts featured the band playing stadiums [...] "in the round" [...] on a circular stage, allowing the audience to surround them on all sides.

On 25 October 2009, U2 set a new US record for single concert attendance for one headline act, performing to 97,014 people at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. At year's end, Rolling Stone named U2 one of eight [...] "Artists of the Decade". The band continued the 360° Tour in 2010 with legs in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. However, their scheduled headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival 2010 and their North American leg that year were postponed following a serious injury to Bono's back. These appearances were rescheduled for 2011 after the South African and South American legs of the tour.

5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large <b>four-legged</b> steel <b>structure</b> that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|R

50|$|Noble Drilling and Wood {{subsidiary}} Mustang Engineering, {{part of the}} Wood Group, won {{the contract}} for Front-End Engineering Design (FEED). They proposed a single steel jacket with an integrated topsides deck with processing facilities, accommodation and a separate modular drilling rig. The steel jacket for Clair is located over the existing 206/8-10z well. The jacket is a <b>four-legged</b> single steel <b>structure</b> with a height of approximately 165 m. At its base, the jacket measures 45 by 50 m, has a height of 169 m, and a total weight of 8,800 tons. Both jacket and topsides are designed for fabrication, transportation and installation as single fully integrated lifts (maximum 10,500t) that require access to the heaviest lift capability vessels on the installation market.

40|$|AbstractIn this article, a {{comparison}} of the moments and forces at the joints of a jacket structure is made between fully coupled aero-hydro-elastic simulations in HAWC 2 and uncoupled load predictions in the finite element software Abaqus. The jacket sub structure is modelled in moderate deep waters of 50 m and designed for the 5 MW NREL baseline wind turbine. External conditions are based on wind and wave joint distribution for a site in the North Sea. The turbulent wind field in HAWC 2 is generated by random values, defined by the Mann Turbulence model, for each operational mean wind speed. A <b>four-legged</b> jacket <b>structure</b> similar to the Upwind reference jacket is developed in the Abaqus environment, to which is added the transition piece and tower. The aeroelastic loads determined in normal operating conditions of the turbine is integrated and centralized as nodal forces and moments acting at the tower top of the finite element model. Hydrodynamic loads from the incoming waves are computed using the Morison equation and based on a nonlinear irregular wave field. Velocities, accelerations and amplitudes of the wave field as well as tower top forces and moments are used as inputs for the structural analysis in Abaqus. The fully coupled simulation is implemented and performed in HAWC 2. In the uncoupled case, the loads (wave loads and tower base loads) are analysed by an implicit structural Finite Element Analysis (Abaqus 6. 11 - 1). A subroutine is used as a preprocessor generating a beam element model and linking the loads to the components as nodal forces. In both simulation cases, the integrated loads acting on the jacket legs are computed as time series and as damage equivalent loading. The analysis and comparison of the fully coupled and decoupled simulation method show that the results vary depending on the structural stiffness and the applied wave loads. Variation in the amplitudes of the moments and forces on the jacket legs up to 25 % was observed between the results obtained from coupled and uncoupled simulations...|$|R

Part of the Johnson Estate 2 is given over to a working farm circa 1870 that {{presents}} various aspects of domestic practice from the era. This includes a desert fridge which is a simple <b>four-legged</b> <b>structure</b> with a slightly battered profile thatis draped in calico. Its principle is simple, water from an upturned jar is drawn by osmosis {{down the sides of}} the calico where it evaporates in wind currents drawn though a “dog runi between two log cabins. Cooled air circulates within the structure and where cheese and milk are kept fresh during the summer. The desert fridge is a simple system that reaches a state of equilibrium through the natural process of evaporation. This system provides a working model for a prototype structure for an outdoor dining pavilion that was designed and constructed on the campus of Arizona State University.

The long-term aim of this project is to provide a multiple of these pavilions across the campus that will be the locus of a sequence of dining events over a “dining seasoni 4 during the fall and spring semester., This paper describes how the desert fridge principle has been interpreted in the program and construction of the dining pavilion. It explores a sequence of levels by which the structure, via digital production process, provides an educational narrative on sustainability. This communicative quality is portrayed by the building in direct biological terms, through tacit knowledge, perceived phenomena, lexical and mechanical systems. The paper also describes how these digital production process were used in the buildingis design and fabrication. These range from an empirical prognosis of evaporative cooling effects, fluid dynamics, heat mapping and solar radiation analysis through to sheet steel laser cutting, folded plate construction and fully associative variable models of standard steel construction. The aim of the pavilion is to create an environment that presents the evaporative cooling message at a multiple of levels that will concentrate the visitor in holistic understanding of the processes imbued within the building. ...|$|E
