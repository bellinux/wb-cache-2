40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show that a number of key features of the Dang Van high cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion</b> can be observed using simple polycrystalline computational models. This paper presents a series of numerical computations for an inclusion consisting of 156 grains embedded in a homogeneous matrix. The grains are modeled using a polycrystalline single slip elasto-plastic model, whilst the matrix is considered as elastic. As expected the numerical simulations confirm the theoretical prediction on which the Dang Van <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion</b> is based, that if a large enough number of grains is considered under uniform loading, a grain with the least favourable lattice orientation will always be present. This grain will constitute the weakest link in the assembly and thus its fatigue life largely determines the fatigue life of the bulk material. Next the question of stress-gradients in the high cycle fatigue regime is addressed. An example of stress gradients appears around notches as they create stress concentrations in structures. It is a well known problem that fatigue criteria have to be locally arranged using stress-factors or critical distances in order to give satisfactory predictions. The work presented here shows that an analysis of the problem at the grain scale explains the apparent discrepancy when using classical fatigue criteria.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to study}} the benefit of rail grinding on service life of railroad rails, focusing on failures due to rolling contact fatigue (RCF) at the rail head. Assuming a tangent rail with one-point contact at the running surface, a finite element analysis of a full-scale wheel-rail rolling contact with a nonlinear isotropic kinematic hardening material model is performed to simulate the accumulation of residual stresses and strains in the rail head. Using rolling stress and strain results from the sixth loading cycle, in which residual stresses and strains are at their steady-state, as input, two critical plane fatigue criteria are proposed for fatigue analyses. The first <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion</b> is the stress-based approach?namely the Findley <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion.</b> It suggests an important role of tensile residual stresses on subsurface crack nucleation and early growth in the rail head, but applications of the criterion to the near-running-surface region are limited because of plastic deformation from wheel-rail contact. The second <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion</b> is the strain-based approach?namely the Fatemi-Socie <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion.</b> Contributed mainly from shear strain amplitudes and factorized by normal stress components, the criterion also predicts fatigue crack nucleation at the subsurface as a possible failure mode as well as fatigue crack nucleation at the near-surface, while maintaining its validity in both regions. A collection of fatigue test data of various types of rail steel from literature is analyzed to determine a relationship between fatigue damages and number of cycles to failure. Considering a set of wheel loads with their corresponding number of rolling passage as a loading unit (LU), optimizations of grinding schedules with genetic algorithm (GA) show that fatigue life of rail increases by varying amount when compared against that from the no-grinding case. Results show that the proposed grinding schedules, optimized with the exploratory and local-search genetic algorithms, can increase fatigue life of rail by 240 percent. The optimization framework {{is designed to be}} able to determine a set of optimal grinding schedules for different types of rail steel and different contact configurations, i. e. two-point contact occurred when cornering...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the fatigue life of two components in different hydraulic quick couplings. The crack which initiates the fatigue failure usually occurs {{in the bottom of}} one of the threads. Thus, the threads in the coupling are carefully investigated. A few different approaches for determining the fatigue life are studied for each component. CAD (Computer Aided Design) models for both components are created and analyzed with FEM (Finite Element Method). By analyzing these components with FEM the stresses and the strains are calculated. These values for stress and strain are used to determine the fatigue life for the different components. The first component is suffering from high cycle fatigue. Four different approaches for high cycle fatigue are investigated. These four are Wöhler-curve, Haigh-diagram, von Mises <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion</b> and Mises-Sines <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion.</b> It was found that all of them but the von Mises <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion</b> give a good approximation of the fatigue life. von Mises <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion</b> does not consider the midstress, which can be a reason for this. The three other approaches indicate that the component will be suffering from fatigue, but will be relatively close to infinite life. The Wöhler-curve indicates that the component will withstand about 470 000 loading cycles. Compared to the experimental tests where the component withstands about 700 000 loading cycles, {{it can be said that}} the approach is a good estimation of the fatigue life. Approximated material data are used. For further work it is essential to obtain experimental material data for better approximation of the fatigue life. The second component is suffering from low cycle fatigue, which means that different approaches are needed. The approaches are originally from Coffin-Manson and Morrow. A total of four low cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>criterion</b> have been studied. The first one is made by CoffinManson and takes the plastic strain in to account, the second is made by Morrow and takes both the elastic and the plastic strain in to account.  The third is a modification of Morrow’s criterion, and will consider the midstresses as well. The fourth is a simplification of Morrow’s criterion where more common material parameters are used. These four have been compared and it can be seen that the CoffinManson criterion gives the best approximation of the reality. The Coffin-Manson criterion gives an approximation of 50 000 loading cycles to fatigue failure which, compared to that the experimental tests suffered from fatigue failure after about 40 000 loading cycles, is a good estimation of the fatigue life...|$|E
