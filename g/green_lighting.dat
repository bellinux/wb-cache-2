The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and <b>green</b> <b>lighting.</b> Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the episode came from the SG-1 writers wondering for years what George Hammond, the SGC leader from seasons one through seven, does while SG-1 is away on missions. Imagined scenarios ranged from the general dealing with minor decisions like bunting and lunch buffet, to averting major emergencies and threats. The episode's working title was [...] "A Day in the Life of General O'Neill", but writer Robert C. Cooper felt [...] "Zero Hour" [...] was more appropriate, referring to the President's visit {{at the end of}} the episode. The subplot of the SGC being overrun with plant life originates in a Season 4 idea by writer and producer Brad Wright. To not interrupt the shooting process, the set was decorated with various plants and vines overnight. Some plants were plastic, but real plants were used for the torching scenes, sprayed to be flame retardant so as not to burn the whole set. Jim Menard as the director of photography was responsible for the <b>green</b> <b>lighting</b> when the emergency lighting goes off.

2500|$|The use {{of amber}} lights to alert drivers that a spotter vehicle is parked is controversial. Light bars and strobe lights have been {{becoming}} increasingly popular with storm spotters and storm chasers since, proponents claim, both groups often travel {{in less than}} ideal weather conditions where visibility may be limited. However, in recent years, some spotters and chasers have been seen using red, blue, white, and/or <b>green</b> <b>lighting</b> devices, apparently imitating emergency vehicles. Such actions are illegal in most areas and are highly condemned by both the spotter and storm chaser communities. Said Chuck Doswell, [...] "flashing light bars added to your chase vehicle (similar to those used by law enforcement) may be illegal in some places and their use to imply some sort of official status to your chasing {{is probably going to}} get you in trouble". Chris Novy, a trainer of storm spotters throughout the US and a veteran storm chaser, also notes that lights distract and can even unconsciously attract other drivers and that lights may encourage people to drive aggressively or to park in situations they would otherwise avoid and thus increase danger to themselves and to other drivers.|$|E

He had shot a wild goose, and this, with the remains of their biscuit, served them both for supper and for breakfast. Next day at noon they passed a little clearing, in the centre of which were the charred embers of a fire. Amos spent half an hour in reading all that sticks and ground could tell him. Then, as they resumed their way, he explained to his companions that the fire had been lit three weeks before, that a white man and two Indians had camped there, that they had been journeying from west to east, and that one of the Indians had been a squaw. No other traces of their fellow-mortals did they come across, until late in the afternoon Amos halted suddenly in the heart of a thick grove, and raised his hand to his ear.|$|E

40|$|Based {{on human}} and animal research, it appears that light {{administered}} {{in the last two}} hours of sleep might be particularly effective as an antidepressant and in advancing circadian rhythms. <b>Green</b> <b>light</b> might be more effective than white light. An obvious advantage of light treatment during sleep is that disturbance and time cost during waking hours might be avoided. For these reasons, we decided to explore effects of a light treatment with a <b>green</b> <b>light</b> mask used for in the last hours of sleep. Subjects were 30 adults aged 18 - 35 years. This protocol took take place at the subjects' homes and lasted 15 days after recruitment (3 -day baseline period and 12 -day intervention period). Throughout the study, participants maintained sleep and compliance diaries and wore a wrist actigraph. The study was a randomized, controlled clinical trial of a bright <b>green</b> <b>light</b> mask versus a dim red light mask. The two treatments were a bright <b>green</b> <b>light</b> and dim red light. Post-treatment interviews showed that all subjects reported some discomfort from the masks, but compliance was good overall. Symptom inventory scores did not differentiate groups, suggesting no significant differences in side effects. Mood ratings and sleep questionnaires did not differentiate groups. Sleep diaries distinguished groups, suggesting worse sleep overall in the green mask group. Actigraphy showed a significant circadian phase advance in the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> group. This suggests that the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> had a physiological effect. These findings suggest that <b>green</b> <b>light</b> masks are safe and tolerable; while the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> mask worsened perceived sleep overall, no specific factors were implicated and such complaints may simply be due to earlier awakening caused by a phase advance. Also, early morning <b>green</b> <b>light</b> presented during sleep produced a significant phase shift, suggesting that while there were no symptom benefits evidenced in this healthy sample, <b>green</b> <b>light</b> masks may be useful in clinical and research applications (e. g., mood disorders, endocrine functioning, delayed sleep phase syndrome) where circadian phase shifts have resulted in positive outcome...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Bright {{white light}} has been {{successfully}} used {{for the treatment of}} depression. There is interest in identifying which spectral colors of light are the most efficient in the treatment of depression. It is theorized that <b>green</b> <b>light</b> could decrease the intensity duration of exposure needed. Late Wake Treatment (LWT), sleep deprivation for the last half of one night, is associated with rapid mood improvement which has been sustained by light treatment. Because spectral responsiveness may differ by age, we examined whether <b>green</b> <b>light</b> would provide efficient antidepressant treatment in an elder age group. Methods We contrasted one hour of bright <b>green</b> <b>light</b> (1, 200 Lux) and one hour of dim red light placebo (Results The protocol was completed by 33 subjects who were 59 to 80 years old. Mood improved on average 23 % for all subjects, but there were no significant statistical differences between treatment and placebo groups. There were negligible adverse reactions to the bright <b>green</b> <b>light,</b> which was well tolerated. Conclusion Bright <b>green</b> <b>light</b> was not shown to have an antidepressant effect in the age group of this study, but a larger trial with brighter <b>green</b> <b>light</b> might be of value. </p...|$|R

In contrast, if the electrical vector of the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> is parallel to the cell axis, no chloroplast reorientation is induced, even with a fluence rate as high as 3 watts per square meter. Furthermore, unpolarized far-red light (727 nanometers, 2 watts per square meter) given alone has no effect on chloroplast reorientation. Simultaneous and continuous irradiation with polarized <b>green</b> <b>light,</b> regardless of its plane of polarization, together with unpolarized far-red light, however, does lead to chloroplast reorientation.

Certain wavelengths in the visible and near-visible spectrum {{are known to have}} discrete effects on plant growth and development, and the effects of red, far-red, blue, and ultraviolet light have been well described. In this report, an effect of <b>green</b> <b>light</b> on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) rosette architecture is demonstrated using a narrow-bandwidth light-emitting diode-based <b>lighting</b> system. When <b>green</b> <b>light</b> was added to a background of constant red and blue light, plants exhibited elongation of petioles and upward leaf reorientation, symptoms consistent with those observed in a shaded light environment. The same green light-induced phenotypes were also observed in phytochrome (phy) and cryptochrome (cry) mutant backgrounds. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the green light-induced response, the accumulation of shade-induced transcripts was measured in response to enriched <b>green</b> <b>light</b> environments. Transcripts that have been demonstrated to increase in abundance under far-red-induced shade avoidance conditions either decrease or exhibit no change when <b>green</b> <b>light</b> is added. However, normal far-red light-associated transcript accumulation patterns are observed in cryptochrome mutants grown with supplemental <b>green</b> <b>light,</b> indicating that the green-absorbing form of cryptochrome is the photoreceptor active in limiting the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> induction of shade-associated transcripts. These results indicate that shade symptoms can be induced by the addition of <b>green</b> <b>light</b> and that cryptochrome receptors and an unknown light sensor participate in acclimation to the enriched green environment...|$|R
