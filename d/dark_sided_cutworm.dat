40|$|A {{large number}} of {{empirical}} studies have illustrated the benefits of adopting and implementing a relational or relationship marketing strategy. However, there is an emergent stream of literature that suggests that despite the recognized benefits associated with this strategy {{there may also be}} a <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> that manifests itself between firms as a result of adopting a relationship marketing strategy. However, though this stream of literature recognizes the presence of the <b>dark</b> <b>side,</b> causal antecedents mediating the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> constructs, or consequences of the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> have yet to be theoretically derived, explained or empirically tested. This dissertation constructs theoretical relationships between common relational constructs, such as trust and commitment and <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> symptoms such as relational myopia, complacency, vulnerability and suspicion. This dissertation also examines how these <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> symptoms, upon their onset, can yield negative consequences for the firms that have adopted the relationship marketing strategy. Data from a diverse set of business to business (B 2 B) relationships (N= 305) was gathered to test the structural model implicit in the theoretical propositions presented in this dissertation. The results support the hypothesized notion of a <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> to B 2 B relationships as the relational constructs of shared values, commitment, trust, and satisfaction were all found to have a positive, significant relationship with elements of the <b>dark</b> <b>side.</b> These results are discussed in detail within the chapters of this dissertation...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper offers}} an {{introduction}} to research that concerns itself with the ‘dark side’ of organization and attempts to bring theoretical resources {{from a range of}} disciplines to bear upon the problem. This stream of research has emerged most visibly since the 1990 s, although its concerns can be found in much earlier research. Frustrations with the tendencies of mainstream work to overlook, ignore or suppress difficult ethical, political and ideological issues, which may well mean life or death to some people, has in recent years led to a research that self-identifies its concerns as being with the <b>dark</b> <b>side.</b> We structure our review around key contributions on the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> of organizational behaviour, mainly in psychology but also including the concept of organizational misbehaviour; the sociology of the <b>dark</b> <b>side,</b> with particular reference to mistakes, misconduct and disaster; and a wider range of critical approaches to the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> including Marxist, post-Marxist and postcolonial perspectives. We also undertake a review of methodologies for investigating <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> phenomena, and finally introduce the five papers that comprise this special issue...|$|R
