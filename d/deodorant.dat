5|$|During the {{dictatorship}} of Ferdinand Marcos, {{in accordance with}} Presidential Decree no. 645, the old Manila Hotel Company was liquidated and the government took over its ownership. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) was given the mandate {{to form a new}} subsidiary corporation that would restore, renovate, and expand the Manila Hotel. In the following two decades, Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda, could frequently be seen at the hotel restaurants.

50|$|<b>Deodorants</b> are {{classified}} and regulated as cosmetics by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and {{are designed to}} eliminate odor. <b>Deodorants</b> are often alcohol-based. Alcohol initially stimulates sweating, but may also temporarily kill bacteria. Other active ingredients in <b>deodorants</b> include sodium stearate, sodium chloride and stearyl alcohol. <b>Deodorants</b> can be formulated with other, more persistent antimicrobials such as triclosan that slow bacterial growth or with metal chelant compounds such as EDTA. <b>Deodorants</b> may contain perfume fragrances or natural essential oils intended to mask the odor of perspiration. In the past, <b>deodorants</b> included chemicals such as zinc oxide, acids, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and formaldehyde, but some of these ingredients were messy, irritating to the skin or even carcinogenic.|$|R
40|$|Body odour {{caused by}} {{bacterial}} growth {{is of great}} concern to those affected. To ameliorate this, <b>deodorants,</b> which are substances applied to avert body odour, are designed and used. These <b>deodorants</b> are claimed to have antibacterial activities. This work was therefore, carried out to determine the antibacterial activities of the <b>deodorants</b> marketed in Owerri municipality. Owerri is the capital of Imo State of Nigeria. To determine this, twenty (20) <b>deodorants</b> from ten (10) different manufacturers made up of fourteen (14) roll-on and six (6) sprays were assessed using punch-hole plate diffusion technique on nutrient agar plates. The <b>deodorants</b> were purchased from Ekeonunwa market, New market, Relief market, and some supper markets, all in Owerri Municipality. These <b>deodorants</b> were tested against Laboratory isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis obtained from Federal Medical Centre (FMC) and Modesty Medical Laboratory Owerri and reconfirmed using morphological and biochemical tests. Out of the twenty (20) <b>deodorants</b> tested, 18 (90 %) were active against the organisms, 17 (85 %) were active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, 15 (75 %) against P. mirabilis, 11 (55 %) against E. coli and 10 (50 %) against P. aeruginosa. It was also observed that <b>deodorants</b> “roll- on ” were more active 14 (100 %) than the <b>deodorants</b> “sprays ” 4 (66. 6 %). From this study, {{it was observed that}} the <b>deodorants</b> tested had antibacterial activities...|$|R
50|$|Between 1942 and 1957 {{the market}} for <b>deodorants</b> {{increased}} 600 times to become a $70 million market. <b>Deodorants</b> were originally marketed primarily to women, but by 1957 the market had expanded to male users, and estimates were that 50% of men were using <b>deodorants</b> by that date. The Ban Roll-On product led the market in sales.|$|R

40|$|Axillary {{dermatitis}} {{is common}} and overrepresented {{in people with}} contact allergy to fragrances. Many people suspect their <b>deodorants</b> to be the incriminating products. In order to investigate the significance of isoeugenol in <b>deodorants</b> {{for the development of}} axillary dermatitis when used by people with and without contact allergy to isoeugenol, patch tests with <b>deodorants</b> and ethanol solutions with isoeugenol, as well as repeated open application tests (ROAT) with roll-on <b>deodorants</b> with and without isoeugenol at various concentrations, were performed in 35 dermatitis patients, 10 without and 25 with contact allergy to isoeugenol. A positive ROAT was observed only in patients hypersensitive to isoeugenol (P< 0. 001) and only in the axilla to which the <b>deodorants</b> containing isoeugenol had been applied (P< 0. 001). <b>Deodorants</b> containing isoeugenol in the concentration range of 0. 0063 - 0. 2 % used 2 times daily on healthy skin can thus elicit axillary dermatitis within a few weeks in people with contact allergy to isoeugenol. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|In 1995, Claus Wedekind {{found that}} {{in a group of}} female college {{students}} who smelled T-shirts worn by male students for two nights (without <b>deodorant,</b> cologne, or scented soaps), by far most women chose shirts worn by men of dissimilar MHCs, a preference reversed if the women were on oral contraceptives. Results of a 2002 experiment likewise suggest HLA-associated odors influence odor preference and may mediate social cues. In 2005 in a group of 58 subjects, women were more indecisive when presented with MHCs like their own, although with oral contraceptives, the women showed no particular preference. No studies show the extent to which odor preference determines mate selection (or vice versa).|$|E

25|$|Retired from Test cricket, Simpson toured England in 1968 as {{a member}} of the press gallery and later worked in public relations. He looked after {{promotion}} and marketing earnings for cricketers in an era where they struggled to survive financially. During the 1975–76 season, he had organised for both Australian and West Indian players to market shampoo and <b>deodorant,</b> and he helped to find sponsors for the Australian team. He also called for the revival of the Cavaliers XI concept to boost the popularity of cricket. He wrote a book titled Captain's Story, in which he expressed his anger against bowlers that he believed to have bowled with an illegal action. His former teammate Meckiff took issue with the contents and sued for libel. After five years of litigation, Simpson settled out of court and apologised to Meckiff.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} four episodes, the show gained its initial sponsor when Dr. Jules Montenier paid to have his product, Stopette spray <b>deodorant,</b> {{featured}} in advertising on the program. This involved featuring the product in the show's opening, {{on the front of}} the panel's desk, above the sign-in board, and on Daly's scorecards. In his last years, Cerf explained to interviewer Robbin Hawkins that Dr. Montenier was ultimately ruined by his refusal to abandon or share sponsorship as the show entered new markets and became too expensive. After Dr. Montenier sold Stopette to Helene Curtis, the series was sponsored by a variety of companies which were either regular or rotating. Sponsors were accorded the same exposure on the set as Stopette. One of the first rotating sponsors, which actually came before Montenier's sale of Stopette to Helene Curtis (who continued to sponsor the program after the purchase and still promoted Stopette in their advertising), was the Remington Rand Corporation, who used their time to promote their line of electric shavers and business machines such as the UNIVAC.|$|E
