5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> mix is pretty close.|$|E
25|$|Atwater: As to {{the whole}} Southern {{strategy}} that Harry S. Dent, Sr. and others put together in 1968, opposition to the Voting Rights Act {{would have been a}} central part of keeping the South. Now you don't have to do that. All that you need to do to keep the South is for Reagan to run in place on the issues that he's campaigned on since 1964, and that's fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cut taxes, you <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> cluster.|$|E
25|$|In {{his early}} years he {{acquired}} a love of national customs and traditions which his humanist education never obliterated. In addition, he learnt to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> range of popular literature (litteratura de cordel) songs, comedies, knightly stories and fairy tales, which were then printed in loose sheets (folhas volantes) and sold by the blind {{in the streets of}} the capital. These circumstances explain the richness of his vocabulary, and joined to an ardent patriotism they fitted him to become the herald of the literary revival known as Romanticism, which was inaugurated by his distinguished follower Almeida Garrett.|$|E

500|$|On August 30, 2013, Kanye West {{unveiled}} the simplistic standard and deluxe edition album covers via his Twitter account. On September 21, 2013, Pusha T released snippets {{for the standard}} edition tracks. On September 27, 2013, Pusha T released the music video for the intro track [...] "King Push". On October 2, 2013, {{after a few days}} of being credited as a co-producer of [...] "King Push", Joaquin Phoenix denied having assist in producing the song. He said, [...] "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye's camp." [...] On October 3, 2013, during an interview with Rap-Up, Pusha T revealed that it was actually the son of Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich who produced the song, saying [...] "Joaquin Phoenix gave the beat to 'Ye, so when I got the beat from 'Ye, it was, Yo, Joaquin gave me this beat. So me, I'm just like, OK, I know Joaquin's into music and you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing, so I'm like, Oh, damn. I believe it is the son of Lars Ulrich from Metallica. I hope I'm not wrong this time. It was mistaken because it came from Joaquin." [...] On October 1, 2013, the album was released for free streaming via MySpace.|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E

2500|$|As the band's career progressed, Hüsker Dü {{emphasized}} melody in its songs. Unlike other hardcore bands, Hüsker Dü did not disavow classic rock. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{deal with}} tearing down the old {{to make room}} for the new?" [...] Hart posited. [...] "Well, music isn't city planning." [...] The band covered 1960s hits like Donovan's [...] "Sunshine Superman" [...] and The Byrds' [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] early in its career. As the band members progressed as musicians, they discovered they were able to play at slower tempos while still maintaining the rhythm, allowing for extended melodies.|$|E
2500|$|Steven worries when Jane asks {{to look at}} the restaurant's {{accounts}} as he {{has stolen}} money. He makes excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop and tells Lauren he will fake some invoices. Steven is overjoyed when Louie says his first word, [...] "mama", and gets him to say [...] "dada", filming it to show Lauren. However, she sends the video to Peter, upsetting Steven as he tells Lauren that he sees himself as Louie's father but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. Steven also worries that Lauren never says she loves him when he says it to her. When Jane looks at the restaurant's accounts and realizes payments are being made to a fake company, she knows it can only be Ian or Steven but worries about confronting the wrong person. She soon discovers that Steven set up the fake company and confronts him; he explains he borrowed the money to help Peter, who was drinking heavily and getting into fights and Lauren does not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> truth, so Jane tells him to be honest with her. She is angry that Steven was not honest and considers visiting Peter; Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake.|$|E
