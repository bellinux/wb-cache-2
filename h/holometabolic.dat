40|$|The nuclear receptors (NRs), an {{important}} protein superfamily of transcription factors {{found in all}} animals, regulate the expression of genes in a large array of biological processes. Their involvement in moulting and metamorphosis, embryonic development, cell differentiation and reproduction of arthropods is well documented. Especially the two NRs that form the functional ecdysteroid receptor and which are {{at the base of}} the ecdysteroid signalling cascade regulating moulting and metamorphosis, EcR and USP, have been researched intensively. During evolution, gene duplication and gene loss events have created a broad diversity of these NRs between different groups in the animal kingdom. However, in 2008, at the time this PhD research started, the information that was available on arthropod NRs was mainly restricted to <b>holometabolic</b> insects. Complete sets of NRs for other groups, including Crustacea, Chelicerata or more basal insects were unavailable. Over the last few years, the number of genome sequencing projects that are carried out for Arthropoda is rapidly increasing. This gave us the opportunity to investigate the NRs in a number of other arthropods and compare the sets of NRs between some of these groups. We chose three species, the hemimetabolic pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, the <b>holometabolic</b> buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris and the chelicerate two-spotted spidermite Tetranychus urticae as representatives of their respective clades. The main research questions that were addressed in the PhD thesis were: (1) Do <b>holometabolic,</b> hemimetabolic and non-insect arthropods exhibit important differences in their sets of nuclear receptors?, (2) What are the consequences towards the ecdysteroid signalling cascade and can any differences be found there?, and (3) Can RNAi be used to add functional information to the fundamental data that these genome annotation analyses have delivered...|$|E

A similar dicistronic Su(var) 3 - 9 /eIF- 2 gamma transcription unit was found in Clytus arietis, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and Scoliopterix libatrix, representing two different orders of <b>holometabolic</b> insects (Coleoptera and Lepidoptera). In all these species the N terminus of the eIF- 2 gamma, which is encoded by the first two exons, is fused to SU(VAR) 3 - 9. In contrast to Drosophila melanogaster, RT-PCR analysis in the two coleopteran and the lepidopteran species demonstrated the usage of a nonconserved splice donor site located within the 3 ' end of the SU(VAR) 3 - 9 ORF, resulting in removal of the Su(var) 3 - 9 -specific stop codon from the mRNA and complete in-frame fusion of the SU(VAR) 3 - 9 and eIF- 2 gamma ORFs.

40|$|The {{relatively}} rare changes of spliceosomal intron positions {{have been used}} both for the estimation of intron evolution and phylogenetic relationships, however with variable success. A specific subset of changes at intron positions is here introduced as a novel phylogenetic marker, termed near intron pair (NIP). It is defined here {{as a pair of}} mutually-exclusive intron presences at two (different) orthologous sequence positions in close proximity. The idea that NIPs are powerful characters {{is based on the assumption}} that both very small exons and multiple gains at the same position are rare. The results of several studies briefly summarized in this chapter demonstrate the successful usage of the NIP character to reconstruct the tree of life and to deliver new insights into mechanisms of intron gain. In a first NIP-based application the phylogenetic position of major orders of <b>holometabolic</b> insects was evaluated supporting Hymenoptera as resulting from their basal split, in agreement with other studies, but contradicting the previously established view. As part of the genome paper describing a new species of twisted-wing parasites (Strepsiptera), the NIP method was applied to help to resolve the phylogenetic position of them within <b>holometabolic</b> insects. However, a NIP-based reconstruction of the metazoan tree covering a broad selection of representative species also identified some weaknesses of the NIP approach that may suffer e. g. from alignment/ortholog prediction artifacts (also depending on the depth of range of taxa) and long-branch attraction (unequal evolutionary rates of intron gain/loss; maximum parsimony based analysis). In a further study, the identification of NIPs within the genus Drosophila could be used to characterize recent intron gain events that apparently involved several cases of intron sliding and tandem exon duplication. Summarizing, the NIP marker could be established as a novel phylogenetic character, in particular dedicated to complementarily explore the wealth of genome data for phylogenetic purposes and to help to resolve open questions of intron evolution...|$|E
40|$|Kynurenines are {{endogenous}} metabolites of tryptophan, {{which are}} studied extensively in vertebrates {{with respect to}} their etiological role in the pathology of various neurodegenerative disorders. In insects, metabolites of the kynurenic pathway are present in peak concentrations in the hemolymph of <b>holometabolic</b> species during pupation and just before eclosion. Unlike in larvae, these compounds cause severe motor dysfunction in adult species. Adult flesh flies were injected with various concentrations of these endogenous toxins and the effects on motor function were assessed. For tryptophan, L-kynurenine, 3 -hydroxy-kynurenine, and anthranilic acid, the effects ranged from reversible to irreversible motor dysfunction, to instant paralysis and death. 3 -Hydroxy-anthranilic acid could induce a tetanus like spasm of the wings. Tryptophan, 3 -hydroxykynurenine, and 3 -hydroxy-anthranilic acid were toxic to primary cultures of insect neurons.

40|$|Numerous {{analyses}} on {{the chemical}} composition of various insects have shown that, as in mammals, fat and glycogen constitute the principal food reserves. Among <b>holometabolic</b> insects {{the accumulation of}} these two substances during the larval instars is, to a varying extent, utilized {{during the process of}} pupation. Most of the data on the chemical changes during metamorphosis are summarized by Needham (1942). However, as pointed out by Wigglesworth (1939), analyses of the body as a whole show only the gross alterations, and almost nothing is known concerning the composition of the separate organs. The only information available concerns the glycogen content of the isolated insect fat body; thus, Babers (1941) found that in the mature larva of Prodenia eridania (Lep.) the glycogen formed 23 - 3 % of the fat body dry weight, while Yokoyama (1934) estimated the glycogen content of the silkworm fat body to vary from 2 to 17 % of the dry weight according to age.

40|$|Abstract Growing animals must {{alter their}} energy {{budget in the}} face of {{environmental}} changes and prioritize the energy allocation to metabolism for life-sustaining requirements and energy deposition in new biomass growth. We hypothesize that when food availability is low, larvae of <b>holometabolic</b> insects with a short development stage (relative to the low food availability period) prioritize biomass growth at the ex-pense of metabolism. Driven by this hypothesis, we develop a simple theoretical model, based on conservation of energy and allometric scaling laws, for understanding the dynamic energy budget of growing larvae under food restriction. We test the hypothesis by manipulative experiments on fifth instar horn-worms at three temperatures. At each temperature, food re-striction increases the scaling power of growth rate but de-creases that of metabolic rate, as predicted by the hypothesis. During the fifth instar, the energy budgets of larvae change dynamically. The free-feeding larvae slightly decrease the en-ergy allocated to growth as body mass increases and increase the energy allocated to life sustaining. The opposite trends were observed in food restricted larvae, indicating the predict-ed prioritization in the energy budget under food restriction. We compare the energy budgets of a few endothermic and ectothermic species and discuss how different life histories lead to the differences in the energy budgets under food restriction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{silkworm}} Bombyx mori {{possesses a}} 30 K protein family of 3 × 104 Da, the biological functions {{of which have}} not been fully identified. The relationship between the 30 K protein family and the embryonic development of temperature sensitive sex-linked mutant strain of silkworm was investigated by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) and Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The results show that protein spots 1 – 5 of the 30 K protein family, mainly existing in normal strain, are possibly related to embryonic development. The early consumption of a 30 K protein named 6 G 1 - 30 K- 1 and the accumulation of 30 K proteins named 6 G 1 - 30 K- 3 and 6 G 1 - 30 K- 4 are likely caused by the destruction of physiological balance in normal embryonic development, which may lead to lower hatchability of the temperature sensitive strain. The results suggest that reasonable metabolism of 30 K proteins {{is a prerequisite for}} the embryo’s normal development.

40|$|The {{deposited}} {{article is}} a post-print version and has peer review. This publication hasn't any creative commons license associated. There is no public supplementary material available for this publication. Germband size in insects has {{played a central role}} in our understanding of insect patterning mechanisms and their evolution. The polarity of evolutionary change in insect patterning has been viewed so far as the unidirectional shift from the ancestral short germband patterning of basal hemimetabolous insects to the long germband patterning observed in most modern Holometabola. However, some orders of <b>holometabolic</b> insects display both short and long germband development, though the absence of a clear phylogenetic context does not permit definite conclusions on the polarity of change. Derived hymenoptera, that is, bees and wasps, represent a classical textbook example of long germband development. Yet, in some wasps putative short germband development has been described correlating with lifestyle changes, namely with evolution of endoparasitism and polyembryony. To address the potential reversion from long to short germband, we focused on the family Braconidae, which displays ancestral long germband development, and examined the derived polyembryonic braconid Macrocentrus cingulum. Using SEM analysis of M. cingulum embryogenesis coupled with analyses of embryonic patterning markers, we show that this wasp evolved short germband embryogenesis secondarily, in a way that is reminiscent of embryogenesis in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. This work shows that the evolution of germband size in insects is a reversible process that may correlate with other life-history traits and suggests broader implications on the mechanisms and evolvability of insect development.

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} effort by {{molecular}} systematists, the trees {{of life of}} eukaryotic organisms still remain partly unresolved or in conflict with each other. An ever increasing number of fully-sequenced genomes of various eukaryotes allows to consider gene and species phylogenies at genome-scale. However, such phylogenomics-based approaches also revealed that more taxa {{and more and more}} gene sequences are not the ultimate solution to fully resolve these conflicts, {{and that there is a}} need for sequence-independent phylogenetic meta-characters that are derived from genome sequences. Spliceosomal introns are characteristic features of eukaryotic nuclear genomes. The relatively rare changes of spliceosomal intron positions have already been used as genome-level markers, both for the estimation of intron evolution and phylogenies, however with variable success. In this thesis, a specific subset of these changes is introduced and established as a novel phylogenetic marker, termed near intron pair (NIP). These characters are inferred from homologous genes that contain mutually-exclusive intron presences at pairs of coding sequence (CDS) positions in close proximity. The idea that NIPs are powerful characters is based on the assumption that both very small exons and multiple intron gains at the same position are rare. To obtain sufficient numbers of NIP character data from genomic and alignment data sets in a consistent and flexible way, the implementation of a computational pipeline was a main goal of this work. Starting from orthologous (or more general: homologous) gene datasets comprising genomic sequences and corresponding CDS transcript annotations, the multiple alignment generation is an integral part of this pipeline. The alignment can be calculated at the amino acid level utilizing external tools (e. g. transAlign) and results in a codon alignment via back-translation. Guided by the multiple alignment, the positionally homologous intron positions should become apparent when mapped individually for each transcript. The pipeline proceeds at this stage to output portions of the intron-annotated alignment that contain at least one candidate of a NIP character. In a subsequent pipeline script, these collected so-called NIP region files are finally converted to binary state characters representing valid NIPs in dependence of quality filter constraints concerning, e. g., the amino acid alignment conservation around intron loci and splice sites, to name a few. The computational pipeline tools provide the researcher to elaborate on NIP character matrices that can be used for tree inference, e. g., using the maximum parsimony approach. In a first NIP-based application, the phylogenetic position of major orders of <b>holometabolic</b> insects (more specifically: the Coleoptera-Hymenoptera-Mecopterida trifurcation) was evaluated in a cladistic sense. As already suggested during a study on the eIF 2 gamma gene based on two NIP cases (Krauss et al. 2005), the genome-scale evaluation supported Hymenoptera as sister group to an assemblage of Coleoptera and Mecopterida, in agreement with other studies, but contradicting the previously established view. As part of the genome paper describing a new species of twisted-wing parasites (Strepsiptera), the NIP method was employed to help to resolve the phylogenetic position of them within (<b>holometabolic)</b> insects. Together with analyses of sequence patterns and a further meta-character, it revealed twisted-wing parasites as being the closest relatives of the mega-diverse beetles. NIP-based reconstructions of the metazoan tree covering a broad selection of representative animal species also identified some weaknesses of the NIP approach that may suffer e. g. from alignment/ortholog prediction artifacts (depending on the depth of range of taxa) and systematic biases (long branch attraction artifacts, due to unequal evolutionary rates of intron gain/loss and the use of the maximum parsimony method). In a further study, the identification of NIPs within the recently diverged genus Drosophila could be utilized to characterize recent intron gain events that apparently involved several cases of intron sliding and tandem exon duplication, albeit the mechanisms of gain for the majority of cases could not be elucidated. Finally, the NIP marker could be established as a novel phylogenetic marker, in particular dedicated to complementarily explore the wealth of genome data for phylogenetic purposes and to address open questions of intron evolution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlterations of {{the amount}} and quality of food {{consumed}} during ontogeny can affect different life-history traits, such as growth rate, developmental time, survival, adult size, and fitness. Understanding the dynamics of such metabolic and energetic pathways and investments is particularly challenging {{in the case of}} holometabolous insects due to their strikingly different life stages. We show how whole life-cycle energy and mass budgets can be achieved for <b>holometabolic</b> insects through dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory, permitting the fate of acquired and stored nutrients to be followed over a complete life-cycle. We applied the DEB theory to model the whole life-cycle energetics of an endoparasitic wasp, Venturia canescens (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). Data on embryo, larval, and pupal dry mass, imago longevity, and fecundity were used for assessing the goodness of fit of the model. Our model predicted the growth curves of the larval and pupal stages, the number of eggs laid by the imago through time, and lifespan events, such as the different developmental times of the parasitoid. The model enabled us to distinguish and follow the energy invested in eggs through income and capital reserves. The mechanisms leading to the double costs of being small (a shorter life under starving conditions and fewer eggs) were identified by running the model for varying amounts of food eaten early in life, according to host sizes. The final larval instar harvests around 60 times the energy of a recently hatched larva. Around 90 % of this energy is then used during pupation to build the structure of the imago and to pay maintenance. Imagoes, therefore, emerge with {{only a small percentage of}} the energy stored by the last instar larvae. Our study shows that, despite being small, this percentage of energy stored during the parasitoid development has a great impact on adult fitness, the loss of which cannot be compensated for by a rich adult environment. Our model is generic and has applications for a wide range of applied and theoretical questions about insect energetics, from population dynamics in multitrophic systems to responses to climate change and life-history strategies...|$|E
40|$|During {{ontogenesis}} of <b>holometabolic</b> insects like butterflies (Lepidoptera) life circumstances change radically. While larval life {{is dominated}} by eating and growing, adult animals need to cope with quite different properties of sensory stimuli, especially during flight. This asks for a complete rebuilding of the brain during metamorphosis to fulfill adult-specific requirements. One well-established model system to examine these develomental processes is the brain of the sphinx moth Manduca sexta. Within about three weeks of pupal development the whole brain increases about ten times in size, several larval cells die, other adult-specific neuroblasts start to proliferate while other neuronal cells are restructured to deal with adult-specific tasks. Many of the underlying ontogenetic processes of outgrowing and differentiation of neural cells seem to be conserved between insects and vertebrates. On the molecular level {{as well as on}} the level of neuropilar organization exist parallels between both, which usually are more accessible in the insect model. One example would be target selection of sensory receptor neurons, which is steered by similar contact receptors. Another example is the analogous organization of olfactory neuropils into spherical glomeruli which exhibit odor-dependent activation. The gaseous signal molecule nitric oxide (NO) and its influence on neurogenesis represents another example of a conserved concept during individual development of various systems, including antennal lobe development in Manduca. The modes of action of NO are manyfold: it may influence proteins by ADP-ribosylation or S-nitrosylation, or may stimulate further intracellular signalling cascades. Most prominent example in Manduca would be the transient cGMP synthesis by NO-dependent soluble guanylyl cyclase. This cGMP in turn exhibits its own broad spectrum of downstream activation, reaching from directly dependent ion channels (cyclic nucleotide gated channels, CNGs) to protein kinases and phosphodiesterases. Within the framework of our working hypothesis the release of neuropeptides in developing local interneurons is mediated by selective cGMP production during a defined time window. This allows for specific refinement of synaptic contacts coming from a previous unspecific developmental signal. Our existing neuropeptide data was extended by anatomical and pharmacological examinations regarding allatotropin and further characterization of the lateral cell group by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The emphasis of this dissertation however was laid on further characterization of the NO/cGMP signalling pathway during antennal lobe develoment of Manduca sexta. First, the cell group in question was examined towards its ability to extend the NO signal by Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase expression, followed by a test for cell death during antennal lobe development. Since no dying cells were found throughout antennal lobe development, a stable cell population could be assumed. Now, the NO/cGMP signalling pathway was further examined with respect to temporal occurrence, specificity, and number of cells involved; additionally, its possible mode of action on neuronal development was pointed out by integrating previous work. Within this framework, 3 D-reconstruction based volumetry was used, which proved to be a powerful tool to answer other questions during antennal lobe development as well. Prerequisite herefore was, however, the establishment of a suitable protocol, together with the definition of easily and reproducably identifyable neuropilar regions in the antennal lobe during development. After introduction of this protocol, an extention onto whole brain neuropils was obvious, which was done in a supervised diploma work. In this context, a Manduca standard brain was created and used to volumetrically examine brain sex dimorphism. In a cooperation project, anatomical expertise on the antennal lobe system was applied by identification and classification of intracellulary recorded projection neurons, combined wtih a 4 D representation of the data obtained...|$|E
