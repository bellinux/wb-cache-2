5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The <b>irreversibility</b> of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E

Magnitude {{and location of}} <b>irreversibilities</b> for the main equipment of the process have been quantified. Gross <b>irreversibilities</b> represent 78. 4 % and exergy gains represent 11. 4 %; i. e., net <b>irreversibilities</b> of the plant are 67. 1 %. <b>Irreversibilities</b> due to chemical reactions and heat transfer are 26. 4 % and 52. 1 %, respectively. For chemical reactions the greatest <b>irreversibilities</b> are located at the furnace, while for heat transfer the greatest <b>irreversibilities</b> {{are located in the}} waste heat boiler and the heat exchanging network of the catalytic converter. The obtained exergy efficiencies are consistent with those reported in the literature for sulphuric acid production plants. Further improvements in exergy efficiencies could be reached by resetting operating conditions and by reconfiguring the heat exchanging network of the catalytic converter...|$|R

This article focuses on the frictional portion of entropy production, which leads to irreversible dissipation of mechanical energy to internal energy through friction.

40|$|Abstract Nanosensor {{technologies}} {{constitute a}} new emerging {{field of science}} and technology with tremendous innovation potential. However, as the technology {{is still in its infancy}} many uncertainties and unknowns exist. Nonetheless, due to high expectations and promises, the technology gained a lot of attention from governments, companies and universities as they see potential to benefit from the development and commercialization of such technologies. With their ongoing activities and interaction those actors shape the dynamics and characteristics of the field. Understanding these dynamics is important for actors attempting to benefit from the development. A key concept in this study - which contribute to the understanding of emerging technology dynamics - are emerging <b>irreversibilities.</b> Emerging <b>irreversibilities</b> are “patterns that enable certain actions and interactions (make it easier) and constrain others (make it more difficult to do something else) ” (Van Merkerk & Robinson, 2006) and thus influence the development paths a technology follows. The aim of this thesis is to study and analyze the processes and mechanisms that influence the development of emerging technologies and explore how <b>irreversibilities</b> shape the development of nanosensor technologies. This research effort presents a new methodology to map the development of new emerging fields and <b>irreversibilities.</b> For the three communities (science, industry and government), a database of papers, patents and projects was constructed. Within this database statements were selected pertaining to nanosensor development. We focused on general nanosensor development, as well as on developments in relation to the application areas food, environmental analysis and medicine. Based on these statements a reconstruction of the developments in the field was made. Two dominant development paths were identified: path A related to electrochemical sensors and path B related to optical nanosensors. Furthermore, the developments in relation to the application areas are described. Based on these narratives the emerging <b>irreversibilities</b> were derived and analyzed. Our findings from this study can contribute to the development of nanosensor technologies as those wishing to coordinate the development can now look to the future in a more informed way. Importantly, we have developed new methods for tracing emerging <b>irreversibilities,</b> which can be seen as an addition to existing mapping tools of emerging technologies...|$|R
