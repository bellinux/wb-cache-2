Neither team managed to score, and only twice did either team manage to penetrate into the opponent's territory. At halftime, the score remained tied, 33.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, battle {{was not necessary}} for either side; the main strategic theatre was mainland Greece itself. Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in a}} clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any strategic considerations. The Persians, seeing little to <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians, sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E

40|$|Secular <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> IQ {{test scores}} have been {{reported}} for many Western countries. This is the first study of secular IQ <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> South Korea, using various datasets. The first question is what {{the size of the}} Flynn effect in South Korea is. The gains per decade are 7. 7 points for persons born between 1970 and 1990. These gains on broad intelligence batteries are much larger than the <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> Western countries of about 3 IQ points per decade. The second question is whether the Korean IQ gains are comparable to the Japanese IQ gains with a lag of a few decades. The <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> Japan of 7. 7 IQ points per decade for those born approximately 1940 - 1965 are identical to the gains per decade for Koreans born 1970 - 1990. The third question is whether the Korean <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> height and education lag a few decades behind the Japanese gains. The Koreans reach the educational levels the Japanese reached 25 - 30 years before, and the <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> height for Koreans born 1970 - 1990 are very similar to <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> height for Japanese born 1940 - 1960, so three decades earlier.

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E

Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists.
