50|$|Burscough Bridge was {{the home}} of Victor Electrics, a {{manufacturer}} of battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicle,</b> including bread vans and milk floats. The company was formed by Outram's bakery of Southport, who could not find electric vehicles at a price {{they were prepared to}} pay, and so decided to build their own. The first bread van was produced in 1923, and proved so successful that several more were built. By 1927, the company looked at the possibility of allowing another company, who were already involved in electric vehicle production, to take over the enterprise, but they decided to retain control of the facility. The company was based on Victoria Street, just {{to the north of the}} Leeds and Liverpool Canal, where there was a bakery shown on maps from 1928, and engineering works on the 1972 map.|$|E
50|$|SERVe (Solar <b>Electric</b> <b>Road</b> <b>Vehicle)</b> was {{designed}} in 2015, making it India's first passenger solar electric vehicle prototype.It is a two seat, four wheeler solar electric passenger car. The top {{is covered by}} a curved solar panel which powers the battery pack; which in turn runs the motor. The solar car is capable of {{a top speed of}} 65 km/h and has a range of about 250 km.The key features of the car is that SERVe is, like Freyr-1, it also uses clean and free fuel with zero emissions and zero noise pollution. It is built with AISI 4130 Chromoly steel chassis which gives it high strength to weight ratio and GFRP body making it lightweight. It has an aerodynamic and aesthetic design obtained from the cut section of a tear drop - the most aerodynamic shape. Curved solar panels are used with a 6m2 area for increased energy generation at 20% efficiency. Focus is laid on improved driver ergonomics. One of the most notable features about the car is that it is energy positive.With SERVe, SolarMobil entered and excelled in various competitions, most notably, being the winner of QuEST Global’s annual pan-India innovation contest - QuEST Ingenium 2015.Among the shortlisted 10 teams, SolarMobil from Manipal Institute of Technology was adjudged as the winning team. Besides an enticing cash prize, SolarMobil team members have been sponsored by Airbus to fly to Europe on a facility tour of its Stade & Bremen facility in Germany.SERVe also secured the 3rd Place Prize at CII India Innovation Challenge amongst 1500 entries in 2014.|$|E

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{process of}} a complex system, based on the calculation and optimization of the system parameters, is complicated in that some parameters can be expressed only as probability distributions. In the present paper, a Monte Carlo technique {{was used to determine}} the daily range requirements of an <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> in the United States from probability distributions of trip lengths, frequencies, and average annual mileage data. The analysis shows that a daily range of 82 miles meets to 95 % of the car-owner requirements at all times with the exception of long vacation trips. Further, it is shown that the requirement of a daily range of 82 miles can be met by a (intermediate-level) battery technology characterized by an energy density of 30 to 50 Watt-hours per pound. Candidate batteries in this class are nickel-zinc, nickel-iron, and iron-air. These results imply that long-term research goals for battery systems should be focused on lower cost and longer service life, rather than on higher energy densitie...|$|E

50|$|Brush {{had entered}} the market for battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> in 1945, having bought designs and {{manufacturing}} rights from Metropolitan Vickers. In 1950 they decided to stop producing 4-wheeled designs, just retaining their 3-wheeled Brush Pony model. They kept enough spare parts {{to enable them to}} service existing 4-wheeled models for another ten years, but sold the rest of their stock of parts to Hindle Smart.|$|R
50|$|By the 20th century, {{electric}} cars and rail transport were commonplace, with commercial electric automobiles having {{the majority of}} the market. Over time their general-purpose commercial use reduced to specialist roles, as platform trucks, forklift trucks, ambulances, tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles, such as the iconic British milk float; for most of the 20th century, the UK was the world's largest user of <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A common {{example of}} the battery {{electric}} trucks is the milk float. Since it makes many stops in delivering milk it is more practical to use an electric vehicle than a combustion truck, which would be idling much of the time; it also reduces noise in residential areas. For most of the 20th century, {{the majority of the}} world's battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> were British milk floats.|$|R
50|$|W&E {{supplied}} {{large numbers}} of floats to United Dairies, who had provided the original specification. They also supplied Express Dairies, who supplied milk over an area of some 1000 sq mi in the London area. In 1963 they had a total fleet of around 2,200 battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles,</b> of which 200 were Standard 3-wheelers, 190 were the 25-cwt Rangemaster model, and three were the Loadmaster articulated model.|$|R
50|$|Lewis Electruk was a British marque of milk floats, {{produced}} by T H Lewis Ltd, a company which had {{close ties with}} Express Dairies, the London-based retail milk company.

The manufacturing of battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> was then sold on to Morrison-Electricar who continued to build two Electruk models for the dairy industry. Major purchasers of their products included Express Dairies and the London Co-operative Society.|$|R
50|$|Tomlinson Electric Vehicles was a British {{manufacturer}} of milk floats and other battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which also supplied vehicles to the Benelux countries. The company {{was formed in}} the mid 1930s. In 1949 they were taken over by King's Motors of Oxford, but the Tomlinson name was retained. They made a battery-electric railway locomotive in 1958, and hoped to diversify into this market, but were {{the subject of a}} hostile takeover by an asset-stripping company in 1961, after which vehicle production ceased.|$|R
50|$|Harbilt Electrics Trucks was a British {{manufacturer}} of milk floats, other battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{and a variety}} of battery electric vehicles designed for industrial use rather than on the public roads. The company was formed in 1935, and diversified into electric vehicles {{after the end of the}} Second World War. They had a good record at exporting their products, with notable successes in Switzerland and California. There were several changes of ownership during the 1970s and 1980s, and the company ceased to exist in 1989.|$|R
50|$|Manulectrics was a British marque of milk floats {{and other}} battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>{{vehicles}}.</b> The vehicles {{were made by}} Sidney Holes Electric Vehicles, of Brighton, Sussex. They were designed out of Holes' experience of doorstep milk delivery, through Holes and Davigdor Dairies. Both pedestrian controlled vehicles (PCVs) and ride-on models were produced, and entered the market around 1947. The company was bought by Stanley Engineering in the 1960s, and sold to Crompton Electricars in 1972. Some Manulectric models were subsequently manufactured by Harbilt Electric Trucks.|$|R
50|$|Partridge Wilson Engineering was {{a company}} {{established}} in Leicester, England in 1926. They initially made radios, and then battery chargers. In 1934 {{they began to}} build battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles,</b> producing both cars and milk floats, which were marketed under the Wilson Electric marque. Vehicle production ceased in 1954, but they continued to make chargers and rectifiers. In 1974, they became part of Westinghouse Davenset Rectifiers Ltd, owned by Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd and in 1986 the Leicester site was closed, with manufacturing transferring to Chippenham. At {{least one of the}} commercial vehicles and three of the cars have been preserved.|$|R
50|$|Victor Electrics Ltd was a British {{manufacturer}} of milk floats and other battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The company {{was formed in}} 1923 by Outram's Bakery in Southport, Merseyside, to make bread vans for their own use, but they soon diversified into other markets, including the Dairy industry. Their first vehicles had bonnets, like conventional vans, which stored the batteries, but by 1935 all of their vehicles were forward control models, with the cab at the front. They were acquired by Brook Motors in 1967, and {{became part of the}} Hawker Siddeley group in 1970. They made a small number of railway locomotives during this latter period.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the goods volume to Zermatt is transported in standard containers, for which bogie and four wheel carrying wagons are available. Freight not transported in containers is loaded at Visp into sliding wall box cars, and later delivered to recipients in Zermatt by <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b> For non moisture sensitive goods, many open wagons of various types can be used. Oil transport is undertaken in tank cars with either four wheels or bogies. Classic covered wagons play no role in normal traffic any more. During the high season, up to three purely goods trains operate daily in each direction, and goods wagons are also attached to some passenger trains.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1948 and 1952, {{the company}} sold {{a large number}} of Graiseley PCVs to United Dairies. In 1953 they {{demonstrated}} a stillage truck at the Factory Equipment Exhibition in London. It had a [...] motor, and two speeds. The platform, which was 6 in above ground level, could be raised to 9 in. They also showed battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> at an exhibition organised by the South Eastern Electricity Board and the Electric Vehicle Association. In 1954 they added another stillage truck, the XL1, to their range, showcasing it at the Mechanical Handling Exhibition at Olympia. They showcased their GP20 pedestrial controlled pallet truck at the same exhibition two years later. Manufacture of the vehicles ceased at Wolverhampton around 1960, when Diamond Motors were liquidated.|$|R
5000|$|Tomlinson {{were listed}} by Commercial Motor {{as one of}} 17 {{companies}} making battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> in 1956 and one of 11 such companies in 1960. In 1958 they ventured into the locomotive market, supplying a diminutive [...] gauge machine to operate in a tunnel on Gibraltar. The vehicle, which was 5 ft long and 2 ft wide, could haul a load of about 2 long tons at speeds of up to 6 mph. It had a [...] motor, running on a 30 volt supply provided by 15 traction cells. It was designed for about 4 hours of use per day. The company announced {{at the time that}} they were thinking of marketting similar vehicles for use in mining, quarrying and general industry.|$|R
50|$|In 1936, {{the company}} built a {{prototype}} 3-wheeled articulated {{vehicle for the}} Midland Railway Company (MR), but no production vehicles were manufactured, as the MR felt it was not robust enough for their needs. The design was not wasted, however, as in 1940 Brush Electrical Engineering asked them to design a small battery tractor unit for use within their factory. The result was a scaled-down version of the Midland Railway vehicle, which Brush manufactured. Having built several for their own use, they then started selling them to other customers, and branched out into battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> in 1945, effectively becoming a competitor to Morrisons. Another development was a low-speed mobile platform which was used for transferring goods from railway trucks to <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The platforms were also fitted with buffers, {{so that they could}} be used to push railway wagons along their tracks.|$|R
25|$|Most {{electric}} car makers stopped production {{at some point}} in the 1910s. Electric vehicles became popular for certain applications where their limited range did not pose major problems. Forklift trucks were electrically powered when they were introduced by Yale in 1923. In Europe, especially the United Kingdom, milk floats were powered by electricity, and for most of the 20th century the majority of the world's battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> were British milk floats. Electric golf carts were produced by Lektro as early as 1954. By the 1920s, the early heyday of {{electric car}}s had passed, and a decade later, the electric automobile industry had effectively disappeared. Michael Brian examines the social and technological reasons for the failure of electric cars in his book Taking Charge: The Electric Automobile in America.|$|R
50|$|Besides dairy work, Midland {{vehicles}} {{were put to}} other tasks. In 1948, the Premier Ignition Company, based in Levenshulme, Manchester, {{claimed to be the}} first company to use battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> as hire cars. Acting as a distributor for Midland, they had previously sold a number of trucks to Lancashire Associated Collieries Ltd, for retail deliveries of coal. Subsequently, they had bought back two of the vehicles, had stripped them down and rebuilt them with 8-seater rear entrance shooting brake bodywork. They were then used to take teams or supporters to various sporting events, such as football, golf and snooker. With a range of about 40 mi, the first vehicle to be converted was a 20 cwt model, while the second was a larger B25 25 cwt model, which had been fitted with a radio for the entertainment of the passengers.|$|R
50|$|The {{company went}} {{through a series of}} amalgamations and takeovers between 1933 and its demise in 1983. On 11 January 1936, they became part of a newly created {{business}} group called Associated Electric Vehicle Manufacturers Limited (AEVM). Other members were Electricars, who had been making battery <b>electric</b> <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> since 1919, and were based in Birmingham; Young Accumulators, who made traction batteries, and were based at New Malden in south-west London; and Hants Electric Chassis, whose location is less certain, but was probably at Andover, Hampshire. Morrison and Electricars worked more closely with one another, and the two ranges of vehicles were rationalised. The battery manufacturer became Crompton Batteries Ltd., and in 1941, the electrical manufacturing company Crompton Parkinson took over AEVM. Following the takeover, Morrisons made vehicles up to 2 LT capacity, and Electricars made larger vehicles, but a year later, all vehicles were marketed as Morrison-Electricars.|$|R
