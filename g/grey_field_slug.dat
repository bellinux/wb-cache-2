50|$|During {{external}} sperm exchange, {{the penis}} of the donor slug is everted {{along with its}} ejaculate. The everted penis is several fold larger than its usual size, and appears as a bulbous, transparent structure. The ejaculate, an amorphous soft mass, is transferred {{onto the surface of}} the receiver slug’s everted penis. At least one species, the <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> (Deroceras reticulatum), shows a primitive degree of sperm packaging. The retraction of the receiver’s penis then takes the ejaculate with it. In most cases, both partners donate and receive simultaneously via intertwined penises; unilateral sperm transfer is only an occasional occurrence. Entwinement is allowed by the curvature present in slug penises; close entwinement aids successful sperm exchange, which occurs at the peak of penis eversion. When an individual of a species with external sperm transfer lacks a penis, it can still reproduce uniparenterally, such as by self-fertilisation, provided it possesses the other components of a normal reproductive system. Uniparental reproduction has been observed in the marsh slug (Deroceras laeve).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> Deroceras reticulatum {{has become}} a pest in no tillage {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) crops in the southeast of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are {{an important component of}} the arthropod community in agricultural systems and have the potential to reduce pest populations. We tested the predation capacity of the carabid beetle Scarites anthracinus on Deroceras reticulatum individuals of different body mass (10, 20 and 30 mg) and on their eggs, in a controlled laboratory no-choice assay. We also tested its preference for juvenile slugs and the similarly-sized pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare), under choice conditions. This beetle preyed upon both eggs and juvenile slugs, with the highest consumption rate on 20 mg body mass individuals. While preferring the pillbug during the first 24 h of the choice test, our results suggest that in field conditions, S. anthracinus might be a natural enemy of D. reticulatum, consuming slug eggs and juveniles of different body mass.

40|$|High-throughput {{sequencing}} {{was used}} to analyse cDNA generated from tissues of the <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum, a significant invertebrate pest of agricultural and horticultural crops. Almost no sequence data is available for this organism. In this project, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce sequence dataset for the Deroceras reticulatum. 	 A total of 132, 597 and 161, 419 sequencing reads between 50 - 600 bp from the digestive gland and neural tissue were obtained through Roche 454 pyrosequencing. These reads were assembled into contiguous sequences and annotated using sequence homology search tools. Multiple sequence assemblies and annotation data was amalgamated into a biological database using BioSQL. Analysis of the dataset with predictions of probable protein function were made based on annotation data. InterPro (IPR) terms generated with InterProScan software were mapped to read counts and used to identify more frequently sequenced gene families. 	Digestive hydrolases were major transcripts in the digestive gland, with cysteine proteinases and cellulases being the most abundant functional classes. A Cathepsin L homologue {{is likely to be}} responsible for the proteinase activity of the digestive gland which was previously detected by biochemical analysis. Cathepsin L and several other predicted proteins were used to design RNAi experiments to assess potential for crop pest defence strategy. Further work on protein expression of a native tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ligand homologue was also conducted as an exemplar study. ...|$|E
40|$|Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} agricultural crop susceptible to damage from invertebrate herbivores, such as caterpillars, aphids and slugs. Plants can detect {{the presence of}} invertebrates via physical contact, tissue consumption, and on recognition of compounds in saliva. Plant retaliation includes the production of proteinase inhibitors to impair gut function and the accumulation of phenylpropanoids and potentially toxic glucosinolates to decrease plant palatability. Previous work has shown that a component of sunlight, ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, can regulate defence related responses {{in a manner similar}} to that of pests and the plant wound-response hormone, Jasmonic acid (JA). The molecular basis behind UV-B- enhanced plant defence against invertebrates, however, remains elusive. This project aims to better understand invertebrate resistance in oilseed rape along with the genetic and metabolic basis of UV-B-enhanced defence against two agricultural pests, the <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> and caterpillars of the Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). UV-B treatment of B. napus and Arabidopsis thaliana has been found to enhance their resistance to these pests, and gene expression analysis of B. napus identified several genes similarly regulated by UV-B radiation, JA application, and/or slug or Plutella grazing. It is thought that these genes are important in UV-B enhanced plant resistance. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines over-expressing three of these oilseed rape genes have been generated to evaluate their role in UV-B-mediated defence. If found to be more resistant to pests, these lines will serve as ‘proof of concept’ that manipulation of the UV-B response pathway in members of the Brassica family could be used to develop new invertebrate resistant varieties...|$|E

40|$|Green {{asparagus}} (Asparagus officinalis L.) {{crops are}} frequently {{damaged by the}} <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> (Deroceras reticulatum). Most damage occurs in the soil, although some asparagus spears are attacked above ground. In the Netherlands damage occurs especially during the first 5 weeks of harvesting, {{from the end of}} April until the end of May and results in loss of quality. Field experiments were carried out from 1998 until 2000 at Oudkarspel in the western region of The Netherlands with the objective of controlling slugs with the slug-parasitic nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) and common salt (sodium chloride (NaCl)). Nematodes and salt were applied as row applications in asparagus beds. Dosages of 10, 000 ¿ 600, 000 nematodes per m 2 were used. Salt was applied in doses of 500 ¿ 4000 kg NaCl per ha. Each of the treatments was applied from 1 to 4 times and was compared with conventional field application of metaldehyde pellets (0. 35 kg a. i. per ha) in an equal number of applications and with untreated plots. Significant protection of the crop was achieved with nematodes during the harvest period in 1999 and 2000, when nematodes were applied three times in the row at a dose of 50, 000 /m 2 (2000) or 100, 000 /m 2 (1999 and 2000). Additionally, salt applied at 2000 kg/ha twice (1998) or at a dose of 1000 kg applied four times (1998, 1999 and 2000) provided successful slug control. An application of slug-parasitic nematodes (Nemaslug®) is recommended once at a dose of 300, 000 /m 2 or three times at a dose of 50, 000 /m 2 as a row application for control of slug damage in green asparagus in The Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|PhDStudies on Deroceras reticulatum (MÃ¼ller), the <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug,</b> {{indicate}} that this animal is responsive to food odours and can therefore. select its food. Olfactory responses to food odours are monitored by distance chemoreceptors while contact chemoreception {{is responsible for the}} gustatory stimuli associated with taste. Both types of sensory perception are important in the feeding cycle. The former has been investigated {{with the aid of a}} timelapse camera and the behaviour of slugs monitored in the presence of various food materials and their components. Gustatory responses have been assessed by a feeding assay which permits the quantitive analysis of food ingested. These two aspects of feeding behaviour have been combined to provide a framework for the improved formulation of slug baits for use in agriculture. The two molluscicides metaldehyde and methiocarb have been compared in laboratory and field tests for their efficiency in poisoning slugs and their effects on soil fauna. The field results, which included comparisons between laboratory and commercial metaldehyde formulations, indicate the importance of monitoring the residual population of slugs which remains after baiting. It appears that the true level of bait efficiency may be obscured if tests are concerned only with recording the number of poisoned animals trapped. The addition of a mammal repellent to slug baits does not appear to adversely affect their attraction to slugs but individual formulations may vary considerably in both their palatability and their effectiveness. The laboratory feeding tests have suggested that Derbceras reticulatum habituates to certain diets and that the feeding response may decline over a few days - this can be restored by presenting a novel food to the animals. The meal size of this species can be manipulated in the laboratory by altering the diet'and by the addition of attractive components. Some attempt has been made to define these compounds with a view to improving the consumption of baits by slugs in the field...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{pressure}} on cereal margins growers are seeking ways of reducing their costs of production. Reduced cultivation may provide cheaper and faster crop establishment, {{but in the past}} has been subject to problems with (poor crop establishment) weeds and soil compaction. With modern cultivation and sowing technology and methodology {{it may be possible to}} overcome these difficulties. In addition reduced cultivation is considered to be more environmentally friendly and sustainable than the conventional plough-based system. With these considerations in mind it was decided to start an experiment in autumn 2000 to compare the conventional system (PL) with reduced cultivation (RC) for crop establishment, and to examine the effect of incorporating the straw into then soil or baling and removing it. The treatments were assessed on winter wheat, and winter and spring barley. The parameters assessed included – crop establishment, yield and quality effects on disease levels, invertebrate pests and beneficials (aphids, slugs, earthworms, beetles), and soil conditions. The work reported here was conducted on four trial sites at Oak Park, Carlow and Knockbeg, Co. Laois from 2000 to 2003. the objectives were to establish the efficacy of RC compared with PL and to its effects on the parameters outlined above. Plant establishment was lower after RC in most of the experiments. Winter wheat yields were good irrespective of the number of plants established and there were no significant differences between cultivation or straw disposal method. The relative yields of the PL and RC treatments in winter barley varied over the three years; in 2001 there was no difference, in 2002 PL yielded 1 t/ha more than RC, while in 2003 the PL area produced 2 t/ha extra. Spring barley yields were similar on the PL and RC treatments. Broadleaved weeds were not a problem on the PL or RC treatments but there were more annual grass weeds on the RC plots. This was particularly serious in the winter barley experiments where sterile brome (Bromus sterilis) had a big effect on yield by 2003. annual meadow grass (Poa annua) was a problem in both PL and RC areas if not controlled by timely herbicide application; this was particularly so on the headland areas in the spring barley field. Disease assessment on the winter wheat trail showed no significant differences in Take-all or Eyespot levels between cultivation or straw disposal methods, although Take-all levels tended to be lower on the RC plots. Soil strength as measured by cone penetrometer and shear vane was higher on the RC treatments. In the winter wheat there was no difference in slug numbers between any of the treatments. Leaf damage by slugs increased in RC relative to PL but not significantly, in 2003. No below ground slug damage was found. Earthworm numbers in the winter barley increased significantly on the RC treatment relative to the PL as the study progressed. Straw incorporation increased earthworm numbers on both PL and RC treatments. Allolobophora chlorotia was the most common species in 2004. In the winter wheat the RC and straw incorporation increased earthworm numbers. Cultivation method had a greater effect on ground beetle numbers than method of straw disposal. Large species (e. g. Pterostichies malanarius) were favoured by RC while smaller species (e. g. Bembidon species) were more numerous in the PL plots. Molecular studies on virus diseases, vectors and vector-predators are underway in progress. In the invertebrate pests and beneficials investigations the RC winter barley had 11 % fewer aphids and 27 % less BYDV than the PL. Incorporating straw reduced aphid numbers and virus incidence by 36 % and 32 % respectively; the comparable values for the PL + straw treatment were 15 % and 15 %. In the winter wheat there was less BYDV in the RC plots than the PL + less were the straw was incorporated than where the straw was removed. Aphid infestation of wheat ears was low in the three years of the experiment. The insecticide seed treatment imidacloprid significantly reduced aphid numbers and virus incidence in winter barley but was less effective than a single insecticide spray in controlling the disease. The seed treatment was more effective in controlling BYDV in RC than in the PL plots. Estimations of slug numbers in the winter barley showed that the dominant species was the <b>grey</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> (Deroceras reticulatum). Slug numbers increased significantly on all treatments between 2001 and 2004. In November 2004, slugs were significantly more numerous in the RC treatments than in the PL areas. Leaf damage was proportional to slug populations, but the slugs did not damage the barely seed or reduce plant populations in continuous winter barley under RC. Root and stem diseases (Take-all and Eyespot) were not nay worse under RC than after PL. In fact there was a tendency towards lower disease levels on the RC areas and there was significantly less sharp eyespot on the RC treatment. End of Project Repor...|$|E
