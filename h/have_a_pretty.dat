25|$|There is {{a strong}} rivalry between St Helens and Wigan; the local derby between the two clubs has been {{traditionally}} regarded as the biggest in British rugby league, {{as well as one}} of the oldest in world rugby league. Both being founder members of the Northern Rugby Football Union, the derby has been played since 1895, making it amongst the most historical derbys in both British and global rugby league. Remarkably, the first encounter between the fierce rivals ended in a 0—0 draw at Knowsley Road, The games were traditionally played on Boxing Day, however were moved to Good Friday, during the busy Easter period in rugby league. More recently, the game was even played on Maundy Thursday in Super League. In all league encounters between the two since 1895, there have been 235 games, with Wigan having won nearly double the amount of games that St Helens have. Saints winning 83, drawing 11 and losing 141. All competitive games, i.e. cup and league games combined, show that in the 366 games played, St Helens have won 141, there have been 19 draws and Wigan have won 206. They too have contested no fewer than 6 Challenge Cup Finals, and have met in three Super League Grand Finals; St Helens winning 29-16 in 2000, with Wigan initially gaining revenge in 2010, with a 22-10 win, before Saints claimed the 2014 Super League Grand Final by a score of 14-6, taking a 2-1 lead in their Super League Grand Final head-to-heads. Wigan and St Helens have also met in 4 Premiership Finals, Wigan winning 3, St Helens once, 3 Lancashire County Cup Finals, St Helens winning two, Wigan one, and one Floodlit Trophy Final in 1968, Wigan winning 7—4. The two have traditionally met each other in the Magic Weekend too. The two teams <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> even record, winning two (at Millennium Stadium in 2007 and 2008) and losing two (at Murrayfield in 2009 and Etihad Stadium in 2012), with one draw (at Millennium Stadium in 2011) in five ties. St Helens greatest winning margin and the highest game score between the two in competitive football was a 75—0 win in a 2005 Challenge Cup Round 6 game. Wigan's biggest win was a 65—12 win in Super League II, 1997.|$|E

[...] "We know where seasons 11 and 12 ... we have benchmarks and milestones for those seasons if we're lucky enough to get there." ...|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Best {{stated that}} Epstein drove {{them both to}} Blackpool one evening where Epstein {{expressed}} his [...] "very fond admiration." [...] Epstein then supposedly said, [...] "Would you find it embarrassing if I ask you {{to stay in a}} hotel overnight?" [...] Best replied that he was not interested, and the two never mentioned the incident again. There were reports of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein during a four-day holiday in Barcelona, in April 1963. Lennon always denied the rumours, telling Playboy in 1980: [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated... but we did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> intense relationship." [...] Lennon's first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon's relationship with Epstein was platonic. A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday is featured in the 1991 film The Hours and Times.|$|E

500|$|Super Smash Bros. Melee {{generally}} {{received a}} positive reception from reviewers, {{most of whom}} credited Melee expansion of gameplay features from Super Smash Bros. Focusing on the additional features, GameSpy commented that [...] "Melee really scores big in the 'we've added tons of great extra stuff' department." [...] Reviewers compared the game favorably to Super Smash Bros.—IGN's Fran Mirabella III stated that it was [...] "in an entirely different league than the N64 version"; GameSpot's Miguel Lopez praised the game for offering an advanced [...] "classic-mode" [...] compared to its predecessor, while detailing the Adventure Mode as [...] "really a hit-or-miss experience." [...] Despite a mixed response to the single-player modes, most reviewers expressed the game's multiplayer mode as a strong component of the game. In their review of the game, GameSpy stated that [...] "you'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> hard time finding a more enjoyable multiplayer experience on any other console." ...|$|E
500|$|Kreisberg {{described}} the crossover between both shows as [...] "a superhero a-go-go!", saying: [...] "It’s insane {{to have them}} all together." [...] Unlike the 2014 crossover, which was two separate self-contained adventures that involved each show, Marc Guggenheim, executive producer on Arrow, said: [...] "This [...] is a crazy, full-on 'To Be Continued' crossover,... it really feels like a 2-hour movie [...] over two nights." [...] Kreisberg and Guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up the spin-off series, and that the crossover is still Oliver Queen and Barry Allen having their own adventure. [...] "These [...] have important stuff going on for the narratives of both The Flash and Arrow," [...] said Kriesberg, while Guggenheim added: [...] "The final moments of The Flash <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big jaw-dropper and we pick up those threads in Arrow. Then we do some things with the characters from Arrow... that are pretty epic and major." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon {{remained}} {{among the}} NHL leaders in wins the following seasons, finishing 6th in 1989–90 with 23 and 2nd in 1990–91 with 31. He was voted {{to the starting}} lineup for both the 1990 and 1991 All-Star Games via fan balloting. He served as the backup goaltender for Team Canada at the 1991 World Championship, and though he lost both games he appeared in, Vernon and the Canadians won the silver medal. Despite his success with the Flames, Vernon was often criticized for letting in weak goals, and was routinely booed by the fans in Calgary when he did so. Some fans chose to direct insults towards his family in the stands, causing his parents to stop attending games. Discussing his relationship with Flames fans later in his career, Vernon remarked: [...] "You've got to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> thick skin to play goal. Fans at hockey games get very emotional. They're very passionate. They don't enjoy watching their team give up goals." ...|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which is going to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were positively received. Manny LaMancha of GamePro said that the visuals were brightly colored and smoothly animated and noted that the Xbox version's graphics were slightly cleaner than the PlayStation 2 version. Michael Lafferty of GameZone praised the environments as [...] "lush and richly textured" [...] and the cutscenes as [...] "very well done". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox commended the graphics as [...] "clean and crisp" [...] and added that the cutscenes were [...] "beautifully polished". Ryan Davis of GameSpot noted that [...] "Crash Nitro Kart maintains the brightly colored, cartoony look {{that has been the}} hallmark of past Crash Bandicoot games, though with slightly upgraded graphics. Ed Lewis of IGN said that the graphics for the single-player modes were [...] "bright and cheery and smooth", but decreased in quality in the multiplayer modes. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer concluded that [...] "CNK stays in exactly the cutesy ballpark you'd expect from the Day-Glo series, neither straying in any way from the generic cartoon worlds of old nor providing any graphical trickery that surprises hardened gamers looking for a splash of eye candy with their cartoon frippery." [...] Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report noted that [...] "if you've played any of the other Crash Bandicoot games out there, then you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good idea what this one looks like." [...] Russ Fischer of GameSpy said that the game [...] "some nice graphics, which use a solid framerate and loads of color to capture the old Crash magic." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E

2500|$|In December 2009, Bentley {{revealed}} to the fan site The Bad Religion Page that the band was expected {{to go into the}} studio on April 26, 2010, to start recording their new album. He stated that a few songs for the album had been written and [...] "it feels like the songwriting is picking up momentum. Baker {{said he was going to}} drive up to Graffin's, Brooks and I are going to do some demos with Brett, so we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good jump." [...] According to Brett's Twitter, Bad Religion is aiming for a fall release of the new album. In January 2010, Bentley revealed that Bad Religion would record their new album at a studio in Pasadena, California with Joe Barresi, who engineered 2004's The Empire Strikes First and produced its 2007 follow-up New Maps of Hell. Despite the statement made by Bentley about entering the studio in April, he noted that the recording date was now May 1. On April 6, 2010, Bentley revealed in an interview with KROQ's Kevin and Bean that the date on which the band would record their new album was May 6.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do you go with this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock {{them in a way}} that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I think we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E
