60|$|In {{considering}} these several {{means of}} distribution, {{it should be}} remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance, on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will {{have a good chance of}} succeeding. Although there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of the species, however few, already occupying any pond, yet as the number of kinds is small, compared with those on the land, the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country, would have a better chance of seizing on a place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should, also, remember that some, perhaps many, fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature, and that we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become modified less quickly than the high; and this will give longer time than the average for the migration of the same aquatic species. We should not forget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as fresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas, and having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. But the wide distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, I believe mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight, and naturally travel from one to another and often <b>distant</b> <b>piece</b> of water. Nature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for them.|$|E
5000|$|In the fast-paced or Super Chinese Checkers variant {{popular in}} France, a piece may hop over a non-adjacent piece. A hop {{consists}} of jumping over a <b>distant</b> <b>piece</b> (friendly or enemy) to a symmetrical {{position on the}} opposite side, in the same line of direction. (For example, if there are two empty positions between the jumping piece and the piece being jumped, the jumping piece lands leaving exactly two empty positions immediately beyond the jumped piece.) As in the standard rules, a jumping move may consist of any number of a chain of hops. (When making a chain of hops, a piece is usually allowed to enter an empty corner, {{as long as it}} hops out again before the move is completed.) ...|$|E

40|$|External idea {{sourcing}} is {{a central}} topic in the recent discourse in innovation research. Companies can tap into a range of external sources to search for and source new ideas - ranging from customer, consumers to suppliers and universities. Whilst it is widely acknowledged that novel ideas often emerge from the combination of <b>distant</b> <b>pieces</b> of knowledge, the current discussion pays only little attention to active search among distant actors using analogical thinking to explore new problem solutions. This action research paper addresses cross-industry innovation sourcing in the front-end and presents a management model for systematic external idea sourcing in distant industry domains. A piloted model is presented that assists technology and innovation managers in developing a cross-industry innovation sourcing strategy and in systematically exploiting cross-industry actors as sources for innovation inputs - going beyond technological solutions...|$|R

40|$|Open innovation" and {{external}} idea sourcing are central topics {{in the recent}} discourse in innovation research [1]. Companies can tap into a range of external sources to search for and source new ideas [2; 3] - ranging from customers, consumers [4; 3] suppliers to universities [2; 5]. Whilst it is widely acknowledged that novel ideas often emerge from the combination of <b>distant</b> <b>pieces</b> of knowledge and that analogical thinking can provide totally new problem solutions [6], the current discussion on open innovation pays only little attention to sourcing among cross-industry partners. This paper addresses cross-industry innovation sourcing in the front-end and discusses dimensions of a management framework for systematic cross-industry innovation sourcing. Building upon a review of relevant concepts a piloted methodology is presented that supports firms to develop a cross-industry innovation sourcing strategy and to systematically exploit cross-industry actors as source for innovation inputs - going beyond technological solutions...|$|R
50|$|Hypermodernism is {{a school}} of chess that emerged after World War I. It {{featured}} challenges to the chess ideas of central European masters, including Wilhelm Steinitz's approach to the centre and the rules established by Siegbert Tarrasch. The Hypermoderns demonstrated their new ideas with games and victories. Aron Nimzowitsch showed that games could be won through indirect control of the center, breaking with Tarrasch's view that the center must be occupied by pawns. Nimzowitsch advocated controlling {{the center of the}} board with <b>distant</b> <b>pieces</b> rather than with pawns, thus inviting the opponent to occupy the center with pawns, which can then become targets of attack. This was part of the hypermodern framework, which Nimzowitsch encapsulated in his seminal book My System, which greatly influenced many chess players. It introduced and formalized concepts of the pawn chain, overprotection, undermining, prophylaxis, restraint, rook on the seventh rank, knight outposts, the dynamics of the isolated queen's pawn, and other areas of chess.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{perpetual}} music {{track is}} a new concept that describes a condition of constant or near-constant musical imagery. This condi-tion appears to be very rare even among composers and musicians. I present here a detailed self-analysis of musical imagery for the pur-pose of defining the psychological features of a perpetual music track. I have music running through my head almost constantly during wak-ing hours, consisting {{of a combination of}} recently-heard <b>pieces</b> and <b>distant</b> <b>pieces</b> that spontaneously pop into the head. Imagery consists mainly of short musical fragments that get looped repeatedly upon themselves. Corporeal manifestations of imagery occur in the form of unconscious finger movements whose patterns correspond to the melodic contour of the imagined piece. Musical dreams occur every week or two, and contain a combination of familiar and originally-composed music. These results are discussed in light of theories of imagery, consciousness, hallucination, obsessive cognition, and most especially the notion that acoustic consciousness can be split into multiple parallel streams...|$|R
40|$|Open innovation" and "external search" for {{new ideas}} are central topics {{in the recent}} {{discourse}} in innovation research. External search helps firms to identify new opportunities for innovation and alleviates the risks of local search. It is widely acknowledged that novel ideas regularly emerge from the combination of <b>distant</b> <b>pieces</b> of knowledge and interaction with "idea suppliers" from distant knowledge domains. However, the current discussion on open innovation has hardly touched upon {{the question of how}} firms can systematically search for cross-industry innovation inputs in the fuzzy front-end of the innovation process. This paper links relevant concepts of cognitive psychology and management theory — such as analogical problem solving and the principle of isomorphism — with open innovation in the front-end. It discusses relevant dimensions of systematic search for innovation across industries. A piloted framework is presented that assists firms in systematically and interactively searching for external innovation inputs in distant industries. This framework supports external innovation search in distant industries for a fuzzy customer problem. The results of this participatory action research indicate that a systematic and interactive search process is of practical value to innovation managers. It also points out contingencies of cross-industry innovation search.

5000|$|Arbre à Palabre (2009): A {{temporary}} 3D street-art installation {{dedicated to}} local immigrant communities in Providence, RI, USA. By referencing the widespread tradition of painted white tree trunks, the piece “teleported” a simple detail of foreign everyday life - {{which happens to}} be shared by all of the local immigrants' countries of origin - into their current reality. Made of steel yet disjointed as if prone to radio interferences, it reflected the anchored yet stretched nature of migration. Augmented with an audio transducer that turned its metallic structure into a large scale street-speaker that vibrated to the sound of foreign music, it also acted as an audio link to <b>distant</b> soundscapes. This <b>piece</b> - {{the first of a series}} on the theme of ‘diaspora’ and ‘home’ was realised as part of Lalya's artist residency at Rhode Island School of Design, in collaboration with The Steel Yard and with the support of the local neighbourhood association. In 2012, this piece awarded Lalya Gaye a feature in Stigmart/10 Annual Review of Contemporary Arts as one of the 10 most promising contemporary artists under the age of 34.|$|R
40|$|With {{the success}} of the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer {{currently}} in orbit, this is quite an exciting {{time in the history of}} Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The study of GRBs is a modern astronomical mystery story that began over 30 years ago with the serendipitous discovery of these astronomical events by military satellites in the late 1960 's. Until the launch of BATSE on the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory, astronomers had no clue whether GRBs originated at the edge of our solar system, in our own Milky Way Galaxy or incredibly far away near the edge of the observable Universe. Data from BATSE proved that GRBs are distributed isotropically on the sky and thus could not be the related to objects in the disk of our Galaxy. Given the intensity of the gamma-ray emission, an extragalactic origin would require an astounding amount of energy. Without sufficient data to decide the issue, a great debate continued about whether GRBs were located in the halo of our own galaxy or were at extragalactic - even cosmological distances. This debate continued until 1997 when the BeppoSAX mission discovered a fading X-ray afterglow signal in the same location as a GRB. This discovery enabled other telescopes, to observe afterglow emission at optical and radio wavelengths and prove that GRBs were at cosmological distances by measuring large redshifts in the optical spectra. Like BeppoSAX Swift, slews to new GRB locations to measure afterglow emission. In addition to improved GRB sensitivity, a significant advantage of Swift over BeppoSAX and other missions is its ability to slew very quickly, allowing x-ray and optical follow-up measurements to be made as early as a minute after the gamma-ray burst trigger rather than the previous 6 - 8 hour delay. Swift afterglow measurements along with follow-up ground-based observations, and theoretical work have allowed astronomers to identify two plausible scenarios for the creation of a GRB: either through core collapse of super massive stars or colliding compact objects in <b>distant</b> galaxies. The <b>pieces</b> of the puzzle are beginning to fall into place and yet the story isn't quite finished. I will frame the history of gamma-ray bursts as a mystery story and will end with a description of what we still don't know and what we'll have to do to get the next clues...|$|R
