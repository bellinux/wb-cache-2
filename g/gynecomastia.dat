25|$|The major {{effect of}} estrogenicity is <b>gynecomastia</b> (woman-like breasts). AAS {{that have a}} high {{potential}} for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show {{a high risk of}} <b>gynecomastia,</b> while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of <b>gynecomastia.</b> In addition to <b>gynecomastia,</b> AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production.|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} include galactorrhea, amenorrhea, <b>gynecomastia,</b> impotence.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cases of}} <b>gynecomastia</b> have been {{reported}} with men on amiodarone.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{significant}} portion of testosterone in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls. Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue (<b>gynecomastia)</b> in a large proportion of boys. Boys who develop mild <b>gynecomastia</b> or even developing swellings under nipples during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of estradiol.|$|E
25|$|Male-specific: {{spontaneous}} erections, nocturnal emissions, priapism, erectile dysfunction, <b>gynecomastia</b> (mostly {{only with}} aromatizable and hence estrogenic AAS), oligospermia/azoospermia, testicular atrophy, intratesticular leiomyosarcoma, prostate hypertrophy, prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide also binds to {{and acts}} as an {{antagonist}} of the androgen receptor (AR) and hence is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) of some capacity. In accordance, it can produce <b>gynecomastia</b> and sexual dysfunction as side effects in men.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gynecomastia,</b> or {{increase}} in breast gland size in men {{that is not}} cancerous, is caused by increased estradiol and can occur in up to 2/3 of patients. This is different from increase in breast fat in overweight people.|$|E
25|$|Often, the fat pads of {{the male}} breast tissue and the male nipples will develop during puberty; sometimes, {{especially}} in one breast, this becomes more apparent and is termed <b>gynecomastia.</b> It is usually not a permanent phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Previously, it was erroneously {{thought that}} {{individuals}} with PAIS were always infertile; at least one case report has been published that describes fertile men that fit the criteria for grade 2 PAIS (micropenis, penile hypospadias, and <b>gynecomastia).</b>|$|E
25|$|Enzyme inhibitorsMay cause {{increased}} levels of testosterone: Serzone, Prozac, Paxil (antidepressants), Sporanox, Diflucan, and other ‘azole’ antifungals, Tagamet (an anti-ulcer agent that can cause <b>gynecomastia</b> in men because of this effect). Biaxin and other ‘erythromycin type’ antibiotics, Protease Inhibitors (HIV treatment).|$|E
25|$|Klinefelter {{syndrome}} (XXY). Men with Klinefelter syndrome {{are usually}} sterile {{and tend to}} be taller and have longer arms and legs than their peers. Boys with the syndrome are often shy and quiet and have {{a higher incidence of}} speech delay and dyslexia. Without testosterone treatment, some may develop <b>gynecomastia</b> during puberty.|$|E
25|$|Breast {{problems}} - Includes <b>gynecomastia</b> (male breast development), macromastia (excessively large breasts), tuberous defects, {{and breast}} asymmetry. Often, {{not only do}} children with breast conditions suffer from physical problems, but psychological side effects as well. With this knowledge, current multi-disciplinary clinics have arisen including specialists from plastic surgery, nutrition, adolescent medicine, psychology, gynecology, and social work.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen is used {{to prevent}} or treat <b>gynecomastia.</b> It is taken as a {{preventative}} measure in small doses, or used {{at the onset of}} any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Other drugs are taken for similar purposes such as clomiphene citrate and the anti-aromatase drugs which are used {{in order to try to}} avoid the hormone-related adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{boys and}} men, {{abnormal}} breast development is manifested as <b>gynecomastia,</b> {{the consequence of}} a biochemical imbalance between the normal levels of estrogen and testosterone in the male body. Around 70% of boys temporarily develop breast tissue during adolescence. The condition usually resolves by itself within two years. When male lactation occurs, it is considered {{a symptom of a}} disorder of the pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|In {{surgical}} practice, for {{the reconstruction}} of a breast, the tissue expander device is a temporary breast prosthesis used to form and establish an implant pocket for the future permanent breast implant. For the correction of male breast defects and deformities, the pectoral implant is the breast prosthesis used for the reconstruction and the aesthetic repair of a man’s chest wall (see: <b>gynecomastia</b> and mastopexy).|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{alcohol intake}} {{can result in}} hyperoestrogenisation. It has been speculated that alcohol {{beverages}} may contain estrogen like compounds. In men, high levels of estrogen can lead to testicular failure {{and the development of}} feminine traits including development of male breasts, called <b>gynecomastia.</b> In women, increased levels of estrogen due to excessive alcohol intake have been related to an increased risk of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone, {{which is}} {{available}} as a pharmaceutical drug, is metabolized in part to estrogens such as estradiol, and can produce significant estrogenic effects at high dosages, most notably <b>gynecomastia</b> in males. The {{same is true for}} some synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids, like methyltestosterone and metandienone. DHEA is available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement in the United States (but not in many other countries), though it is only very weakly estrogenic.|$|E
25|$|Health risks can be {{produced}} by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes {{in the structure of}} the left ventricle of the heart. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as <b>gynecomastia</b> and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS.|$|E
25|$|Breast {{reduction}}, or reduction mammoplasty, is the {{cosmetic surgery}} used in resizing the breast, {{in women with}} oversized breasts and men who suffer from <b>gynecomastia.</b> It is an overall safe procedure {{and most of the}} patients are pleased with the results. This type of surgery is performed to treat a breast condition known as hypertrophy, which refers to oversized breasts. This condition usually occurs in both breasts and commonly develops at puberty or immediately after.|$|E
25|$|Hyperestrogenism (elevated {{levels of}} estrogen) {{may be a}} result of {{exogenous}} administration of estrogen or estrogen-like substances, or may {{be a result of}} physiologic conditions such as pregnancy. Any of these causes is linked with an increase in the risk of thrombosis. It's also a symptom of liver cirrhosis, due to lowered metabolic function of the liver, which metabolises estrogen, leading to spider angioma, palmary erythema, <b>gynecomastia</b> and testicular atrophy in some male patients.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is {{a potent}} and direct {{antagonist}} of the AR, blocking androgens like testosterone from binding to and activating the receptor. The AR antagonism of spironolactone mostly underlies its antiandrogen activity and is responsible for its therapeutic benefits {{in the treatment of}} androgen-dependent conditions like acne, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and its usefulness in hormone therapy for transgender women. In addition, the AR antagonism of spironolactone is involved in its feminizing side effects like <b>gynecomastia</b> in men.|$|E
25|$|Other {{signs of}} ascites {{may be present}} due to its {{underlying}} cause. For instance, in portal hypertension (perhaps due to cirrhosis or fibrosis of the liver) patients may also complain of leg swelling, bruising, <b>gynecomastia,</b> hematemesis, or mental changes due to encephalopathy. Those with ascites due to cancer (peritoneal carcinomatosis) may complain of chronic fatigue or weight loss. Those with ascites due to heart failure may also complain of shortness of breath as well as wheezing and exercise intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{methyltestosterone}} include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and sex drive, and spontaneous erections, {{as well as}} estrogenic side effects like <b>gynecomastia,</b> fluid retention, and edema. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{side effects}} of {{cimetidine}} include diarrhea, rashes, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, and muscle pain, {{all of which are}} usually mild and transient. It has been reported that mental confusion may occur in the elderly. Because of its hormonal effects, cimetidine rarely may cause sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction and <b>gynecomastia</b> (0.1–0.2%) in males during long-term treatment. Rarely, interstitial nephritis, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported with cimetidine treatment. Cimetidine is also commonly associated with transient raised aminotransferase activity; hepatotoxicity is rare.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{side effect of}} {{spironolactone}} is urinary frequency. Other general side effects include dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, dry skin, and rashes. Because it reduces androgen levels and directly blocks androgen signaling, spironolactone can, in men, cause breast tenderness, <b>gynecomastia</b> (breast development), and feminization in general, as well as testicular atrophy, reversibly reduced fertility, and sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone has weak progestogenic {{activity}} in bioassays. Its actions {{in this regard}} {{are a result of}} direct agonist activity at the PR, though with a very low half-maximal potency. Spironolactone's {{progestogenic activity}} has been suggested to be involved in some of its side effects, including the menstrual irregularities seen in women and the undesirable serum lipid profile changes that are seen at higher doses. It has also been suggested to augment the <b>gynecomastia</b> caused by the estrogenic effects of spironolactone, as progesterone is known to be involved in mammary gland development.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} studied at a high dosage in the {{treatment}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It was found to be better than placebo in terms of symptom relief following three months of treatment. However, this was not maintained after six months of treatment, by which point the improvements had largely disappeared. Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. <b>Gynecomastia</b> was observed in about 5% of people. On the basis of these results, {{it has been said that}} spironolactone has no place {{in the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{induction}} of breast development, transwomen who undergo HRT {{do not have an}} increased risk of breast cancer, as cissexual women do. Only a handful of cases of breast cancer have ever been described in transsexual women who have undergone male-to-female HRT. This is in accordance with research in cissexual men in which <b>gynecomastia</b> has been found not to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, suggesting a protective role of the male sex-determination chromosome. On the other hand, men with Klinefelter's syndrome (two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome), which causes hypoandrogenism, hyperestrogenism, and a very high incidence of <b>gynecomastia</b> (80%), have a dramatically (20- to 58-fold) increased risk of breast cancer compared to men with one X chromosome, closer to the rate of homogametic females. The incidences of breast cancer in karyotypical men (46,XY karyotype), men with Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY karyotype), and karyotypical women (46,XX karyotype) are approximately 0.1%, 3%, and 12.5%, respectively. Individuals with the 46,XY karyotype affected by complete androgen insensitivity syndrome never develop male sex characteristics and have normal and complete female morphology, and accelerated breast growth during puberty, but appear to have little (or possibly even no) incidence of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer in women with Turner syndrome (45,XO karyotype) also appears to be significantly decreased, though this may be related to ovarian failure/hypogonadism rather necessarily than to genetics.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors of}} the study {{concluded}} that direct interaction of spironolactone (and/or its metabolites) with the ER could {{be involved in the}} <b>gynecomastia,</b> feminization, and effects on gonadotropin levels that the drug is associated with. Subsequently, it has also been suggested that, as a SERM-like drug, ER agonistic activity of spironolactone in the pituitary gland could be responsible for its antigonadotropic effects while ER antagonstic activity of spironolactone in the endometrium could be responsible for the menstrual disturbances that are associated with it. Such actions might explain these effects of spironolactone in light of the finding that it is not significantly progestogenic or antiprogestogenic in women even at high dosages.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. The AR antagonistic (i.e., antiandrogen) activity of spironolactone was first discovered and reported in 1969, which shortly followed the discovery in 1968 that <b>gynecomastia,</b> a frequent {{and by that}} time well-established side effect of spironolactone, is an important and major side effect of AR antagonists. The drug started to be used as an antiandrogen, for instance in the treatment of hirsutism in women, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, and has since become the most widely used antiandrogen for dermatological indications in the United States.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} sex-specific {{side effects of}} AAS. Development of breast tissue in males, a {{condition}} called <b>gynecomastia</b> (which is usually caused by high levels of circulating estradiol), may arise because of increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol by the enzyme aromatase. Reduced sexual function and temporary infertility can also occur in males. Another male-specific side-effect that can occur is testicular atrophy, caused by the suppression of natural testosterone levels, which inhibits production of sperm (most {{of the mass of}} the testes is developing sperm). This side-effect is temporary; the size of the testicles usually returns to normal within a few weeks of discontinuing AAS use as normal production of sperm resumes.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens, {{including}} spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, bicalutamide, and finasteride, {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of hirsutism. Although effective for reducing body hair, antiandrogens have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. Antiandrogens will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, antiandrogens are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as <b>gynecomastia</b> as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.|$|E
25|$|The {{intracellular}} {{metabolism theory}} explains {{how and why}} remarkable dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects can occur, but why dissociation is invariably incomplete. In support of the model is the rare condition congenital 5α-reductase deficiency, in which the 5α-reductase enzyme is defective, production of DHT is impaired, and DHT levels are very low while testosterone levels are normal. Males with this condition are born with ambiguous genitalia and an underdeveloped prostate gland. In addition, saliently, such males develop normal musculature, voice changes/deepening, and libido at puberty, but have little to no acne or facial, pubic, or body hair, minimal enlargement of the prostate, and no incidence of male-pattern baldness or prostate cancer. They also notably do not develop <b>gynecomastia</b> {{as a consequence of}} their condition.|$|E
25|$|Canrenone is an {{antagonist}} of the MR {{similarly to}} spironolactone, but is slightly more potent in comparison. In addition, canrenone inhibits steroidogenic enzymes such as 11β-hydroxylase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17α-hydroxylase, and 21-hydroxylase similarly to spironolactone, {{but once again}} is more potent in doing so in comparison. In vitro, canrenone binds to and blocks the AR. However, relative to spironolactone, canrenone is described as having very weak affinity to the AR. In accordance, replacement of spironolactone with canrenone in male patients {{has been found to}} reverse spironolactone-induced <b>gynecomastia,</b> suggesting that canrenone is comparatively much less potent in vivo as an antiandrogen. As such, based on the above, the antiandrogen effects of spironolactone are considered to be largely due to other metabolites rather than due to canrenone.|$|E
25|$|High dose {{estrogen}} {{therapy with}} estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol, ethinylestradiol, and estradiol undecylate {{has been used}} in the past to treat prostate cancer in men. It is effective because estrogens are functional antiandrogens, capable of suppressing testosterone levels to castrate concentrations and decreasing free testosterone levels by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production. High dose estrogen therapy is associated with poor tolerability and safety, namely severe <b>gynecomastia</b> and cardiovascular complications such as thrombosis, and for this reason, has largely been replaced by newer antiandrogens such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It is still sometimes used in the treatment of prostate cancer however, and newer estrogens with atypical profiles such as GTx-758 that have improved tolerability profiles are being studied for possible application in prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|NET is weakly estrogenic (via {{conversion}} {{into its}} metabolite EE), {{and for this}} reason, {{it has been found}} at high dosages to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and <b>gynecomastia</b> in men, but also with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. It has been suggested that very high dosages (e.g., 40mg/day, which are sometimes used in clinical practice for various indications) of NETA (and by extension NET) may result in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) analogously to high dosages (above 50μg/day) of EE, and that even dosages of NETA of 10 to 20mg, which correspond to EE dosages of approximately 20 to 30μg/day, may in certain women be associated with increased risk.|$|E
