An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been.</b> A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been.</b>|$|R
