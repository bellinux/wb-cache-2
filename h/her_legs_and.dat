When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> feet.|$|E

25|$|Mating {{behavior}} of V. pensylvanica {{has been observed}} to be very similar to mating {{behavior of}} V. germanica. Pairing occurs midday and receptive queens remain stationary throughout. Mating occurs between one male and one female, with the female generally upright on <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> the male attached solely by genitalia. Other males in the nest do {{not interfere with the}} mating, but often antennate the pairs during the mating process. Sometimes, queens may be unreceptive and will exhibit this by twisting away from the males and biting. Unreceptive behavior from females, however, does not always prevent mating from occurring. Vespula queens often mate more than once with the same or different males. Mating involves only one male.|$|E

25|$|On September 17, 1925, Kahlo and {{her boyfriend}} and fellow Cachuca, Alejandro Gómez Arias, {{were on their way}} home from school when the wooden bus they were riding {{collided}} with a streetcar. Several people were killed, and Kahlo suffered nearly fatal injuries—an iron handrail impaled her through her pelvis, fracturing the bone. She also fractured several ribs, <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> her collarbone. She spent a month in the hospital and two months recovering at home, before being able to return to work. As she continued to experience fatigue and back pain, her doctors ordered x-rays, which revealed that the accident had also displaced three vertebrae.

25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her. When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know how to treat it. Instead, they were waiting {{to see how it}} progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. When she left the hospital {{for the first time in}} a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a need to explain to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in <b>her</b> <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. The last time she was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory. Perales earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy, which she earned from the Universidad de Zaragoza where she was a student from 1996 to 1999.|$|E

The performance received positive feedback from critics with Ricardo Baca, from The Denver Post, writing that [...] "her courageous, late-set take on 'You Must Love Me' — from the filmed version of the Broadway musical Evita — was spot-on and gorgeous with its string accompaniment". On the Buenos Aires stop of the tour, after performing [...] "You Must Love Me", Madonna also sang [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] from the film. The performances of both songs in the city were recorded in the live CD-DVD titled, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010). Singer Brooke White covered the song on the seventh season of American Idol.
