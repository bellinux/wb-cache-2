40|$|Bibliography: pages 151 - 184. The {{suitability}} of the <b>galjoen,</b> Coracinus capensis, for mariculture in South Africa has been assessed from both {{an economic and}} a biological viewpoint. In terms of economic criteria <b>galjoen</b> shows a high potential for culture, being widely known and highly regarded as a table fish. The restaurant trade in the southwestern Cape {{has been identified as}} a possible market showing a high demand for this species. Adult <b>galjoen</b> are readily available, hardy, and are easily maintained in captivity. A biochemical technique to determine the sex of live fish has been elucidated and allows sexual identification to be conducted for several months prior to and during the spawning season. Natural serial spawning with high fertilization occurs readily in captivity, with <b>galjoen</b> producing large numbers of good quality eggs during a single season. However induced spawning using two mammalian gonadotropins resulted in the production of poor quality eggs. The relationship between temperature and development time for fertilized <b>galjoen</b> eggs has been determined, and the lower lethal temperature for developing eggs was found to lie between 14 ° and 16 °C. Newly-hatched larvae exhaust their endogenous food reserves rapidly and show a short time to irreversible starvation, with first-feeding beginning from 110 hours after hatching at 18 °C. <b>Galjoen</b> larvae proved to be extremely difficult to rear. Although successful first-feeding on a few live food organisms was observed, mass mortality at 4 - 8 days and again at 12 - 15 days after first-feeding resulted in exceptionally poor survival. It is surmised that <b>galjoen</b> larvae have very stringent nutritional requirements which cannot be met by employing commonly-used live food organisms. Growth rate estimates for <b>galjoen</b> that survived past metamorphosis indicate that growth under culture conditions is similar to that in the natural environment. Certain biological attributes of the <b>galjoen</b> such as simple broodstock maintenance, ease of natural spawning in captivity and high fecundity select this species for culture. However the inability to mass rear larvae through to metamorphosis drastically reduces the {{suitability of}} this species, especially since larval rearing is the key to successful mariculture. In addition, the slow growth rate under culture conditions observed also selects against this species. Because of these last two factors, it is concluded that the <b>galjoen</b> is not a suitable species for mariculture in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: p. 281 - 301. The {{successful}} {{management of}} the fishery for <b>galjoen</b> Dichistius capensis depends on an understanding of its spatial and temporal dynamics. This thesis investigates the movement of <b>galjoen</b> and its fishery parameters, and evaluates the role of marine protected areas (MPAs) and alternative assessment strategies. A {{review of the literature}} shows that there are examples of resident behaviour, territoriality, nomadism and migration among fish. Combinations of the above may exist within a stock. Fish movement behaviour may be plastic, but never random. Planktonic stages are capable of influencing their destination and settlement...|$|R

40|$|The {{movement}} behaviour of <b>galjoen</b> Dichistius capensis (> 250 mm total length) was {{studied by}} using a tag and recapture technique. A total of 25 191 <b>galjoen</b> was tagged at four sites in South Africa. Three of the sites were in fully protected reserves (two in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area, one in the Tsitsikamma National Park), whereas the fourth site was at the Cape Peninsula where fishing is permitted. In all, 2 174 fish were recaptured, some of them several times. The vast majority of fish were caught {{at the site of}} release. After correcting for differences in recovery effort between the release sites and other areas, it was estimated that 95 % of tagged fish remained at the release site. The remaining 5 % moved throughout the South African range of <b>galjoen,</b> which was separated from the Namibian range. There was no evidence to suggest that movement is linked to season, age or sex. Although not territorial, <b>galjoen</b> do hold home ranges, which were estimated to be no larger than 1. 38 km in extent, but probably much smaller. Two likely models, the polymorphic and the tourist, are advanced to explain the movement behaviour. The polymorphic model is a combination of two movement patterns, one resident and another nomadic. The balance between the two may represent a mixed evolutionary stable strategy. The tourist model does not differentiate between fish. Each fish spends its time at a small number of widely separated sites, moving between them as conditions dictate. The tag and recovery data do not favour one model above the other unequivocally...|$|R

40|$|Ten years (1993 – 2002) of shore fishing {{catch and}} effort data {{collected}} during routine patrols in the Goukamma Marine Protected Area in theWestern Cape Province were analysed. Of {{a total of}} 35 species recorded, the most common were backtail, Diplodus sargus capensis (39 %), and <b>galjoen,</b> Dichistius capensis (25 %). These species dominated most years of the study period. Mean overall annual catch per unit effort by number and weight remained relatively constant over the period. Up to 30 % of the recorded catches of top species were smaller than the minimum Although catches {{of most of the}} top species contained specimens, 98 % of recorded dusky kob, Argyrosomus japonicus,  and 87 % of white steenbras, Lithognathus lithognathus, were immature.

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are gaining {{credibility in the}} scientific community because of their duality as a conservation and fishery management tool, but sometimes the actual effects of an MPA fall short of the expected outcomes. Case-by-case studies are needed to understand what works and what doesn’t and this understanding can then be applied to decision making and adaptive management. The <b>galjoen</b> (Coracinus capensis), a surf zone teleost endemic to South Africa, is a popular fish for recreational shore anglers and as such the population has declined to dangerously low levels. Marine reserves were established around Cape Point to try and counteract this decline. This study aimed to determine whether these reserves are having a positive effect on <b>galjoen</b> mortality, density and size. A controlled shore angling program has been running on the Cape Peninsula since 1986 in which anglers use a standardised fishing technique. The anglers record the length of their fishing trip as well as the fork length of the fish they catch. Two sites located in near proximity to each other, one in a reserve and one in an exploited area, were chosen from the data set to compare. This avoided the conflicting problem of major habitat differences. General linear models (GLMs) were used to isolate the effect of area on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) as well as fork length, and a negative log-likelihood function was used to estimate the mortality rate and sex ratio for each area. CPUE increased significantly from of 1. 02 ± 0. 81 <b>galjoen.</b> angler- 1. hour- 1 in th...|$|R

In season southern right whales, occasionally killer whales, humpback dolphins, Haviside's dolphin and Cape fur seals are commonly seen in the bay.|$|R
40|$|A fishery-dependant {{monitoring}} method of the recreational shore-based fishery was {{undertaken in the}} Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the south coast of South Africa {{for a period of}} 17 months. The method used was a roving creel survey (RCS), with dates, times and starting locations chosen by stratified random sampling. The MPA was divided into two sections, Buffalo Bay and Groenvlei, and all anglers encountered were interviewed. Catch and effort data were collected and catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated from this. The spatial distribution of anglers was also mapped. A generalized linear model (GLM) was fitted to the effort data {{to determine the effects of}} month and day type on the variability of effort in each section. Fitted values showed that effort was significantly higher on weekends than on week days, in both sections. A total average of 3662 anglers fishing 21 428 hours annually is estimated within the reserve with a mean trip length of 5. 85 hours. Angler numbers were higher per unit coastline length in Buffalo Bay than Groenvlei, but fishing effort (angler hours) was higher in Groenvlei. Density distributions showed that anglers were clumped in easily accessible areas and that they favored rocky areas and mixed shores over sandy shores. Catch documented between October 2008 and December 2009 included a total of 361 fish, of 27 species from 12 families. Sparidae had the highest contribution (12 species). A Shannon-Weiner diversity index showed that diversity was higher in Buffalo Bay (0. 81) than Groenvlei (0. 57). Catch composition of retained fish (336 individuals) showed that the six numerically most important species were blacktail (Diplodus sargus capensis) (66 percent of catch), followed by <b>galjoen</b> (Dichistius capensis) at 11 percent, Cape stumpnose (Rhabdosargus holubi), belman (Umbrina robinsonii) and strepie at 3 percent, and elf (Pomatomus saltatrix) at 2 percent. Catch composition of an earlier study in Goukamma (Pradervand and Hiseman 2006) was compared with the present study, as well as data from the De Hoop MPA, which is closed to fishing. A multi-dimensional scaling plot of catch composition showed tight clustering of the De Hoop samples, and high variability among the Goukamma samples. A bray-curtis similarity index and dendrogram of similarity between study sites and study periods showed that there was an 83 percent similarity among De Hoop samples and a 75 percent similarity among Goukamma samples (ignoring the two outliers). The two sites are different with respect to species composition, but this is expected because they are different areas. Differences between time periods in Goukamma (i. e. the previous study versus the present study) were not significant. The most significant result from the catch composition analyses is the high variability among the Goukamma samples. This can be explained by the variable fishing methods used by anglers in Goukamma, compared with the standardized fishing methods used by researchers in De Hoop, and the fact that fish are more abundant and populations are more stable in De Hoop – giving higher sample sizes which reduce the variability in the statistics. Species-specific CPUE was calculated for the six numerically most important species. In both sections, CPUE was highest for blacktail, with an average of 0. 133 fish per hour for Groenvlei, and 0. 060 fish per hour for Buffalo Bay, over the 12 months. The second highest CPUE values per section were 0. 030 for <b>galjoen</b> in Groenvlei and 0. 039 for strepie in Buffalo Bay. Remaining CPUE values ranged from 0. 014 (belman in Groenvlei) to the lowest value of 0. 001 (strepie in Groenvlei). Total estimated CPUE for these six species in the MPA using the estimated effort and catch results amounted to 0. 018 fish per hour. An annual estimated 3897 fish were landed in the reserve during 2009. Most fish (n= 2481, 64 percent) were caught in the Groenvlei section. Numbers of blacktail were the highest of all species, within both sections (2353 fish). Strepie was the next most common (561 fish), but was caught almost entirely within the Buffalo Bay section (97 percent of individuals), followed by <b>galjoen</b> (548 fish) caught mostly within the Groenvlei section (92 percent of individuals). Size comparisons of the six species between the Goukamma and De Hoop MPAs showed that ranges in size are similar, but there are substantial differences in mean sizes between the two MPAs. Sample sizes of all species from the Goukamma MPA were too small to draw conclusions about stock status, except for blacktail. The Goukamma MPA is a popular fishing destination and angler effort is high. It can be considered a node of exploitation for surf zone fish, for which it provides no protection. Even though the MPA allows shore angling, sustainable fishing practices should be incorporated in management plans if the MPA is expected to protect and conserve its stocks. Of noteworthy concern is the occurrence of illegal night fishing (the public may not enter the reserve between sunrise and sunset) which leads to underestimates of catch and effort (night surveys were not conducted because of safety concerns). It is recommended that more communication should take place between the angling community and the reserve management. Sign boards giving information on species which are under pressure, and why they are under pressure, with a short explanation on their life cycles, is advised. The roving creel survey method was suitable for the study area and delivered statistically rigorous results. I thus recommend that it is continued in the future by management. I make some recommendations for reducing costs of future surveys, as well as for altering the survey design if funds are very limite...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 48 - 54). Ancient intertidal stonewall fish traps {{are found}} world-wide and those along the SouthAfrican south coast {{are the focus}} of my thesis. These fish traps, known locally as 'vywers', have recently enjoyed much media attention as interest increases in both South Africa's cultural heritage and its diminishing fish stocks. Two pioneering studies, by Goodwin (1946) and Avery (1975), provided the only documented knowledge of these vywers. My study aimed to locate, survey and document the main concentrations of vywers within a 300 -km stretch along the south coast. A total of 43 sets of vywers was located by aerial surveys, 30 of which are only accessible through private land. This affords them some measure of protection, together with five located off reserves, but diminishes their educational and tourism value. Four sets of vywers were mapped in detail using aerial photogrammetry, a method that provided a rapid, extensive, accurate survey record in the form of geo-rectified ortho-images of these sites. The vywers are built in both exposed and sheltered environments, constructed from in situ rock material built into walls with either angular or curved shapes. These walls may occur singularly or in complexes of up to 25 traps. Vywers are prone to decimation by wave action and storm damage and so require maintenance to retain their characteristic form and associated cultural information. Tensions have, however, arisen between those who maintain and fish the vywers, and fisheries managers. Data from a questionnaire survey compared with records from the literature showed that species composition has not changed significantly in the last five decades. The fish are caught most frequently during new-moon spring-tides, especially in the winter months. The vywer fishery, currently active at only two sets of vywers, targets primarily mullet species (mostly Liza richardsonii) but infrequently enjoys 'bonanza' catches of over-exploited linefish stocks such as <b>galjoen</b> Dichistius capensis. It is these latter catches that concern managers, in addition to the noncompliance of fishers in terms of catch composition and size, permits and gear...|$|R
