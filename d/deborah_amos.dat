50|$|Noticed at WTVT-TV by Florida native <b>Deborah</b> <b>Amos</b> of National Public Radio, Shuster {{was invited}} to move to Washington and join NPR where {{he became one of}} the early {{producers}} of All Things Considered evening news magazine program. Shuster later joined the Washington-based Associated Press Radio Network, and the Africa Service of the Voice of America, before becoming the Geneva, Switzerland-based foreign correspondent of ABC News, first under ABC’s Paris Bureau Chief Pierre Salinger and later reporting directly to ABC Chief Foreign Correspondent Peter Jennings. For nine years with ABC Shuster worked in more than 40 developing countries covering mainly Africa, South and East Asia, and Latin America. In 1986, CNN Executive Producer Stuart Loory approached Scott Shuster for help with a new program he was planning, CNN World Report (today known as CNN World View). The program was to launch in 1987 and would feature news items produced by the (at that time largely government-owned) television broadcasters of a list of nations, eventually 150 countries. This content would be broadcast worldwide: On CNN in the US, on CNN International around the world, as well as on the government-owned broadcasting stations that contributed the material. Knowing of Shuster’s long experience as the guy in the Safari Suit reporting for ABC from the most distant lands, Loory asked Shuster to try to sign up government broadcasters in Africa in particular. Shuster visited and brought to CNN program contribution relationships with the television broadcasters of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Zaire (today’s Democratic Republic of Congo), and with the government film unit of Chad (where there was as yet, no television).|$|E
