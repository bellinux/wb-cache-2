40|$|An extraction-adsorptive {{stripping}} voltammetric {{procedure for}} {{the determination of}} the pesticide <b>dialifos</b> in soil samples using microwave-assisted solvent extraction and a mercury film ultramicroelectrode was developed. The method is based on the use of hexane-acetone solvent (1 : 1, v/v) and on controlled adsorptive accumulation of the insecticide at the potential of - 0. 10 V (versus Ag/AgCl) in the presence of Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 2. 0). Soil sample extracts were analyzed directly after drying and redissolution with the supporting electrolyte, but without other pretreatment. The limit of detection obtained for a 10 sec collection time was 2. 0 x 10 - 8 mol L- 1. Recovery experiments for the global procedure, at the 0. 100 Âµgg- 1 level, gave satisfactory average and standard deviation results for the two different soils tested...|$|E
