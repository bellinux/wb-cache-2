2500|$|To these {{concrete}} five {{might be}} added a vaguer sixth, {{having to do}} with maintaining a chemical purity in the reaction between product and appraiser. Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not <b>imagine</b> <b>yourself</b> a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in any ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind. Never, never... try to put the author [...] "in his place," [...] making of him a pawn in a contest with other reviewers. Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, and all our discriminations should curve toward that end.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Searle {{presented}} the [...] "Chinese room" [...] argument, which purports {{to prove the}} falsity of strong AI. Assume you do not speak Chinese and <b>imagine</b> <b>yourself</b> {{in a room with}} two slits, a book, and some scratch paper. Someone slides you some Chinese characters through the first slit, you follow the instructions in the book, transcribing characters as instructed onto the scratch paper, and slide the resulting sheet out the second slit. To people on the outside world, it appears the room speaks Chinese—they slide Chinese statements in one slit and get valid responses in return—yet you do not understand a word of Chinese. This suggests, according to Searle, that no computer can ever understand Chinese or English, because, as the thought experiment suggests, being able to 'translate' Chinese into English does not entail 'understanding' either Chinese or English: all which the person in the thought experiment, and hence a computer, is able to do is to execute certain syntactic manipulations.|$|E

The central defining form of Vajrayana meditation is Deity Yoga (devatayoga).

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} {{whether there are}} performance advantages associated with a single bout of imagery when <b>imagining</b> <b>yourself</b> ‘as your favourite athlete’, or <b>imagining</b> <b>yourself</b> performing a strength-based task. Design: A blind 2 (Imagery ability: high, low) x 3 (imagery condition: self, “hero”, control) mixed factorial design was used. Methods: Participants (n = 17 male; Mage = 19. 7 ± 2. 7) completed the Sport Imagery Ability Questionnaire then viewed a standardised video demonstrating the grip strength (GS) task. Three baseline trials separated by one minute were then executed. Three imagery scripts (control, self, hero) were then presented to participants via an MP 3 player in a counterbalanced order (an interval of 1 -minute was provided between each condition). The conclusion of each imagery script prompted participants to perform the GS task. Performance in each condition was conceptualised as delta change scores (Imagery condition – baseline average). Results: No main effects were present {{but there was a}} group x condition interaction (F(2, 28) = 4. 27, p =. 02. ƞ_p^ 2 =. 23. The interaction suggests that for individuals with high imagery ability, simply “doing the imagery that they already do” is preferable compared to a scripted self- or hero-imagery condition. For individuals with a low imagery ability, a simple script whether that is self- or hero- based may enhance strength performance, compared to “what they already do”. Conclusion: Imagery ability may influence the effectiveness of a brief imagery intervention. Further examination of processes and outcomes associated with “hero-imagery” is recommended...|$|R

5000|$|Slant Magazine's Elise Nakhnikian had {{the most}} sullen review, {{frowning}} on the film's choice to root its perspective with the adolescent inmates: [...] "There's {{a certain kind of}} fantasy, appealing to teenagers, that involves <b>imagining</b> <b>yourself</b> in a situation harsh enough to justify the alienation and rage flooding your soul. The attraction is the perverse satisfaction of enduring nightmarish scenarios, no matter how high the deck is stacked against you." [...] Indignant herself, she awarded the film only one star for what she called [...] "its melodramatic mixture of grandiosity and powerlessness to its view of the world as a torture-chamber crucible for an angry young man who has to grow up too fast." ...|$|R

Once these three have become visible, you can continue {{to increase the number}} to several dozen, all like yourself, who may be concealed or revealed, and all of whom are automatically in possession of secret oral directions. This may be termed a process for multiplying the body. Through this method Cu, Liao, and my uncle Xuan could be in several dozen places at one time. When guests were present they could be one host speaking the guests in the house, another host greeting guests beside the stream, and still another host making cases with his fishing line, but the guests were unable to distinguish which was he true one. My teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright Mirror 守一兼修明鏡, and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same dress and facial expression.
