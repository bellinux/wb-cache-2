25|$|Gum chewing is {{regarded}} as a helpful way to cure halitosis (bad breath). Chewing gum not only helps to add freshness to breath but can aid in removing food particles and bacteria associated with bad breath from teeth. It does this by stimulating saliva, which essentially washes out the mouth. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after a meal helps prevent tooth decay, according to the American Dental Association, because the act of chewing the sugar-free gum produces saliva to wash away bacteria, which protects teeth. Chewing gum after a meal replaces brushing and flossing, if that's not possible, to prevent tooth decay and increase saliva production. Chewing gum can also help with the lack of saliva or xerostomia since it naturally stimulates saliva production. Saliva is made of chemicals, such as organic molecules, inorganic ions and macromolecules. 0.5% of saliva deals with dental health, since tooth enamel is made of calcium phosphate, those inorganic ions in saliva help repair the teeth and keep them in good condition. The pH of saliva is neutral, which having a pH of 7 allows it to remineralize tooth enamel. Falling below a pH of 5.5 (which is acidic) causes the saliva to <b>demineralize</b> the teeth.|$|E

The rat tubular cortical bone matrices were <b>demineralized</b> in heated 0. 6 N HCl at 60 °C for 5 and 20 mins, respectively, using a controlled-heat ultrasonic cleaner and implanted in rat dorsal subcutaneous pouches and thigh muscles for 1 - 3 weeks. The {{influence of the}} <b>demineralized</b> condition of bone matrix on cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation was also evaluated in vitro by MTT assay and ALP staining. The cortical matrices were completely <b>demineralized</b> within 20 mins by sonication and heating of diluted 0. 6 N HCl. The sonicated bone matrices in heated acidic solution at 60 °C revealed no adverse immunogenic and inflammatory response in vivo regardless of <b>demineralized</b> condition. Cellular proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation was facilitated by more fully <b>demineralized.</b> Ectopic bone formation was induced only by <b>demineralized</b> bone matrices and were more favorable in fully <b>demineralized</b> matrices. The ectopic bone induction was more favorably in subcutaneous pouches than in muscular tissue. These findings suggest that a fully <b>demineralized</b> cortical bone matrix maximizes osteogenic repair by exposing more bioactive molecules which in turn induce chondro- and osteognic differentiation of mesenchymal cells around the implanted matrices, and that the sonication of diluted 0. 6 N HCl heated at 60 ° C is a rapid and effective method for sterile <b>demineralized</b> graft preparation...|$|R

Questions/purposes We determined at what times and to what extent <b>demineralized</b> bone matrix promotes gap healing and bone ingrowth around a porous implant. Methods We inserted porous titanium implants into the proximal metaphyses of canine femora and humeri, with an initial 3 -mm gap between host cancellous bone and implants. We left the gaps empty (control; n = 12) or filled them with either <b>demineralized</b> bone matrix (n = 6) or devitalized <b>demineralized</b> bone matrix (negative control; n = 6) and left them in situ for 4 or 12 weeks. We quantified volume healing of the gap with new bone using three-dimensional micro-CT scanning and quantified apposition and ingrowth using backscattered scanning electron microscopy. Results The density of bone inside gaps filled with <b>demineralized</b> bone matrix reached 64 % and 93 % of surrounding bone density by 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Compared with empty controls and negative controls at 4 and 12 weeks, gap healing using <b>demineralized</b> bone matrix was two to three times greater and bone ingrowth and apposition were up to 15 times greater.

40|$|Repair {{of large}} bone defects {{represents}} {{a challenge to}} orthopedic surgery since autogenous graft is not available in large amounts. <b>Demineralized</b> bone matrix (DBM) which contains bone morphogenic protein, a potent osteoinductive glycoprotein, and collagen, an osteoconductive matrix, may be an effective substitute for these graft materials. Bone marrow which contains osteoprogenitor cells could potentiate the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of <b>demineralized</b> bone matrix. This study tested the ability of <b>demineralized</b> bone matrix with and without bone marrow to bridge large segmental defects, and evaluated the results both radiographically and biomechanically as compared to autogenous (isogeneic) cancellous bone graft. <b>Demineralized</b> bone-matrix segments implanted into a plated femoral segmental defect in rats resulted in firm union in most animals. Bone marrow significantly enhanced bone formation of <b>demineralized</b> bone-matrix implants {{at an early stage}} but with time, differences between bone marrow-augmented and bone marrow-deprived <b>demineralized</b> bone implants were no longer demonstrable radiographically and biomechanically.

Background: The application of diamine silver fluoride (Ag(NH 3) 2 F) and potassium iodide (KI) to <b>demineralized</b> dentine {{has been shown to}} inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans. The {{purpose of this study was}} to observe the differences between <b>demineralized</b> and non-demineralized dentine treated with AgF/KI. Methods: Thirty-five dentine discs were bonded to the bases of 5 mL polycarbonate screw top vials which were filled with nutrient medium, sterilized and placed into the overflow from a continuous culture of S. mutans. Samples were divided as follows: 10 samples of <b>demineralized</b> dentine; 10 samples of <b>demineralized</b> dentine treated with AgF/KI; 5 samples of non-demineralized dentine; and 10 samples of non-demineralized dentine treated with AgF/KI. Following two weeks connected to the Chemostat, an electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) of percentage weights and penetration depths of calcium, phosphorous silver and fluoride was conducted. Bacterial growth was monitored by taking optical density readings of the growth medium in each vial and outer surfaces of the specimens were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: AgF/KI treatment of <b>demineralized</b> and non-demineralized dentine prevented biofilm formation and reduced further demineralization by S. mutans. AgF/KI treatment of <b>demineralized</b> dentine was more effective in reducing dentine breakdown and the growth of S. mutans. Significantly higher levels of silver and fluoride were deposited within <b>demineralized</b> dentine. Conclusions: A topical treatment with AgF/KI on dentine reduced in vitro caries development and inhibited surface biofilm formation.

Additionally, SWRO permeate was used for backwashes in long-term experiments to check the possibility of it replacing <b>demineralized</b> water. Results show that seawater UF fouling control is substantially improved by <b>demineralized</b> water backwashing. However, due to the high salinity of seawater, more water was required to dilute the cation concentration and limit the dispersion effect near the membrane surface than was needed for surface water. A 2 -min <b>demineralized</b> water backwash showed better fouling control efficiency than a 1 -min backwash. Furthermore, the presence of monovalent cations in the backwash water deteriorated the fouling control efficiency of the backwash, indicating {{the existence of a}} charge screening effect. The <b>demineralized</b> water with 5 and 50 mmol/l NaCl both showed a similar fouling control efficiency which is better than the UF permeate backwash. The calcium ions in UF permeate probably deteriorates the fouling control efficiency by maintaining a Ca-bridging effect between the membranes and NOM.
