25|$|Although {{already an}} {{accomplished}} practitioner, in interview Okabayashi Shōgen {{stated that he}} <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had come to a}} technical road block in his training through which he could not pass. He could perform the techniques effectively but not at a speed necessary for them to be employed under the demands of real fighting. His teacher Hisa had become elderly and had suffered a dehabilitating stroke and so was moving to Tokyo to be cared for by his family. Okabayashi decided that he would give up the practise of Daitō-ryū. Hearing of this Hisa encouraged him rather to go study with Sōkaku's son, the current headmaster of the art, Tokimune Takeda, and gave him a letter of recommendation.|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|Chrisye {{began work}} on a {{rearrangement}} of Badai Pasti Berlalu in 1999 {{at the request of}} Musica Studios– although he felt that the original album was fine– and once again teamed up with Gutawa. The new album, which retained the title Badai Pasti Berlalu, cost Rp.800 million (US$95,000) to produce and promote, in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra, the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra. After its release, the album sold well, breaking even within three months and selling 350,000 copies. The album led to Chrisye's second sold-out solo concert at the Plenary Hall of Jakarta Convention Centre, known as the Badai concert, and he received numerous offers to perform at venues throughout the country. He later told Kompas that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had reached a dead end, having tried all genres available. He continued performing, singing [...] "Indonesia Perkasa" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 15th National Games on 19 June 2000 in Sidoarjo, East Java.|$|E
60|$|Harz bowed; but {{for some}} reason <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> annoyed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been asked to part with {{something}} personal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't we {{want some}} canvas for sail?" [...] asked Randy, who was {{intensely}} interested, and who <b>felt</b> somewhat <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{was going out}} to play at Robinson Crusoe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'However unconventional,' said Merton, smiling. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> rather <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were being}} treated like a quack doctor, to whom people (if foolish enough) appeal only as the last desperate resource.|$|R
500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{having sex with a}} sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, {{the first time she had}} sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{there was}} a scene after the four had been reunited in the museum where Amy had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and Rory assured her it was okay; this was cut due to pacing issues, which pleased Darvill as he disliked his {{performance}} in the scene. Gillan stated that the episode was the [...] "most difficult" [...] for her, as it was [...] "a big climax for Amy and her story that's been building through the series...it just required a lot of kind of concentration and emotion." [...] In August 2011 she stated that the Doctor and Amy's farewell was the most emotional scene for her to film. The scene in which the Doctor gives a final speech to young Amelia was not filmed with Smith and Blackwood on the same set. Smith's dialogue was shot first in the bedroom set, while the corner with the bed was recreated and filmed with Blackwood as a pick-up. Blackwood fell asleep during filming. Amy and Rory's wedding reception was filmed at Miskin Manor. Gillan found wearing the dress strange, while Darvill <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was gate-crashing someone else's wedding, as {{he did not know}} any of the extras there. Haynes wanted to first show the revelation that the TARDIS would appear at the reception in a small way with minor changes such as the glasses tinkling and chandelier shaking, and build it up from there. Moffat thought that Amy would want a big wedding with a lot of dancing. In the script it was written that the Doctor was a [...] "terrible dancer" [...] and danced like a [...] "drunk giraffe", and Smith additionally came up with his own routine.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Oliver Meeker's friends from Indianapolis {{joined the group}} before the party left Iowa. They crossed the Missouri River at the small Mormon {{settlement}} of Kanesville (today Council Bluffs, Iowa). Meeker recounted that, as {{he stood on the}} far side of the Missouri, he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had left the United States. As they journeyed westward along the Platte River in Nebraska Territory, there were such large numbers traveling that they were never out of sight of the tens of thousands of other pioneers journeying west that year. Sometimes several wagons advanced side by side. The Meekers chose a slow, steady pace, unlike many who sought to rush along as quickly as possible. Piles of abandoned possessions lined the way, cast aside to lighten loads. [...] As the party went further west, they passed some of those who had hurried past them, and whose wagons had broken down or whose oxen had died as a result of failure to care for them properly. Disease was an ever-present risk; at the present site of Kearney, Nebraska, Oliver Meeker was stricken with illness. This led to a division of the group when most of Oliver's friends, including later Idaho Territory governor David W. Ballard, refused to wait. Oliver recovered after four days, and was one of the lucky ones—his brother later estimated that one in ten of those who took the Trail perished during the journey. Ezra Meeker remembered meeting one wagon train, slowly moving east against the flow of traffic. That group had made it as far as Fort Laramie (today in Wyoming) before losing the last of its menfolk, and the women and children turned back, hoping to regain their homes in the East. [...] He never learned if they made it. According to local historians Bert and Margie Webber, [...] "all of these deaths made a great impression on the young man".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay,' she said, in an incomprehensible monosyllable, {{that sounded}} profoundly cynical. Birkin <b>felt</b> afraid, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> dared not realise. And Mrs Crich moved away, forgetting him. But she {{returned}} on her traces.|$|R
60|$|And Headley, poor fool, <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> happy <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had found}} a gold mine.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} Peggy, {{standing}} on the bottom stair, and back again at the envelope in his hand. His mood was changing with a violence that left him physically weak. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> dazed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had wakened out of a trance.|$|R
2500|$|Sheena {{recorded}} the demos of her compositions songs with guitarist Ryosuke Nagaoka, {{who would later}} join Tokyo Jihen as their second guitarist in 2005. During the pre-production stages of the album, H Zetto M also gave Sheena a collection of demos he had composed for her. [...] "Gunjō Biyori" [...] was the first song present, and after listening Sheena <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had written the song specifically for Sheena, and everything she was experiencing.|$|E
2500|$|Gable was {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tarzan in Tarzan the Ape Man, but lost out to Johnny Weissmuller's more imposing physique and superior swimming prowess. However, Gable's unshaven lovemaking with braless Jean Harlow in Red Dust (1932) soon made him MGM's most important male star. After the hit Hold Your Man (1933), MGM recognized the goldmine of the Gable-Harlow pairing, putting them in two more films, China Seas (1935; with Gable and Harlow billed above Wallace Beery) and Wife vs. Secretary (1936) with Myrna Loy and James Stewart. An enormously popular combination, on-screen and off-screen, Gable and Harlow made six films together, the most notable being Red Dust (1932) and Saratoga (1937). Harlow died during production of Saratoga. Ninety percent completed, the remaining scenes were filmed with long shots or the use of doubles like Mary Dees; Gable said that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were [...] "in the arms of a ghost".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1989 {{interview}} with radio host Timothy White, Townshend apparently acknowledged his bisexuality, referencing the song [...] "Rough Boys" [...] on his 1980 album, Empty Glass. He called the song a [...] "coming out, {{an acknowledgment of}} the fact that I'd had a gay life, and that I understood what gay sex was about." [...] However, in a 1994 interview for Playboy, he said, [...] "I did an interview about it, saying that [...] "Rough Boys" [...] was about being gay, and in the interview I also talked about my [...] "gay life," [...] which—I meant—was actually about the friends I've had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the t's and crossed the i's and assumed that this was a coming out, which it wasn't at all." [...] Townshend later wrote in his 2012 autobiography Who I Am that he at one point <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "probably bisexual". Townshend also stated jokingly that he once felt sexually attracted to The Rolling Stones lead singer, Mick Jagger.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{tired of}} it," [...] said Pony; {{but when he}} put his mother off that way <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> badly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had told her a lie, and he let Trip come with him and began to train him again the next day.|$|R
60|$|Then Ma {{glared at}} the smiling Josiah, who {{instantly}} <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> guilty <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been caught stealing sheep red-handed.|$|R

2500|$|Vase with Zinnias and Geraniums (F241) {{reflects}} {{the influence of}} Adolphe Monticelli (1824–1886) in its vivid color and impasto paint. [...] Van Gogh admired, and later collected, Monticelli's work. [...] Van Gogh had been introduced by his brother Theo to Monticelli's still life work with flowers in Paris. [...] He admired Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast. [...] Secondly he admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint called [...] "impasto". It was partially Monticelli, from Marseilles, who inspired Van Gogh's southerly move to Provence in 1888. [...] He felt such kinship for the man, and desire to emulate his style, that {{he wrote in a}} letter to his sister Wil that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were [...] "Monticelli's son or his brother." [...] The first owner in the provenance of this painting is [...] "C.M. van Gogh Gallery, Amsterdam, The Netherlands", which was owned by Van Gogh's uncle and an art dealer, Cornelius Marinus van Gogh (1824–1908).|$|E
2500|$|All 17 of {{the songs}} for the Kyōiku era were {{recorded}} {{over a period of}} four days. The song features lyrics by Sheena set to a melody composed by then band pianist H Zetto M. It was one of three songs from Kyōiku to be written in this style, the other two being [...] "Genjitsu ni Oite" [...] and [...] "Service". The single's B-sides include a cover of the 1937 standard [...] "The Lady Is a Tramp", and [...] "Kao", a duet between Sheena and then guitarist Mikio Hirama, who wrote the song's music. Sheena stated that it had been [...] "a dream of sorts" [...] to release music that collaborated with a variety of songwriters. The single's song lengths are all palindromic, much like Sheena's album Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana (2003). Pianist H Zetto M gave Sheena a collection of demos before recording sessions started, and [...] "Gunjō Biyori" [...] was the first song present. Sheena <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had written the song specifically for Sheena, and everything she was experiencing. [...] "Kao" [...] was a song Hirama initially gave Sheena during the Sugoroku Tour, though she felt she could not sing it. Eventually, the idea of singing the song as a duet was created, meaning the song became feasible.|$|E
2500|$|Band vocalist and {{songwriter}} Ichiro Yamaguchi had difficulty finalising [...] "Endless", feeling {{dissatisfied with the}} lyrics. He felt that releasing music {{was an act of}} pointing at yourself; stating to everyone that you are a certain type of person. Considering this, he wanted to create a song that directly reflected his inner feelings perfectly, but felt that he needed new lyrical techniques to do so. Yamaguchi <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> relied on his pre-existing lyrical techniques such as wordplay, the lyrics would not truly express his ideas. Eventually, he rewrote the song 74 times, creating a total of 78 different versions of the song lyrics. While Yamaguchi struggled actualising [...] "Endless", the band worked on the other compositions included in Documentaly, returning to [...] "Endless" [...] each time. Yamaguchi focused on [...] "Endless", acting as the driving force for the song's creation, and had little input on the production of the other songs on Documentaly. He felt that the song's [...] "groove" [...] was an extremely important part of the song, so discussed the song at length with the band's drummer Keiichi Ejima. Yamaguchi utilised a technique where he slowly added a progression of instruments to the song, which he believed would control the emotional sentiment. During the trial and error process, Yamaguchi removed an entire section of the song's melody, {{in order to make the}} composition simpler.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, on Saturday afternoon, {{at about}} two o'clock, Joe {{received}} a bolt from the blue--a telegram: 'Meet me Belbury Station 6.00 p.m. today. M.S.' He knew at once who M.S. was. His heart melted, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> weak <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had had a}} blow.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are other}} gentlemen here," [...] said Lambert, {{speaking}} with more firmness and decision {{now that he}} encountered inimical glances and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> somehow <b>he</b> was on his trial before all these people, [...] "and I am not rich enough to afford the luxury of gambling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sleeping {{like this}} keeps a fellow warm," [...] said Randy, who <b>felt</b> somehow <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was {{out for a}} lark. But by and by, when {{somebody}} passed over him {{in the dark and}} slipped on his chest, he did not think it quite so much fun.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don’t want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who’s better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" ...|$|E

60|$|Water was life. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> now <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{could run}} a mile, scale a ten-foot wall, sing a song. Only {{a few minutes}} ago he was next door to a corpse, done up, unable to stand, to lift a hand; unable to groan. A drop of water had done that miracle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Denham," [...] said Rodney. [...] "He {{was there}} last night too." [...] He spoke sternly. His whole manner had become full of authority. Katharine <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{accused her of}} some crime. She was pale and uncomfortably agitated, as much by the strangeness of Rodney's {{behavior}} as {{by the sight of}} Ralph Denham.|$|R

6000|$|... "You see? When he {{read the}} account of that {{accident}} in the paper this morning, and found a name so much like Northwick's among the victims, he was fearfully broken up, of course. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> somehow <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had caused his death--I could see that, though of course he wouldn't admit anything of the kind." ...|$|R
60|$|On the {{way home}} Ralph was in unusually good spirits, and talked much about Dora.
