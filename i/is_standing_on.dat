Presto tries to start the performance, but Alec becomes {{reluctant}} to cooperate until he is given the carrot. After Alec hits his master's hand on the podium he <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on,</b> Presto then spends {{the rest of the}} show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat.|$|E
5|$|In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Tom Ewell {{as a woman who}} becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In the shoot, Monroe <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E
25|$|The first Achewood strip ("Philippe <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> it") was {{released}} on October 1, 2001. Onstad has stated in multiple interviews that he was inspired to launch the strip {{by the events of}} September 11, 2001. The strip sets the tone for future strips with its nonsensical humor and flat visual punchline. In this particular strip, Mr. Bear and Téodor are discussing Téodor's confusion over a drum machine. Mr. Bear informs Téodor that there is an instruction manual. However, Philippe <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> it.|$|E

Mr. McArdle, apparently hung-over, is attempting to verbally assert control over his son; Mrs. McArdle indulges the boy as a provocative counterpoint to her husband’s bullying: neither adult has any real impact on the child's behavior.|$|E

25|$|In power {{transmission}} systems, {{one side of}} the circuit, known as the neutral, is grounded to dissipate static electricity and to reduce hazardous voltages caused by insulation failure and other electrical faults. It is possible to get a shock by only touching the hot wire, due to the person's body being capacitively coupled to the ground upon which the person stands, even if the person <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> an insulated surface.|$|E
25|$|In {{the scene}} where Jesus is in {{discussion}} with lawyers in the temple, Jesus <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a pedestal {{as was the case}} at Pleyben. This helps to underline his ascendancy. At Plougonven, there are four lawyers, two on each side of Jesus whilst at Pleyben there were just two, one each side of Jesus. At Plougonven the sculpture of this scene was divided between the two Prigent brothers, Bastien sculpted the figure of Jesus, Henry the rest.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, one of {{the last}} {{photographs}} ever taken of Mannock was discovered in Northern France.

25|$|Early one morning, a room-service waiter at a New York City {{hotel is}} horrified to {{discover}} that the young man to whom he has just delivered breakfast (Basehart) <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the narrow ledge outside his room on the 15th floor. Charlie Dunnigan (Douglas), a policeman on traffic duty in the street below, tries to talk him off the ledge to no avail. He is ordered back to traffic patrol by police emergency services deputy chief Moksar (Da Silva), but he is ordered to return when the man on the ledge will not speak to psychiatrists summoned to the scene. Coached by a psychiatrist (Martin Gabel), Dunnigan tries to relate to the man on the ledge as one human to another.|$|E
25|$|A common {{variant of}} the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this {{depiction}} at Taq-e Bostan, a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of Ardashir I or II. The figure <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a lotus, with a baresman in hand and with a gloriole around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly {{thought to be a}} depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of Mithra. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in Raphael's 1509 The School of Athens. In it, Zoroaster and Ptolemy are having a discussion in the lower right corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe.|$|E
25|$|He {{could also}} alter his {{personal}} mono-directional gravity field beneath himself {{to make himself}} virtually immovable {{as long as he}} was in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on.</b> The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the Hulk, Juggernaut, and Strong Guy (powered-up near his limit by absorbing kinetic energy), although Colossus has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability. Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob's feet via metal pipes. Despite his appearance, the Blob's speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.|$|E

25|$|Jumping spiders are {{generally}} diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering {{the pressure of}} body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or 'dragline') to whatever it <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> to protect itself if the jump should fail. Should it fall, for example if the prey shakes it off, it climbs back up the silk tether. Some species, such as Portia, will actually let themselves down to attack prey such as a web spider apparently secure {{in the middle of}} its web. Like many other spiders that leave practically continuous silk trails, jumping spiders impregnate the silk line with pheromones that play a role in social and reproductive communication, and possibly in navigation.|$|E
25|$|Mario's primary {{attack is}} jumping {{on top of}} enemies, though many enemies have differing {{responses}} to this. For example, a Goomba will flatten and be defeated, while a Koopa Troopa will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario {{to use it as}} a projectile. These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him. Another attack, for enemies standing overhead, is to jump up and hit beneath the brick that the enemy <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on.</b> Another is the Fire Flower; when picked up, this item changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs, or only upgrades Mario to Super Mario if he has not already. A less common item is the Starman, which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily invincible to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.|$|E
500|$|The artwork for The Blackening was {{designed}} by Robb Flynn, longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown, and Deanna Alcorn. Based on a metal carving in the 16th century, these carvings were used to scare people about going to Hell and for propaganda purposes. It features a skeleton on a throne that <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> top of the world, and the words [...] "The mirror which flatters not." [...] Flynn thought [...] "this whole record is like holding up a mirror to ourselves. It's talking {{about things that are}} going on now, but it's not necessarily specific to this time." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] was {{directed}} by Rupert James, produced by Tim Bevan, and edited by Brian Grant and Nick Morris. [...] The video features the Thompson Twins in a set with a blue background. [...] Each member <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a platform, singing or playing a different instrument, a guitar or a piano for Bailey, a Marimba or another percussion instrument for Currie, and a bass guitar or congas for Leeway. [...] The video is heavily edited, with frames sliding from the sides, doubling or tripling, split-screen edits, and close-ups of the band while singing or dancing. [...] At the end the background changes from blue to red, and the three members are featured together singing and clapping while the song is fading out.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} ending {{was similar}} in style {{to the previous}} Batman films, which had involved a scene with Alfred in the limousine, the camera tracking upward through the Gotham cityscape, followed by a rooftop shot involving a silhouetted hero (Batman in the original, Catwoman in Batman Returns) facing the Bat Signal. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham she asks him [...] "Does it ever end, Alfred?" [...] Alfred replies, [...] "No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime..." [...] The Bat-Signal shines on the night sky and Batman <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit {{of the first half}} of the scene appears on the special edition DVD, but not in its entirety.|$|E
