Senior combat {{designer}} Derek Daniels {{said that for}} God of War II, they were basing the magical attacks on elements (e.g., air and earth). He said the combat system was updated so that it flowed smoothly between attacks and switching between weapons and magic. He {{said that they were}} working for a similar balance of puzzle solving, exploration, and combat seen in the first game, and they used elements that worked in that game as a base for the overall balance. Unlike God of War where magic had a small role, Daniels said that for God of War II, their goal was to make magic {{an integral part of the}} combat system and to make it more refined. Barlog said the game would feature new creatures and heroes from the mythology, and he wanted to put more boss battles in it. Commenting on multiplayer options, Barlog said that [...] "there are possibilities for that but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> we are doing right now." [...] He said that he felt that God of War is a single-player experience, and although multiplayer [...] "would be cool," [...] it did not appeal to him to work on. As for a PlayStation Portable (PSP) installment, he said that he thought it [...] "would be freaking awesome," [...] but not something he had time to work on and it was Sony's decision whether or not to make a PSP installment.|$|E

2500|$|A draft report, {{published}} on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, {{saying that the}} long-term health effects on the population were still unknown {{and that there was}} insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination.

2500|$|For three months, UN officials, the CDC, {{and others}} argued against {{investigating}} {{the source of}} the outbreak. Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said finding the cause of the outbreak was [...] "not important". [...] "Right now, there is no active investigation. I cannot say one way or another [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> we are thinking about at the moment. What we are thinking about is the public health response in Haiti." [...] Jordan Tappero, the lead epidemiologist at the CDC, said the main task was to control the outbreak, not to look for {{the source of the}} bacteria and that [...] "we may never know the actual origin of this cholera strain." [...] A CDC spokesperson, Kathryn Harben, added that [...] "at some point in the future, when many different analyses of the strain are complete, {{it may be possible to}} identify the origin of the strain causing the outbreak in Haiti." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Protestants, however, {{reject the}} {{position}} that contraceptive use {{is a matter of}} conscience. Although some Quiverfull adherents accept that birth control use is a matter of individual conscience, other such adherents may argue that the Bible commands their position for all Christians. For example, David Crank, publisher of Unless The Lord Magazine, states, [...] "The 'Quiverfull' approach is universal in the sense that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> unusual that only a few are called to. Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and it was the way most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century." [...] Charles D. Provan additionally argues:"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.|$|E

2500|$|Williams, {{a scholar}} of the Church Fathers and an {{historian}} of Christian spirituality, wrote in 1983 that orthodoxy should be seen [...] "as a tool rather than an end in itself..." [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> which stands still. Thus [...] "old styles come under increasing strain, new speech needs to be generated". He sees orthodoxy {{as a number of}} [...] "dialogues": a constant dialogue with Christ, crucified and risen; but also that of the community of faith with the world – [...] "a risky enterprise", as he writes. [...] "We ought to be puzzled", he says, [...] "when the world is not challenged by the gospel." [...] It may mean that Christians have not understood the kinds of bondage to which the gospel is addressed. He has also written that [...] "orthodoxy is inseparable from sacramental practice... The eucharist is the paradigm of that dialogue which is 'orthodoxy'". This stance may help to explain both his social radicalism and his view {{of the importance of the}} Church, and thus of the holding together of the Anglican communion over matters such as homosexuality: his belief in the idea of the Church is profound.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, writers Robert Parkin and Linda Stone {{published}} the book Kinship and Family: An Anthropological Reader, a representative collection tracing {{the history of}} the anthropological study of kinship from the early 1900s to the present day. In their study, one of the topics Parkin and Stone analyzed was how in today's soap opera medium, a family consisting of a husband and wife living with their biological children is now [...] "exceedingly rare" [...] and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that is expected anymore on daytime dramas to create the [...] "ideal" [...] family. In their chapter Kinship In The American Soap Opera, Parkin and Stone presented the Tad and Dixie marriage as the prime example. Studied was how JR (biological son of Adam and Dixie) and Jamie (Tad's biological son with ex-wife Brooke English) lived with Tad and Dixie. Tad shared custody with Brooke, which pleased everyone. He was and an ideal stepfather to JR, despite the fact that JR's other father, Adam, is Tad's archenemy. Likewise, Dixie was an ideal stepmother to Jamie. Parkin and Stone reasoned that [...] "in this family, there are biological connections with children, but these are not shared between husband and wife. On today's soaps, this is as good as it gets. Tad and Dixie are happy to have created a family and they do not long to create biogenetic children together".|$|E
2500|$|In this passage, Aristotle {{explained}} that concerning these koina (such as movement) {{we already have}} a sense, a [...] "common sense" [...] or sense of the common things (Greek: koinē aisthēsis), which does not work by accident (Greek: kata sumbebēkos). And there is no specific (idia) sense perception for movement and other koina, because then we would not perceive the koina at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. [...] explains that [...] "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident. Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have [...] "some one thing" [...] that can distinguish black from sweet. The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; Greek: sēmeion) of what the specialist senses have perceived. The common sense is therefore also where a type of consciousness originates, [...] "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.|$|E

He said the experience was too demanding and claimed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the other people involved that [...] "saved" [...] the film, and added that he never wants to direct again.|$|R
50|$|The Allotment era {{resulted}} {{in the loss of}} over two-thirds of tribally entrusted lands from 138 million acres (558,000 km²) in 1871 to 48 million acres (190,000 km²) in 1934. This was mainly due to leasing, and eventually selling, tribal lands to white settlers. Allotment did <b>not</b> work, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> Indians <b>were</b> used to. They did not view the land as something to own. Instead, they viewed it as their home.|$|R
5000|$|Jurchens, the {{predecessors}} of the Manchus, {{were influenced}} by the Buddhism of Balhae, Goryeo, Liao and Song in the 10-13th centuries, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> new to the rising Manchus in the 16-17th centuries.

60|$|This is {{the first}} {{principle}} of democracy: that the essential things in men are the things they hold in common, not the things they hold separately. And the second principle is merely this: that the political instinct or desire {{is one of these}} things which they hold in common. Falling in love is more poetical than dropping into poetry. The democratic contention is that government (helping to rule the tribe) is a thing like falling in love, and not a thing like dropping into poetry. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> analogous to playing the church organ, painting on vellum, discovering the North Pole (that insidious habit), looping the loop, being Astronomer Royal, and so on. For these things we do not wish a man to do at all unless he does them well. It is, on the contrary, a thing analogous to writing one's own love-letters or blowing one's own nose. These things we want a man to do for himself, even if he does them badly. I am not here arguing the truth of any of these conceptions; I know that some moderns are asking to have their wives chosen by scientists, and they may soon be asking, for all I know, to have their noses blown by nurses. I merely say that mankind does recognize these universal human functions, and that democracy classes government among them. In short, the democratic faith is this: that the most terribly important things must be left to ordinary men themselves--the mating of the sexes, the rearing of the young, the laws of the state. This is democracy; and in this I have always believed.|$|E
