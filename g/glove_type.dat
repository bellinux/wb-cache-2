40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the puncture resistance of a recently introduced non-latex, nitrile dental glove {{in comparison with}} a latex glove worn during routine clinical dental procedures. SETTING: Dentists in general dental practice working within the UK during 1999. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 2, 020 gloves worn by five general dental practitioners were examined for punctures following standard clinical use by a water inflation method. Procedures undertaken during glove usage and length of time worn were recorded. RESULTS: Following clinical use, 1. 9 % of the latex gloves and 5. 3 % of the nitrile gloves had punctures, {{a statistically significant difference}} (P less than 0. 0001). The puncture resistance of the nitrile gloves was superior to the puncture resistance of previously tested worn non-latex (vinyl) gloves. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference between operators for the percentage or incidence of punctured gloves (P = 0. 787) after correcting for <b>glove</b> <b>type.</b> No statistically significant difference was noted between incidence of puncture in the control, unused gloves (n = 200 for each type) and the gloves examined following clinical use (P = 0. 907 for nitrile, P = 0. 613 for latex).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of different <b>glove</b> <b>types</b> on mobility performance in a series of field tests specific to wheelchair rugby. Design: Ten international wheelchair rugby players performed three drills in each glove condition: (i) players' current glove selection, (ii) American football glove, (iii) building glove, and (iv) new prototype glove. Performance was assessed by a combination of outcomes including test times, peak velocities, and accelerations within each drill. Peak velocities and accelerations were measured using a velocometer sampling at 100 Hz. Results: A two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed that participants performed statistically better for measures of acceleration and sprinting when wearing their current choice of glove compared with the new prototype glove (P < 0. 05). Subjective data identified that players also favored their current gloves compared with others, although slight discrepancies were evident among classification levels concerning the building gloves. Building gloves seemed to be less suited to low-point players because of the reduced grip and protection they provided.

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} for {{reduction}} in performance when gloves are donned is the lack of tactile sensitivity. It was argued that grasping force for a weight to be grasped will be a function of the weight to be lifted and the hand conditions. It was further reasoned that the differences in grasping force for various hand conditions will be a correlate of the tactile sensitivity of the corresponding hand conditions. The objective of this experiment, therefore, was {{to determine the effects of}} <b>glove</b> <b>type,</b> pressure, and weight of load on the initial grasping force and stable grasping force. It was hypothesized that when a person grasps an object, he/she grasps very firmly initially and then releases the grasp slightly after realizing what force is needed to maintain a steady grasp. This would seem to be particularly true when a person is wearing a glove and has lost some tactile sensitivity and force feedback during the grasp. Therefore, the ratio of initial force and stable force and the stable force itself would represent the amount of tactile adjustment that is made when picking up an object, and this adjustment should vary with the use of gloves. A dynamometer was fabricated to measure the grasping force; the tests were performed inside a glove box. Four female and four male subjects participated in the study, which measured the effects of four variables: load effect, gender effect, <b>glove</b> <b>type,</b> and pressure variance. The only significant effects on the peak and stable force were caused by gender and the weight of the load lifted. Neither gloves nor pressure altered these forces when compared to a bare-handed condition, as was suspected before the test. It is possible that gloves facilitate in holding due to coefficient of friction while they deter in peak grasp strength...|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} in the occurrence of latex allergy has been concurrent with {{the increasing use of}} latex gloves by laboratory and healthcare workers. In recent years nitrile gloves have been used to replace latex gloves to prevent latex allergy. Nitrile gloves offer a comparable level of protection against chemical and biological agents and are more puncture resistant. However, if manual dexterity is compromised by nitrile gloves to a greater degree than latex then this may increase the risk of sharps injuries. The Purdue pegboard test, which measures both gross and fine finger dexterity, was used to test the dexterity levels of two <b>glove</b> <b>types</b> used at HPA CEPR; Kimberly-Clark SafeSkin nitrile and latex laboratory gloves. There was a statistically signi-ficant 8. 6 % {{increase in}} fine finger dexterity provided by latex compared with nitrile SafeSkin laboratory gloves but no difference in gross dexterity between the <b>glove</b> <b>types.</b> There was no significant relationship between glove dexterity and age or gender. The selection of glove size was influenced by the digit length of participants. Moreover, those with longer, thinner fingers appeared to have an advantage when using nitrile SafeSkin gloves. The level of dexterity provided by latex and nitrile SafeSkin gloves for tasks on a gross dexterity level are comparable and health workers will benefit from the non-allergenic properties of nitrile. For tasks requiring fine finger dexterity nitrile SafeSkin gloves may impede dexterity. Despite this, the degree of restriction appears to have a negligible impact on safety in this study when compared with the risk of latex sensitization and subsequent allergy. In addition to glove material, working prac-tices must also take into account glove size, fit, grip and thickness, as these factors can all influence dexterity...|$|R

40|$|A new {{roughness}} perception {{test was}} designed to evaluate cutaneous sensibility. Blindfolded subjects explored a sample of sandpaper using one of two methods: stroking the sample (dynamic method) or applying pressure (static method). A range of samples of various grades were presented in a random order, and subjects scored each one in terms of perceived roughness. Each subject performed the test in three conditions – wearing latex and nitrile examination gloves and bare-handed. Mean normalised scores for each combination of sandpaper grade and hand condition were calculated. The coefficient of friction (COF) between each sample and glove (or bare finger) was measured, and the topography of each sample was analysed using a profilometer. It {{was found that the}} COF did not vary significantly across the samples, and so could not be related to perceived roughness. However, there were strong correlations between perceived roughness and surface topography (roughness average, particle diameter, particle spacing), particularly in the dynamic method. In the static method, most subjects did not perceive roughness differences below 800 [*]µm particle spacing. In both methods, there was a significant reduction in perceived roughness when gloves were donned, but {{no significant difference between the}} two <b>glove</b> <b>types</b> could be found.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{permeability}} of 13 different {{gloves to}} 13 cytotoxic agents under controlled dynamic conditions is described. METHODS: Thirteen cytotoxic agents were prepared {{at the highest}} concentrations normally encountered by pharmacy personnel. Four <b>glove</b> <b>types</b> [...] neoprene, natural rubber latex, nitrile, and vinyl [...] {{were exposed to the}} cytotoxic agents for 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Tests were conducted using the middle finger of each glove. Linearity, reproducibility, and sensitivity were evaluated for each drug tested. Assays were run using liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet light (HPLC-UV). Permeability testing was conducted using an original system designed to evaluate dynamic constraints, such as rubbing, stretching, and tension. RESULTS: Linearity by LC/MS/MS and HPLC-UV was confirmed at concentrations up to 1000 ng/mL for all drugs. Most glove materials were permeable at rates below ASTM recommendations over the one-hour testing period. Vinyl was the most permeable material. Carmustine permeated the widest variety of materials. Due to the high sensitivity of the analytic methods, all materials displayed low but significant permeability for at least one drug after one hour. Higher resistance to permeation was recorded for all neoprene, some natural rubber latex, and one nitrile glove. CONCLUSION: Neoprene, natural rubber latex, and nitrile gloves displayed the highest resistance to permeation of the 13 cytotoxic agents studied.

Methods: A total number of 1500 consecutively used pairs of examination gloves of two different brands and materials (latex and nitrile) were collected over a period of two months on two ICU’s. Used gloves were examined for micro perforations using the “water-proof-test” according to EN 455 – 1. Cox-regression for both <b>glove</b> <b>types</b> was used to estimate optimal changing intervals. Results: Only 26 % of gloves were worn longer than 15 min.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Construction {{workers are}} at risk of {{developing}} occupational contact dermatitis. Gloves, when used properly, may protect against chemicals and coarse materials. We investigated the prevalence and determinants of contact dermatitis in a population of Dutch construction workers and aimed at validating questionnaire items on hand hygiene. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at 13 construction sites, yielding data of 177 subjects (95 % response rate). A questionnaire covering questions on hand hygiene and contact dermatitis symptoms was used. Agreement between workplace observations and a number of questionnaire items was assessed by calculating Cohen's kappa. Log-binomial regression analysis was used to assess the association between contact dermatitis and various hand hygiene-related determinants. RESULTS: The 1 -year prevalence of self-reported contact dermatitis in our study sample was 46. 9 %. Multiple regression analysis showed a positive association with difficulties with hand cleaning (prevalence ratio [PR]: 1. 26, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 05 - 1. 52), hand contamination {{at the end of the}} working day (PR: 2. 30, 95 % CI: 1. 14 - 4. 65), and intensive hand cream use (PR: 2. 07, 95 % CI: 1. 42 - 3. 01).
