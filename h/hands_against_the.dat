5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E
25|$|In the bible, David {{refuses to}} harm King Saul, {{because he is}} the Lord's anointed, even when Saul is seeking his life. And when Saul {{eventually}} is killed in battle and a person comes to David to tell him that he helped kill Saul, David puts the man to death, even though Saul had been his enemy, because he had raised his <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Lord's anointed. Christian concepts of the inviolability of the person of the monarch have great influence from this story. Diarmait mac Cerbaill, King of Tara (mentioned above), was killed by Áed Dub mac Suibni in 565. According to Adomnan of Iona's Life of St Columba, Áed Dub mac Suibni received God's punishment for this crime by being impaled by a treacherous spear many years later and then falling from his ship into a lake and drowning.|$|E
25|$|In the 5th century, {{control of}} Valentia {{passed from the}} Romans to the Alans and other barbarians: in 413, the Goths under Ataulf besieged and {{captured}} {{the brother of the}} usurper Jovinus, Sebastianus, at Valentia on behalf of the emperor Honorius. In 440, Alans led by Sambida were given deserted lands in Valentia by the Romans. Three years later, Aetius settled the Burgundians in the region, which became part of their kingdom until 534. The city then fell successively under the power of the Franks, the Arabs of Spain, the sovereigns of Arles, the emperors of Germany, the counts of Valentinois, the counts of Toulouse, as well as its own bishops, who struggled to retain the control of the city they had won in the fifth century. These bishops were often in conflict with the citizens and the counts of Valentinois and to strengthen their <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> latter the pope in 1275 united their bishopric with that of Die.|$|E

He explained that when leaders pump up their followers by promising them utopian visions, and then fail to deliver on those promises, followers take action into their own hands. He expressed his concern that disappointed followers of Trump will [...] "end up joining fascist or far-right groups" [...] and take {{matters into their own}} <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> eight million Muslims in the United States".|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Israeli {{historian}} Benny Morris {{reviewed the}} Tantura controversy. He suggests that, while controversy remains {{as to whether}} a ‘massacre’ actually occurred, {{there is no doubt}} that war crimes were committed by the Jewish forces (Haganah) and that the village was forcibly cleansed of its Arab inhabitants. Morris underlines the fact that in interviews conducted by himself and by the whistle-blower Amil Gilat, all refugees confirmed that a massacre had taken place, while all IDF veterans denied it. Regarding the latter, Morris describes what he calls “troubling hints”, such as a diary by an Alexandroni soldier, Tulik Makovsky, in which he wrote “… that our boys know the craft of murder quite well, especially boys whose relatives the Arabs had murdered... or those harmed by Hitler [...] They took their private revenge, and avenged our comrades who had died at their <b>hands,</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> snipers”. Morris defended the value of oral testimony and tradition. He additionally pointed out issues with the scoring of the second version of Katz’s thesis in that the two referees who gave anomalously low scores had been co-authors of an IDF book in which it was argued that ”… the Israeli Army had carried out only a ‘partial expulsion’ of the populations of the Arab towns of Lydda and Ramlah and dismissed the charge that the troops had massacred Lydda townspeople, some of them inside a mosque, on July 12, 1948”, whereas IDF records from the IDF archive show that a full-scale expulsion had been carried out and that Yiftah Brigade troops killed some 250 townspeople.|$|E
