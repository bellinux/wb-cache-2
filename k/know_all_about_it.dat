[...] I have but {{to lift the}} {{alabaster}} box of precious ointment, and up leaps the genuine Manx perfume, so that the house {{is filled with the}} savour thereof. [...] Whether it's the blood in you, or the poet and diviner, you <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> you need not that any should tell you concerning Man. for you know what is Man, and that in two senses.|$|E
2500|$|In her review, Pauline Kael {{noted that}} [...] "the decisive {{change in the}} characters' lives which the story hinges on takes place {{suddenly}} and hardly makes sense."

6000|$|... "It is his proposition, Margaret." [...] Then she <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{and felt}} great relief. Then she <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{and let him}} go on till he had spoken his speech.|$|R
60|$|The Archbishop's {{blue eyes}} twinkled. Dan {{saw that he}} <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|But Phineas Duge already <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He {{smiled when}} Virginia brought him her news.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's {{something}} wrong, and you <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Why didn't {{the people}} come?' Miles, looking guilty, {{did not even}} attempt to deny his knowledge. 'Come; what is it? We might as well <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at once.' Miles looked down on the ground, and grunted something. 'Is it about the election?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right; I {{will soon}} show {{you all about}} it; and I wouldn't play, if I were you, till you <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Perhaps, after you <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> you'll think it wiser not to play at all At least, you might well think so abroad, where very fishy things are often done. Here it's all right, of course." ...|$|E

60|$|DICK. You do look so sweet! Oh, Joy, I'll comfort you, I'll {{take it all}} on myself. I <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'The governor,--that's my father,--he {{had heard}} of Mr. Seely. I wrote first as he told me. They <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at Pollington {{as well as you}} do.' ...|$|R
60|$|Oom Coetzee {{shook his}} head with the air of one who <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and then turned an {{attentive}} ear to Silas Croft's version of Jantje's story.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Tom, do cheer up. It {{is nothing}} to be in such {{distress}} at. Papa <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and while he does, I don't care half so much." ...|$|R
