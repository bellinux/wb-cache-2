5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains.

By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that <b>had</b> <b>high</b> alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the insular nature of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|It is also widely {{believed}} that birth rates fell {{during the period}} too, meaning that {{the growth rate of}} the population fell relative to the natural death rate. Vansina, however, notes that precolonial societies <b>had</b> <b>high</b> birth and death rates, leading to a great deal of natural population fluctuation over time. Among the Kuba, the period 1880 to 1900 was actually one of population expansion.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the Blue Cross Foundation {{found that}} there are four types of {{communities}} that can be identified based on their risk of uninsurance: entrenched-risk, unexpected-risk, resilient, and low-risk.

Unexpected-risk communities <b>have</b> <b>high</b> uninsurance but were not expected to based on their geographical locations, like Cape Cod or Boston.

5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft.

5|$|The {{expedition}} originally <b>had</b> <b>high</b> {{expectations of}} encountering a densely populated region that would quickly submit to Spanish rule, with the natives being parcelled out in encomienda to the conquistadores, effectively as slave labour.

Chamula was given to Bernal Díaz, and Zinacantan was given to Francisco de Marmolejo.|$|E
5|$|The game <b>had</b> <b>high</b> sales, selling 400,000 {{copies in}} its first week of release and 700,000 {{by the end of}} 1999.

Critics gave considerable acclaim to its vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics and soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura, but were critical of the lack of a clear main storyline, stating that it left the game feeling disjointed. The game was re-released as a part of both the PlayStation's and Square Enix's best-sellers lines. It was released as a PSOne Classic in Japan and North America.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews and}} sales estimates ranged from subpar to par.

Reviewers found the story and Kameo's character lackluster, but largely liked the other characters and the core morphing concept. They <b>had</b> <b>high</b> praise for the orchestral score and other technical features, apart from the game's camera. Rare released several cosmetic downloadable content packs, and a free online cooperative mode upgrade.|$|E
