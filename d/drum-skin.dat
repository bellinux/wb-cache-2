2500|$|It is {{currently}} {{not unusual for}} the rim of a bodhran to be covered with electrical tape, either by the drum-maker or the owner. This both reduces [...] "edge-loading" [...] (where the vibrations in the skin hit the rim and bounce back {{toward the center of}} the drum), and dampens unwanted overtones, allowing for greater control of the drum's sound. Electrical tape is preferred because the adhesive is rubber-based and will stretch with the skin even after bonding to it, lessening the likelihood of bubbles and other changes in the tape occurring when the skin tension is changed by tuning or atmospheric conditions. Owners of lower quality drums, with thick and rough skins, may also choose to sand the skin very lightly to reduce the rasp when the tipper strikes the face of the drum. Many effects of these and other modifications to the <b>drum-skin,</b> especially high quality skins, can also be achieved through regular use of the drum over time.|$|E
60|$|Instead {{of going}} up to him, {{she sat down on}} the corded trunk and began to sob. It was the sobbing of a child whose school-treat has been cancelled, of a girl whose ball-dress has not come home in time. It only irritated Hilary, whose nerves had already borne all they could bear. He stood {{literally}} trembling, as though each one of these common little sobs were a blow falling on the <b>drum-skin</b> of his spirit; and through every fibre he took in the features of the dusty, scent-besprinkled room--the brown tin trunk, the dismantled bed, the rust-red doors.|$|E
50|$|He {{tells them}} he {{arranged}} for the two men to be arrested by friends, so they could safely take the <b>drum-skin</b> to London: it bears information about deeds giving title to Averna. He identifies a necklace of Aunt Hattie's as the ancient crown of Averna, and gives everyone instructions to go to Dr Galley's house and flee by boat when they get his signal. When he hears some stories about Galley from Amanda, he realises the old man is insane and plans to kill his guests. Campion and Amanda rush to Galley's house, arriving {{just in time to}} stop him drugging everyone, and Campion heads off on his mission.|$|E
