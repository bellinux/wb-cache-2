5|$|The crew of EO-19 {{conducted}} {{their first}} Extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, on July 14. Before the mission, {{the crew had}} trained to use special tools in order to release a stuck solar array on {{the exterior of the}} Spektr module. During the spacewalk, the pair cut a problematic restraint from the solar array. All but one section of the array deployed successfully. They then proceeded to inspect a <b>docking</b> <b>mechanism</b> in preparation for the relocation of the Kristall module. The final task of the spacewalk was to inspect a solar array on Kristall that was not tracking the Sun properly. The excursion ended after five hours and thirty-four minutes outside the station.|$|E
25|$|Kliper's {{design was}} {{another attempt to}} solve the {{geometric}} problems of spacecraft. Soyuz has an Orbital Module, a hollow sphere, {{to be used for}} eating and hygiene, and an airlock located above the Reentry module (the capsule), with the <b>docking</b> <b>mechanism</b> at the top. In the event of an emergency, it would be lifted away from the rocket along with the reentry module, and the fairing over the spacecraft was designed to successfully split apart either circumferentially just below the reentry module in such an emergency or longitudinally if the flight should be successful. Kliper was designed with the Orbital Module below its reentry module, and the <b>docking</b> <b>mechanism</b> below that. This was made possible by constructing a reentry module broader than the orbital module, so that a pair of rocket nozzles for orbital maneuvering could have been fitted alongside it, as the later Salyut space stations had.|$|E
50|$|The International Berthing and <b>Docking</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (IBDM) is the European {{androgynous}} {{low impact}} <b>docking</b> <b>mechanism</b> that {{is capable of}} docking and berthing large and small spacecraft.

40|$|The {{development}} of a real-time man-in-the-loop berthing simulator is in progress at NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) to conduct a parametric study and to measure forces during contact conditions of the actual <b>docking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the Space Station Freedom and the orbiter. In berthing, the docking ports of the Space Station and the orbiter are brought together using the orbiter robotic arm to control the relative motion of the vehicles. The berthing simulator consists of a dynamics docking test system (DDTS), computer system, simulator software, and workstations. In the DDTS, the Space Station, and the orbiter <b>docking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are mounted on a six-degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) table and a fixed platform above the table. Six load cells are used on the fixed platform to measure forces during contact conditions of the <b>docking</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Two Encore Concept 32 / 9780 computers are used to simulate the orbiter robotic arm and to operate the berthing simulator. A systematic procedure for a real-time dynamic initialization is being developed to synchronize the Space Station docking port trajectory with the 6 DOF table movement. The berthing test can be conducted manually or automatically and can be extended for any two orbiting vehicles using a simulated robotic arm. The real-time operation of the berthing simulator is briefly described...|$|R

50|$|The terms Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS), Androgynous Peripheral Assembly System (APAS) and Androgynous Peripheral Docking System (APDS), {{are used}} interchangeably to {{describe}} a family of spacecraft <b>docking</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and are also sometimes used as a generic name for any docking system in that family.

5000|$|In the 1980s, SSVP {{was further}} {{upgraded}} to support docking of large modules, {{such as the}} ones that would be used to construct Mir. They were used to attach all pressurized modules of the Mir station, and for most spacecraft dockings (with the exception of the Space Shuttle flights, and Soyuz TM-16, which used the APAS-89 <b>docking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> located on Kristall and the Mir Docking Module.) ...|$|R

50|$|Co-developed by American and Soviet {{engineers}} {{though a}} series of in-person meetings, letters and teleconferences, APAS-75 was initially planned to be used on an American mission to a Salyut space station which instead became the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). There were differences between the American and Soviet version of the <b>docking</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{but they were still}} mechanically compatible. Early on, the Americans called the device both the International Rendezvous and Docking Mission (IRDM) <b>Docking</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and the International Docking System. The device is called the Androgynous Peripheral Docking System (APDS) in the NASA press packet for ASTP.|$|E
5000|$|The two {{craft of}} the Soyuz 7K-OKS {{generation}} were modified {{from the original}} Soyuz 7K-OK. The new [...] "probe and drogue" [...] <b>docking</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which was first used by these two missions, featured an internal docking hatch that allowed {{for the first time}} internal transfer between Soviet spacecraft. This [...] "probe and drogue" [...] <b>docking</b> <b>mechanism</b> introduced with Soyuz 7K-OKS is still in use today at the ISS. The external toroidal fuel tank, a holdover from the original lunar mission models of the Soyuz, was dropped from the 7K-OKS since it was unneeded for Earth orbital flights.|$|E
5000|$|A docking/berthing {{connection}} {{is referred to}} as either [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "hard". Typically, a spacecraft first initiates a soft dock by making contact and latching its docking connector with that of the target vehicle. Once the soft {{connection is}} secured, if both spacecraft are pressurized, they may proceed to a hard dock where the <b>docking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> airtightly seal together, enabling interior hatches to be safely opened so that crew and cargo can be transferred.|$|R
50|$|The Russian Segment of the ISS (RSOS) has the {{capability}} via the probe and cone <b>docking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to support propellant transfer. Incorporation of propellant transfer capability introduces international issues requiring {{the coordination of}} multiple corporate and governmental organizations. Since ISS propellant requirements are adequately provided for by the Russian Progress and ESA ATV, costs associated with incorporating these features can be avoided. However, the CPS’ modular nature coupled with the inherent capability of selected subsystems enables economical alternatives to propellant transfer should ISS needs require.|$|R

50|$|When the USSR {{started working}} on Mir they were also working on the Buran shuttle program. APAS-89 was envisioned to be the docking system for Buran with the Mir space station. The APAS-75 design was heavily modified. The outer {{diameter}} was reduced from 2030 mm to 1550 mm and the alignment petals were pointed inward instead of outward. This limited the internal passage diameter of the docking port to about 800 mm. The Buran shuttle was finally canceled in 1994 and never flew to the Mir space station, but Mir's Kristall module was outfitted with two APAS-89 <b>docking</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The Mir <b>Docking</b> Module, basically a spacer module between Kristall and the Shuttle, also used APAS-89 on both sides.|$|R
