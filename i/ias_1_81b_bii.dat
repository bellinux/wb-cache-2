40|$|Neurogenin 3 (Ngn 3) is key for {{endocrine}} {{cell specification}} in the embryonic pancreas and induction of a neuroendocrine cell differentiation program by misexpression in adult pancreatic duct cells. We identify the gene encoding <b>IA</b> <b>1,</b> a zinc-finger transcription factor, {{as a direct}} target of Ngn 3 and show that it forms a novel branch in the Ngn 3 -dependent endocrinogenic transcription factor network. During embryonic development of the pancreas, <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> and Ngn 3 exhibit nearly identical spatio-temporal expression patterns. However, embryos lacking Ngn 3 fail to express <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> in the pancreas. Upon ectopic expression in adult pancreatic duct cells Ngn 3 binds to chromatin in the <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> promoter region and activates transcription. Consistent with this direct effect, <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> expression is normal in embryos mutant for NeuroD 1, Arx, Pax 4 and Pax 6, regulators operating downstream of Ngn 3. <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> is an effector of Ngn 3 function as inhibition of <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> expression in embryonic pancreas decreases the formation of insulin- and glucagon-positive cells by 40 %, while its ectopic expression amplifies neuroendocrine cell differentiation by Ngn 3 in adult duct cells. <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> is therefore a novel Ngn 3 -regulated factor required for normal differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells...|$|R

Mice immunized with <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> - liposomes developed measurable serum antibodies to <b>IA</b> <b>1,</b> while mice immunized with <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> in Freund's adjuvant did not. mAbs produced by two stable hybridomas (10 G 6 and 5 F 11) from mice immunized with <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> - liposomes produced IgG antibody reactive with HA in ELISA. 10 G 6 {{had a much}} higher avidity for liposome-bound <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> than free <b>IA</b> <b>1,</b> while 5 F 11 did not, suggesting that the mode of presentation of <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> is important in HA immunogenicity and antigenicity.

However, ascorbic acid treatment significantly reduced the antigenicity of HA for mAb 5 F 11, but not 10 G 6. Only 10 G 6 was inhibited by glucuronic acid. Electrostatic forces appear {{to play a role in}} the binding site of 5 F 11, but not 10 G 6. 5 F 11 crossreacts with heparan sulfate and phosphorylcholine, while 10 G 6 did not crossreact with any glycosaminoglycans or phosphorylated compounds tested. These results confirm that HA is immunogenic. They suggest that the mode of presentation of HA is important for the induction of the immune response, and in HA antigenicity. At least two different antigenic sites on HA were demonstrated. 10 G 6 recognizes a terminal HA antigenic site expressed on <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> -liposomes that contains glucuronic acid in its immunodominant site. 5 F 11 recognizes an HA antigenic site in which electrostatic forces appear to play a role, is sensitive to ascorbic acid treatment, and is crossreactive with heparan sulfate.

Anti-peptide antibodies were successfully raised when the peptide was coupled through either its N- or its C-terminus to carrier protein, but no antibodies were produced against the so-called multiple peptide antigen, which consisted of eight copies of the peptide attached through its C-terminus to a synthetic base. Both of the anti-peptide antibodies bound specifically to cytochrome P 450 <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> in the rat, as shown by e. l. i. s. a. and immunoblotting. They inhibited microsomal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity and the mutagenic activation of 2 -acetylaminofluorene (these reactions are catalysed by cytochrome P 450 <b>IA</b> <b>1),</b> but not high-affinity phenacetin O-de-ethylation activity, which is catalysed by cytochrome P 450 IA 2. However, there was differences in {{the properties of the}} two antisera in their binding to cytochromes P 450 <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> in species other than the rat, their relative binding to the multiple peptide antigen, the yield of antibody following affinity purification using peptide coupled through its N-terminus to CNBr-activated Sepharose, and the binding of the purified preparations to N- and C-terminal-coupled peptide conjugates. These observations indicated that the antibodies were directed to the region of the peptide opposite to the end which was coupled to the carrier protein.

Upon binding of ligand, the receptor is converted to a form which specifically interacts in vitro with two dioxin-responsive positive control elements located {{in close proximity to}} each other about 1 kb upstream of the rat cytochrome P- 450 <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> gene transcription start point. In rat liver, the cytochrome P- 450 <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> gene is marked at the chromatin level by two DNase I-hypersensitive sites that map to the location of the response elements and exist prior to induction of transcription by the dioxin receptor ligand 0 -naphthoflavone. In addition, a DNase I-hypersensitive site is detected near the transcription initiation site and is altered in nuclease sensitivity by induction. The presence of the constitutive DNase I-hypersensitive sites at the dioxin response elements correlates with the presence of a constitutive, labile factor which specifically recognizes these elements in vitro. This factor appears to be distinct from the dioxin receptor, which is observed only in nuclear extract from treated cells.

This was most likely due to metabolism of BNF as exemplified {{by the fact that}} a P 450 <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> enzyme suicide-inhibitor, 1 -ethynylpyrene, could prolong the induc-tion response following a short BNF treatment. The TCDF induction of a reporter gene construct under the control of the- 1140 to + 2435 part of the CYPIA 1 gene transiently transfected into HK was effectively inhibited by the dioxin-receptor antagonist a-naphthoflavone (ANF).

A 7 P-G and A 7 P-A, two promoter haplotypes differing in a single nucleotide at rs 2851028, had different transcriptional activities and interacted with variants further upstream. A sequence located 12. 5 kb upstream (7 P 10) can function as an enhancer. These complex interactions indicate that the effects of variants in the ADH 7 regulatory elements depend on both sequence and cellular context, and should be considered in interpretation of the association of variants with alcoholism and cancer. The mechanisms governing the tissue-specific expression of ADH 7 remain unexplained however. We identified an intergenic region (<b>iA</b> <b>1</b> C), located between ADH 7 and ADH 1 C, having enhancer blocking activity in liver-derived HepG 2 cells. This enhancer blocking function was cell- and position- dependent with no activity seen in CP-A esophageal cells. <b>iA</b> <b>1</b> C had a similar effect on the ectopic SV 40 enhancer. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) bound <b>iA</b> <b>1</b> C in HepG 2 cells but not in CP-A cells. Our results suggest that in liver-derived cells, <b>iA</b> <b>1</b> C blocks the effects of downstream ADH enhancers and thereby contributes to the cell specificity of ADH 7 expression. Thus, while genetic factors determine level of ADH 7 transcriptional activity, <b>iA</b> <b>1</b> C helps determine the cell specificity of transcription...|$|R

It causes serious damage to potato leaves and tubers making the latter unfit for human consumption or use as seed. This pest can be combated when a Bacillus thuringiensis gene is expressed in potato. During this study Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to transfer the Bacillus thuringiensis gene, specifically the cry <b>1</b> <b>Ia</b> <b>1</b> gene, into the South African potato cultivar Mnandi. In vitro potato explants were used in the transformation study. The explants were cultured on the pre-culture medium with 50 μM acetosyringone, infected for 30 minutes with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens cell suspension and co-cultivated for two days. Stable gene integration of the cry <b>1</b> <b>Ia</b> <b>1</b> gene into these lines were analysed by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization procedures. The level of resistance to the potato tuber moth was investigated during leaf and tuber bio-assays. The Southern blot hybridization analysis verified that the cry <b>1</b> <b>Ia</b> <b>1</b> gene was inserted into the genome of six potato lines. Insect resistant ‘Mnandi’ could allow a reduction in the use of pesticides during cultivation and allow potato growers to lower the risk of potato tuber moth as a post harvest pest of stored potatoes...|$|R

Cyclophosphamide, tested up to a concentration of 2 mM, was not cytotoxic in V 79 nor in the P 450 <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> -expressing V 79 -derived cell line XEM 2. Pronounced cytotoxicity was, however, observed in the P 450 IIB 1 -expressing V 79 -derived cell line SD 1. Induction of gene mutations (acquisition of 6 -thioguanine resistance) was observed in SD 1 cells as well, but the effects were weak. Ifosfamide was inactive in V 79 cells, but was cytotoxic in SD 1 cells. Ifosfamide mustard, an active metabolite of ifosfamide, was equally cytotoxic and showed similar mutagenic effects in SD 1 and parental V 79 cells. The results indicate that cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are metabolically activated by cytochrome P 450 IIB 1. In contrast, cytochrome P 450 <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> was not capable of activating cyclophosphamide. Thus, V 79 -derived cell lines defined for their expression of a specific form of cytochrome P- 450 {{can be used as}} diagnostic tools to identify the cytochrome P- 450 that is responsible for the metabolic activation of drugs...|$|R

40|$|Patients with FIGO stage <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> {{squamous}} cell carcinoma of the cervix can be treated conservatively with simple hysterectomy or, if young and desiring to preserve their fertility, with conization only, provided surgical margins are free of dysplasia or invasive disease. When the surgical margins are involved a repeat conization should be performed. Patients with FIGO stage IA 2 or stage <b>IA</b> <b>1</b> carcinoma with extensive lymph vascular space invasion benefit from a modified radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. If preservation of fertility is an issue, then conization with extraperitoneal or laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy can be performed. Alternatively, radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy may be a safer procedure. Individualization of therapy based on an exhaustive pathological evaluation of an adequate cone biopsy specimen {{is of paramount importance}} for treatment planning and disease control...|$|R

40|$|An expeditious {{isolation}} {{method for}} the cembrane diterpene alcohols incensol (1 a) and serratol (2) {{has been developed}} from respectively African and Indian frankincense. The two native alcohols {{and a series of}} semisynthetic derivatives of incensol were evaluated for transient receptor potential vanilloid 3 (TRPV 3) activation and the inhibition of NF-κB, the putative molecular targets underlying the psychotropic and anti-inflammatory activities of incensol acetate (<b>IA,</b> <b>1</b> b). Serratol (2) was the most potent TRPV 3 activator, outperforming by 2 orders of magnitude the reference agonist thymol and by 1 order of magnitude incensol acetate (1 b). Acylation, epimerization, and oxidation did not significantly improve the affinity of incensol for TRPV 3, while NF-κB inhibition, marginal for both natural alcohols, could be improved by esterification of incensol (1 a) with lipophilic acids. Interestingly, incensol (1 a) but not <b>IA</b> (<b>1</b> b) was a potent inhibitor of STAT 3, raising the possibility that hydrolysis to incensol (1 a) might be involved in the in vivo biological activity of <b>IA</b> (<b>1</b> b). Serratol was not amenable to chemical modification, but some marine cembranoids related to the frankincense diterpenoids showed a certain degree of TRPV 3 -activating properties, qualifying the aliphatic macrocyclic cembrane skeleton as a selective chemotype to explore the pharmacology of TRPV 3, a thermo-TRP otherwise resistant to modulation by small molecules...|$|R
