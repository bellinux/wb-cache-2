5|$|His most {{successful}} <b>intruder</b> <b>operation</b> {{took place on}} the night of the 17/18 August 1943, when he participated in 100 Group's support of RAF Bomber Command's Operation Hydra. Braham had decided that it was best to employ the British night fighters in a freelance role. Instead of operating over known German airfields, he elected to interpose the Beaufighters between the outward bomber stream and German airfields in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. He hoped that the echoes made by the Beaufighters on the German Lichtenstein radar would attract enemy aircraft and divert them from the bombers.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{was awarded}} the first bar to his DSO on 24 September 1943. Four nights later, on the 28/29 September whilst {{carrying}} out an <b>intruder</b> <b>operation</b> between Celle and Hanover Braham encountered what he identified to be a Do 217 which engaged him in a dogfight. He downed the enemy aircraft which hit the ground and exploded. He then gained another contact on an enemy aircraft but could not quite catch it then witnessed a crash or explosion nearby. One source suggests {{the victim of the}} crash was German ace Hans-Dieter Frank (55 victories), flying a Heinkel He 219, who collided with another German fighter while trying to evade Braham. The very next night he claimed a Bf 110. His victim was identified as German ace August Geiger of IV/NJG 1 (53 victories). Geiger parachuted out of his fighter but drowned. Within minutes Braham fired on a Ju 88 which he claimed as damaged. Frank, Vinke and Geiger were the 17th, 18th and 19th most successful night fighter aces of the Second World War (and aerial warfare).|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians have}} claimed that had German <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> been {{maintained}} over Britain in 1941, and thereafter, the British night flying training program, which produced {{the nucleus of the}} huge bomber force that operated in 1944–45, could have been halted or disrupted. The decision not to continue <b>intruder</b> <b>operations,</b> in their view, allowed the British to build their bomber force virtually unhindered for over four years. A consequence of an effective German intruder campaign at this time may have given the Luftwaffe night fighter defences an unassailable lead in the night war, and may have stopped, or diminished, the effectiveness of British bombing operations. This omission could be {{regarded as one of the}} major errors attributable to the OKL concerning the air defence of Germany.|$|R
5|$|The {{removal of}} Kammhuber as {{commanding}} officer of night air defences in September 1943 did not prevent further appeals for the reinstatement of <b>intruder</b> <b>operations.</b> His replacement as General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Joseph Schmid, commanding 1. Jagdkorps (1st Fighter Corps). Schmid had long argued for a repeat of <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> and first pressed for their resumption in December 1943. His proposals were rejected by Göring {{on the grounds that}} <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> were not his business. Schmid did not receive substantive support from other field commanders, most notably Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, who objected to the operation after meeting with Schmid in January and February 1944 on the grounds that Hitler opposed such operations and newer German radar was not to fall into Allied hands. Four months later, attitudes had not changed. Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz, commanding Angriffsführer England (Bomber Leader England) and IX. Fliegerkorps showed little interest in intruder missions either, since his remaining forces were engaged in night attacks against the Allied beachheads in Normandy. In October 1944, he finally won support from Werner Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd (Inspector of Night Fighters) to press for an operation again. The plan was simple; a large force of 600—700 night fighters were to be gathered and sent out in one simultaneous operation.|$|R
5000|$|He then flew {{long-range}} <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> over Germany from RNAS Ford, developing night fighter tactics {{with the}} RAF's Fighter Interception Unit. Ford also acted as an operational research unit and so Twiss flew missions over occupied Europe, in Beaufighters and Mosquitoes, so putting the unit's theory into practice. He claimed two Junkers Ju 88's shot down during 1944.|$|R

50|$|On the 21st, seven aircrews {{relocated}} to Bône in readiness for intruder operations over Sardinia. This marked a significant {{extension of the}} squadron's role; {{they were no longer}} just being used for defensive work, but were also carrying the fight into enemy airspace. The first such <b>intruder</b> <b>operation</b> took place on the night of 23/24 March 1943. On the sixth, the move out of Macdonald to the new campsite at Ain Arnat was completed.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 December 1942 {{he assumed}} command of No. 157 Squadron RAF then at RAF Castle Camps flying the de Havilland Mosquito NF MkII {{in the night}} fighter role.

Although he never managed to increase his tally of enemy aircraft further, he had some success at destroying ground targets such as trains during these missions.

50|$|Rökker {{recorded}} three bombers destroyed on 7/8 August between 23:20 and 00:06 {{northeast of}} Le Havre. This included his 40th victory. After Normandy, NJG 2 relocated to Germany from France and Belgium. On 4 November 1944 he claimed four bombers in the Dortmund area between 19:31 and 20:06. On New Year's Day 1945, Rökker downed a Lancaster near Geldern. It was recorded at 20:07 in the evening. On {{the evening of}} 5 January he accounted for two Lancasters—one north of Nienburg at 19:19 and another northwest of Hannover at 19:29. In February 1945 Rökker continued to achieve interceptions and file claims. On {{the night of the}} 1/2 February 1945 he accounted for a single Avro Lancaster bomber near Koblenz for his 50th victory. Rökker recorded three more victories on the night of 3/4 February to take his score to 53. The latter success were claimed between 19:31 and 19:56 CET; the first over Krefeld and the last two victories were scored over Geldern. A Douglas A-20 Havoc was shot down over Eindhoven Airport on 7/8 February and another Lancaster over Fulda on the evening of 14 February brought his tally to 55. On the night of 21/22 February 1945, he claimed six Lancaster bombers between 20:46 and 21:19 CET. The first two Lancasters were claimed over Wageningen and 's-Hertogenbosch, the remaining four were shot down in the vicinity of Eindhoven. Heinz Rökker had now destroyed 61 enemy aircraft. On the night of the 3/4 March, Rökker participated in Operation Gisela, the failed <b>intruder</b> <b>operation</b> over eastern England. He failed to shoot down any aircraft on this night. For his achievements Rökker was awarded the 781st Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross on 12 March 1945.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1943 No 141 Squadron {{moved to}} RAF Wittering. It {{had been chosen}} {{to be the first}} {{purpose-built}} night fighter squadron to operate over Germany and occupied Europe in the bomber support role. The Beaufighters were equipped with the new Serrate radar detector, which picked up the radar impulses given out by the German night fighter's' Lichtenstein radar. A number of Beaufighters were also equipped with Mk IV radar, but not the more effective and recently introduced Mark VII. Serrate operations started in June 1943 and were given greater impetus as the Battle of the Ruhr was intensifying and Bomber Command's losses to German night fighters increased. Braham had immediate success, destroying a Messerschmitt Bf 110 over the Netherlands on 14 June and another nine days later. A claim was also made for a damaged Ju 88 after Braham's guns had jammed. In between these two successes, Braham was awarded a second bar to his DFC on 15 June 1943. Throughout June, 141 Squadron claimed five enemy fighters destroyed and two damaged for the loss of one Beaufighter. Braham noted the continuous operations were tiring Gregory and he arranged for him to be rested as squadron operational planning officer. His replacement was Flight Lieutenant Harry [...] "Jacko" [...] Jacobs.His most successful <b>intruder</b> <b>operation</b> took place {{on the night of the}} 17/18 August 1943, when he participated in 100 Group's support of RAF Bomber Command's Operation Hydra.

50|$|Several raids {{were made}} by the Luftwaffe; the first attack on the night of 12 October 1941 {{followed}} a Beaufighter on the approach and shot up the airfield. Defence soon gave way to offensive operations; fighter sweeps and <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> took place over France. The airfield’s southerly location made it also suitable for anti-shipping strikes over the Bay of Biscay. Westland Whirlwind and Beaufighter squadrons mounted successful patrols, followed later by a number of de Havilland Mosquito squadrons.|$|R

5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|R
5|$|Schnaufer's {{greatest}} one-night {{success and}} {{the second time he}} became an ace-in-a-day was on 21 February 1945, when he claimed nine Lancaster heavy bombers in the course of one day. Two were claimed {{in the early hours of}} the morning and a further seven, in just 19 minutes, in the evening between 20:44 and 21:03. Schnaufer was one of the influential figures that instigated a brief return to mass <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> over England named Operation Gisela. General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant Schmid, commanding I. Jagdkorps and Kammhuber, commanding XII. Fliegerkorps, and de facto command-in-chief of the German Night Fighter Force until November 1943, had long since desired to return to <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> over Bomber Command bases in England. The proposals met resistance from Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, Chief of the General Staff. Eventually, in October 1944, Schmid won support from Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd, to begin planning an operation. Schnaufer voiced his support also. In his experience, he had regularly pursued RAF bombers to the English coast, or least the other side of the frontline. In British airspace, and over territory the Germans did not control, he experienced a lack of radar interference. Schnaufer recalled that he could fly around as if it was peace time, since all British jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in Allied airspace.|$|R
50|$|As the {{fortunes}} of war progressed, the squadron moved west along the northern coast of New Guinea, moving to several advance airfields on the island throughout 1943 and 1944. In September 1944, the squadron was re-equipped with P-61 Black Widows and moved to Morotai Island in the Dutch East Indies where they engaged enemy aircraft. In the East Indies, additional B-25 Mitchells and P-38s were assigned, using the B-25s for night <b>intruder</b> <b>operations,</b> P-61s for night fighter operations and the P-38s for searchlight cooperation operations. In November the squadron moved to the Philippines, arriving on Leyte on 14 November.|$|R
5000|$|Production of the Mosquito, {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Mossie," [...] was the company's {{greatest}} {{contribution to the}} war effort. It {{was one of the}} few front-line aircraft of the era constructed almost entirely of wood and was nicknamed [...] "The Wooden Wonder". The Mosquito was designed to use speed instead of defensive armament to evade attack, and as a result it was one of the fastest aircraft in the war, reaching 425 mph at 30,000 ft. The original design was intended as a light bomber, but soon proved itself in high-level photography and every phase of <b>intruder</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In May 1940, the {{squadron}} flew patrols over northern France and {{took part in}} the defence of south-east England based at RAF Biggin Hill during the opening weeks of the Battle of Britain before moving to northern England at the end of August 1940. The Squadron's Hurricanes saw little action throughout 1941, but did attempt, unsuccessfully, to escort the Fairey Swordfish biplanes of 825 Naval Air Squadron during their doomed attempt to stop the German warships , [...] and [...] during the Channel Dash on 12 February 1942, and then carried out a number of night <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> before being deployed overseas.|$|R
5|$|RAF Fighter Command and Bomber Command {{attempted}} to warn {{all of their}} airborne units of the potential danger and bomber units were ordered to plan alternate landing sites {{in the event of}} an attack on their airfields. All bomber and fighter groups were linked by telephone and ground control passed on all details of <b>intruder</b> <b>operations</b> to pilots including height and heading when they occurred. Station Commands organised blackouts of airfields and pilots could be ordered to switch the navigation lights off at any time. Only the Mosquito groups remained active against intruders, though the majority of these units were supporting Allied operations on the continent.|$|R
50|$|In early 1943 the {{squadron}} began {{to switch over}} to night <b>intruder</b> <b>operations.</b> In February 1944, {{the squadron}} was allocated to the 2nd Tactical Air Force and began conversion to the de Havilland Mosquito. Operations from Normandy began in August but the following month the unit returned to the UK, returning to the continent once again in January 1945. They remained there until disbanding at B.51 at Vendeville, near Lille, France on 18 April 1945. Some 127 air victories had been claimed by the Squadron during the war, 41 since May 1944. A notable member of the squadron, later awarded a posthumous George Cross, was John Quinton DFC.|$|R
