Diseases of the hoof, such as <b>foot</b> <b>rot</b> and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes.

In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert <b>foot</b> <b>rot</b> disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400).

40|$|We {{compared}} field emergence and {{yield of}} a white- and a coloured-flowered variety of faba bean (Vicia faba) {{in relation to}} Bruchus rufimanus seed damage in a factorial, hand sown mini-plot field experiment. Further manipulating factors at sowing were, <b>foot</b> root <b>rot</b> inoculation with a 4 -species Fusarium-mixture, a seed dressing with powdered testa material of the coloured-flower variety and sowing depth. In both varieties Fusarium-inoculation was the most detrimental and significant factor to field emergence and yield, interacting with a concordant B. rufimanus effect. Expectedly, the white-flowered variety was most affected. Tannin-containing testa meal did not reduce or compensate the impact of fungal inoculation and/or B. rufimanus. We hypothesize that B. rufimanus testa damage affects seedling vigour via reported faster water imbibition, causing cellular rupture and higher solute leakage which may enhance soilborne <b>foot</b> root <b>rot</b> incidence and finally yield.

25|$|In a {{concentrated}} animal feeding operation (CAFO), {{it is considered}} normal for {{a large number of}} animals to continuously occupy a very small area. The aisles that animals use to move around are consequently constantly coated with a moist layer of manure and urine from the many animals, leading to ailments such as <b>foot</b> <b>rot</b> due to the constant wet exposure. The manure and urine is usually just scraped off into gutters below slatted surfaces, and the surfaces and gutters are rarely washed completely clean, so molds, bacteria, and insects can grow and thrive in the potentially infectious waste. Feeding areas in a CAFO are also rarely stripped bare and washed with a disinfectant, as this would reduce the time available for animals to eat continuously, so molds and bacteria are also able to become established where the animals eat. The close confinement and lack of general environmental cleanliness leads to easier spread of infection and increased sickness, requiring the regular feeding of antibiotics to keep the confined animals healthy but which also leads to antibiotic resistance for bacteria constantly present in the CAFO.|$|E

50|$|<b>Foot</b> <b>rot,</b> or {{infectious}} pododermatitis, is a hoof infection {{commonly found}} in sheep, goats, and cattle. As the name suggests, it rots away {{the foot of the}} animal, more specifically the area between the two toes of the affected animal. It is extremely painful and contagious. It can be treated with a series of medications, but if not treated, the whole herd can become infected. The cause of the infection in cattle is two species of anaerobic bacteria, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus. Both bacteria are common to the environment in which cattle live, and Fusobacterium is present in the rumen and fecal matter of the cattle. In sheep, F. necrophorum first invades the interdigital skin following damage to the skin, and causes interdigital lesions and slight inflammation. The second stage of the disease is marked by the invasion of the foot by the <b>foot</b> <b>rot</b> bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus, a Gram-negative anaerobe. Usually, an injury to the skin between the hooves allows the bacteria to infect the animal. Another cause of <b>foot</b> <b>rot</b> may be high temperatures or humidity, causing the skin between the hooves to crack and let the bacteria infect the foot. This {{is one of the reasons}} <b>foot</b> <b>rot</b> is such a major problem in the summer. <b>Foot</b> <b>rot</b> is easily identifiable by its appearance and foul odor. Treatment is usually with an antibiotic medication, and preventing injury to the feet is the best way to prevent <b>foot</b> <b>rot.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of plant growth – promoting bacteria is variable under different biotic and abiotic conditions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of plant growth – promoting rhizobacteria on plant growth and on the control of <b>foot</b> and root <b>rot</b> of tomatoes caused by Fusarium solani under different soil salinity conditions. Among the five tested strains, only Pseudomonas chlororaphis TSAU 13, and Pseudomonas extremorientalis TSAU 20 were able to stimulate plant growth and act as biological controls of <b>foot</b> and root <b>rot</b> disease of tomato. The soil salinity did not negatively affect the beneficial impacts of these strains, as they were able to colonize and survive on the roots of tomato plants under both saline and non-saline soil conditions. The improved plant height and fruit yield of tomato was also observed for plants inoculated with P. extremorientalis TSAU 20. Our results indicated that, saline condition is not crucial factor in obtaining good performance with respect to the plant growth stimulating and biocontrol abilities of PGPR strains.

40|$|The {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} several fungi that can invade {{a wide range of}} cereals and grasses, and can survive and multiply on many crop residues, all producing similar symptoms.

Symptoms <b>Foot</b> and root <b>rots</b> impact winter wheat by reducing plant stand, number of tillers and ultimately yield, and like Take-All, are found in localized patches.

A number of aerial fungi, together with soil-borne pathogens associated with <b>foot</b> and root <b>rot</b> complexes, nematodes, parasitic weeds and viruses may cause severe diseases in faba bean crops. The use of genetic resistance is the most economical and environmentally friendly control method. However, to date no efficient sources of resistance have been described to some diseases, or it is scarce and of complex nature, making necessary the implementation of other control measures. Phenotypic expression of resistance is usually poorly described. As a consequence of this, and of the poorly developed genomic resources available, the genetic basis of resistances is, in most cases, largely unknown. Effectiveness of MAS might soon increase with the adoption of new improvements in marker technology together with the integration of comparative mapping and functional genomics.
