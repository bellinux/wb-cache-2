These aspects can be quantitatively evaluated through inter-regional computable general equilibrium models. Short-run and long-run spatial considerations can be rigorously assessed, producing relevant information to regional planning. ...|$|R

Also, larger companies may be able to operate at low or even negative profits for extended periods of time, thus pushing out competition. More progressive taxation of profits, however, would reduce such barriers for new entrants, thereby increasing competition and ultimately benefiting consumers.|$|R
