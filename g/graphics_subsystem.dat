25|$|While {{technically}} a graphical {{user interface}} is not an operating system service, incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by {{reducing the number of}} context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are modular, separating the <b>graphics</b> <b>subsystem</b> from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX, VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. Linux and macOS are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a <b>graphics</b> <b>subsystem</b> that is mostly in user-space; however the graphics drawing routines of versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003 exist mostly in kernel space. Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel.|$|E
25|$|The server {{component}} of RDS is Terminal Server (termdd.sys), which listens on TCP port 3389. When a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client connects to this port, it is tagged {{with a unique}} SessionID and associated with a freshly spawned console session (Session 0, keyboard, mouse and character mode UI only). The login subsystem (winlogon.exe) and the GDI <b>graphics</b> <b>subsystem</b> is then initiated, which handles the job of authenticating the user and presenting the GUI. These executables are loaded in a new session, rather than the console session. When creating the new session, the graphics and keyboard/mouse device drivers are replaced with RDP-specific drivers: RdpDD.sys and RdpWD.sys. The RdpDD.sys is the device driver and it captures the UI rendering calls into a format that is transmittable over RDP. RdpWD.sys acts as keyboard and mouse driver; it receives keyboard and mouse input over the TCP connection and presents them as keyboard or mouse inputs. It also allows creation of virtual channels, which allow other devices, such as disc, audio, printers, and COM ports to be redirected, i.e., the channels act as replacement for these devices. The channels connect to the client over the TCP connection; as the channels are accessed for data, the client is informed of the request, which is then transferred over the TCP connection to the application. This entire procedure {{is done by the}} terminal server and the client, with the RDP mediating the correct transfer, and is entirely transparent to the applications. RDP communications are encrypted using 128-bit RC4 encryption. Windows Server 2003 onwards, it can use a FIPS 140 compliant encryption schemes.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista {{includes}} {{a new version}} of Direct3D, called Direct3D 10. It adds scheduling and memory virtualization capabilities to the <b>graphics</b> <b>subsystem</b> and forgoes the current DirectX practice of using [...] "capability bits" [...] to indicate which features are active on the current hardware. Instead, Direct3D 10 defines a minimum standard of hardware capabilities which must be supported for a display system to be [...] "Direct3D 10 compatible". Microsoft's goal is to create an environment for developers and designers where they can be assured that the input they provide will be rendered in exactly the same fashion on all supported graphics cards. This has been a recurring problem with the DirectX 9 model, where different video cards have produced different results, thus requiring fixes keyed to specific cards to be produced by developers.|$|E

50|$|Through the 1990s, many <b>graphic</b> <b>subsystems</b> used VRAM, {{with the}} number of megabits touted as a selling point. In the late 1990s, {{synchronous}} DRAM technologies gradually became affordable, dense, and fast enough to displace VRAM, even though it is only single-ported and more overhead is required. Nevertheless, many of the VRAM concepts of internal, on-chip buffering and organization have been used and improved in modern graphics adapters.|$|R
50|$|The InfiniteReality succeeded the RealityEngine2 as the {{high-end}} <b>graphics</b> <b>subsystem</b> for the Onyx when introduced in 1996.

50|$|A similar {{approach}} that gave similar results is the boost up of graphics {{used in some}} SGi computers, most notably the O2/O2+. The memory in these machines is simply one fast pool (2,1 GB/s per second in 1996) shared between system and graphics. Sharing is performed on demand, including pointer redirection communication between main system and <b>graphics</b> <b>subsystem.</b> This is called Unified Memory Architecture (UMA).|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{graphics}} processors play {{a central}} role in many modern computer systems due to the large demand for entertainment, visualization tools, architectural CAD tools, and physical modeling. But high performance <b>graphics</b> <b>subsystems</b> are just beginning to reach the commercial workstation and personal computer markets. They also remain high priced and often lacking the performance needed for graphics-intensive applications. The root of the problem lies in the complex graphics algorithms that require large amounts of object data to be manipulated with high throughput, such as what is required for ray tracing. This has resulted in complex, real-time 3 D graphics to be limited to high-end systems. In this paper, we present a library of 3 D graphics algorithms that have been mapped to the Micro-Grain Array Processor (MGAP), an inexpensive and versatile SIMD processing board capable of fitting in a typical workstation. Our results show that the MGAP can produce comparable data throughput as more costly <b>graphics</b> <b>subsystems,</b> while maintaining the flexibility of being a general purpose parallel machine. 1...|$|R
