50|$|The Stokes <b>interview</b> is a {{secondary}} <b>interview</b> conducted {{on a couple}} {{who are trying to}} obtain an immigration green card in the United States {{on the basis of their}} marriage.

The Stokes <b>interview</b> is offered as a second chance for the couple to prove their marriage's legitimacy. What separates the Stokes <b>interview</b> from the initial adjustment of status <b>interview,</b> which is usually the only <b>interview</b> necessary in the process, is that during the Stokes <b>interview</b> couples are <b>interviewed</b> separately instead of together. The two <b>interviews</b> are recorded and compared for discrepancies.

5|$|On April 15, 2009, Helms {{was drafted}} to the ECW brand {{as part of}} the 2009 Supplemental Draft. Helms made his ECW debut as a {{backstage}} interviewer on April 28, 2009, reverting to his Gregory Helms ring name, <b>interviewing</b> Evan Bourne. He started a storyline where, while he was <b>interviewing</b> someone, a scripted accident would occur, leading to Helms leaving the interview seconds before the person in distress was saved by The Hurricane. On the August 11, 2009 episode of ECW, Helms was attacked by Paul Burchill after Helms denied being The Hurricane. The Hurricane later attacked Burchill in the ring dressed in his Hurricane attire, to save Yoshi Tatsu. The next week on ECW, he made his in-ring debut for the brand as The Hurricane, and defeated Burchill. He continued to feud with Burchill, who attempted to expose The Hurricane's true identity, until the November 17 episode of ECW when The Hurricane defeated Burchill in a mask versus career match.|$|E

5000|$|Employment. <b>Interviews</b> in an {{employment}} context are typically called job <b>interviews</b> which describe a formal consultation {{for the purpose}} of evaluating the qualifications of the interviewee for a specific position. <b>Interviews</b> are seen as a useful tool in assessing qualifications. A specific type of job <b>interview</b> is a case <b>interview</b> in which the applicant is presented with a question or task or challenge, and asked to resolve the situation. Sometimes to prepare for job <b>interviews,</b> candidates are treated to a mock <b>interview</b> as a training exercise to prepare the respondent to handle questions in the subsequent 'real' <b>interview.</b> Sometimes the <b>interviews</b> happen in several waves, with the first <b>interview</b> sometimes being called a screening <b>interview</b> which is a shorter length <b>interview,</b> followed by more in-depth <b>interviews</b> later on, usually by company personnel who can ultimately hire the applicant. Technology has enabled new possibilities for interviewing; for example, video phoning technology has enabled applicants to <b>interview</b> for jobs despite being in different cities or countries than the interviewer.|$|R

50|$|Telephone <b>interviews</b> {{are often}} {{conducted}} by employers {{in the initial}} <b>interview</b> round of the hiring process, this type of <b>interview</b> allows an employer to screen candidates on the candidates experience, qualifications, and salary expectations pertaining to the position and the company. The telephone <b>interview</b> saves the employers' time and eliminates candidates that are unlikely to meet the company’s expectations. Employers tend to perform telephone <b>interviews</b> as a structured <b>interview.</b> The questions are custom tailored to meet the position in question. With the telephone <b>interview</b> {{there may not be}} direct contact between the employer and employee, however, the expectations are still there. Telephone <b>interviews</b> are scheduled and questions are generally prepared in advance, similar to the way other <b>interviews</b> are conducted. Another common reason a company looks to the telephone <b>interview</b> is that these <b>interviews</b> can be conducted on-the-fly. The interviewer does not have to assign company resources to the phone <b>interview.</b> It is a cost-effective method to short-list candidates for the position being <b>interviewed</b> for.|$|R
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from <b>interviewing</b> other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{psychological}} profile, the Garda broadcast an appeal for information on the RTÉ television programme Crimeline with a request for people whose houses had been broken into in the Grangegorman area to contact them.

50|$|In general {{clinical}} practice with assessment of personality disorders, {{one form of}} <b>interview</b> is the most popular; an unstructured <b>interview.</b> The actual preferred method is a semi-structured <b>interview</b> but there is reluctance to use this type of <b>interview</b> because they can seem impractical or superficial. The reason that a semi-structured <b>interview</b> is preferred over an unstructured <b>interview</b> is that semi-structured <b>interviews</b> {{tend to be more}} objective, systematic, replicable, and comprehensive.Unstructured <b>interviews,</b> despite their popularity, tend to have problems with unreliability and are susceptible to errors leading to false assumptions of the client.|$|R

50|$|A mock <b>interview</b> is an {{emulation}} {{of a job}} <b>interview</b> {{used for}} training purposes. The conversational exercise usually resembles a real <b>interview</b> as closely as possible, {{for the purpose of}} providing experience for a candidate. It can help a job applicant to understand what is expected in a real job <b>interview,</b> and can help an applicant improve his or her self-presentation. Mock <b>interviews</b> can be videotaped; the candidate can view the tape afterward, and get feedback. There are coaches who can provide feedback on aspects of the <b>interview</b> process. Mock <b>interviews</b> are most common for job <b>interviews,</b> but may also be used to train public figures to handle interrogations by journalists, as well as help candidates for office prepare for debates. Some organizations schedule mock <b>interview</b> events to help many students prepare for job <b>interviews.</b> For example, some schools have mock <b>interview</b> training days, often organized by career and guidance counselors. While the usual sense of the term is an exercise done as a form of preparation prior to applying for jobs, there is another sense of the term which describes a playful or non-serious <b>interview.</b> Mock <b>interviews</b> can help a person gain confidence for real <b>interviews,</b> as well as provide the interviewee with information about how to handle an upcoming <b>interview.</b>|$|R
