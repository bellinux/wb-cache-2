However, the Chinook {{experienced}} engine difficulties, and new MH-47s were dispatched to replace the original helicopters. This delay meant that the SEALs could not be inserted into the LZ east of the peak until 02:30 on 4 March, which did not allow enough time to reach the peak before daylight. Blaber was notified that the SEALs were forced to insert on the peak in order to fulfill the order to <b>infil</b> Mako 30 that night.

40|$|Abstract: Neutrophils {{represent}} {{an important source}} of autoantigens for antineutrophil cytoplas-mic antibody associated with vasculitis. To date, two cytoskeletal proteins, vinculin and vimentin, have been reported to be expressed on the cell surfaces of activated macrophages, platelets, and apoptotic T lymphocytes. However, such cell sur-face expression has never been studied in human neutrophils. As we recently demonstrated that dif-ferent cytoskeletal proteins were cleaved in apo-ptotic neutrophils, we hypothesized that some of these were expressed on the cell surface of apopto-tic neutrophils. Herein, we found that among vin-culin, paxillin, gelsolin, vimentin, lamin B 1, -tu-bulin, and -tubulin, only the two intermediate filament (<b>INFIL)</b> proteins, vimentin and lamin B 1, are expressed on the cell surface of 24 -h aged neutrophils [spontaneous apoptosis (SA) ]. By mon-itoring intracellular expression of vimentin and lamin B 1 during SA, we found that these two pro-teins were cleaved and that such cleavage was re-versed by the pan caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxy-carbonyl-V-A-D-O-methylfluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk). When neutrophil apoptosis was delayed or suppressed by lipopolysaccharide or the cyto-kines granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage (GM) -CSF, or in-terleukin- 4, the loss of intracellular expression of vimentin and lamin B 1 was prevented. The <b>INFIL</b> proteins were absent from the cell surface when neutrophil apoptosis was delayed. Addition of z-VAD-fmk significantly decreased the cell surface expression of vimentin and lamin B 1 during SA. This study provides the first evidence that apopto-tic neutrophils express cytoskeletal proteins on their surface, opening the possibility that these cells may participate in the development of autoantibodies directed against cytoskeletal proteins, a condition frequently reported in several inflammator...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFloodplain {{development}} {{is associated with}} lateral accretion along stable channel geometry. Along shifting rivers, the floodplain sedimentation is more complex because of changes in channel position but also cutoff channel presence, which exhibit specific overflow patterns. In this contribution, the spatial and temporal variability of sedimentation rates in cutoff channel infill deposits is related to channel changes of a shifting gravel bed river (Ain River, France). The sedimentation rates estimated from dendrogeomorphic analysis are compared between and within 14 cutoff channel infills. Detailed analyses along a single channel infill are performed to assess changes in the sedimentation rates through time by analyzing activity profiles of the fallout radionuclides 137 Cs and unsupported 210 Pb. Sedimentation rates are also compared within the channel infills with rates in other plots located in the adjacent floodplain. Sedimentation rates range between 0. 65 and 2. 4 cm a 1 {{over a period of}} 10 to 40 years. The data provide additional information on the role of distance from the bank, overbank flow frequency, and channel geometry in controlling the sedimentation rate. Channel infills, lower than adjacent floodplains, exhibit higher sedimentation rates and convey overbank sediment farther away within the floodplain. Additionally, channel degradation, aggradation, and bank erosion, which reduce or increase the distance between the main channel and the cutoff channel aquatic zone, affect local overbank flow magnitude and frequency and therefore sedimentation rates, thereby creating a complex mosaic of sedimentation zones within the floodplain and along the cutoff channel infills. Last, the dendrogeomorphic and 137 Cs approaches are cross validated for estimating the sedimentation rate within a channel <b>infil...</b>|$|E

40|$|Pahute Mesa is a {{groundwater}} recharge {{area at the}} Nevada National Security Site. Because underground nuclear testing was conducted at Pahute Mesa, {{groundwater recharge}} may transport radionuclides from underground test sites downward to the water table; the amount of groundwater recharge {{is also an important}} component of contaminant transport models. To estimate the amount of groundwater recharge at Pahute Mesa, an <b>INFIL</b> 3. 0 recharge-runoff model is being developed. Two eddy covariance (EC) stations were installed on Pahute Mesa to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) to support the groundwater recharge modeling project. This data report describes the methods that were used to estimate ET and collect meteorological data. Evapotranspiration was estimated for two predominant plant communities on Pahute Mesa; one site was located in a sagebrush plant community, the other site in a pinyon pine/juniper community. Annual ET was estimated to be 310 ± 13. 9 mm for the sagebrush site and 347 ± 15. 9 mm for the pinyon pine/juniper site (March 26, 2011 to March 26, 2012). Annual precipitation measured with unheated tipping bucket rain gauges was 179 mm at the sagebrush site and 159 mm at the pinyon pine/juniper site. Annual precipitation measured with bulk precipitation gauges was 222 mm at the sagebrush site and 227 mm at the pinyon pine/juniper site (March 21, 2011 to March 28, 2012). A comparison of tipping bucket versus bulk precipitation data showed that total precipitation measured by the tipping bucket rain gauges was 17 to 20 percent lower than the bulk precipitation gauges. These differences were most likely the result of the unheated tipping bucket precipitation gauges not measuring frozen precipitation as accurately as the bulk precipitation gauges.

The epidemiology of infection by these four nematode species was examined both in whole fish, and in individual host tissues and organs. Frequency distributions of nematodes {{were found to}} be generally overdispersed in fish. Preliminary investigations revealed no strong evidence to suggest that competi tive interactions occurred between ascaridoid nematodes wi thin fish. Stomach lesions in gadoids were associated with single (partially penetrated) and mul tiple (throughout stomach wall) worm infections of larval A. simplex; such lesions were discrete and raised in appearance. Lesions associated with 1 - 3 larval P. decipiens in an open cavity within the stomach of angler fish were diffuse and not significantly raised. Histological examination of each form of ulcer revealed general similarities in pathology, with <b>infil</b> tration of inflamatory cells being the initial response to the nematode. Changes in the cephalic morphology of A. simplex, P. decip 1 ens, C. osculatum and H. aduncu were examined at different life cycle stages under scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|For {{the past}} 20 years, {{extensive}} field, laboratory, and modeling investigations {{have been performed}} at Yucca Mountain, which {{have led to the}} development of a number of conceptual models of infiltration and climate for the Yucca Mountain region around the repository site (Flint, A. L. et al. 2001; Wang and Bodvarsson 2003). Evaluating the amount of infiltrating water entering the subsurface is important, because this water may affect the percolation flux, which, in turn, controls seepage into the waste emplacement drifts and radionuclide transport from the repository to the water table. Forecasting of climatic data indicates that during the next 10, 000 years at Yucca Mountain, the present-day climate should persist for 400 to 600 years, followed by a warmer and much wetter monsoon climate for 900 to 1, 400 years, and by a cooler and wetter glacial-transition climate for the remaining 8, 000 to 8, 700 years. The analysis of climatic forecasting indicates that long-term climate conditions are generally predictable from a past climate sequence, while short-term climate conditions and weather predictions may be more variable and uncertain. The use of past climate sequences to bound future climate sequences involves several types of uncertainties, such as (1) uncertainty in the timing of future climate, (2) uncertainty in the methodology of climatic forecasting, and (3) uncertainty in the earth's future physical processes. Some of the uncertainties of the climatic forecasting are epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible). Because of the size of the model domain, <b>INFIL</b> treats many flow processes in a simplified manner. For example, uptake of water by roots occurs according to the ''distributed model'', in which available water in each soil layer is withdrawn in proportion to the root density in that layer, multiplied by the total evapotranspirative demand. Runoff is calculated simply as the excess of precipitation over a sum of infiltration and water storage in the root zone. More significantly, water movement throughout the soil profile is treated according to the bucket model, in which the amount of water that moves down from one layer to the next is equal to the mass of water in excess of field capacity in the upper layer. The development of a numerical model of infiltration involves a number of abstractions and simplifications to represent the complexity of environmental conditions at Yucca Mountain, such as the arid climate, mountain-type topography, heterogeneous soils and fractured rock, and irregular soil-rock interface...|$|E

The lipids are heterogeneously distr ibuted to create regions, or domains, whose physical properties {{differ from the}} bulk membrane and play {{an essential role in}} modulating the function of resident proteins. Many basic questions pertaining to the formation of these lateral assemblies remain. T his research employs model membranes of well - defined composition to focus on the potential role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their interaction with cholesterol (chol) in restructuring the membrane environment. Omega - 3 (n - 3) PUFAs are the main bioactive components of fish oil, whose consumption alleviates a variety of health problems by a molecular mechanism that is unclear. We hypothesize that the incorporation of PUFAs into membrane lipids and the effect they have on molecular organization may be, in part, responsible. Chol is a major constituent in the plasma membrane of mammals. It determines the arrangement and collective properties of neighboring lipids, driving the formation of domains via differential affinity for different lipids. T he m olecular organization of 1 -[2 H 31]palmitoyl - 2 - eicosapentaenoylphosphatidylcholine (PEPC - d 31) and 1 -[2 H 31]palmitoyl - 2 - docosahexaenoylphosphatidylcholine (PDPC -d 31) in membran es with sphingomyelin (SM) and chol (1 : 1 : 1 mol) was compared by solid - state 2 H NMR spectroscopy. Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids are the two major n - 3 PUFAs found in fish oil, while PEPC -d 31 and PDPC -d 31 are phospholipids containing the respective PUFAs at the sn - 2 position and a perdeuterated palmitic acid a t the sn - 1 position. Analysis of s pectra recorded as a function of temperature indicate s that in both cases, formation of PUFA - rich (less ordered) and SM - rich (more ordered) domains occurred. A surprisingly substantial proportion of PUFA was found to <b>infil</b> trate the more ordered domain. There was almost twice as much DHA (65 %) as EPA (30 %). The implication is that n - 3 PUFA s can incorporate into lipid rafts, which are domains enriched in SM and chol in the plasma membrane, and potentially disrupt the activity of signaling proteins that reside therein. DHA, furthermore, may be the more potent component of fish oil. PUFA - chol interactions were also examined through affinity measurements. A novel method utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was develope d, to monitor the partitioning of a spin - labeled analog of chol, 3 β - doxyl - 5 α - cholestane (chlstn), between large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and met hyl - β - cyclodextrin (mβCD). The EPR spectra for chlstn in the two environments are distinguishable due to the substantial differences in tumbling rates, allowing the population distribution ratio to be determined by spectral simulation. Advantages of this approach include speed of implementation and a vo idance of potential artifact s associated with physical separation of LUV and mβCD. Additionally, in a check of the method, t he relative partition coefficients between lipids measured for the spin label analog agree with values obtained for chol by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Results from LUV with different composition confirmed a hierarchy of decreased sterol affinity for phospholipids with increasing acyl chain unsaturation, PDPC possessing half the affinity of the corresponding monounsaturated phospholipid. Taken together, the results of these studies on model membranes demonstrate the potential for PUFA - driven alteration of the architecture of biomembranes, a mechanism through which human health may be impacted...|$|E
