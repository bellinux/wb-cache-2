500|$|In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) that Frigg is {{the highest}} among the Ã¡synjur or Aesir, and that [...] "she has a {{dwelling}} called Fensalir {{and it is very}} splendid." [...] In chapter 49, High says that when Loki witnessed that Baldr had gained invincibility due to the oath all things took not to harm him, Loki went to Fensalir appearing as a woman. In his disguise, Loki there asked Frigg why Baldr was not harmed by the objects. Frigg revealed that it is due to the oath they have taken. The disguised Loki asks if nothing can hurt Baldr, and Frigg reveals that only mistletoe can, for <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> too young to demand an oath from. After this, Loki immediately disappears, and subsequently engineers the death of Baldr with a mistletoe projectile.|$|E
2500|$|This Thielvar {{had a son}} called Hafthi. And Hafthi's {{wife was}} called Whitestar. Those two {{were the first to}} settle on Gotland. The first night they slept {{together}} she dreamt that three snakes were coiled in her lap. And <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that they slid out of her lap. She told this dream to her husband Hafthi. He interpreted it thus: ...|$|E
60|$|Still he stood, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that her}} father's gaze pierced to her secret soul.|$|E
60|$|This time <b>it</b> did <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that she}} could detect a slight ring of excitement.|$|R
60|$|He put his {{arm around}} her shoulders, and the {{strength}} of <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> calm <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Thyme's eyes {{followed}} that slow, sweeping movement of <b>her</b> cousin's hand. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> fascinate <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{beyond the}} desert {{of a woman}} {{that she should be}} privileged to participate....|$|E
60|$|Margaret {{looked across}} the table curiously. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that her friend had turned a little paler.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her {{steadily}} and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that his eyes were on fire with evil things.|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to find out what}} had happened, she looks for other people with binoculars. The only other person she can see is a man who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be frozen still. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that a tragedy killed all living creatures {{on the other side of}} the wall. She is entirely alone, {{protected}} and trapped by the invisible wall in equal measure.|$|R
60|$|He {{told her}} the news, in the fewest words possible. Even he {{observed}} that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> excite <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Nelly bit <b>her</b> lip. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>her</b> fate to-day <b>to</b> {{meet people}} {{who were going to}} America.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as if {{this first}} vision of death must alter the {{daylight}} for her for evermore.|$|E
60|$|Miriam {{could not}} help {{touching}} the eggs, and his hand which, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> cradled them so well.|$|E
60|$|This figure {{took her}} imagination; <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> very beautiful; and his praise humbled her more and more.|$|E
60|$|Her jaw fell. She caught {{more than}} an admonition in his words. <b>It</b> almost <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that he was threatening.|$|R
60|$|Jean had doffed his sombrero {{at sight}} of her and he still held it, rather deferentially, perhaps. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> attract <b>her</b> attention.|$|R
60|$|She merely replied, {{and that}} evasively and hurriedly: Why should she? She {{had not thought}} about <b>it.</b> He <b>seemed,</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> have so {{little to do with}} it.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as if ages {{had passed}} in this way, when one evening two letters were brought in.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked into}} her eyes almost fearfully, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that his own held a first glimmer of hope.|$|E
60|$|As {{he did so}} she {{had started}} to her feet, listening. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that there was someone near them.|$|E
60|$|Theodora never {{pretended to}} bashfulness where Ludovic was concerned. She {{was not at}} all shy of {{referring}} to him and his dilatory courtship. Indeed, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> amuse <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Miss Bishop {{raised her}} eyes, {{and looked at}} him. She {{appeared}} to be very thoughtful. Then her lip flickered curiously, almost scornfully, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> him. <b>Her</b> slender fingers drummed the table.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood before}} him, her hands behind her back, {{and they looked}} into one another's eyes. Her words were steady and quiet. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> an {{infinite}} relief to say them.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} a glance. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that {{whatever}} it was, his presence would help her to bear it.|$|E
60|$|And as {{she looked}} out on the sea from her narrow window, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> dismally gray, moaning, restless, and dreary.|$|E
60|$|She {{very much}} {{wanted to look at}} him, but she would not. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> quite a time before he replied.|$|E
60|$|She stole a {{quick glance}} at him, through her tears. She was deeply {{penitent}} for what she had said. <b>It</b> almost <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as if a dual nature was at war within her.|$|R
60|$|She had, indeed, even <b>to</b> <b>her</b> dress. It was now of a vivid brick red, and so {{much longer}} in the skirt that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> make <b>her</b> taller. Only her hat {{remained}} the same.|$|R
60|$|The moving shadow {{split into}} two shadows that stole closer, loomed before her. She could not tell which belonged to Jim till he touched her. His touch was potent. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{electrify}} <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ralph Denham said that?" [...] said Katharine, with {{considerable}} indignation. In {{order to have}} produced such suffering in Mary, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that he must have}} behaved with extreme callousness. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that he had discarded the friendship, when it suited his convenience to do so, with some falsely philosophical theory which made his conduct all the worse. She was going on to express herself thus, had not Mary at once interrupted her.|$|E
6000|$|Almost <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as if {{father and}} brother were {{standing}} by her side, as she knelt and prayed.--Oh! how she prayed! ...|$|E
60|$|Elspeth {{discovered}} that guns cost fourpence, and dominoes threepence halfpenny; <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> therefore, that Tommy was defrauding {{her of a}} halfpenny.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drink {{another cup}} of wine at least," [...] she said, smiling and filling their mugs with the sweet vintage of Lebanon--for <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> please <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see them eat so heartily of her fare.|$|R
60|$|She had {{no sooner}} said it than {{she burst into}} a dry hard sobbing, so violent that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> rend <b>her.</b> Tess was not a hysterical girl by any means, and he was surprised.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{worse than}} might be expected, Jacob. I have spoken <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> told her who I am, and why I came here. Naturally enough, she is sore at present, and {{considers}} that I have been deceiving her, {{which is true}} enough. At first she denied nothing, but afterwards fired up, and for the present regards me as an enemy; but I believe it will all come right. She is angry now because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that I have been taking her in for my own purposes, but I think that when she thinks it over calmly she will do what I want.' ...|$|R
