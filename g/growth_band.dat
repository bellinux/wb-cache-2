50|$|The <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> widths of {{the bone}} {{indicated}} that the growing season, or annual period of relatively warm weather, was much longer than it is today. A very low δ18O value was also found within the bone indicating that the predominant source of moisture for the ancient lake was high-elevation snow run-off which experienced low evaporation rates after entering the lake’s waters. This moisture source is not unlike the moisture source of today but due to more equitable seasonal temperatures and thus less evaporation in the summers, lakes reached greater depth over time than they would today. This may be a contributing factor to the ‘disharmonious assemblage’ that Smith & Patterson found among the fossil record for the Pliocene epoch. Sunfish and catfish were occupying the same waters, albeit different depths, as sculpins and trout at the same time. Sculpins reportedly went extinct at approximately 2 million years ago in this lake which may provide a signal for heightened summer temperatures and thus an increase in deep, cold-water temperatures in the ancient lake.|$|E

Both calcified structures presented observable growth bands, allowing cross comparison among structures {{for the first}} time in a shark species. Whole and sectioned vertebrae and dorsal fin-spines possess highly visible growth bands and intra-reader band counts resulted in similar precision indices with little systematic bias. However, inter-reader <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> count plots showed possible biases in counts from sectioned vertebrae and sectioned dorsal-fin spines. Sectioned vertebrae and whole and sectioned dorsal-fin spines produced similar <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> counts, whereas whole vertebrae produced significantly lower counts. The similar readability, precision indices, <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> counts and apparent absence of biases between counts for a single reader would indicate that sectioned vertebrae and whole and sectioned dorsal-fin spines are both potentially useful and acceptable methods for band counting. However, inter-reader comparisons are necessary to avoid acceptance of biased estimations, resulting in over- or under-estimations of age.

Two fluorochrome marker dyes, calcein and oxytetracycline, {{were used to}} validate the timing and periodicity of vertebral band formation in nine individuals held in the laboratory for between 423 and 472 days. Growth bands were difficult to interpret and final counts were obtained from only 98 (53. 8 %) individuals ranging in total length (TL) from 63 to 146 cm. The timing of <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> formation in the vertebrae of captive animals had no predictable temporal pattern, with formation occurring during all seasons of the year, making age validation difficult. <b>Growth</b> <b>band</b> formation was hypothesised {{to be influenced by}} non-periodic changes in centrum or somatic growth rather than seasonal growth, as observed in many other elasmobranch species. Growth rates of nine O. hutchinsi held in captivity varied considerably, ranging from 3. 5 cm year– 1 to 13. 8 cm year– 1 in total length (mean = 7. 03 cm year– 1). Although the periodicity of vertebral band formation in captive animals did not support a synchronous annual pattern, captive growth rates matched those predicted when an annual band pattern was assumed for wild caught individuals. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated from vertebral analysis assuming an annual banding pattern and a mean size of birth of 24. 1 cm were: L∞ = 149. 45 cm and K = 0. 117 year– 1 for both sexes combined.

40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of scleractinian corals on geological timescales is key to predict how modern reef ecosystems will react to changing environmental conditions in the future. Important to such efforts has been the development of several skeleton-based criteria {{to distinguish between the}} two major ecological groups of scleractinians: zooxanthellates, which live in symbiosis with dinoflagellate algae, and azooxanthellates, which lack endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. Existing criteria are based on overall skeletal morphology and bio/geo-chemical indicators-none of them being particularly robust. Here we explore another skeletal feature, namely fine-scale <b>growth</b> <b>banding,</b> which differs between these two groups of corals. Using various ultra-structural imaging techniques (e. g., TEM, SEM, and NanoSIMS) we have characterized skeletal growth increments, composed of doublets of optically light and dark bands, in a broad selection of extant symbiotic and asymbiotic corals. Skeletons of zooxanthellate corals are characterized by regular <b>growth</b> <b>banding,</b> whereas in skeletons of azooxanthellate corals the <b>growth</b> <b>banding</b> is irregular. Importantly, the regularity of <b>growth</b> <b>bands</b> can be easily quantified with a coefficient of variation obtained by measuring bandwidths on SEM images of polished and etched skeletal surfaces of septa and/or walls. We find that this coefficient of variation (lower values indicate higher regularity) ranges from ~ 40 to ~ 90 % in azooxanthellate corals and from ~ 5 to ~ 15 % in symbiotic species. With more than 90 % (28 out of 31) of the studied corals conforming to this microstructural criterion, it represents an easy and robust method to discriminate between zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate corals. This microstructural criterion has been applied to the exceptionally preserved skeleton of the Triassic (Norian, ca. 215 Ma) scleractinian Volzeia sp., which contains the first example of regular, fine-scale banding of thickening deposits in a fossil coral of this age. The regularity of its <b>growth</b> <b>banding</b> strongly suggests that the coral was symbiotic with zooxanthellates...|$|R
40|$|Determining the age {{of sharks}} using {{vertebral}} banding is a vital component of management, but the causes of banding are not fully understood. Traditional shark ageing is based on fish otolith ageing methods where <b>growth</b> <b>bands</b> are assumed to result from varied seasonal calcification rates. Here we investigate these assumptions by mapping elemental distribution within the <b>growth</b> <b>bands</b> of vertebrae from six species of sharks representing four different taxonomic orders using scanning x-ray fluorescence microscopy.

Age, growth, and longevity estimates useful for stock assessment and fishery models, however, require some form of validation. By counting vertebral <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> pairs, ages can be estimated, but because not all sharks deposit annual growth bands and many are not easily discernable, {{it is necessary to}} validate <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> periodicity with an independent method.

The results from the wild individual suggest depth migration is recorded by the shell, but are not consistent with a simple sinusoidal, diurnal depth change pattern. To create the observed range of δ 18 O, however, this Nautilus must have traversed a temperature gradient of at least ~ 12 °C, corresponding to approximately 400 m depth change. Isotopic variation was also measured in the aquarium-reared sample, but the pattern within and between bands likely reflects evaporative enrichment arising from a weekly cycle of refill and replacement of the aquarium water.

First modern Adriatic corals from Mljet (Croatia) where growth temperatures were known were studied. A clear sinusoidal cyclicity {{is present in}} both the δ 18 O and trace element (Sr, Mg, U, etc.) composition of the modern coral skeletons. Cyclicity approximately matches the number of seasonal <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> pairs in each corallite, implying a genetic link between these cycles and factors that determine seasonal <b>growth</b> <b>band</b> development, in this case mainly water temperature. It is found that C. caespitosa do not calcify in equilibrium with seawater in respect {{to any of the}} proxies analysed. Much intra-site variation is observed in trace element composition between coral colonies so this is not useful for production of a reliable palaeothermometer. For δ 18 O and Δ 47 however, the offset, from what would be expected for aragonite precipitated in equilibrium with water, appears constant and so it was possible to derive a species-specific δ 18 O-temperature calibration equation, although more work needs to be done on Δ 47. The δ 18 O-temperature calibration equation was applied to well-preserved corals collected from late Pleistocene deposits, MIS 1, 5, 7, in central Greece. The fossils contain ‘similar to modern’ δ 18 O values and variability in all proxies preserving growth environment seasonal signatures. MIS 5 e, which has the best supporting contextual palaeoclimatic information, was found to be the warmest period studied with a lower than modern seasonal temperature range. The Early-Mid Holocene probably Sam Royle Abstract iii experienced the coolest temperatures while conditions in MIS 7 a/c were probably the wettest with most freshwater input into the Gulf...|$|E

The initial rate of racemization is extraordinarily rapid (0. 6 % per year) but slows in older <b>growth</b> <b>bands</b> to 0. 04 % per year (4 % per century). The skeletal proteins show progressive hydrolysis with increasing age, with free aspartic acid comprising 16 % of the total aspartic acid in the 350 -year-old band. The proteins are unusually rich in aspartic acid (nearly 50 mol%). The relative weakness of the peptide bonds formed by aspartic acid moieties is probably responsible for the rapid hydrolysis and consequent rapid racemization of aspartic acid. Racemization analysis provides a means for checking for sections of missing bands in corals and for screening of prospective samples for U-Th dating. © 1992...|$|R
