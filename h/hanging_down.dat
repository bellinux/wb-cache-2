5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head <b>hanging</b> <b>down,</b> exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E

25|$|Another in situ {{observation}} {{of three different}} whipnose anglerfish showed unusual upside-down swimming behavior. Fish were observed floating upside-down completely motionless with the illicium <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> stiffly in a slight arch {{in front of the}} fish. The illicium was hanging over small visible burrows. It was suggested this is an effort to entice prey and an example of low-energy opportunistic foraging and predation. When the ROV approached the fish, they exhibited burst swimming, still upside-down.|$|E
25|$|Pendulous breasts {{can make}} it {{difficult}} for a person to properly fit a bra. For best results, the breasts should be measured twice: once when standing upright, once bending over at the waist with the breasts <b>hanging</b> <b>down.</b> If the difference between these two measurements is more than 10cm, then the average is chosen for calculating the cup size. A number of reports, surveys and studies in different countries have found that between 80% to 85% of women wear incorrectly fitted bras.|$|E

25|$|Greek chariots {{were made}} to be drawn by two horses {{attached}} to a central pole. If two additional horses were added, they were attached {{on each side of}} the main pair by a single bar or trace fastened to the front or prow of the chariot, as may be seen on two prize vases in the British Museum from the Panathenaic Games at Athens, Greece, in which the driver is seated with feet resting on a board <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> in front close to the legs of the horses. The biga itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels. Greek chariots appear to have lacked any other attachment for the horses, which would have made turning difficult.|$|E
25|$|Saul Swimmer's Concert for Bangladesh {{documentary}} combined {{footage from}} both of the Madison Square Garden shows held on 1 August 1971, using George Harrison's preference of the performances of the songs. Harrison later explained {{that much of the}} concert footage was unusable, as a camera on the right-hand side of the venue was faulty and out of focus throughout, while the one opposite, down the left side, had cables <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> in front of it. The compromised quality would result in some brutal edits in the released movie – Eric Clapton, for instance, appears to change jackets and guitar part-way through a song (Leon Russell's medley in particular). In an interview accompanying the 2005 DVD release of the film, Swimmer would cite the audio syncing and the frame-by-frame conversion to 70mm format (from the original 16mm) as other challenging, labour-intensive tasks. With work almost completed on the Concert for Bangladesh live album, Harrison is said to have begun editing the footage on 6 September; at some stage during the next few months, he was joined in this lengthy process by Bob Dylan.|$|E

500|$|The American Cocker Spaniel is the {{smallest}} dog recognised by the American Kennel Club as a sporting dog, being on average between [...] high at the withers. It is a dog of normal proportions, with medium long silky fur on the body and ears, <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> on the legs and belly (known as feathering). The head has an upturned nose and the ears hang down. The breed standard states that size over [...] inches for males and [...] for females is a disqualification at conformation shows. American Cocker Spaniels weigh around [...] on average, with females of the breed usually weighing slightly less than the males.|$|E
500|$|William gave a {{more nuanced}} picture of the kings of his own day. He {{claimed to have been}} {{commissioned}} to write by King Amalric himself, but William did not allow himself to praise the king excessively; for example, Amalric did not respect the rights of the church, and although he was a good military commander, he could not stop the increasing threat from the neighbouring Muslim states. On a personal level, William admired the king's education and his interest in history and law, but also noted that Amalric had [...] "breasts like those of a woman <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> to his waist" [...] and was shocked when the king questioned the resurrection of the dead.|$|E

500|$|The Nightmare likely {{influenced}} Mary Shelley in a {{scene from}} her famous Gothic novel Frankenstein (1818). Shelley would have been familiar with the painting; her parents, Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, knew Fuseli. The iconic imagery associated with the Creature's murder of the protagonist Victor's wife seems to draw from the canvas: [...] "She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head <b>hanging</b> <b>down,</b> and her pale and distorted features half covered by hair." [...] The novel and Fuseli's biography share a parallel theme: just as Fuseli's incubus is infused with the artist's emotions in seeing Landholdt marry another man, Shelley's monster promises to get revenge on Victor {{on the night of}} his wedding. Like Frankenstein's monster, Fuseli's demon symbolically seeks to forestall a marriage.|$|E
500|$|Before dawn on 1 February, {{with the}} sky still {{shrouded}} in darkness, Washington collided with [...] when the latter left formation to fuel four destroyers. Indiana had radioed {{that she was}} going to make a turn to port out of the formation, but soon after starting the turn, its captain ordered a reversal, back to starboard. About seven minutes later, she came into view of lookouts aboard Washington at a range of [...] Although crews on both ships frantically tried to avoid the other, it was to no avail; Washington gave Indiana a glancing blow, scraping down a large aft portion of the ship's starboard side. Washingtons fore end was severely damaged, with about [...] of its bow <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> and into the water. Ten men, six from Washington, were killed or listed as missing. After temporary reinforcements to the damaged section, she was forced to sail to Pearl Harbor to be fitted with a false bow to make possible a voyage to Puget Sound. Once there, she received a full overhaul, along with a new bow; this work lasted from March until April. Washington did not enter the war zone again until late May.|$|E
500|$|Spores are {{dispersed}} when a peridiole is dislodged by raindrops {{or water}} dripping off an over-hanging leaf. The smooth inner {{walls of the}} fruiting body consistently form an angle of 70–75° with the horizontal; it has been demonstrated experimentally that the combined effect of the crucible shape and internal wall angle produce a good splash action. [...] The force of the falling water splashes out the peridiole, uncoiling and snapping the funiculus, the cord that connects it to the fruiting body. As the peridiole continues its flight, the funiculus extends to its full length. The sticky end of the funiculus may adhere to a leaf or a twig some distance away, and the peridiole may end up being wrapped around or <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> the object to which the funiculus is stuck. The spores can germinate when the thick outer wall of the peridiole wears away, or the peridiole may be eaten by a herbivorous animal, and ultimately passed through its digestive system. This method of spore dispersal, first suggested by John Ray in the late 17th century, was tested experimentally by Martin (1927), and more thoroughly by Buller and Brodie in the 1940s.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{was directed by}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who had previously directed Madonna's videos for [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] and [...] "Justify My Love". It was shot over two days, May 6 to 7, 1995 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and was created under Palomar Productions' Anita Wetterstedt. The video was choreographed by Jamie King, who later directed Madonna's concert tours. [...] "She wanted me to dance in her 'Human Nature' video. I didn't want to do it, but she begged", he stated. King {{was one of the}} dancers in the S attires <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> from a swinging trapeze in the video. Her dancer Luca Tommassini was the choreography assistant. Madonna's main inspiration behind the video was the work of artist Eric Stanton who did S inspired drawings. The singer enlisted Mondino to direct the video and wanted to be about the fun aspects of Stanton's work and more dance-oriented than her previous videos from Bedtime Stories. For Mondino, the main problem was that he did not prefer too much dancing in the videos, because that resulted in extra editing.|$|E
500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> over his popping-out tummy, and it was all very sad and tense".|$|E
500|$|Allen's {{show with}} Presley had, {{for the first}} time, beaten CBS's Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings. Sullivan, despite his June pronouncement, booked the singer for three {{appearances}} for an unprecedented $50,000. The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience. Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan recuperated from a car accident. Presley appeared in two segments that night from CBS Television City in Los Angeles, during which he was shot from only the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows with his producer, Sullivan said that Presley [...] "got some kind of device <b>hanging</b> <b>down</b> below the crotch of his pants–so when he moves his legs back and forth {{you can see the}} outline of his cock.... I think it's a Coke bottle.... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!" [...] Sullivan publicly told TV Guide, [...] "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots." [...] In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe in the first and second shows. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming. Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad [...] "Love Me Tender", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders. More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that made Presley a national celebrity.|$|E
