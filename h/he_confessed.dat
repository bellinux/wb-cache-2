5|$|After Flores' {{murder on}} 30 May 2010—five {{years to the}} day after Holloway's disappearance—Van der Sloot fled to Chile, where he was arrested and extradited back to Peru for {{questioning}} regarding the murder. On 7 June 2010, <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> to bludgeoning Ramírez. He later tried to formally retract his confession, claiming that he had been intimidated by the National Police of Peru and framed by the FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that the confession was valid and on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for Flores' murder.|$|E

5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in east Moscow, Streltsov joined Torpedo {{at the age of}} 16 in 1953 and made his {{international}} debut two years later. He was part of the squad that won the gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, and came seventh in the 1957 Ballon d'Or. Early the next year his promising career was interrupted by a rape scandal. The 20-year-old Streltsov was accused of raping a woman shortly before the 1958 World Cup; told he could still play if he admitted his guilt, <b>he</b> <b>confessed,</b> despite inconclusive evidence against him. He was instead convicted and sentenced to twelve years in the Gulag system of forced labour camps.|$|E
5|$|By 1547, {{opposition}} to Calvin and other French refugee ministers {{had grown to}} constitute {{the majority of the}} syndics, the civil magistrates of Geneva. On 27 June an unsigned threatening letter in Genevan dialect was found at the pulpit of St. Pierre Cathedral where Calvin preached. Suspecting a plot against both the church and the state, the council appointed a commission to investigate. Jacques Gruet, a Genevan member of Favre's group, was arrested and incriminating evidence was found when his house was searched. Under torture, <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> to several crimes including writing the letter left in the pulpit which threatened the church leaders. A civil court condemned Gruet to death and he was beheaded on 26 July. Calvin was not opposed to the civil court's decision.|$|E

Two days after the killings, a friend of Saari's, named Rauno, told 7 päivää that at 11:53 he received a call from Saari in which <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> to having killed ten people. Saari is claimed to have spoken to Rauno in a calm manner, telling him that he wanted to say goodbye. He was found alive by the police at 12:30, having shot himself in the head. He was taken to Tampere University Hospital, where he was treated for his gunshot wound. He died a short time later at 17:40.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{dreams of}} a red light that leads him to the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> to all of the murders.|$|E

Sunarti, incredulous that her husband could be a murderer, wrote letters to several high-ranking officials and bodies, including President Suharto. Only one, to the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM), received a reply: on 28 October, the commission {{announced that it would}} investigate irregularities in Sumaji's arrest and internment. Meanwhile, Sumaji's counsel and the White Kijang team located several witnesses to corroborate Sumaji's account, including the prostitute.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} section of Eusebius' Historia on Philip's religious beliefs describes the emperor's {{visit to a}} church on Easter Eve when he was denied entry by the presiding bishop until <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> his sins. The account is paralleled by Chrysostom's homily, which celebrates Saint Babylas, Bishop of Antioch, for denying a sinful emperor entry to his church; and quotations of Leontius in the Chronicon Paschale which describe Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of murdering his predecessor. Given the parallels between the accounts, most scholars believe that Eusebius, Chrysostom, and Leontius are referring to the same event (or legend).|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Liverpool, {{he was put}} in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and was made a director of NEMS in 1955. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for only one day, was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. He did not want his parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool. Back in Liverpool, <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their best league finish since 1997–98, Benfica negotiated a one-year extension to Camacho's contract, which had been set to expire on 30 June. As a condition to agreeing to stay, he wanted several problems related to the technical staff, training fields and signings to be solved. On 23 June, Camacho agreed to remain as manager, with Pepe Carcelén and Álvaro Magalhães assisting him. In his presentation, <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> that the club's limited finances would {{make it harder to}} sign players; he also said that Benfica would give their best but did not expect to dethrone Porto. Benfica inquired after Helton, and Ricardo to compete with José Moreira for the goalkeeper position. Over the course of two weeks, the club negotiated unsuccessfully with the latter and ultimately chose to stay with Moreira. The club also looked into strengthen their options at centre and at left-back, negotiating unsuccessfully with Ânderson Polga, Atouba and Júnior. Despite these failed negotiations, Benfica added Luisão, and re-signed Geovanni; both would be regular starters throughout the season.|$|E

5|$|The case {{began when}} the {{investigation}} of an automobile rollover accident during Mateen Cleaves' 1996 Michigan Wolverines recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated {{over the next few}} years and by 1999 several were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball players (Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his perjury during a federal grand jury investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by National Basketball Association after performing public service.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E
5|$|Two {{extensive}} espionage {{cases in}} Sweden during the Cold War involved Boden Fortress, both exposed in 1951. The Enbom case involved Fritiof Enbom, a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden, {{and later the}} local editor for the communist newspaper Norrskensflamman. He was exposed by his own careless talkoften {{under the influence of}} alcoholto the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the Swedish Security Service after the Christmas holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952. During interrogation, <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> that hefrom February 1943 to April 1951had met with Soviet employers around 25 times. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from public sources, but also secrets, of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of the pieces of information that concerned Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications. He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour, but was released after ten years. The other case involved Ernst Hilding Andersson, who was arrested on 21 September 1951. He had carried out seven missions for the Soviets and had provided them primarily with information regarding the Swedish Navy, but also information on the fortifications along the Norrland coast, and an initiated report about Boden Fortress and the airforce unit located in Boden and Luleå, Norrbottens flygbaskår. Andersson was, like Fritjof Enbom, sentenced to hard labour for life.|$|E

5|$|Umar and {{his senate}} {{identified}} this act as misuse of state treasure, {{though not as}} punishing as to lose one's office, Khalid was already warned not act as alone, he should seek permission from his commander or Caliph for such actions. He immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Abu Ubaidah asking him to bring Khalid in front of the congregation, his turban, and take off his cap. Umar wanted Abu Ubaida to ask Khalid from what funds he gave to Ash'as: from his own pocket or from the state treasury? If <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> to having used the spoils, he was guilty of misappropriation. If he claimed that he gave from his own pocket, he was guilty of extravagance. In either case he would be dismissed, and Abu Ubaida would take charge of his duties. Abu Ubaida was himself an admirer of Khalid and loved him as his younger brother, and so said that he was not capable of doing it. Instead, Bilal ibn Ribah was appointed for this task and called back Khalid from Chalcis to Emessa, where he was charged publicly. Khalid stated that he gave money from his own pocket and thus was declared innocent in that charge. However, when he went to Abu Ubaida, he told him that he had been dismissed on the order of Umar and is required to go back to Medina.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E
5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, <b>he</b> <b>confessed</b> {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E
