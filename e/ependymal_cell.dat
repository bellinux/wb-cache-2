We examined the brains of adult C 57 BL/ 6 mice and found that <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> located in the adhesions of the medial and lateral walls of the rostral LVs upregulated parvalbumin (PV) and displayed reactive phenotype, similarly to injury-reactive <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells.</b> However, PV+ <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> in the LV-wall adhesions, unlike injury-reactive ones, did not express glial fibrillary acidic protein. S 100 B+/PV+ <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> found in younger mice diminished in the LV-wall adhesions throughout aging. We found that periventricular PV-immunofluorescence showed positive correlation to the grade of LV stenosis in nonaged mice (10 -month-old) PV-knock out (PV-KO) mice. This suggests an involvement of PV+ <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> in aging-associated ventricle stenosis. Additionally, we observed a time-shift in microglial activation in the LV-wall adhesions between age-grouped PV- KO and wild-type mice, suggesting a delay in microglial activation when PV is absent from <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells.</b> Our findings implicate that compromised <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> of the adhering ependymal layers upregulate PV and display phenotype shift to “reactive” <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> in aging-related ventricle stenosis; moreover, they also contribute to the progression of LV-wall fusion associated with a decline of the affected SVZ-stem cell niche in aged mice...|$|R

We have shown previously that endogenous stem cell potential is confined to <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> in the adult spinal cord which could be targeted for non-invasive SCI therapy. However, <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> are an understudied cell population.

We show that spinal cord stem cell potential in vitro is contained within these cells by birth. Moreover, juvenile cultures generate more neurospheres and more oligodendrocytes than adult ones. Interestingly, juvenile <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo contribute to glial scar formation after severe but not mild SCI, due to a more effective sealing of the lesion by other glial cells.

Although considered postmitotic {{and completely}} differentiated, <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> maintain some phenotypic characteristics of neural stem cells. Thereby, under specific conditions they behave as neural stem cells, developing radial glia characteristics, and undergoing asymmetric division. Our group is searching for factors that promote dedifferentiation of <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro. We developed a simple method to obtain pure cultures of non-adherent multiciliated <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> from adult rats. These cultures were used to investigate the effect of FGF 2 on the differentiation state and the aggregation of <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, FGF 2 treated <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> lose cilia and hence mobility, and after 7 days they aggregate to form irregular spheres (diameter ≥ 20 - 30 μm). Such changes were not observed when EFG was used instead of FGF 2. To assess the specificity of FGF 2 action on cell aggregation, the FGF receptor inhibitor PD 166866 and an anti-FGF 2 neutralizing antibody were used. In both conditions the aggregative effect of FGF 2 was abolished. No cell proliferation was observed during sphere formation, at least in such experimental conditions. Spheres were analyzed by immunocytochemistry using radial glia markers. They were positive for GFAP, vimentin, BLBP and GLAST.

5000|$|The choroid plexus {{consists}} of a layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a core of capillaries and loose connective tissue. The epithelium of the choroid plexus is continuous with the <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> layer that lines the ventricles, but unlike the ependyma, the epithelial layer has tight junctions between the cells on the side facing the ventricle (apical surface). These tight junctions prevent the majority of substances from crossing the cell layer into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); thus the choroid plexus acts as a blood-CSF barrier. The choroid plexus folds into many villi around each capillary, creating frond-like processes that project into the ventricles. The villi, along with a brush border of microvilli, greatly increases the surface area of the choroid plexus. CSF is formed as plasma is filtered from the blood through the epithelial cells. Choroid plexus epithelial cells actively transport sodium ions into the ventricles and water follows the resulting osmotic gradient.|$|E

The first divisions of the progenitor cells are symmetric, which duplicates the total number of progenitor cells at each mitotic cycle. Then, some progenitor cells begin to divide asymmetrically, producing one postmitotic cell that migrates along the radial glial fibers, leaving the ventricular zone, and one progenitor cell, which continues to divide until the end of development, when it differentiates into a glial cell or an <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell.</b> As the G1 phase of mitosis is elongated, in what is seen as selective cell-cycle lengthening, the newly-born neurons migrate to more superficial layers of the cortex.

Within this region, <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been identified as}} neural stem cells however very little is known about their properties and how the local environment, including neurotransmitters, is capable of affecting them. The neurotransmitter GABA is present around the central canal and is known to affect cells within other postnatal neurogenic niches. This study used whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and intracellular dye-loading in in vitro Wistar rat spinal cord slices to characterise <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> and their ability to respond to GABA. <b>Ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> were defined by their passive response properties and low input resistances.

In response to a lesion, astrocytes give rise to ependymal cells and ependymal cells give rise to niche astrocytes. We identify EphB 2 forward signaling as a key pathway regulating niche cell plasticity. EphB 2 acts downstream of Notch and is required for the maintenance of <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> characteristics, thereby inhibiting the transition from <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> to astrocyte.

40|$|During {{the first}} {{postnatal}} week of mouse development, radial glial cells lining the ventricles {{of the brain}} differentiate into ependymal cells, undergoing a morphological change from pseudostratified cuboidal cells to a flattened monolayer. Concomitant with this change, multiple motile cilia are generated and aligned on each nascent <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell.</b> Proper <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> development is crucial to forming the brain tissue:CSF barrier, and {{to the establishment of}} ciliary CSF flow, but the mechanisms that regulate this differentiation event are poorly understood. The JhylacZ mouse line carries an insertional mutation in the Jhy gene (formerly 4931429 I 11 Rik), and homozygous JhylacZ/lacZ mice develop a rapidly progressive juvenile hydrocephalus, with defects in ependymal cilia morphology and ultrastructure. Here we show that beyond just defective motile cilia, JhylacZ/lacZ mice display abnormal <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. Ventricular ependyma in JhylacZ/lacZ mice retain an unorganized and multi-layered morphology, representative of undifferentiated ependymal (radial glial) cells, and they show altered expression of differentiation markers. Most JhylacZ/lacZ ependymal cells do eventually acquire some differentiated ependymal characteristics, suggesting a delay, rather than a block, in the differentiation process, but ciliogenesis remains perturbed. JhylacZ/lacZ ependymal cells also manifest disruptions in adherens junction formation, with altered N-cadherin localization, and have defects in the polarized organization of the apical motile cilia that do form. Functional studies showed that cilia of JhylacZ/lacZ mice have severely reduced motility, a potential cause for the development of hydrocephalus. This work shows that JHY does not only control ciliogenesis, but is a crucial component of the ependymal differentiation process, with ciliary defects likely a consequence of altered ependymal differentiation...|$|E

In OHSCs, de novo PV-expression begins shortly after the onset of culturing, {{and the number of}} <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> implicated in this process increases with time. PV-immunopositive <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> aggregate and form compact cell clusters, which are characterized by lumen-formation and beating cilia. Scratches inflicted on such clusters with a sharp knife are rapidly closed. Exposure of OHSCs to NF-КB-inhibitors and to antioxidants reduces PV-expression in <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells,</b> thereby implicating injury-induced inflammation in this process. Indeed, in vivo stab injury enhances PV-expression in <b>ependymal</b> <b>cells</b> adjacent to the lesion, whereas neuraminidase denudation is without effect.

The number of these ectopic ependymal cells correlated positively with the magnitude of lateral ventriclar enlargement and negatively with the <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> number in the "neurogenic spot".

30|$|The {{establishment}} of a polarized cellular morphology is essential {{for a variety of}} processes including neural tube morphogenesis and the development of the brain. Cdc 42 is a Ras-related GTPase that plays an essential role in controlling cell polarity through the regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton architecture. Previous studies have shown that Cdc 42 plays an indispensable role in telencephalon development in earlier embryo developmental stage (before E 12.5). However, the functions of Cdc 42 in other parts of brain in later embryo developmental stage or in adult brain remain unclear. Thus, in order to address the role of Cdc 42 in the whole brain in later embryo developmental stage or in adulthood, we used Cre/loxP technology to generate two lines of tissuespecific Cdc 42 -knock-out mice. Inactivation of Cdc 42 was achieved in neuroepithelial cells by crossing Cdc 42 / flox mice with Nestin-Cre mice and resulted in hydrocephalus, causing death to occur within the postnatal stage. Histological analyses of the brains from these mice showed that <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation was disrupted, resulting in aqueductal stenosis. Deletion of Cdc 42 in the cerebral cortex also induced obvious defects in interkinetic nuclear migration and hypoplasia. To further explore the role of Cdc 42 in adult mice brain, we examined the effects of knocking-out Cdc 42 in radial glial cells by crossing Cdc 42 /flox mice with human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-Cre mice. Inactivation of Cdc 42 in radial glial cells resulted in hydrocephalus and <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> denudation.

It was found that the walls of the lateral ventricles move together, adhere, and eventually fuse. This results in a degradation of the SVZ. Other changes associated with aging were found, including <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> stretching, heightened, ependymal repair, changes in CSF flow velocity and dynamics, and altered <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> polarity.

The effects of injuries, including repetitive, mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) and Neuraminidase injections were also investigated. Preliminary studies on rmTBI did not produce an effect on the volume of the lateral ventricle, but did increase the prevalence of intraventricular fusion. However, further analysis is needed.

To analyze their function during brain development, we crossed Nestin-Cre mice with mice bearing a conditional E 2 f 7 /E 2 f 8 allele to delete both E 2 f 7 and E 2 f 8 in neural precursor cells. Whereas cortical development was largely unaffected by E 2 f 7 /E 2 f 8 deficiency, we observed an enlargement of the lateral ventricles occurring postnatally, a brain condition named ventriculomegaly. We then looked at the ependymal cells, which are the cells lining the wall of the lateral ventricles, to determine if these cells were affected by the absence of atypical E 2 fs. We found progressive denaturation of the <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> layer, distortion of the ependymal motile cilia and reactive astrocytes within the layer. We identified Gli 3, a component of the Sonic hedgehog pathway (Shh), as a target for E 2 fs, including atypical E 2 fs.

Given the neurological findings in patients treated with VEGF-neutralizing therapy (bevacizumab) and in patients with severe preeclampsia, which is mediated by soluble VEGF receptor 1 /soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 1 and soluble endoglin, a TGF-β signaling inhibitor, we investigated the roles of VEGF and TGF-β in choroid plexus (CP) integrity and function in adult mice.

The ependymal layer that encases the ventricles displays certain degrees of plasticity and regenerative ability due to its associated stem cell niche, the subventricular zone (SVZ). Previous research in the Conover Lab has shown that in the mouse, which maintains an actively proliferating SVZ into adulthood, there is an intact ependymal monolayer throughout normal aging, with maintained lateral ventricle size with some degree of stretching. In contrast, the human SVZ declines in proliferative capacity after infancy, and age-related changes to the ventricular lining can be seen. Here, we confirm that ventriculomegaly, or {{the expansion}} in ventricle volume, is consistent in human brains, particularly after the age of 60. We found that extensive formation of gliosis is associated with ventriculomegaly, possibly compensating for the loss of <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> coverage along the ventricle wall. In addition, we looked at the effects of injury in the form of repeated traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) on the ventricular lining. Results confirm that in mice, there is an increase in <b>ependymal</b> <b>cell</b> size correlated with increased ventricular size, along with an increased expression of astrocytes along the apical surface of the ventricles. These studies show the importance of the ventricular system in the brain, and further research could elucidate how it is implicated in neurodegeneration...|$|E
