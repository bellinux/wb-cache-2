It was reported in September 2001 {{by some of the}} European press that Sauber were looking to replace outgoing Kimi Räikkönen with Alonso although he was facing competition for the seat from Felipe Massa and then Jaguar test driver André Lotterer. A month later it was confirmed that Massa was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> vacant Sauber seat for 2002.|$|E
25|$|His driving was {{noticed by}} Colin Chapman, owner of Lotus, {{and shortly after}} his accident, hiding {{the extent of his}} injury with painkillers, Mansell {{performed}} well enough during a tryout at the Paul Ricard circuit with Lotus, where he was pitted against a number of other drivers to determine who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> second seat for the 1980 season alongside Mario Andretti, as Argentinean Carlos Reutemann was leaving to go to Williams. Driving a 79, the seat eventually went to Italian driver Elio de Angelis, but Mansell was selected to become a test driver for the Norfolk-based Formula One team.|$|E
25|$|The two McLaren {{drivers were}} the first two drivers out on the track for the initial fuel burning phase, and initially, Alonso was the fastest on the track. After {{the first set of}} pit stops it looked like Alonso was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> pole. On the last set of laps, Alonso was on a faster time than he was before, but Räikkönen was on a faster. Both of them {{completed}} their laps and Räikkönen came out on top, despite an error coming out of the final corner. Hamilton who had been sitting in fourth did not look like he was very competitive during qualifying. In the last few seconds of the session he set the fastest lap and put himself on pole position, and {{he was the only one}} to break into the 1 minute 19 second margin.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{backing from}} Sony, Media Molecule were unsure {{about exactly what}} {{direction}} they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> game. They also worried about whether people would understand, or even like the game, but these worries were dispelled after its first presentation. Media Molecule {{were aware of the}} fact that Sony wanted them to demonstrate the game at the upcoming GDC 2007, but they were not told they were to be part of Phil Harrison's keynote speech until near the date it was due to take place. Healey stated that it was only when they arrived in San Francisco for the conference that they realised just how much backing Sony were devoting to the game—much more than Media Molecule had previously thought. Healey relates that although the revelation of Sony's faith in the game boosted their confidence, additionally, it increased the pressure on them with the realisation that their task had become much greater than originally anticipated.|$|E

500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays.

500|$|After {{completing}} the album, Sony hired Bojan Bazelli {{to direct the}} song's music video. After filming the video's first version, record label executives felt the result was sub-par {{in comparison to the}} quality of the music.

After word got out of the two videos, a Sony employee spoke to the press about Carey, saying how [...] "the special treatment really upset" [...] him. He felt they treated Carey differently from how they would another artist signed to the label, and that they viewed her as a higher priority. He also claimed that Carey was the reason they re-filmed, [...] "they spend $200,000 on a video and Mariah doesn't like it. No big deal." [...] Another employee estimated the figure of both videos at over $450,000.
