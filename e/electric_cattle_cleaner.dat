50|$|A cattle prod, {{also called}} a stock prod, is a {{handheld}} device {{commonly used to}} make cattle or other livestock move by striking or poking them. An <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod is a stick with electrodes on the end {{which is used to}} make cattle move through a relatively high-voltage, low-current electric shock The <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod {{is said to have been}} invented by Texas cattle baron Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. of the King Ranch around 1930, although versions were sold as early as 1917.|$|R
50|$|Princess Python has no super human powers {{but she is}} {{a trained}} athlete and an {{extremely}} talented snake charmer and handler. She usually carries a hand held, <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod capable of discharging 1,000 volts.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod is {{designed}} to apply a painful shock to cattle, and thus [...] "prod" [...] them along; the pain stimulates movement. Some higher-voltage prods can interfere with radio and CB radio reception when activated.|$|R
25|$|In April 2009, a {{video tape}} of torture smuggled {{out of the}} UAE showed Sheikh Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan torturing a man with whips, <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods, wooden planks with {{protruding}} nails and running him over repeatedly with a car.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods {{has been}} debated by many people. Organizations such as PETA {{contend that the}} use of cattle prods is as much mentally harmful as it is physically. Most farmers contend that the short shock is {{minutely}} felt, and soon forgotten.|$|R
50|$|Livestock {{branding}} {{is perhaps}} the most prevalent use of a branding iron. Modern use includes gas heating, the traditional fire-heated method, an iron heated by electricity (<b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> branding iron) or an iron super cooled by dry ice (freeze branding iron). Cattle, horses and other livestock are commonly branded today for the same reason they were in Ancient times, to prove ownership.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{development}} of stun batons and the taser, <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods were also used on people in varying degrees. Their first common usage on people occurred during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s; prods were first adopted by police officers in Alabama to use on black protesters and agencies elsewhere followed; Hotshot later developed an electric police baton.|$|R
5000|$|The couple trained {{wild animals}} for {{television}} shows and movies, using [...] "affection methods" [...] that avoided causing pain for the animal. But Pat disagreed with Ted's {{use of an}} <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod in training, and they divorced in the mid-1970s. She trained animals for the CBS television series Lassie, Gentle Ben and Daktari and the NBC series Flipper. She also worked on the Lincoln-Mercury ad campaign that featured Farrah Fawcett with two cougars in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|Ranchers {{and farmers}} {{typically}} {{use the term}} [...] "cattle prods" [...] mainly to refer to simple non-electrified fiberglass or metal goads used to physically encourage cattle into motion; {{the majority of people}} living outside of rural areas use the term 'cattle prod' exclusively for the electrified variant. Most ranchers and farmers refer to <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods as [...] "hotshots" [...] (this {{is an example of a}} genericized trademark; one of the most prominent brands of electric prod is Hot-Shot).|$|R
50|$|Civil {{rights groups}} such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) {{organized}} across the South with tactics such as boycotts, voter registration campaigns, Freedom Rides and other nonviolent direct action, such as marches, pickets and sit-ins to mobilize around issues of equal access and voting rights. Southern segregationists fought back to block reform. The conflict grew to involve steadily escalating physical violence, bombings and intimidation by Southern whites. Law enforcement responded to protesters with batons, <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods, fire hoses, attack dogs and mass arrests.|$|R
50|$|Pastor Coronel was {{the chief}} of the Department of Investigations, or secret police. He would {{interview}} people in a pileta, a bath of human excrement or ram <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods up their rectums. The Secretary of the Paraguayan Communist Party, Miguel Soler, was dismembered alive with a chainsaw while Stroessner listened on the phone. The screams of tortured dissidents would often be recorded and played over the phone to family members, and sometimes the bloody garments of those killed were sent to their homes.|$|R
2500|$|The Voice of America {{translated}} the speeches and rebroadcast them in 36 languages. The United States Information Agency organized {{a press conference}} {{for the benefit of}} foreign journalists, and also created a documentary film of the event for distribution to embassies abroad. Commented Michael Thelwell of SNCC: [...] "So it happened that Negro students from the South, some of whom still had unhealed bruises from the <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods which Southern police used to break up demonstrations, were recorded for the screens of the world portraying 'American Democracy at Work.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|The larger baton-style prods {{are similar}} in basic design to an <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod. [...] It has a metal end split into two parts {{electrically}} insulated from each other, or two thin projecting metal electrodes about [...] apart, at an end of a shaft containing the batteries and mechanism. At {{the other end of}} the shaft are a handle and a switch. Both electrodes must touch the subject. In some types the sides of the baton can be electrified to stop the subject from grasping the baton above the electrodes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>cattle</b> guards use {{electricity}} to deter animals from crossing the fence line. There are different designs. One uses high-tensile wire {{run across the}} roadway, about 3 to 4 in off the ground, attached to a power source on one side. The primary advantage is cost and ease of installation. Drawbacks include the necessity of spraying vegetation with herbicides to keep weeds from shorting out the grid {{if there is no}} barrier between the wires and the ground. Also, some low-riding vehicles can catch the wires and tear them out.|$|R
50|$|The beatings {{after the}} flag-raising {{ceremony}} was not isolated incident. Torture was {{used against the}} nuns throughout their detention. These included the use of many instruments of physical torture; {{including the use of}} hard labour the use of metal bars, and <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods and suspending her by her arms with her arms tied behind her back. However, Ngawang states that the psychological torture was far worse. Ngawang still suffers from headaches, stomach and kidney problems due to how she was treated and due to her exile {{has not been able to}} visit her family.|$|R
50|$|The larger baton-style prods {{are similar}} in basic design to an <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod.

In some types the sides of the baton can be electrified to stop the subject from grasping the baton above the electrodes.|$|R
5000|$|In April and May 2011, an {{undercover}} investigator shot footage at McConnell’s stable. The footage revealed two workers, Jeff Dockery and John Mays, applying caustic substances that cause soring to horses’ legs and hooves and beating the animals {{with a wooden}} beam and an <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod to make them stand still during leg palpation. [...] Soon after the undercover footage was released, state authorities raided McConnell’s barn. After ABC News aired the footage, McConnell was banned for life from the Tennessee Walking Horse organization’s biggest event and stricken from its hall of fame.|$|R

25|$|There {{are three}} basic {{areas of concern}} to various groups. The first set of {{concerns}} surround relatively common rodeo practices, {{such as the use}} of bucking straps, also known as flank straps, the use of metal or <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods, and tail-twisting. The second set of concerns surround non-traditional rodeo events that operate outside the rules of sanctioning organizations. These are usually amateur events such as mutton busting, calf dressing, wild cow milking, calf riding, chuck wagon races, and other events designed primarily for publicity, half-time entertainment or crowd participation. Finally, some groups consider some or all rodeo events themselves to be cruel.|$|R
50|$|Critics also {{claim that}} <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods ("hot shots") {{are used to}} injure and torture bulls, while {{supporters}} of bull riding claim that the cattle prod simply gets the bull out of the chute quickly and is only a moderate irritation due to {{the thickness of the}} animal's hide. Cattle prods have not been used in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour for several years. However, in smaller associations, a cattle prod is still sometimes used to ensure that the animal leaves the chute as soon as the rider nods their head. Cattle prods are not allowed by any major association.|$|R
50|$|An {{investigation}} by ABC News into the training methods of Tennessee Walking Horses revealed that many horses had been tortured and beaten {{to make them}} produce their signature high-stepping gait. In a video shot by the Humane Society of the United States, high-profile trainer Jackie McConnell is seen beating horses, using <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods, and soring their hooves with caustic chemicals. Additionally, a random inspection by the Department of Agriculture at the 2011 annual championship found {{that all of the}} 52 horses inspected had a foreign substance applied to their front hooves, either to cause pain or hide it.|$|R

50|$|The United States {{supported}} Alfredo Stroessner's anti-communist {{military dictatorship}} {{in many ways}} like with the U.S. Army officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Thierry, who sent to help the local workmen to build a detention and interrogation center named “La Technica.” as part of Operation Condor. La Technica was also a well known torture centre. Stroessner's secret police, headed by Pastor Coronel, bathed their captives in human excrement, and shocked them in the rectum with <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods; they even dismembered the Communist party secretary alive with a chainsaw while Stroessner listened on the phone. Stroessner demanded the tapes of detainees screaming in pain to be played to their family members.|$|R
50|$|The picana is {{a hybrid}} {{electroshock}} weapon {{adapted from the}} <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod, the precursor for today's stun guns. Originally cattle prods were devices developed {{for use as a}} goad in animal slaughterhouses, but later were used on humans as torture devices intended to exact pain and incapacitate a person. The picana is reported as having been used in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1932. The device was a notorious innovation introduced by police chief Polo Lugones, son of the famous poet and novelist Leopoldo Lugones. Its use did not spread to other countries until the 1970s, when it was in use in Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay.|$|R
5000|$|Realizing {{that it is}} Halloween, Richie forms a plan; he and Eddie will go trick-or-treating {{to raise}} money for a party which will feature, in Richie's words, [...] "plenty of booze and jugged-up babes, shaggy-shaggy-shag!" [...] They go down to the local costume shop, with Richie returns wearing a woman's devil outfit and Eddie ends up dressed up in a giant banana costume. To make sure that people give them money, Richie asks Eddie to bring along an <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod which they have somehow obtained; unfortunately, when Richie tries to use it, the {{electricity}} arcs back and causes Richie's bowels to loosen, ruining one of his three pairs of tights.|$|R
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} in Chengdu was more violent. On {{the morning of}} June 4, police forcibly broke up the student demonstration taking place in Chengdu's main square. The resulting violence killed eight people, and injured hundreds more. The most brutal attacks occurred on June 5 and 6. Witnesses estimate that 30 to 100 bodies were thrown onto a truck after a crowd broke into the Jinjiang Hotel. According to Amnesty International, at least 300 {{people were killed in}} Chengdu on June 5. Troops in Chengdu used concussion grenades, truncheons, knives and <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods against civilians. Hospitals were ordered to not accept students and on the second night the ambulance service was stopped by police.|$|R
5000|$|Buccieri, {{along with}} Jackie [...] "The Lackey" [...] Cerone, James [...] "Turk" [...] Torello, Samuel [...] "Mad Sam" [...] DeStefano and Dave Yaras {{participated in the}} infamous torture murder of loanshark William [...] "Action" [...] Jackson. The Outfit {{suspected}} Jackson of stealing its money and working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as an informant. The 300-pound Jackson was hung on a meat hook and tortured with ice picks, baseball bats, a blow torch and an <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod. This ordeal went on for three days, until Jackson finally died of shock. Federal authorities later obtained details of Jackson's murder from conversations overheard between Buccieri and Cerone. As it turned out, Jackson was not an FBI informant.|$|R

50|$|In April 2009 a {{video tape}} of torture smuggled {{out of the}} United Arab Emirates showed Issa mercilessly torturing a man with whips, <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods, wooden planks with {{protruding}} nails and running him over repeatedly with an SUV. The same person may have been allegedly sodomised, but the Emirati court found him not guilty of any crime and instead condemned and sentenced two brothers for using the video as blackmail. The court was accused, by respected international human rights observers, to have not delivered justice. In addition to this, Issa was alleged to have illtreated several other men, mostly foreign nationals, and to have ordered himself to film his tortures to the victims to sadistically enjoy watching them later.|$|R
50|$|Walter {{realizes that}} Jesse {{has also been}} cooking in the lab. Walter pleads for them to stick {{together}} to thwart Gus, but Jesse, still bitter after their fight, turns his back on Walter. Walter is suddenly paralyzed with an <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod by Tyrus (Ray Campbell) and brought to the desert where Gus confronts him. Gus tells Walter that he is fired, warning him {{to stay away from}} Jesse, and that although he cannot kill Walter due to Jesse's continuing loyalty to him, he asserts that Jesse will inevitably relinquish that loyalty and side with Gus, effectively eliminating what little protection Walter still enjoys. Gus also says that Walter has failed to stop Hank's investigation so Hank will need to be killed, and if Walter interferes, Gus will kill Walter's entire family.|$|R

In December 2009, Issa appeared in court and proclaimed his innocence. The trial ended on 10 January 2010, when Issa was cleared of the torture of Mohammed Shah Poor. Human Rights Watch criticised the trial and called on the government to establish an independent body to investigate allegations of abuse by UAE security personnel and other persons of authority. The US State Department has expressed concern over the verdict and said all members of Emirati society [...] "must stand equal before the law" [...] {{and called for a}} careful review of the decision to ensure that the demands of justice are fully met in this case.|$|R
50|$|In an <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod, {{which is}} the {{precursor}} to the modern day stun gun, dual surface electrodes produce a very high voltage/very low amperage electric arc between them, which, when pressed against conductive skin, produces a painful but superficial electric shock which stimulates the target to cease their current activity and move in the direction opposite {{the source of the}} pain. With higher amperage, the cattle prod is the equivalent of a stun gun and functions exactly the same way. Cattle prods are the precursor to direct contact electric stun guns used against humans, and their basic operating principles are the same: The major differences are primarily in the matter of size and power: cattle prods tend to have a higher electric current and a longer handle than stun guns, which is helpful when dealing with very large, powerful animals or humans as a torture device.|$|R

5000|$|According {{to former}} Willow Springs, Illinois, police chief Michael Corbitt, {{statements}} by Outfit Capo Sal Bastone implicated Spilotro {{in the murder}} of former Chicago Outfit boss Sam Giancana. The FBI believes Spilotro was also involved in the torture murder of loan shark enforcer William [...] "Action" [...] Jackson, who worked for DeStefano in the 1950s and 1960s. The Chicago Outfit mistakenly believed Jackson had become an FBI informant in 1961. A gang led by Sam DeStefano took Jackson to a meat packing plant, where they hung him by a meat hook inside the rectum and then crippled Jackson by smashing his knees with a hammer and poking his genitals with an <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prod in an attempt to get him to confess to being an informant. Jackson was left near death for three days before finally succumbing to his injuries. Allegedly, Spilotro {{was a member of the}} gang that tortured and murdered him.|$|R
5000|$|Critics gave Itchy & Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness {{generally}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Nintendo Power {{gave it a}} 2.825/5 rating in their August 1994 issue. In February 1995, VideoGames & Computer Entertainment wrote that [...] "You'll never know just how fun miniature golf can be until you play this Itchy and Scratchy game. The unique gameplay sets it apart from other platform games, You play as Scratchy, who's trapped in a miniature golf park, Itchy's after Scratchy, equipped with chainsaws, <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods and flame throwers. You've got to maneuver your golf ball through each level. And watch out for all those little golf ball traps. You'll see plenty of innovative miniature golf contraptions. You get a golf game and an action game all in one." [...] The magazine gave Miniature Golf Madness a 9 out of 10 rating. GamePro rated the game 11.5/20, commenting that the controls are accurate but the graphics are boring and the music is repetitive, making an overall mediocre game.|$|R
5000|$|Increasingly {{concerned}} {{over the}} growing popular opposition, Stasi Minister Mielke early in 1989 ordered {{the creation of}} a special elite unit for crushing disturbances. Its personnel were carefully selected members of the counterespionage and counterterrorism directorate. They were equipped with special batons similar to <b>electric</b> <b>cattle</b> prods but much more powerful. In a secret speech to top-ranking Stasi officers on June 29, Mielke warned that, [...] "hostile opposing forces and groups have already achieved a measure of power and are using all methods to achieve a change in the balance of power." [...] Former Stasi Colonel Rainer Wiegand told me he was horrified when Mielke compared the situation with that of China two months earlier. Chinese students in Beijing had begun massive protests in April and in May, during a student demonstration in Tiananmen Square, security troops had opened fire on them killing hundreds. [...] "Mielke said our situation was comparable and we had to be ready to counter it with all means and methods," [...] Wiegand recalled. [...] "Mielke said that the Chinese leadership had succeeded in smothering the protests before the situation got out of hand." ...|$|R
