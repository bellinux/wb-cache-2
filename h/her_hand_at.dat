25|$|In Far and Near a {{young woman}} tries <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> {{managing}} the family rice mill only to learn about every possible form that government corruption as applied to rice millers can take. There's so much realistic detail the story {{must be at least}} partially factual. By the end the government officials seem no better than the rats that gnaw through the rice sacks in search of their plunder.|$|E
25|$|Wells used singing as her {{comfort from}} her pain and by age 10 had {{graduated}} from church choirs to performing at local nightclubs in the Detroit area. Wells graduated from Detroit's Northwestern High School {{at the age of}} 17 and set her sights on becoming a scientist, but after hearing about the success of Detroit musicians such as Jackie Wilson and the Miracles, she decided to try <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> music as a singer-songwriter.|$|E

25|$|Her first sports {{commentary}} job came in 1985 {{when she}} was asked to cover a tennis tournament for a local sports radio station. Impressed by her work, the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation persuaded her to try <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> covering cricket, and in 1987 she covered her first Shell Shield match. She moved on to covering West Indies Test cricket, and her first commentary was West Indies vs Pakistan at Barbados in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Not {{completely}} {{satisfied with}} the play itself, Christie decided to try <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> playwrighting and wrote Black Coffee – a stage play not based on a previous work and again featuring Poirot. It was first presented in 1930 but after this Christie decided that Poirot was too strong a character to be portrayed on stage and removed him from all of her own subsequent adaptations of her books. She did, however, allow Arnold Ridley to include the character in his 1940 adaptation of Peril at End House.|$|E
25|$|In {{her later}} years, Rickey fell {{on hard times}} with declining health and {{financial}} woes. She took a church mission trip to Mexico in 1996 and returned with a mysterious virus which ruined her health. Thereafter, {{she was diagnosed with}} Crohn's disease and hypertension. She was a former Presbyterian who had converted to Roman Catholicism. Unable to find steady employment and with high-deductible health insurance coverage, she had practically exhausted her life savings before being found dead with a pitcher of iced tea in <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> the Silver Saddle Motel in Santa Fe, New Mexico. A friend had paid for a week of lodging for Rickey.|$|E

50|$|When {{the first}} verse was over, she stands {{out on the}} red carpet waving <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>at</b> the whole {{audience}} taking pictures of Blige. She steps inside the tour bus looking in the mirror <b>at</b> herself pusing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> singing the hook.|$|R
60|$|Miss Ruth collapsed. Then he made at Miss Longstreth. She {{stood with}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> breast.

25|$|Frances Burney's {{early career}} was deeply {{affected}} by {{her relationship with}} her father, and by the critical attentions of their family friend Samuel Crisp. Both encouraged her writing, but also employed their influence in a critical fashion, dissuading her from publishing or performing her dramatic comedies because they felt that working in the genre was inappropriate for a lady. Many feminist critics thus see her as an author whose natural talent for satire was somewhat stifled by the social pressures exerted on female authors of the age. But Burney persisted in writing despite the setbacks. When her comedies were poorly received, she returned to novel writing, and later tried <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> tragedy. She supported both herself and her family with the proceeds of her later novels, Camilla and The Wanderer.|$|E
25|$|Previous to Dugger, {{several books}} claimed Scott was a {{mistress}} of Hal Wallis, then married to actress Louise Fazenda. Wallis had a falling out with Scott {{around the time}} of Bad for Each Other, with recriminations on Wallis' part. After Scott freelanced for a few years, Wallis made an effort to revive the relationship by making Scott the leading lady opposite Presley, as it might be his last chance to star Scott in anything. After shooting was completed, Scott walked away from film acting to try <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> singing. The 14-year-relationship that began at the Stork Club in 1943 came to an end. Scott herself knew the relationship was over—only Wallis remained in denial. After Louise's death in 1962, Wallis went into a depression and became a recluse before marrying Martha Hyer in 1966. In later life, he was reticent on the subject of Scott, despite an unjealous Hyer urging him to include Scott and his other mistresses in his autobiography. Though Casablanca was the film of which Wallis was most proud, the ones he watched repeatedly were those starring Lizabeth Scott. Even during his second marriage, Wallis continued to screen Scott's films at home, night after night.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft next tried <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> being a governess, but she chafed at her lowly {{position}} {{and refused to}} accommodate herself to her employers. [...] The modest success of Thoughts and Johnson's encouragement emboldened Wollstonecraft {{to embark on a}} career as a professional writer, a precarious and somewhat disreputable profession for women during the 18th century. She wrote to her sister {{that she was going to}} become the [...] "first of a new genus" [...] and published , an autobiographical novel, in 1788.|$|E
500|$|Candice Barnes from The Sydney Morning Herald {{gave the}} show {{positive}} review, saying that Gaga [...] "delivered a show {{fit for a}} queen" [...] at Perth Arena. [...] "Plugged as an 'art rave', {{it was hard to}} distinguish where the art finished and the music began", she concluded. Conversely, Ross McCrae from The West Australian panned the show calling it [...] "middle of the road arena rock show", and noticed the public's lack of interest in the performances. The lack of ticket sales was also noted by a reviewer for News.com.au, who went on to add that [...] "one could never accuse Lady Gaga of lacking attention to detail in her live productions or failing to put in a wholehearted and energetic performance." [...] Jenny Valentish from Time Out awarded the show in Melbourne five stars, calling Gaga [...] "a phenomenal singer with an immense voice (...) who could try <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> any genre", also praising her live band and the costume changes.|$|E
500|$|The {{player can}} move with weapons drawn and use {{automatic}} targeting functions. Enemies can knock Regina's weapon out of <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>at</b> which point she'll have to retrieve it. Sometimes [...] "DANGER" [...] may flash {{on the screen}} in perilous situations, {{at which point the}} player should push all the controller buttons as rapidly as possible to survive. If Regina becomes injured, she will hold her arm or struggle to walk. Med Paks can be used to heal Regina's health. Sometimes a trail of blood may appear, indicating that Regina is bleeding and will continue to lose health. Hemostats can be used to stop bleeding injuries. Two types of medical supplies are available in the game: Med Paks, which heals player health, and Hemostats, which stop bleeding injuries. If Regina dies, the player may continue from the room she died in. After five [...] "Continues" [...] are exhausted, the player must continue from their last save point.|$|E

500|$|Good Girl Gone Bad {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 16 reviews. Uncut {{called it a}} [...] "shiny, trans-atlantic blend of Europop vim, R grit and Caribbean bounce." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic deemed it quintessential pop music and said each of its tracks was a potential hit. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters praised the album, describing it as [...] "more raw, perhaps edgier and more risqué" [...] than Rihanna's previous material. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that the album [...] "sounds {{as if it were}} scientifically engineered to deliver hits". Peter Robinson of The Observer commended her collaborators for [...] "masking her own shortcomings" [...] and commented that, [...] "While Rihanna lacks her peers' charisma, she's a great vessel for exhilarating mainstream pop." [...] Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the album varied and satisfying. Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly felt that, although it [...] "goes bad when Rihanna tries <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> treacly ballads and glum sentiment", at times Good Girl Gone Bad is a [...] "thrilling throwback to more than a decade ago, when upstart producers haphazardly mashed R with hip-hop to create chunky jeep anthems such as Mary J. Blige's 'Real Love'." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} {{commented on}} her cannibalistic tendencies. In a VentureBeat humor article by Jason Lomberg, Mileena [...] "tried <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> stripping, modeling, and a stint on The View. But {{none of them}} could satisfy her insatiable desire for carnage and human flesh," [...] so she became Donald Trump’s co-host on The Apprentice. Ranking 1992's Mortal Kombat as the second-most controversial violent video game in history, CNN's Doug Gross noted that in the reboot, [...] "options include eating an opponent's head." [...] X360 chose her MK2011 Fatality, [...] "in which she tears a man's head off then chows down upon it", to represent cannibalism on their list of the top ten video game crimes. In a feature about Tommy Wiseau's 2011 web series The Tommy-Wi Show, Carl Lyon of Fearnet described Wiseau therein as [...] "an ambiguously-accented, sleepy-eyed 'actor' who chews scenery like Mileena on an opponent's throat." [...] Praising the 2011 reboot game for its inclusion of [...] "iconic" [...] characters and [...] "the quite remarkable violence," [...] GamesMaster opined one [...] "simply cannot watch Mileena throw swords into Johnny Cage, decapitate him and then take repeated bites out of his face like a dog on death row without deeply desiring this game." [...] Mileena finishing move of devouring a still-living opponent in MKX was chosen as the most [...] "hardcore" [...] in the game by French website JeuxActu.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Buffet tried <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> {{managing}} her own cafés-concerts: From 1902–1903 Buffet ran a cabaret in Montmartre called the Cabaret de la Purée (Down-on-Your-Luck Cabaret) {{and later in}} 1903 she ran an establishment called Folies-Pigalle (Pigalle Follies) which was closed down that same year by the police because it was [...] "a meeting-place for right-wing enemies of the regime." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} idea {{for this show}} {{was based on the}} That's So Raven episode [...] "Goin' Hollywood", which served as the backdoor pilot for a sitcom tentatively called Better Days to star Alyson Stoner, in which a child star of a popular TV show of the same name was to try <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> going to a normal school.

2500|$|May Simons {{was also}} active during the couple's time in Girard, trying <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> fiction-writing for [...] The Coming Nation albeit with limited success. Also {{contributing}} fiction was a youngster hailing from Philadelphia, {{who would later}} achieve wider fame {{as the owner of}} the entire Appeal operation, Emanuel Julius, who wrote pedestrian short stories in the O.

Far more typical and worthy of the publication were muckraking pieces of non-fiction, such as exposés on coal mining and the faintly-disguised theft of public lands.|$|E
