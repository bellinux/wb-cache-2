On March 21, Hamasaki released her thirteenth studio album, Party Queen. The album peaked at number two on the Oricon charts, becoming her second studio album to do so after 2007's Guilty. On August 6, 2012, Hamasaki released her sixth compilation album A Summer Best. It included two new songs which were digitally released {{for the promotion of}} the album: the TRF cover, <b>Happening</b> <b>Here,</b> and You & Me.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Powell of Rolling Stone felt that, like OutKast's debut album, ATLiens is [...] "a gritty {{document}} of what's <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> and now, an up-to-the-minute briefing on Southern black ghetto life on which OutKast members Andre and Big Boi cast {{their feelings of}} alienation in familiar, realistic characterizations". Powell asserted that unlike East Coast hip hop's [...] "hedonistic materialism" [...] or [...] "the gunplay and pimpism" [...] of West Coast hip hop, [...] "Andre and Big Boi display a unique ability to describe ghetto life while offering up life-affirming possibilities, something all too rare in today's hip-hop nation." [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post enjoyed the record's [...] "more serious and focused lyrical sensibility", explaining, [...] "The raps are generally inventive, clever without being cloying, more proof (if any were needed) that hip-hop innovation isn't just an East-West thang." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 January 2013, Higginbotham {{signed for}} Sheffield United on a six-month contract, {{and made his}} debut for the club against their South Yorkshire rivals Doncaster Rovers the same day. Former Stoke {{teammate}} and current Sheffield United teammate Dave Kitson {{played a part in}} Higginbotham's move to Bramall Lane, Higginbotham stated on his move to the club: [...] "I was getting ready to go back to Ipswich on Sunday but after speaking to Dave I was optimistic something would be sorted here and thankfully it was... I was very surprised and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could be <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> ... Dropping into League One isn't a worry for me because this is a club on the up and I didn't want to be stuck at Stoke just picking my money up because that isn't me" [...] On 18 June 2013, having made sufficient first-team appearances for Sheffield United, Higginbotham activated a clause in his contract to extend it for the following season.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to another}} account, Dubnow's killer was a German {{who had been}} a former student. [...] A rumor, which later grew into a legend, started that Dubnow said to the Jews present at the last moments of his life: [...] "If you survive, never forget what is <b>happening</b> <b>here,</b> give evidence, write and rewrite, keep alive each word and each gesture, each cry and each tear! [...] What is certain is that the SS stole the historian's library and papers and transported them back to the Reich.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contrast}} to his largely comedy-based acting career, Koechner starred in the 2016 drama Priceless, a film about human trafficking. He said of the role, [...] "My wife and I have five kids — {{three of them are}} daughters. So, just to imagine the horror of any young lady having to go through this. This film is based on true events. It’s happening right now. It’s happening in Chicago. It’s <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> in Los Angeles. It’s happening globally. So, to be a participant in a film like this — to bring awareness to such a horror — makes me happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asquith {{was left}} {{politically}} discredited by the Maurice Debate {{and by the}} clear turn {{of the war in}} the Allies' favour from the summer of 1918. He devoted far more effort to his Romanes Lecture [...] "Some Aspects of the Victorian Age" [...] at Oxford in June 1918 than to any political speech. However, Lady Ottoline Morrell thought it [...] "a dull address". A letter of July 1918 describes a typical couple of days. [...] "Nothing much is <b>happening</b> <b>here.</b> I dined with the usual crowd at Mrs. Astor's last night. The Duke of Connaught lunches here on Friday: don't you wish you were coming!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Grabens form {{where the}} crust is being {{stretched}} or extended. [...] Several explanations {{have been offered}} as to why this is <b>happening</b> <b>here.</b> [...] theorized that right-lateral slip on the Wallula Fault is being transferred to more southerly faults such as the Vale Fault, wherefore he labelled this region the Wallulandash&Vale Transfer Zone. [...] suggested that crustal deformation in this region {{is a continuation of}} the Basin and Range region immediately to the south, with any connection to the OWL deemed circumstantial. [...] Another explanation is that clock-wise rotation of part of Oregon (discussed below) about a point near the Wallula Gap has pulled the Blue Mountains away from the OWL; this might also explain why the OWL seems to be bending here.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1984, Some Great Reward was released. Melody Maker {{claimed that}} the album made one [...] "sit up and take notice of what is <b>happening</b> <b>here,</b> right under your nose." [...] In {{contrast}} to the political and environmental subjects addressed on the previous album, the songs on Some Great Reward were mostly concerned with more personal themes such as sexual politics ("Master and Servant"), adulterous relationships ("Lie to Me"), and arbitrary divine justice ("Blasphemous Rumours"). Also included was the first Martin Gore ballad, [...] "Somebody" [...] — such songs would become a feature of all following albums. [...] "Somebody" [...] was released as a double A-side with [...] "Blasphemous Rumours," [...] {{and was the first}} single with Gore on lead vocal. Some Great Reward became the first Depeche Mode album to enter the US album charts, and made the Top 10 in several European countries.|$|E

Every 8 December, the town's Poblacion celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception wherein colorful banderitas, loud marching bands and expectacular display of fireworks are seen and is being visited by many people coming from the different towns in Cavite. Cultural shows and many celebrations are <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> almost weekly so it has the rightful claim to be called [...] "The Liveliest City in Cavite".|$|E
