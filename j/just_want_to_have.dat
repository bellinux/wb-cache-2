500|$|Jim compares {{spending}} {{a day with}} Julius Erving to a hypothetical situation wherein Pam would spend the day with John Stamos. Pam and Meredith bond over karaoke, and the two sing the song [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun", which was made famous by Cyndi Lauper in 1983.|$|E
50|$|Jaz Nerini (Bryony Seth) - a headstrong, feisty 16-year-old who is {{experienced}} and <b>just</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun.|$|R
5000|$|Stacy. A hot 22-year-old, who <b>just</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{sex with}} Walden, {{but he is}} more {{interested}} in her grandmother.|$|R
5000|$|The {{self-determination}} of her clientele {{is in the}} foreground. “If someone <b>just</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> my hand on {{his stomach}} for an hour, that's okay. For an autistic person to allow {{that can be a}} high accomplishment.” ...|$|R
500|$|Both [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun" [...] and [...] "Constant Craving" [...] were {{featured}} on the soundtrack album [...] Three additional songs from the episode {{were included in the}} five bonus tracks available on the Target edition of the album: [...] "Perfect", [...] "I'm the Only One" [...] and [...] "I Kissed a Girl".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} begrudgingly {{released}} by Yankovic, {{who felt that}} the compilation was unnecessary and merely a way for his record label to make money. Several food-related songs that Yankovic had recorded, such as [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Lunch" [...] and [...] "Waffle King" [...] were left off the record, although the former was due to personal preference, while the latter was due to scheduling issues.|$|E
500|$|Notable for {{its absence}} is [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Lunch", from Dare to Be Stupid (1985), Yankovic's only {{previously}} released food-related song {{not to make}} the album. According to Yankovic, {{this is due to the}} fact there is a [...] "royalty ceiling" [...] on the albums and he needed to pick one song to cut from the list in order to turn a profit on the album. [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Lunch" [...] was chosen due to Yankovic's personal dislike of the song, as his record label had forced him to record it in order to release Dare to Be Stupid back in 1985. Also absent from the release is [...] "Waffle King." [...] The song had originally been recorded for Off the Deep End. However, Yankovic decided to swap [...] "Waffle King" [...] with [...] "I Was Only Kidding"—a song he had actually recorded for his next album—at the last minute; this forced Yankovic to shelve [...] "Waffle King" [...] for the time being. The song was later released on [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] single, as well as Yankovic's eighth studio album, Alapalooza, which was released four months after The Food Album.|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Yael Yuzon explained, [...] "I {{think on}} the first record we <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an album out as a {{collection}} of songs written from high school; while on Transit, we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> push the limits of our song-writing so we took a creatively different approach for every song." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Angel" [...] (Molly Hagan) {{represents}} his sensitivity. As {{the only}} female character in his brain, Angel also represents his feminine side, and sometimes uses this fact to manipulate the male characters. She also clashes with Animal about how to treat women because while she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> treat them with sensitivity and kindness, Animal <b>just</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex.|$|R
50|$|I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a really}} wild all-girl band {{that was like}} a gang or something. And Boom Boom Lafoon was the only drummer I could think of so even though we hated each other I wound up calling her anyway. We had all the same ideas about bands and life and {{drinking}} and everything.|$|R
500|$|A {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Everyone Nose" [...] {{featuring}} Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and Pusha T was filmed in July and {{was directed by}} Hype Williams. It features video game graphics from the 1980s. Williams explained that, [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun with the project. In a day and age where the record industry is what it is, I'm {{lucky enough to be}} on a label that understands and they'll just let us have fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Linda's {{pseudonym}} as a one-hit wonder, [...] "Lindana," [...] is a spoof of {{the famous}} singer Madonna; as well, the title of her hit single [...] "I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun" [...] is referent to the 1983 hit song [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun" [...] by Cyndi Lauper. Furthermore, during the end credits, the Greatest hits CD for the song is titled [...] "The Essential Lindana: Still Fun..." [...] which is a general play on [...] "The Essentials" [...] CDs.|$|E
500|$|Santana (Naya Rivera) {{is about}} to be {{suspended}} for hitting Finn (Cory Monteith), but he claims it was merely a stage slap. He then blackmails Santana into having her glee club, the Troubletones, temporarily meet with her former club, New Directions, so he can show her how they all support her. Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss) sing [...] "Perfect" [...] to her, which leaves her unimpressed, but Finn's slow, stripped-down rendition of [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun" [...] is better received.|$|E
5000|$|Sandy Lucas (Rebecca Creskoff) - She is {{the mother}} of Kevin, Joe, Nick, and Frankie, and is Tom's wife. She's down to earth and always proud of her sons, despite their mistakes. Mrs. Lucas <b>just</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a normal family, but has {{acknowledged}} that it may not be possible with famous children. She is mostly an off-screen character.|$|R
50|$|During the World's End events, Roxy is {{the first}} to witness the devastation brought on Earth, after a teletransport mishap left the entire team frozen for months. Emotionally shattered, she tries to cope and help the team to survive. Pressured to share her fantasies about the post-atomic world as a way to crack the tension, she reveals <b>to</b> <b>have</b> none: she <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> more time <b>to</b> live a happier and more {{peaceful}} adolescence, becoming a better student, a beloved cheerleader and growing up in a caring family: things she feels she'll never have again.|$|R
5000|$|The Blondies {{were tough}} in the studio, real tough. None of them liked each other, except Chris and Debbie, {{and there was}} so much animosity. They were really, really {{juvenile}} in their approach to life—a classic New York underground rock band—and they didn't give a fuck about anything. They <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun and didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work too hard getting it.|$|R
500|$|... "When I wrote American Life, I {{was very}} {{agitated}} {{by what was}} going on in the world around me, [...] I was angry. I had a lot to get off my chest. I made a lot of political statements. But now, I feel that I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun; I want to dance; I want to feel buoyant. And I want to give other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun" [...] from the album She's So Unusual (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't be scared of anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're not even sure what it is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says, the bad people that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the midtempo piece [...] "I <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Something to Do", which {{contains}} lyrics pertaining to ambivalence and anomie. In the song, Joey manages to rhyme [...] "Second Avenue" [...] with [...] "chicken vindaloo". The next track, [...] "I Wanted Everything", {{is compared to}} Merle Haggard's song [...] "If We Make It Through December", being called its [...] "punk counterpart" [...] by Rock: A Canadian Perspective author Larry Starr. [...] "Questioningly" [...] is a ballad focusing on failing relationships and heartbreak. [...] "Don't Come Close" [...] uses elements which can also be heard in country music, such as twang.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, {{newspapers}} {{reported on}} a 1979 video that showed Sergeant Arthur Hutchinson addressing a group of police recruits. He used the terms “ni**ers,” “beaners,” “greasers” and “homos" [...] to describe them. He asked one woman in the class [...] "Is the real reason you came on here is because you <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> access <b>to</b> 1,400 guys to f*ck?" ...|$|R
60|$|Tommy Trout didn't {{mean to be}} bad. Oh dear, no! He <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his own way, {{and because}} Tommy Trout had his own way and didn't mind Mrs. Trout there isn't any Tommy Trout now. No sir, there isn't {{as much as one}} little blue spot of his {{beautiful}} little coat left because--why, just because Tommy Trout didn't mind.|$|R
50|$|Nadine Samonte <b>has</b> {{been married}} <b>to</b> {{businessman}} Richard Chua since October 30, 2013; they had initially kept their marriage private until their first wedding anniversary with Samonte explaining they <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their privacy as a newly wed couple. In June 2016, {{it was announced}} that the couple were expecting their first child. Heather Sloane, their daughter, was born on August 27, 2016.|$|R
500|$|Finn's {{performance}} of [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun" [...] {{received the most}} commentary. Bell wrote that [...] "his cover of Greg Laswell's cover" [...] of the Lauper song [...] "may just be my favorite Finn solo ever". Kubicek described the [...] "slowed-down, acoustic version" [...] as [...] "insanely good", and Flandez called it [...] "poignant" [...] and [...] "surprising and appealing". West said it was [...] "the best showcase for his voice in recent memory". Slezak called it his [...] "favorite performance by Finn {{in the last two}} seasons", and added that Monteith [...] "sounded terrific". While Votta thought the rendition was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "well sung", she wrote that it [...] "felt a little off-center"; Chaney described it as [...] "not terribly compelling". Sullivan called it a [...] "horrifyingly creepy" [...] performance.|$|E
500|$|In January 1985 Yankovic {{entered the}} {{recording}} studio to begin the sessions to his In 3-D follow-up album. To produce the album, Yankovic brought in former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer who also produced Yankovic's previous albums. Backing Yankovic were Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The first session yielded four originals: [...] "Dare to Be Stupid", [...] "Cable TV", [...] "Slime Creatures from Outer Space", and [...] "One More Minute". The band also recorded a cover tune of the theme from [...] "George Of The Jungle". The following month, Yankovic began recording the four parodies and polka medley that would appear on the album, [...] "Yoda", [...] "Like a Surgeon", [...] "I Want a New Duck", [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Lunch", and [...] "Hooked on Polkas".|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Homer {{builds a}} scary clown-shaped bed for Bart. The scene was {{inspired}} by Mike Reiss, whose dad had built him a clown-shaped bed when he was younger, and just like Bart, Reiss was scared of sleeping in it. As the flashback begins in 1983, a young Homer strolls down the street, singing Cyndi Lauper's song [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun", which was released the same year. The idea for this sequence came from animation director Chuck Sheetz, who suggested it because {{the length of the}} final version of the episode was too short. The Fox censors wrote a note concerning Homer's line, [...] "Bart can kiss my hairy, yellow butt!" [...] after Marge tells Homer that Bart might be jealous of baby Lisa, citing that the line is considered [...] "coarse", due to the fact that Bart was two during the flashback.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I've {{frightened him}} to death," [...] said Bowser, talking to himself. [...] "I didn't {{mean to do}} that. I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some fun with him." [...] With that, Bowser took one more sniff and then trotted off {{to try to find}} {{something}} more exciting. You see, he hadn't had the least intention in the world of really hurting Grandfather Frog.|$|R
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> mimic that sound. I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|R
50|$|Lily {{returns to}} the apartment, only to vomit after {{learning}} their parents hooked up. Barney consoles them at the bar, saying people can change. Robin asks Marshall, Lily, and Ted to hold an intervention for Barney - but the three hold it instead for her. Lily and Marshall tell Mickey and Judy that it's okay for them to date, but when the parents admit <b>just</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex.|$|R
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{addresses}} a [...] "good girl gone wild" [...] singing about her [...] "burning hot desire" [...] {{to have some}} fun. It contains references to singer Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun" [...] (1983), with lyrics like [...] "Girls, they just wanna have some fun" [...] and [...] "The room is spinning / It must be the Tanqueray / I'm about to go astray / My inhibitions gone away". In the intermediate verses, Madonna utters [...] "forgive me", which is a Catholic term used as a sexual reference. The lyrics, once placed {{in the context of}} Madonna's career [...] "attains a new meaning" [...] according to Josh Haigh from Attitude magazine. Explaining it, he said that the meaning behind the lyrics was how Madonna, being a Catholic girl herself, decided that she would not be tied down by anyone else's rules, and consequently {{became one of the most}} recognizable musical artists.|$|E
500|$|Music in {{the episode}} {{includes}} the song {{from which it}} gets its title, Katy Perry's [...] "I Kissed a Girl", which was previously sung by Tina for her glee club audition in the show's pilot. Jones performs Dolly Parton's [...] "Jolene" [...] during the episode, her second time singing on the show; her first was a duet with Matthew Morrison in the second season episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol".

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the movie Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken. The movie The Bloodening is a parody of the 1960 film Village of the Damned. The sequence showing the children taking the equipment to build their radio transmitter is a recreation of a sequence from the short comedy films Our Gang, featuring similar music and a dog, with Milhouse dressed like Our Gang character Alfalfa. The review Marge reads of Talk to the Hand [...] "The writing snaps, crackles and pops" [...] was how Variety reviewed the sitcom Just Shoot Me! when it first aired in 1997. The musical argument between kids, adults and seniors is a parody of the song [...] "Kids" [...] from the musical Bye Bye Birdie. When Lisa is flipping through the radio channels, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Infamy Speech can be heard. In the Springfield Elementary School shower-room Homer, Barney, Lenny, and Carl sing a medley of Queen songs consisting of [...] "We Are the Champions" [...] and [...] "We Will Rock You". When Cyndi Lauper sings [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] it is to the tune of her hit song [...] "Girls <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Have</b> Fun".|$|E
5000|$|Series {{producer}} Erika Hossington {{revealed in}} an interview with Digital Spy that Sarker had temporarily departed the show and that Zoe's exit scenes would air on 23 August, [...] "That was because Sunetra Sarker, who has been fantastically faithful to Casualty over the last few years, <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a bit of time out. That gave us an opportunity {{to come up with a}} new story for the character." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do with Bobbywas {{just to get}} him {{to sound}} in the studio as natural, just as he was in person, and have that {{extraordinary}} personality come thru.... After all, he's not a great harmonica player, and he's not a great guitar player, and he's not a great singer. He just happens to be an original. And I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that originality come thru." [...] John Hammond on Bob Dylan, 1968 Pop Chroniclesinterview.|$|R
50|$|Viola Spolin {{began working}} with {{children}} early in her career. Aside from her work with The Parent's School, Spolin used her Theatre Games {{as a way to}} help develop creative confidence in troubled kids as well as for child actors and kids who <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun improvising.
