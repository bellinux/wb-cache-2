40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} ESVT – EmailSet Visualization Tool, an <b>email</b> archive tool that provides users a visualization to re-find and discover information in their <b>email</b> archive. ESVT is an end-to-end <b>email</b> archive tool {{that can be}} used from archiving a user’s <b>email</b> messages to visualizing queries on the <b>email</b> archive. We address <b>email</b> archiving by allowing import of <b>email</b> messages from an <b>email</b> server or from a standard existing <b>email</b> client. The central idea in ESVT’s visualization, an “email-set”, is the set of <b>emails</b> that are the result of a query on a user’s <b>email</b> archive. ESVT provides a multiple email-set view - visualization of multiple email-sets on a time axis. In addition, each <b>email</b> set can be individually visualized based on person and time axis, using the single email-set view. Query logs, individual <b>email</b> visualization, multiple <b>email</b> set visualization provide rich contextual cues, thus enabling end users to deal with <b>email</b> overload and re-find past <b>email</b> which otherwise wouldn’t be discovered easily...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: With {{the rapid}} growth of the number of <b>email</b> {{messages}} and the diverse use of <b>email,</b> people have become overwhelmed by the large volumes of <b>email</b> archives. As a result, <b>email</b> tools that facilitate the browsing of <b>email</b> messages are highly required. This study described an empirical study that aimed to investigate whether the usability of <b>email</b> client can be improved by incorporating graphical visualization techniques to browse <b>email</b> data. Approach: Two <b>email</b> visualization approaches, called LinearVis and MatrixVis, were developed for this empirical study which presented <b>email</b> messages based on a dateline together with other <b>email</b> information. The usability of each approach was compared to atypical <b>email</b> tool in terms of locating messages. Results: The results demonstrated that LinearVis was the most usable <b>email</b> approach in terms of browsing <b>email</b> messages whereas MatrixVis was found to be the least usable <b>email</b> condition. Conclusion: The results showed that usability of <b>email</b> clients can be significantly improved by presenting graphically <b>email</b> messages with only a small volume of hidden <b>email</b> data. Results also indicated that usability of the graphical representations, that hide large volume of <b>email</b> data, can be negatively affected...|$|R
40|$|As <b>email</b> {{becomes one}} of the most {{convenient}} and indispensable communication mediums in our life, {{it is very important to}} protect <b>email</b> users from increasing <b>email</b> worm attacks. In this paper, we present the architecture and system design of a "feedback <b>email</b> worm defense system" to protect <b>email</b> users in enterprise networks. The defense system is flexible and able to integrate many existing detection techniques to provide e#ective and e#cient <b>email</b> worm defense. First, in response to a "detection score" of a detected worm <b>email</b> and information on the possible appearance of a malicious <b>email</b> worm in the global Internet, the defense system adaptively chooses a cost-e#ective defense action that can range from simply labelling this <b>email</b> to aggressively deleting it from an <b>email</b> server. Second, the system uses "honeypot" [13] to thoroughly detect worm <b>emails</b> received by <b>email</b> servers and also to early detect the presence of an <b>email</b> worm in the global Internet. Third, the defense system implements a "multi-sifting detection" technique and "di#erential <b>email</b> service" to achieve accurate detection without causing much delay on most <b>emails.</b> Furthermore, the defense system separates <b>email</b> attachments from <b>email</b> texts and saves attachments in separate "attachment caching servers", which facilitate both <b>email</b> worm detection and <b>email</b> service e#ciency. 1...|$|R

25|$|Another racial {{discrimination}} suit was filed in October 2010 when 30 African American firefighters accused DCFEMS of tolerating a racist work environment. The suit named about 10 white male firefighters who were accused or convicted of crimes — including assault (sometimes with knives), sexual harassment (<b>emailing</b> images of their genitals to female colleagues), illegal {{possession of a}} firearm, public nudity in the firehouse, and stalking — but had not been disciplined. But black firefighters accused or convicted of similar crimes were punished. The lawsuit also alleged that the department purposefully allowed the 2006 promotions list (which had many black candidates on it) to expire so that a 2010 list (which had few black candidates) could be acted on instead. The suit asked for class action status for the department's 1,000 black firefighters.|$|E

The hotel's owner Gurey Abdi Hassan partly blamed Hodan district officials and state forces for the attack. He indicated that the local Hodan district commissioner had ignored his request to set up a security checkpoint in the hotel's rear, while simultaneously providing lax security despite the premises having been attacked three times before. Al-Shabaab concurrently claimed responsibility for the raid, with the group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mahamud Rage <b>emailing</b> that some militants had survived the attack and escaped the scene. Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab also indicated that the insurgents were targeting government officials only and had left civilians unharmed. Government forces displayed the bodies of the slain militants at a press gathering, deeming the counter-terrorist operation a success.|$|E

While Don Trip was based in Memphis while Starlito was based in Nashville, the two continued to meet up to record, never <b>emailing</b> each other songs back and forth. Eventually, in 2017, the two linked up again for the third installment of the Step Brothers series, preceded by the Karate in the Garage collaborative mixtape.

25|$|Wonga {{was founded}} by Errol Damelin (chief {{executive}} officer) in October 2006 and he linked up with software engineer Jonty Hurwitz in January 2007. Both Damelin and Hurwitz had previous internet start-up experience; neither had any experience of retail banking. When the company first started looking for funding, potential investors saw the short-term, small-loans business as an unprofitable, risky backwater. After being denied funding by UK banks, Wonga secured venture capital through Balderton Capital. The first place of business was in a shared office space in St. John's Wood, London. After a year of software development a beta website was launched in 2007. In interviews, Damelin {{has said that the}} goal was to disrupt the short-term credit industry by providing transparency, exact control of amount and payment date, immediate access to funds, and no faxing or <b>emailing</b> documents. The business model of lending only to those who could pay back reliably, as opposed to the much wider catchment practice of payday loans required an algorithm that could fully determine risk in an automated manner – something they had difficulty developing in the early stages. To get funds directly to customer's bank accounts as quickly as possible, co-operation from leading banks was required. Banks were reportedly dismissive of Wonga's plan saying they would not be totally satisfied with customer identity without physical documentation.|$|E

A fund was set up for victims of the explosion. Rexnord made an initial donation of $100,000; by December 2006, the fund had topped $325,000. A separate fund was also set up for the young children of one of the deceased. The company had started to ship finished products again by December 20. By January 10, all 750 Falk Corporation employees had returned to work. The company intends to rebuild on the site. The explosion has, to date, cost Rexnord over $40 million in damage and lost sales. The company is insured for up to $2billion per incident. When Christmas came, the Salvation Army donated toys to Falk employees for their children, to help with the cost of Christmas at a time when the families were still very distressed. Milwaukee's state representative, Pedro Colón, has said that there were no laws in Wisconsin requiring the inspection of propane tanks, and is now pushing for adoption of such laws. In October 2008, the lawsuit went to trial in Milwaukee. After four weeks of trial, Rexnord was found to be primarily at fault for the explosion and J.M. Brennan was not liable for any of the damages.|$|E
