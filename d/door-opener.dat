The main component of the ritual {{can be characterized as}} follows: Once you have collected your da-ta, try to refute your null hypothesis (e. g., no mean differ-ence, zero correlation, etc.) in an automatized manner. Of-ten the ritual is complemented by the “star procedure”: If p <. 05, assign one star to your results (*), if p <. 01 give two stars (**), and if p <. 001 you have earned yourself three stars (***). If you have obtained at least one star, the ritual has been successfully performed; if not, your results are not worth much. The stars, or the corresponding numer-ical values, have been <b>door-openers</b> to prestigious psychol-ogy journals and, therefore, the ritual has received strong reinforcement. The ritual does not have a firm theoretical grounding; it seems to have arisen as a badly understood hybrid mixture of the approaches of Ronald A. Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, Egon S.

40|$|Entering {{foreign markets}} {{is often seen}} {{to be a big}} {{challenge}} for small firms due to the small amount of resources available for internationalisation. However, through interpersonal networks, firms can gain access to, as well as, mobilise external resources to aid the initiation of internationalisation. Thus, to understand small firm’s internationalisation, knowledge of the factors influencing the internationalisation and an analysis at the social relationship level is needed. The present study is concerned with the initiation of the internationalisation of small high-technology firms. It concentrates in particular, on social networks and their influence on internationalisation. The paper develops an empirically grounded framework for understanding the roles that a social network can play in the initiation of small firm internationalisation. The framework acknowledges the roles of personal relationships as sources of critical information about foreign business opportunities and potential international business partners. Moreover, social relationships are important <b>door-openers</b> for international relationships. This study contributes to the existing research by bringing forward the very active role that the interpersonal network can play as a mediator in the initiation of small firm’s internationalisation. The mediation can provide the small firm publicity, contacts, and legitimacy resulting in first international contacts and development of international business relationships. ...|$|R
5000|$|Olga Lipińska began {{producing}} satirical {{programs for}} Telewizja Polska {{in the late}} 1960s. The Gallux Show (1970-1974) was followed by her first true Kabaret Olgi Lipińskiej, produced in 1975-1977: a series consisting of 10 episodes entitled the Cabaret's just playing (Właśnie leci kabarecik). It was aired by the TV block of entertainment called Only on Sunday (Tylko w niedzielę). Between 1977 and 1981 she produced Curtain Up (Kurtyna w górę; 18 episodes), a widely popular program based on absurd and surreal humour featuring renowned artists such as Piotr Fronczewski, Wojciech Pokora, and Bohdan Łazuka. One of its best-remembered lines (from a restaurant sketch featuring Jan Kobuszewski) was: [...] "Who ordered Russian pierogi?" [...] Answer: [...] "Nobody. They came on their own." [...] - It resulted in an official protest by the Soviet embassy in 1978, followed by secret police questioning. Lipińska was accused of political provocation and suspended from work for eight months; her producer, downgraded to a lower position; and the censor in charge, officially reprimanded. In the subsequent years, the cabaret (inspired by satirical writings of Gałczyński) was a <b>door-opener</b> for many stage artists including Barbara Wrzesińska, Jan Kobuszewski, and Marek Kondrat.|$|E

Crates is also described as being the student of Bryson the Achaean, and of Stilpo.

He is said to have been deformed with a lame leg and hunched shoulders. He was nicknamed the <b>Door-Opener</b> (θυρεπανοίκτης) because he would enter any house and people would receive him gladly and with honour: He used to enter the houses of his friends, without being invited or otherwise called, in order to reconcile members of a family, even if it was apparent that they were deeply at odds. He would not reprove them harshly, but in a soothing way, in a manner which was non-accusatory towards those whom he was correcting, because he wished to be of service to them as well as to those who were just listening.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHalal {{industry}} {{has received special attention}} worldwide {{as one of}} the most potential businesses to be explored and developed. Demand from approximately 1. 6 billion Muslims throughout the world has become a crucial <b>door-opener</b> for Halal industry. One of the highly growth markets at present is the Halal packaged food industry. Even though several studies have focused on the purchase of Halal products produced by Non-Muslim manufacturer, however their results are still inconclusive. Thus, this study aims to investigate the determinant factors that consumers may consider in buying Halal packaged food produced by Non-Muslim manufacturers. Halal awareness, Islamic brand and product ingredients are used as the pre-determined factors in measuring consumer's purchase intention. A total of 150 set of questionnaires were distributed randomly in Klang Valley. The hypotheses which were tested using Pearson Correlation have revealed that Halal awareness and product ingredients have significantly influenced Muslim's intention to buy Halal packaged food that are produced by Non-Muslim manufacturers. It is expected that the findings of this study will assist the Non-Muslim's Halal certified manufacturers to develop the best strategy in winning the heart of Muslim consumers...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY [...] - This master {{thesis is}} about music therapy and grief. It explores how music therapy can {{facilitate}} the grief or bereavement process of human beings. The study has a qualitative design with semi-structured interview as method. The {{focus of the}} study is close to the informants´ reflections, with a theoretical basis in grief and bereavement processes and empirical studies in the music therapy field. Hermeneutic inquiry is used in interpretation, and analysis of the empirical data is inspired by thematic analysis, and systematic text condensation in the last phase. Five categories emerged from the analysis: grief, <b>door-opener,</b> community, acceptance and experience. These were put in relation to theories and music therapeutic empirical data, and discussed in a separate chapter. Music therapy facilitates connectedness to memories and experiences, by making emotions understandable individually and in community, which makes conciliation easier by oscillate between conflict orientation and resource orientation. The music therapist must have satisfactory experience. The thesis suggests that music therapy can facilitate the grief or bereavement process of human beings, and ends with encouraging the Norwegian music therapy field to make more research and interest in the field of grief and bereavement...|$|E

40|$|Who is the expert? Hip-hop as {{university}} {{politics and}} progressive education. Since hip-hop started over 35 {{years ago in}} New York, it {{has been associated with}} social activism and education. Accordingly, {{it is not surprising that}} academic institutions in universities and K- 12 schools are interested in hip-hop with regards to the history of this street culture. This article's aim is to highlight this “hip-hop academization” and analyze the academization processes. The research questions are: How is hip-hop legitimized in official webpage texts? Who is the expert and what is at stake? What symbolic fights are going on between pioneers of the culture and academics? How do hip-hop scholars talk about the academization? The theoretical framework stems from sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, including his work within cultural fields and capital forms. The empirical data, which has been collected with an ethnographical approach, are webpage texts, observations, recordings from academic events concerned with hip-hop and individual interviews with hip-hop scholars in New York City during 2010. The results show how hip-hop at the university is an attractive label and a <b>door-opener</b> for the scholars, but at the same time how hip-hop is regarded as low-culture within the university. Finally, the data shows how the pioneers of hip hop construct the scholars as outsiders in order to maintain themselves as foremost experts of the culture...|$|E
40|$|Bangladesh {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world; and women in that country are among the poorest of the poor. In the late 1970 s, a man performed a miracle there. With a few loans out of his own pocket in 1976, Professor Yunus proved to himself that even the most downtrodden are able to pull themselves out of dire poverty. By planting a vegetable garden, buying a cow or opening a small store, these women are able to make a profit, feed their family and repay their loan with interest. He then took his message to Rome where the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) had just been established, with the mandate of poverty alleviation in the poorest countries. With his enthusiasm, he convinced IFAD that a loan to the Grameen Bank, as he called his venture, would be a good investment and greatly help to reduce poverty in Bangladesh.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} relation between mindfulness and coping. Building on a definition of mindfulness as a way of being in the present moment, appraisal theory was linked to coping with distress. The reason was to inquire whether mindfulness may be related to a coping process that entails appraising and to suggest how it is associated. “Mindful coping” is presented as a way to link these two traditions. This aim was developed based on years of working with both clinical and non-clinical populations who have expressed interest in and benefitted from practicing mindfulness as a <b>door-opener</b> to more adequate coping with general stress- and emotionrelated life problems. Beginning with a look into coping strategies that may {{play a central role in}} mindful coping, these strategies were related to mental health indicators to provide information on how mindful coping strategies may affect mental health. Mindful coping strategies were then investigated empirically within a non-clinical adolescent sample and a sample of psychiatric outpatients. Two interventions believed to enhance mindful coping were evaluated with the main goal of learning more about how mindful coping skills may be developed, as well as their capability to stimulate mindful coping and improve mental health. Using a pragmatic approach within a critical realist framework, and by mixing quantitative and qualitative methods, four studies contributed to the current research. Findings showed that mindfulness may play a part in coping (i. e., mindful coping). Strategies for promoting mindful coping have been suggested. Furthermore, the results revealed that mindful coping strategies do seem to affect mental health in different ways for different populations. Within the adolescent sample, tendencies reflected that some strategies were more beneficial than others, whereas the strategies seem to affect symptoms of poor mental health in promising ways within the patient sample. In response to the findings, suggestions have been made to moderate interventions that enhance mindful coping to increase the use of such strategies and promote mental health. Finally, challenges in developing and executing mindfulness-based interventions for adolescents and for psychiatric outpatients have been suggested.

40|$|Physical {{education}} (PE) {{at school}} may {{play an important}} role in the process of becoming physically active in the adolescence and in developing a physically active lifestyle. The opportunities for teachers to provide positive physical activity experiences to the student population extend regularly over the school terms. For some students, PE can be the only opportunity they have to be physically active. Therefore it is important that the students become motivated to practice physical activity and know the purpose with physical activity. The overall purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the possibilities to motivate youth, 12 - 16 years old, to practice physical activity and hopefully to stimulate them to continue to be physically active in young adulthood. The sample consisted of 122 Swedish compulsory school students (12 - 16 years old), 51 girls and 71 boys, who were either physically inactive, physically active but not formal members of sport clubs, or physically active and members of a sport club. They used a self-monitoring instrument to describe their physical activity and we compared their self-reported physical activity with their actual VO 2 capacity and physical status. The self-monitoring instrument was further validated against an activity monitor, RT 3. The intervention lasted one and a half years, and four to five years later a follow-up study was done. Using a quasi-experimental design, the three groups of participants were compared with youths who did not use the selfmonitoring instrument. The main findings were that the associations between the accelerometer counts and the activities the students recorded in the self-monitoring instrument were high. The participants in Group 1 (physically inactive) continued exercising nearly to the same extent as during the intervention while youths in a matched control group did not develop regular physical activity habits. Concerning Group 2 (exercisers), participants in the intervention group were more physically active both during the intervention and at follow-up, compared with a matched control group of exercisers who did not use the self-monitoring instrument. In Group 3 (sport team members), there was no difference between the intervention group and a matched control group after the intervention or at follow-up. The conclusion of these main findings was that when someone motivates students to continue being physically active and to change their physical activity patterns in a positive direction, the self-monitoring instrument can be a <b>door-opener</b> for youths who are physically inactive or regularly active outside sports clubs...|$|E

40|$|This written thesis {{has been}} {{developed}} in tandem with its practical counterpart: Entrance Not For Everybody. Together the practical and theoretical work make use of virtually every interesting experience I have had. In essence it explores how ancient spiritual practices {{may be the most}} developed tools we have for experiential mind expansion - regardless of how these practices are viewed by the scientific community. In addition this text question science's relevance for the personal experience of reality - in comparison to individual exploration of the same by whatever means. The prime strength of the sciences is its consistent, empirical development through logic. Mostly aided by external (as in not belonging to one's own body and mind) resources and tools and the development thereof. So far, science largely concern a material evolution - even if it is of an immaterial nature such as software or intellect. What I propose is the Human Individual Experience - optional means for experiencing the world as alternative ways of knowing. The work's main intention is to awaken an interest in spiritual practice in individuals who have no such experience or did not know to value such experiences that could be perceived as being of spiritual magnitude. This is important because regardless of the nature of spiritual content - seen from a scientific perspective of any kind - spiritual experiences are mind blowing, mind altering and most of all mind expansion in its purest form - at least on an experiential level - which naturally is key - given the context this text is being written in. For someone who already have a personal relationship to spiritual practices of an experiential nature - of any sort - there is a place, community or method to expand within their field of choice - if not locally then certainly globally. Therefore the target audience is not the experienced spiritual seeker for whom endless paths lay ahead. What is being proposed here is an approach which put the individual's experience in the centre of all - using more or less traditional spiritual practices as they have been constructed or discovered to offer great paths into higher consciousness experientially. In its practical manifestation, Entrance Not For Everybody, these have been gift wrapped in - as well as accompanied by - layers of fiction, cultural references and very detailed physical props, much because the individual of no spiritual background who is the main target group for this introductory experience, is likely used to a material world based in tools, entertainment, storytelling etc. Therefore this redressing and recontextualizing of practices is just a means to target and introduce a new crowd to old and useful methods - in a smooth and memorable manner. The idea is to offer this experience as a starting point and to be continued as a forum or hub for future explorations of more advanced experiences focusing on expansion of consciousness. Material complexity is bound to develop further in both it's tangible and intangible realms but it is here questioned whether this will really lead to an expansion of consciousness or just offer products to reach realms that are already accessible within - at no cost. The aim of this work is not to clarify the lack of consistency in what is commonly referred to as reality - although this might be a direct consequence. It is rather taken for granted that reality is subjectively understood. Therefore the thesis only investigates if and explains how a composition of experiential practices which are strung together thoughtfully may work as a <b>door-opener</b> for further inquiries into the realm of spiritual practice as a means of expanding mind and consciousness. In this respect the exhibition itself is the most important research ground for the thesis - which naturally cannot be incorporated in advance...|$|E
