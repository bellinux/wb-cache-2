500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1965, the Parliament of Malaysia voted 126–0 {{in favor of a}} {{constitutional}} amendment expelling Singapore from the federation; hours later, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, establishing the island as an independent and sovereign republic. [...] A tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced in a televised press conference that Singapore had become a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he stated: [...] "For me, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> anguish. All my life, my whole adult life, I have believed in merger and unity of the two territories." [...] The new state became the Republic of Singapore, with Yusof bin Ishak appointed as its first President.|$|E
500|$|From Rite to Ritual {{examined}} {{relationships between}} Indigenous and settler cultures, including differences in spiritual practices. Mellor, in an artist's statement for the awards, described {{the work as}} showing [...] "what <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> contact, a conversation and interaction between two cultures; it speaks of the challenges of settlement, and the differences in spiritual enactment and belief". Commenting on the work, the judges of the prize remarked that the [...] "surprising scale and layering of imagery, with its understated political and historical references" [...] made the work [...] "outstanding" [...] and of [...] "great complexity and grace". Art writer Nicolas Rothwell described the work as drawing a parallel [...] "between Aboriginal initiation rituals and the ceremonies inside a Masonic lodge." ...|$|E
500|$|The men {{are called}} to the trench {{to prepare for the}} big push. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> hope when the British barrage lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, {{but for the first time}} in any series, does not call it a [...] "cunning plan". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign {{insanity}} because [...] "who would have noticed another madman round here?" [...] The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous machine-gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the Blackadder theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard.|$|E

500|$|Underwood's {{sexuality}} is ambiguous {{throughout much of}} the first two seasons; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated about his homosexuality. It is revealed in [...] "Chapter 8" [...] he had an experience with homosexuality in college. Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1. Slate journalist Hanna Rosin noted: if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real-life Washington couple and they were found each to be having an affair, he would be accused of being [...] "secretly gay, turned on by women only when he can use them for a pure power play". Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood's sexuality, but hypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire. In season 2, Underwood is involved in a threesome with Claire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), while in season 3, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer, Tom Yates (Paul Sparks). The same season, however, also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings (Malcolm Madera), his male personal trainer.|$|E
500|$|P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway {{has been}} a source of {{critical}} discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced [...] "mild claustrophobia" [...] and [...] "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as [...] "the conduit for everything that it builds", along with saying that [...] "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." [...] Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working [...] "within the realm of psychology". Polygon quoted a game player who said that [...] "P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also [...] "curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.|$|E

For me it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> anguish because all my life ... you see, the whole of my adult life ... I have believed in Malaysian merger and the unity of these two territories. You know, it's a people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rana’s work {{deals with}} {{everyday}} {{issues ranging from}} faith and tradition to urbanization and popular culture. He uses photography and video installations to depict his commentary and parody of both social and political scenarios. In his composite photomontages, for instance, each main image {{is made up of}} several thousand smaller photographs of diametrically opposite subjects. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> sudden withdrawal when the viewer moves closer to the picture and becomes aware of the tiny [...] images that compose the larger one.|$|E
2500|$|... "Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord" [...] is a 16-minute-long track {{based on}} the {{traditional}} gospel song. The arrangement was credited to Santana and McLaughlin but Bob Palmer in Rolling Stone wrote that the arrangement is close enough to Lonnie Liston Smith's [...] "to {{be described as a}} cop". Smith's arrangement was recorded in 1970 when he worked with Pharoah Sanders, who had recorded and worked closely with Coltrane. After the slow introductory statement (the part which resembles Smith's arrangement), most of the piece consists of soloing over two chords accompanied by a loping bass and Latin percussion. Of Larry Young's organ contribution here, Paul Stump, in Go Ahead John, wrote: [...] "with its overlapping flurries of triplets, [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> pure genius, worthy of mention in its own right, a musical equivalent of a swarm of surreally coloured butterflies." [...] The track closes with a return to the slow introductory statement.|$|E
2500|$|Tunku {{opened his}} speech in Parliament with the words, [...] "In all the 10 {{years of my}} {{leadership}} of this House I {{have never had a}} duty so unpleasant as this to perform. The announcement which I am making concerns the separation of Singapore {{from the rest of the}} Federation." [...] On that day, a tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation and assumed the role of prime minister of the new nation. His speech included this quote: [...] "For me, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> anguish. All my life, my whole adult life, I have believed in merger and unity of the two territories." [...] Hence, Singapore became the only country in the history of the modern world to gain independence against its own will. After the separation and independence of Singapore in 1965, the Singapore branch of UMNO was renamed the Singapore Malay National Organisation (Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura).|$|E

2500|$|As Adorno {{believed}} that sociology {{needs to be}} self-reflective and self-critical, he also {{believed that}} the language the sociologist uses, like {{the language of the}} ordinary person, is a political construct in large measure that uses, often unreflectingly, concepts installed by dominant classes and social structures (such as our notion of [...] "deviance" [...] which includes both genuinely deviant individuals and [...] "hustlers" [...] operating below social norms because they lack the capital to operate above: for an analysis of this phenomenon, cf. Pierre Bourdieu's book The Weight of the World). He felt that those {{at the top of the}} Institute needed to be the source primarily of theories for evaluation and empirical testing, as well as people who would process the [...] "facts" [...] discovered...including revising theories that were found to be false. For example, in an essay published in Germany on Adorno's return from the USA, and reprinted in the Critical Models essays collection (...) , Adorno praised the egalitarianism and openness of US society [...] based on his sojourn in New York and the Los Angeles area between 1935 and 1955: [...] "Characteristic for the life in America <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> peacefulness, kindness and generosity".

60|$|His hat {{and shoes}} were off; and he rode the yard-arm end, leaning {{backward}} to the gale, and pulling at the earing-rope, like a bridle.

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, all was quiet, and, seemingly, death-like, in the English ships. Their people {{were at their}} quarters, already, and this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> {{profound}} stillness in a vessel of war. The lower ports being down, the portions of the crews stationed on those decks were buried, as it might be, in obscurity, while even those above were still partly concealed by the half-ports. There was virtually nothing for the sail-trimmers to do, and every thing was apparently left to the evolutions of the vast machines themselves, in which they floated. Sir Gervaise, Greenly, and the usual attendants still remained on the poop, their eyes scarcely turning for an instant from the fleet of the enemy.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> intense suspense. Gradually a glimmer of light--an inch--a flood! The shield passes from the opening; the gun runs out. A flash, a roar--a mad reeling of the senses, and crimson clouds flitting before your eyes--a horrible pain in your ears, a sense of oppression on your chest, and the knowledge {{that you are not}} on your feet--a whispering of voices blending with the concert in your ears--a darkness before your eyes--and you feel yourself plump up against the padding, whither you have been thrown by the violence of the concussion.|$|E
60|$|In September 1858, {{after my}} return from New Guinea, I went to stay some {{time at the}} village of Djilolo, {{situated}} in a bay on the northern peninsula. Here I obtained a house through the kindness of the Resident of Ternate, who sent orders to prepare one for me. The first walk into the unexplored forests of a new locality <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> intense interest to the naturalist, as it is almost sure to furnish him with something curious or hitherto unknown. The first thing I saw here was a flock of small parroquets, of which I shot a pair, and was pleased to find a most beautiful little long-tailed bird, ornamented with green, red, and blue colours, and quite new to me. It was a variety of the Charmosyna placentis, {{one of the smallest}} and most elegant of the brush-tongued lories. My hunters soon shot me several other fine birds, and I myself found a specimen of the rare and beautiful day-flying moth, Cocytia d'Urvillei.|$|E
