For this issue, a new storage architecture based on the HDFS is designed {{to solve the problem}} of low efficiency of HDFS storing small files in this article. This paper mainly uses SequenceFile to merge small files and against to the shortcoming that SequenceFile merges small files, the paper provides the solution and designs a new system structure based on HDFS. The system mainly increases the file <b>judgment</b> <b>unit</b> to mark and identify small files, creates a local index file which is helpful to improve the retrieval efficiency of small files to record the size and offset of the small files and finally uses binary serialization to merge the small files, which makes small files be written into large files as time order...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 99) The aim of {{this project}} is to suggest activities to {{meet some of the}} personal growth needs of young people about thirteen years old which could be used by a counselor teaching a semester guidance class at the junior high school level. The three main problem areas for teens focused upon are solving problems, relating to other teens, and getting along with one's family. Each of these sections includes relevant background information on teenage development, behavioral objectives for the unit, and suggested activities to help students cope more effectively in that area. Unit one on solving problems gives the students a problem-solving model and provides opportunities for students to practice using it. It also covers the areas of taking responsibility for problems, decision making in a group, using dreams to solve problems, and making value <b>judgments.</b> <b>Unit</b> two on relating to other teens is divided into three sections: friendship, cliques, and boy-girl relationships. The section on friendship covers such topics as the definition of friendship, qualities of a good friend, and ways of relating to others. The section on cliques helps students understand group pressure and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} group membership. The last section, boy-girl relationships prepares teens for dating by discussing dating behavior, improving their communication skills, and helping them deal with acceptance and rejection. Unit three deals with the family. It provides a number of activities to help the student gain a better understanding of his family and to help him find his new more-adult role in it...|$|R

The main reason for choosing such a subject is contributing to analyse Kadi (Moslem judges) records of Bursa which had never been investigated before. Furthermore, it is aimed to analyse the physical, administrative, social and economic position of Hüdâvendigâr Region in Ottoman History. In this research the above-mentioned records are transcripted and analysed. In addition to this, the literature is investigated. First of all some information is given about Ottoman government and Hüdâvendigâr Region {{at the end of}} XVI. century, according to native and foreign investigators. After this Kadi records are analysed and then the importance and contents of records are explained. At the end, these records are transcripted. As a result; 1 - The administrative organization in this region is a sample of centralizative policy that is used by the government on the provinces. The administrative units of the Sultans are Sancakbeyi (Chief of subdivision of province), Tımarlı Sipahi (cavalry soldiers), Subaşı (police superintendents), Emin (superintendents) and the <b>judgment</b> <b>units</b> are Kadi (Moslem judges). These units with their assistants form the administrative group in provinces (sancak) and towns (kaza). 2 - Bursa, Kite, İznik and Yenişehir towns of the Hüdâvendigâr Region are the free fief towns of Sultan's properties (hâs). The management of these towns are given to Bursa Hâssa Harcı Emini. The main income of the people as townsman, villager or nomads comes from agricultural and industrial production and trading their products. 3 - There is no difference as social status between the Moslem non-Moslem people. Societies being managed in compliance with the Moslem religious and conventional laws. Moreover some advantages are given to non-Moslem people. The administrative class and the public problems in social life solved by Kadi (Moslem judge). 4 - At that time {{it can be seen that}} rebellion events that are called as [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analogically applies {{a framework}} of minor literary analysis to uniquely political units of the built environment. As urbanism is conventionally understood to be executed per the greatest utility of established communal objectives, an underlying politicization is inherent as such forms must adhere to dominant norms of development which potentially marginalize those who practice cultural methods outside normative standards. Employing a uniquely architectural method of environmental justice advocacy, select communities facing disenfranchisement react by self-producing urban-architectural forms ("UAFs") to protect threatened cultural values from marginalization. Installed to subvert the existing power dynamic, such UAFs are potential exhibitions of minor architecture. Adopting the analytical standards established by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari for evaluating Franz Kafka's literature, this paper tests six UAFs to discover if a minor architecture is possible under contemporary globalization. Employing an enumerated framework of minor production characteristics, an interpretive-historical analysis is the primary method of <b>judgment</b> regarding each <b>unit's</b> execution of minor architecture. Two secondary tests are undertaken to validate the primary findings, {{the first of which}} is a physio-logical evaluation that characterizes and measures urban resource utility as per collective minority aims. Second, a newspaper correlation test is undertaken so as to judge the enunciative effectiveness of each community per issues of minority politics. Of the six cases examined, two have their source in cinema including "Bartertown" of MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985) and the "House on Paper Street" of FIGHT CLUB (1999). The four remaining cases include the Tibetan Government-in-Exile of Dharamsala, India; Student Bonfire of Robertson County, Texas; Isla Vista Recreation & Park District of Santa Barbara County, California; and the Emergent Cannabis Community of Arcata, California. Of all the cases studied, only the Tibetan Government-in-Exile met both the conditions of minor architecture and was validated in terms of practiced urban resource use as well as effective representation in mainstream newsprint. Both cinematic cases failed as minor productions of the built environment. Although they did not find full validation, the three remaining real-world UAFs each were found on a course of minor architectural expression at varying stages of execution...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{nursing care}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} predictor of overall patient’s satisfaction. In Italy such researches are few, especially regarding emergency unit, and they use not-validated instruments. The aim of this study was to measure and describe the relationship between patient satisfaction and nursing care provided in a Emergency Room. Methods: The study took place between 2010 - 2011 in a town hospital of Grosseto-Italy. A trained operator administered the italian version of the Consumer Emergency Care Satisfaction Scale questionnaire (CECCS) to patients having white-blue-green code who were admitted at the Emergency Room. CECCS has two scales: Caring (CS), with 12 items, each scoring from 1 to 5 and Teaching Ability (TS), 3 items, each scoring from 1 to 5. When the CS and TS score are respectively from 12 to 32 and from 3 to 7 patients are not satisfied, from 33 to 42 and from 8 to 10 patients are neutral and from 43 to 60 and 11 to 15 patients are satisfied. Results: A total of 160 CECCS questionnaires were administered. The sample consisted of 54 % males and 46 % females, 94 % Italians and 6 % foreigners. Focusing on code of admission, 84 % of patients had a green code, 16 % a blue/white code. After triage, the 76 % of patients lied in waiting for medical examination less than 30 minutes, 14 % from 30 to 60 minutes and 10 % from 1 to 3 hours. The 54 % of discharges occurred after 1 to 3 hours, 33 % under 30 minutes, 11 % from 3 to 6 hours and 2 % after 6 hours. Regarding the “CS” 95 % of patients were satisfied, while through “TS” 58, 7 % of patients resulted satisfied, 41, 3 % not satisfied. Finally, the overall satisfaction with Emergency Care saw the 31 % of patients very satisfied, 67 % satisfied and 2 % not satisfied. Conclusions: This survey highlighted the efficiency (short time of waiting and discharges) and the efficacy (the emergency nurses matched patient’s expectation in both CECCS scales and patient’s overall satisfaction obtained one of the higher score) of our Emergency Room. However, to express a complete <b>judgment</b> of Emergency <b>Unit,</b> one of CECCS limits is that it does not report information about the performances of Emergency personnel in case of yellow and red codes...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{concrete}} armour layer units {{is becoming more}} common nowadays {{as a replacement for}} the rock armour in the breakwater rubble mound design. The development {{of concrete}} armour units in time led to various individual types and forms with specific individual characteristics. One of the latest developments of concrete armour layer units is the Xbloc® unit by Delta Marine Consultants (DMC). The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate and validate the study of the placement of the Xbloc unit specifically on a curved section of the breakwater using a large scale model test. Xbloc unit are placed on a breakwater slope row by row starting from bottom. Then the placement will be continued to another new row above until the units are completely covering the whole slope of the breakwater. Placement of the Xbloc unit on a straight section is quite straight forward with a constant relation between the surrounding units. The relations are based on the horizontal distances to the other unit in the same row and the distance to the unit upslope on the next row above. With a correct placement distances a required packing density and the interlocking effect between the units can be achieved. However, the relations of the distances are not applicable for a curved section of a breakwater. A curved section of a breakwater has a difference in radius length further upslope. The differences in radius lengths create improper placement distances between the units in the higher upslope. The horizontal distance between the two units becoming smaller and very close to each other. Eventually one unit has to be left out. The calculation of the packing density are also differs from the method used to calculate for the unit on a straight section. Hence, a new method was used to calculate the packing density for the breakwater curved section. The relations of the unit placement distances on a breakwater curve have been studied by ten Oever in his MSc thesis in 2006. A theoretically study are made and was validated by a placement tests on a model of a breakwater straight section. From the study, a computer model was developed to generate an optimal design grid position to place the Xbloc unit on a breakwater slope. ten Oever suggested a new unit are place off centre with an angle when the horizontal distances on the row below are becoming closer and closer. The off centre distance will be based on the horizontal distances between the two units. The maximum off centre distance are 0. 4 D and the unit will be left out. The angle is called the unit adjust angle and to be 450 from the horizontal line. Hence, this thesis focuses on validating the design placement grid generated by the computer model. Two placement tests have been performed using a model of a quarter of a breakwater head. The first test was performed following the generated design grid from the computer model. The output result of the final Xbloc position from the first placement tests was generally can be achieved according to the design grid with some distortion. The distortions of the units are mostly on {{the upper part of the}} breakwater slope especially in the row above where there is a left out unit. Furthermore, the packing density was 3 % lower than the required theoretical packing density. In accordance to the first placement test, the second placement test was made to further improve the placement of the Xbloc unit. The second test is performed by correcting the design grid by using a coherent judgement before placing a new <b>unit.</b> <b>Judgments</b> are made by visually looking to the overview of the units in surrounding to ensure the new unit are placed in a suitable position for better fit between the two base units. The packing density resulted in higher values. Most of the units after the row where there is a left out unit are placed with a lower upslope distances than the design grid. The gap resulted from the left out unit are also being reduced when the unit a placed with a lower upslope distances. In conclusion, the placement quality can be improved by lowering the upslope distances in the computer algorithm for generating the optimal design grid. This could possibly be done by changing the parameters of maximal off centre distance to 0. 3 D and unit adjust angle in the order of 300 to 400. A comparison of the placement made in the laboratory and the placement of the prototype unit from the breakwater project in Port Oriel are made. Although a direct comparison could not be made in accordance to the relations between the placement grids, nevertheless there are several conclusions that can be drawn from the placement made in Port Oriel. The placement of the units in the Port Oriel was denser than the placement of the model units in the laboratory. This is mainly due to the larger forces on the edges of the units and due to the use of the excavator which actively pushed the units into a tight placement pattern. This is not done in the laboratory as the placements made are based on the use of a crane. Denser placement is acceptable for the stability of the armour layer but it leads to higher concrete use on the breakwater head. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
