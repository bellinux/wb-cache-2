Accordingly, the use of sustainable materials for green buildings construction is an important goal that must be reached in short times. Sustainable cements can be designed by partially replacing clinker content with non hazardous waste. Indeed, recycling process can transform waste in secondary raw materials that work as new cement constituents usually leading to sustainable binders with peculiar <b>environmental</b> <b>resistances.</b> Details of cement manufacturing process and its effect on the environmental pollution as well as the route that can be carried out to tailor sustainable cements are reported and discussed...|$|R

The maximum microhardness was found 119 % higher for the same nano-filler concentration compared to monolithic polyester.

40|$|The {{culture of}} social development, in general, {{and that of}} {{economical}} one, in particular, at least in its modern meaning, has its origin in the structural definition of industrialized society. The writer of this essay aims at introducing a short reflexion {{in which it is}} possible to distinguish two opposing tendencies that are always crossed each other on the way of western modernity and have characterized the industrial development logic, that is both a capitalistic production system and a development based on protectionist controls. In the first case, the industrial process, promoted primary by the enlightened middle classes, at the beginning and during the second revolution {{at the end of the}} 19 th century, has never met the <b>environmental</b> <b>resistances</b> depth, favouring a materialistic conception of production based on exploitation of available resources, involving the human ones. So doing, it has followed a utilitarian logic, aiming at a market economy which has become, in the 29 th century the main historical reference subject. In the second case, a conservative culture, even if has shared the industrial production development, has tried to impose a production rationalization, connected to needs. These two tendencies and others, which are not the object of this research, have been the expression of a modernity culture that during two centuries of industrial development have attracted the attention, but at the same time, have also originated controversies...|$|R

5000|$|Pourbiax {{diagrams}} {{will show}} the phases that a material will take in an aqueous environment, based on electrical potential and pH. The brain maintains a pH of around 7.2 to 7.4, and from the Pourbaix diagram of platinum [...] {{it can be seen}} that at around 0.8 volts Pt at the surface will oxidize to PtO2, and at around 1.6 volts, PtO2 will oxidize to PtO3. These voltages do not seem to be outside of reasonable range for neural stimulation. The voltage required for stimulation may change significantly over the life of a single electrode. This change is required to maintain a consistent current output through variations in the surrounding <b>environmental</b> <b>resistance.</b> The changes in resistance may be due to: adsorption of material onto the electrode, corrosion of the electrode, encapsulation of the electrode in fibrous tissue - known as a glial scar, or changes in the chemical environment around the electrode. Ohm's law V = I * R shows the interdependence of voltage, current and resistance. When voltage change causes a crossing of equilibrium lines as seen in a Pourbaix diagram during a stimulation, the changing polarization of the electrode is no longer linear. Undesirable polarization can lead to adverse effects such as corrosion, fouling, and toxicity. Because of this equilibrium potential, pH, and required current density should be considered when making material choice since these can affect the surface chemistry and biocompatibility of the implant.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine a radical {{relational}} agency, applied to contemporary <b>environmental</b> <b>resistances,</b> that incorporates both the thought of Michel Foucault and complexity theory. While Foucault’s thought, following from his argument that power is a relation, implies a relational agency, it does not, however, account for the agency of nonhumans and environments. Because power is a relation and not a possession, {{it can no longer}} be viewed as an attribute of individual subjects. Similarly, a relational agency is defined as an aspect of power relations. Complexity theory, on the other hand, acknowledges that humans interact with nonhumans and environments, but does not acknowledge that all relations are relations of power. In addition to Foucault’s explanation of power relations, complexity theory explicitly describes the processes of self-organization through which individual and diverse agents interact and change can emerge. Thus, a radical relational agency is defined as an aspect of the power relationships between many diverse agents. Change, according to both Foucault and complexity theory, happens nonlinearly. As a result, it often occurs unpredictably. However, change within complex systems is also limited by previous historical emergences. In this sense, both possibility and risk are inherent in the relationships between humans, nonhumans and environments. Indeed, I argue that a radical relational agency occurs because there are both possibilities and risks generated within ecological relations and relations of power. Therefore, I argue that any environmental action must account for the unpredictability inherent to the complex interactions between humans, nonhumans and environments.
