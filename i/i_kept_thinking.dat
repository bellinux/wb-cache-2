25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show.

Gradual clarifying this aim, the connections and both immediate and oblique assumptions of such a tendency interconnected with the issues of an open-air theatre space, specifically the possibilities of Revolving Theatre based in chateau gardens in Cesky Krumlov.

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed. In a DVD {{review of the}} first series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema thought Macfadyen {{was not a very}} good actor and believed [...] "he seems to be in some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression," [...] but thought the character himself, particularly his personal life, mostly worked well for the most part as it continues [...] "as a standard soap opera."

500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, {{a female}} {{teacher at the}} school was {{involved}} in a nationally covered sex scandal and charged with sexual battery involving two male students, ages 17 and 18. In late 2008, the school received notice that the parents of the first student were suspicious of the contact between the teacher and student. The school was investigating internally to see if the claims were warranted. Then, in early 2009, the family of the second student contacted the school and filed a complaint that the student confirmed an inappropriate relationship was taking place. The same day, Erin Speicher, then 34, resigned from her position as a ninth-grade English teacher at Rittman High School. She taught at the school for 12 years. Speicher was arrested and was being held on a $75,000 cash bond at the Wayne County Jail. Speicher engaged in sexual conduct with one student in June 2008 and again sometime between August and October. She engaged in sexual conduct with a second student five times in January 2009, according to the indictment. She pleaded guilty to a seven-count indictment of sexual battery in Wayne County Common Pleas Court and was sentenced to four years in prison. Speicher, who was married (currently divorced) with two young children at the time, is quoted as saying to the court [...] "As a result of my actions I will never teach again, and I love teaching. Last week I taught my 4-year-old and my 3-year-old the words, 'correctional facility,' to explain that is where I may have to live for a while. ... But <b>I</b> also <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> that if my sons were the victims in this case, I know I would want that teacher punished." [...] Speicher's attorney, Norman Miller, said she was remorseful for her actions, and had sought counseling. Upon release from prison, Speicher will be classified as a Tier 3 sex offender, which comes with a lifetime registry.|$|R

Arkansas had injury problems of its own, and became one-dimensional with Cedric Cobbs, the Hogs' starting running back, missing much of the second half with a turf toe injury. The Razorbacks got the ball with ten minutes left in the fourth quarter and scored two touchdowns in a span of 4½ minutes. The tying touchdown was a 92-yard touchdown pass to Richard Smith from Matt Jones. Said Jones of that play after the game, [...] "The coaches have told us never to quit, and we were down seven at our own 8, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> about that."

Levinson was impressed by Zimmer's work and hired him to score Rain Man. In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers (mostly a Fairlight CMI) mixed with steel drums. Zimmer explained that [...] "It was a road movie, and road movies usually have jangly guitars or a bunch of strings. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>thinking</b> don't be bigger than the characters.

I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time.
