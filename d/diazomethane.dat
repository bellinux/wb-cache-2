It was not until 1935 that another ICI chemist, Michael Perrin, developed this accident into a reproducible high-pressure synthesis for polyethylene that {{became the basis for}} industrial LDPE production beginning in 1939. Because polyethylene was found to have very low-loss properties at very high frequency radio waves, commercial distribution in Britain was suspended on the outbreak of World War II, secrecy imposed, and the new process was used to produce insulation for UHF and SHF coaxial cables of radar sets.

Peptidyl <b>diazomethanes</b> are the most specific inhibitors available for lysosomal cysteine proteinases and can be hypothesized to interrupt visceral yolk sac (VYS) -mediated nutrition during early organogenesis. When added directly to the culture medium of gestational day 10 – 11 rat conceptuses, both compounds inhibited lysosomal cysteine proteinase activity in the VYS in a concentration-dependent fashion that correlated with the degree of embryotoxicity observed. Z-Phe-Ala-CHN 2 and Z-Phe-Phe-CHN 2 were also found to increase the protein content of the VYS, even though all other conceptal growth parameters decreased. This effect was dependent on the serum content of the culture medium and the exposure time. Histological examination of Z-Phe-Ala-CHN 2 -treated conceptuses revealed {{a dramatic increase in}} the size and number of vacuoles in the VYS endoderm epithelium, suggestive of inhibition of VYS proteolysis.

The resulting cyclopropyl units are found as a basic structural element in a wide range of naturally occurring compounds and biologically active compounds, and can serve as versatile synthetic intermediates in the synthesis of multifunctionalized cycloalkanes and acyclic compounds. Since Co(II) complexes of D 2 -symmetric chiral amidoporphyrins [Co(D 2 -Por*) ] were first introduced in 2004, Co(II) -metalloradical catalysis (MRC) have emerged as a new platform for asymmetric cyclopropanation.

This dissertation aims to develop new Co(II) -MRC based enantioselective cyclopropanation systems.

Using isodesmic reactions, correlation between stabilization energies of cumulenes and substituent group electronegativities (c BE) is established {{and the results}} from DFT and MP 2 methods are compared with the earlier HF calculations.

Inhibition by HgCl 2, iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide suggests that free thiols are necessary for the enzyme to maintain activity, but that these thiols are not particularly reactive as is the case for cysteine proteinases of the papain superfamily. The peptidyl aldehydes chymostatin and leupeptin were found to be reversible inhibitors of multicatalytic proteinase. Chymostatin inhibited activity against succinyl-Ala-Ala-Phe- 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin at pH 4. 5 (Ki 160 +/- 22 microM) whereas leupeptin (200 microM) was not inhibitory. Inhibition of activity against benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Gly-Arg- 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin by these compounds was more complex, in that they behaved as slow tight-binding inhibitors. kon values were determined to be 12 +/- 2 M- 1. s- 1 and 1290 +/- 125 M- 1. s- 1 for chymostatin and leupeptin, respectively.

40|$|The carbon-hydrogen bonds (abbreviated as C-H bonds) are {{fundamental}} and most common chemical bonds {{in a variety}} of organic compounds. Owing to the high bond dissociation energy, transformations of inert C H bonds into C-C bonds or C-X bonds (X= S, O, N, Cl, Br, etc.) are still great challenges nowadays. In general, traditional approaches for the transformations of C-H bonds rely on prefunctionalized starting materials for both reactivity and selectivity or require costly chemical steps. Thus, the development of a cheap and alternative method is still desirable to address the above issues. Transition metal catalyzed direct functionalization of inert C H bonds has attracted great attention and gradually emerged as a powerful method in organic synthesis. In the first chapter, a new combination of rhodium(III) and Fe(OAc) 2 have been utilized for the functionalization of the NH-sulfoximines through direct C-H activation pathway, including annulation reaction with alkynes and addition reaction with hetero bicycle alkenes. Mechanistically, the transformations involved a dual C-H/N-H activation, which was substantiated by KIE studies and the isolation of a reactive rhodacycle intermediate. Then the useful applications of the yielded products have been demonstrated by the oxidative cleavage of the 1, 2 -benzothiazines or I 2 -mediated phosphorylation or acid-assisted dehydration of the addition products. In the second chapter, we focus on the [4 + 1] cycloaddition reactions between hydrazones and sulfur ylides. Previouslu, numerous examples have been reported for the synthesis of dihydropyrazole.

Complexes herein are routinely characterized by 1 H NMR, infrared and electronic absorption spectroscopies, and X-ray crystallography. The reactivity of these complexes with a variety of organic substrates, including terminal acetylides, amines, a variety of phenols, and benzene thiol, has been explored. This has resulted in the quantitative formation of a series of uranium(III) -element bonds, of the type Tp* 2 UR, via protonation of the alkyl substituent. ^ The studies of the reactivity of U(III) alkyl complexes are extended through exposure to a variety of C=E (E = O, S) multiple bond containing substrates. Treating the U(III) alkyl complex with carbon dioxide results in insertion into the uranium-carbon bond to generate Tp* 2 (O 2 CCH 2 Ph). The addition of 1 atm of CO 2 to the bis-Tp* U(III) derivatives results in the insertion of the greenhouse gas. In analogy, the reactivity of carbon disulfide was evaluated. CS 2 was successfully inserted across the uranium alkyl, amide, and thiol linkages. Additionally, the reactivity of Tp* 2 UCH 2 Ph with various ketones and acetates was explored. ^ Addition of a series of organic oxidants including pyridine-n-oxide, sulfur, and a variety of azides and <b>diazomethanes,</b> results in the quantitative formation of Tp* 2 U(E 2 -) (E = O, S 2, NR, N-NCR 2) and half an equivalent of bibenzyl. This type of reactivity shows the unique character of the U(III) carbon bond and how {{it can be used to}} facilitate two electron processes on uranium through reductive coupling of the alkyl substituent. This results in the alkyl complex functioning as a source of 2 ̆ 2 Tp* 2 U 2 ̆ 2. ^ The synthesis and reactivity of a rare, U(III) bis alkyl complex, Tp* 2 U(CH 2 Ph) 2 (THF) is summarized in chapter four. Upon exposure of this alkyl complex to an equivalent of benzophenone or mesityl azide, oxidation occurs, resulting in the formation of a U+ 4 product. Traditional reactivity of the bis alkyl complex towards protonolysis has been presented as well. Furthermore, the bis alkyl complex supports the first catalytic example of hydrosilyation of terminal olefins by uranium. ^ The chemistry of uranium with redox-active amido phenolate ligands is highlighted in Chapter 5 of this work. A series of mono amido phenolate uranium complexes have been synthesized, including (dippisq•) UI 3 (THF) 2, (dippap) UI 2 (THF) 2, (dippap) U(CH 2 Ph) 2 (THF) 2, and Cp* 2 U(dippap). Bis(amido-phenolate) U(IV) species have been synthesized and isolated as (Rap) 2 U(THF) (R = tBu, DIPP). Subsequent reactivity with I 2 produces the oxidative addition products (Risq) 2 UI 2 (THF), which establishes the [ap] ligand framework as viable for supporting two electron processes on uranium. ^ The final entry of this work focuses on the development of asymmetric ligand frameworks for a series of uranium complexes. Chiral species are important for the development of catalysts that mediate a variety types of asymmetric processes. A series of mixed ligand uranium(III) complexes, bis(Tp R) and TpR/Cp*, were synthesized and characterized, and subsequent alkylation chemistry was explored. Likewise, a series of mixed redox-active and CpR ancillary species were generated to serve as a platform for the isolation of tetravalent uranium alkyl complexes. Finally, the {{synthesis of}} uranium(III) and (IV) complexes supported by the tris(oxazoline) borate ligands are reported. ...|$|R
