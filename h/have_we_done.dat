Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son just sat there riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, what <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>done?</b> We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, you should have seen it on the wide screen! They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered out into the night, convinced that we were on to a winner." [...] In his DVD commentary, Gerry Anderson praised Saunders' direction.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} anti-apartheid protest music often used subversive {{meanings}} hidden under innocuous lyrics, partially {{as a consequence}} of the censorship that they experienced. Purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning. The tendency to use hidden meaning increased as the government grew less tolerant from the 1950s to the 1980s. Popular protest songs of the 1950s often directly addressed politicians. [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] by Mini told Hendrik Verwoerd to [...] "Naants'indod'emnyama, Verwoerd bhasobha" [...] (beware of the advancing blacks), while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included the phrase [...] "Hey Strydom, Wathint'a bafazi, way ithint'imbodoko uzaKufa" [...] (Strydom, now that you have touched the women, you have struck a rock, you have dislodged a boulder, and you will be crushed). Following the Sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of the government, and more mournful. [...] "Thina Sizwe" [...] included references to stolen land, was described as depicting emotional desolation, while [...] "Senzeni Na" [...] (what <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>done)</b> achieved the same effect by repeating that phrase a number of times. Some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics, thereby avoiding the censors. The Soweto uprising marked a turning point in the movement, as songs written in the 1980s again became more direct, with the appearance of musicians such as Lucey, who [...] "believed in an in‐your‐face, tell‐it‐like‐it‐is approach". Lyrics from this period included calls such as [...] "They are lying to themselves. Arresting us, killing us, won't work. We'll still fight for our land," [...] and [...] "The whites don't negotiate with us, so let's fight".|$|E

2500|$|On the night, Labour's {{candidate}} Judith Tizard {{came within}} 406 votes {{of winning the}} traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Tizard's near-win fueled Lange's misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, [...] "That election night was a great revelation for me. That was an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set me to think what on earth <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>done</b> that we come within 400 votes of winning the true-blue seat of Remuera. And that struck me as being a dangerous flirtation, and an act of treachery to the people we were born to represent." ...|$|E

[...] "I think since we already are in that world, about 70 percent of the Navy's IT infrastructure, we are in a world where the Navy has complete control and authority over how we operate the network. That has allowed us to maintain extremely high degree of security, which is frankly our number one issue. The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from. To that note, what <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>done</b> to lessen blow in future? I think the answer is we don't need to because we are already there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Entrames {{started at}} 11:00 am on 28 October 1793 when Beaupuy's {{division}} accompanied by Marceau encountered the Vendeans on {{the heights of}} Entrammes. Kléber brought his division up in support of Beaupuy who had come under assault. Unfortunately, Léchelle had jammed the entire army into a single column in which the rear was unable {{to come to the}} assistance of the vanguard, nor could the army commander issue the orders required to remedy the situation. Though they were facing the army's best troops, the Vendeans mounted an extremely effective attack which steadily drove back the Republicans. Finally, seeing the rear of the column start to disintegrate, the divisions of Kléber and Beaupuy took to their heels. That evening the Republicans tried to hold Château-Gontier, but the rebels drove them from there. Troops from the Army of the West scattered as far as Nantes, Angers and Rennes. One source placed Republican losses as 12,000 men and 19 artillery pieces out of 30,000. A more modest estimate is 4,000 Republican casualties out of 25,000 against 2,100 Vendeans killed and wounded out of 31,000. As his soldiers fled, Léchelle shouted, [...] "What have I done that I should command such cowards?"
