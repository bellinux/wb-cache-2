25|$|During {{his long}} tenure {{in the office}} (1968–79, 1980–84), Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau made social and {{cultural}} change his political goal for Canada, including the pursuit of an official policy on bilingualism and plans for significant constitutional change. The west, particularly the oil and <b>gas-producing</b> province of Alberta, opposed many of the policies emanating from central Canada, with the National Energy Program creating considerable antagonism and growing western alienation.|$|E
25|$|One is shallow, {{biogenic}}ally derived gas {{in mixed}} sand and shale sequences. Shallow biogenic gas {{is considered to}} be an unconventional gas resource since it is not generated in the same temperature and pressure systems found in conventional hydrocarbon generation. The Milk River and Medicine Hat sands of southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan are classic examples of this type of unconventional gas. This is the area where gas was first produced in western Canada, and it is still a major producing region. This continuously <b>gas-producing</b> area is the largest in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the Carlsbad area is based {{primarily}} on the mineral extraction sector; the city overlies the rich oil- and <b>gas-producing</b> formations of the Permian Basin and produces more potash than any other location in the United States.

Tourism is a major factor with Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Lincoln National Forest, the Living Desert Zoo and Gardens State Park, and the annual Christmas on the Pecos Light Show all located within fifty miles of the city.|$|E

40|$|We will {{demonstrate}} that carbon particles consisting of large cages {{can be produced}} without catalytic metal. The carbon particles were produced in CO gas {{as well as by}} introduction of 5 % methane gas into the CO gas. The <b>gas-produced</b> carbon particles were able to absorb approximately 16. 2 wt% of hydrogen. This value is 2. 5 times higher than the 6. 5 wt% goal for the vehicular hydrogen storage proposed by the Department of Energy in the USA. Therefore, we believe that this carbon particle is an excellent candidate for hydrogen storage for fuel cells...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{development}} of hydraulic fracturing {{for natural gas}} production from shale reservoirs presents a significant challenge related to {{the management of the}} high-salinity wastewaters that return to the surface. In addition to high total dissolved solids (TDS), shale <b>gas-produced</b> brines typically contain elevated concentrations of radium (Ra), which must be treated properly to prevent contamination of surface waters and allow for safe disposal or reuse of produced water. Treatment strategies that isolate radium in the lowest volume waste streams would be desirable to reduce disposal cost and generate useful treatment by-products. The present study evaluates the potential of a commercial strong acid cation exchange resin for removing Ra 2 + from high-TDS brines using fixed-bed column reactors. Column reactors were operated with varying brine chemistries and salinities in an effort to find optimal conditions for Ra 2 + removal through ion exchange. To overcome competing divalent cations present in the brine for exchange sites, the chelating agent, EDTA, was used to form stable complexes predominantly with the higher concentration Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Sr 2 + divalent cations, while isolating the much lower concentration Ra 2 + species. Results showed that Ra 2 + removal by the resin strongly depended on the TDS concentration and could be improved with careful selection of EDTA concentration. This strategy of metal chelation coupled with ion exchange resins may be effective in enhancing Ra 2 + removal and reducing the generation and disposal cost if volume reduction of low-level radioactive solid waste can be achieved...|$|R
25|$|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Uyghur : شىنجاڭ ئۇيغۇر ئاپتونوم رايونى / Shinjang Uyghur Aptonom Rayoni, Chinese : 新疆维吾尔自治区), is a provincial-level {{autonomous}} region of China {{in the northwest}} of the country. It is the largest Chinese administrative division and the eighth largest country subdivision in the world, spanning over 1.6 million km2 (640,000 squaremiles). Xinjiang contains the disputed territory of Aksai Chin, which is administered by China. Xinjiang borders the countries of Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The rugged Karakoram, Kunlun, and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, {{as well as its}} western and southern regions. Xinjiang also borders Tibet Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai. The most well-known route of the historical Silk Road ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border. In recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang, and it is currently China's largest natural <b>gas-producing</b> region.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being an}} ancient {{treatment}} for various digestive complaints, activated charcoal {{did not produce}} reduction in both the total flatus volume nor the release of sulfur-containing gasses, {{and there was no}} reduction in abdominal symptoms (after 0.52g activated charcoal four times a day for 1 week). The authors suggested that saturation of charcoal binding sites during its passage through the gut was the reason for this. A further study concluded that activated charcoal (4g) does not influence gas formation in vitro or in vivo. Other authors reported that activated charcoal was effective. A study in 8 dogs concluded activated charcoal (unknown oral dose) reduced H2S by 71%. In combination with yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate, this was increased to an 86% H2S reduction, although total flatus volume and number of flatus events was unchanged. An early study reported activated charcoal (unknown oral dose) prevented a large {{increase in the number of}} flatus events and increased breath hydrogen concentrations that normally occur following a <b>gas-producing</b> meal.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} LDRD {{involves}} {{development of}} a system dynamics model to understand the interdependencies between water resource availability and water needs for production of biofuels. Specifically, this model focuses on availability and feasibility of non-traditional water sources from dairy wastewater, produced water from crude oil production and from coal-bed methane gas extraction {{for the production of}} algal-based biofuel. The conceptual simulation framework and historical data are based on two locales within New Mexico, the San Juan basin in the northwest and the Permian basin in the southeast, where oil and gas drilling have increased considerably in the last ten years. The overall water balance ignores both transportation options and water chemistry and is broken down by county level. The resulting model contains an algal growth module, a dairy module, an oil production module, and a gas production module. A user interface is also created for controlling the adjustable parameters in the model. Our preliminary investigation indicates a cyclical demand for non-fresh water due to the cyclical nature of algal biomass production and crop evapotranspiration. The wastewater from the dairy industry is not a feasible non-fresh water source because the agricultural water demand for cow's dry feed far exceeds the amount generated at the dairy. The uncertainty associated with the water demand for cow's dry matter intake is the greatest in this model. The oil- and <b>gas-produced</b> water, ignoring the quality, provides ample supply for water demand in algal biomass production. There remains work to address technical challenges associated with coupling the appropriate non-fresh water source to the local demand...|$|R
2500|$|Although the {{conventional}} {{oil and gas}} industry in western Canada is mature, the country's Arctic and offshore petroleum resources are mostly in early stages of exploration and development.

2500|$|The Commission {{was charged}} by Texas state law with the {{administration}} {{of oil and gas}} regulations, including production quotas for each field and well.

[...] Because of the complex geology of oil fields and multiple division of surface rights, one user’s oil drilling activity can affect the production of others, which meant that both public and private interests were at stake. [...] Underground water and gas pressure needed to be monitored in order to maintain steady oil production and prevent waste.|$|E
