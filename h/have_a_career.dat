5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} {{suggestion}} that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E

Sidelined for 6 weeks, Higgins was limited to 61 games, though still managed to match his previous season's points total with 22 goals and 16 assists. Set to become a restricted free agent in the off-season, Montreal re-signed Higgins to a two-year, US$3.4 million deal on June 25, 2007. Prior {{to the start of the}} 2007–08 season, Higgins was named an alternate captain for the Canadiens. He went on to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> season with personal bests of 27 goals, 25 assists and 52 points. On November 11, 2008, Higgins recorded his first NHL hat-trick in a 4–0 win over the Ottawa Senators. However, his points total decreased in his fourth NHL campaign with 23 points over 57 games.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} family, whose forebears had been {{involved}} in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she was not expected to work outside the home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>career,</b> she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E
5|$|In 2006–07, Salo sprained {{his knee}} {{in a game}} against the Minnesota Wild on 2 November 2006.

The Canucks entered the 2007 playoffs as the third seed. After eliminating the Dallas Stars in the first round, Vancouver was defeated by the Anaheim Ducks in five games.

5|$|The {{family moved}} to Berlin in 1811, leaving Hamburg in {{disguise}} fearing French revenge for the Mendelssohn bank's role in breaking Napoleon's Continental System blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children– Fanny, Felix, Paul and Rebecka– the best education possible. Fanny became a well-known pianist and amateur composer; originally Abraham had thought that she, rather than Felix, would be the more musical. But at that time, it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, {{for a woman to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> in music, so Fanny remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was also disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he seriously intended to dedicate himself to it.|$|E

25|$|First and {{foremost}} in the implied Nazi doctrine concerning women was {{the notion of}} motherhood and procreation for those of child-bearing ages.

Women only had a limited right to training revolving around domestic tasks, and were, over time, restricted from teaching in universities, from medical professions and from serving in political positions within the NSDAP. Many restrictions were lifted once wartime necessity dictated changes to policy later in the regime's existence.|$|E

25|$|Although Ron Clarke had {{a number}} of junior world records for {{distances}} of 1500m, one mile (1.6km) and two miles (3km), he was relatively unknown in 1956. Perhaps the opportunity to carry the torch inspired him because he went on to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> of exceptional brilliance and was without doubt the most outstanding runner of his day. At one stage he held the world record for every distance from two miles (3km) to 20km. His few failures came in Olympic and Commonwealth Games competition. Although favourite for the gold at Tokyo in 1964 he was placed ninth in the 5,000metres race and the marathon and third in the 10,000metres.
