40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnetic fields may {{interfere}} with the function of cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, which are small in size but produce strong magnetic fields, have become widely available in recent years. Therefore, NdFeB magnets {{may be associated with}} an emerging risk of <b>device</b> <b>interference.</b> OBJECTIVE: We conducted a clinical study to evaluate the potential of small NdFeB magnets to interfere with cardiac pacemakers and ICDs. METHODS: The effect of four NdFeB magnets (two spherical magnets 8 and 10 mm in diameter, a necklace made of 45 spherical magnets, and a magnetic name tag) was tested in forty-one ambulatory patients with a pacemaker and 29 patients with an ICD. The maximum distance at which the magnetic switch of a device was influenced was observed. RESULTS: Magnetic interference was observed in all patients. The maximum distance resulting in <b>device</b> <b>interference</b> was 3 cm. No significant differences were found with respect to device manufacturer and device types. CONCLUSION: Small NdFeB magnets may cause interference with cardiac pacemakers and ICDs. Patients should be cautioned about the interference risk associated with NdFeB magnets during daily life...|$|E

30|$|We applied both {{trackers}} to {{two different}} types of real signals: a photosenor insect activity signal and an arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal. The photosensor insect activity signal has a clear harmonic structure, which carries important entomological information. The instantaneous frequency and the harmonic amplitudes help entomologists determine what kind of insects flew over the photosensor [23, 24]. The ABP signal also has many harmonics by nature. Accurate tracking of the harmonics in the ABP signal is critical to check a patient's heart condition. However, the ABP signal can often be noisy due to signal drops and medical <b>device</b> <b>interference.</b> The following example will demonstrate that the FBSL-SPKS harmonic tracker is more robust to this type of noise than the EKS harmonic tracker.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cardiac {{pacemakers}} and implantable defibrillators {{are potentially}} susceptible to electromagnetic interferences {{as they have}} complex circuitry for sensing and communication purposes. Cellular telephones being {{an important source of}} electromagnetic waves are likely to cause interference in the function of these devices.

40|$|Abstract — With {{the growing}} amount of {{wireless}} <b>devices,</b> <b>interference</b> robustness is a receiver specification of increasing importance. This paper presents {{a technique that}} improves both out-of-band compression and weakly non-linear distortion. It mitigates the effect of non-linearity in the baseband amplifier by preceding it by a cross-coupled passive filter. This provides a highly linear passive shunt path for out-of-band currents, while maintaining wideband input matching. The 65 nm CMOS prototype chip achieves 41 dBm out-of-band IIP 3 at 40 MHz offset and an 11 dBm out-of-band blocker compression point.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{broadband}} wireless interference {{in a computer}} platform is resulted by multiple electro-magnetic emission sources. This non-Gaussian interference is proved to be double-sided K-distributed in previous research. With the limitation of transmission power and dimension of the <b>device,</b> <b>interference</b> mitigation is {{an efficient way to}} improve received signal bit error rate (BER). When applied on the double-sided K-distributed interference in the presence of Gaussian noise, traditional interference/noise cancellation schemes are not able to produce satisfactory results. In this thesis, our target is to find an interference mitigation method with improved BER performance. By introducing a new criterion of goodness, i. e. the cross-cumulant, the new adaptive algorithm based on higher order statistics (HOS) is designed to reconstruct and to cancel the interference in a recursive fashion. It is proved to be effective on both experimental binary transmission system and the OFDM system which is widely applied in modern mobile communication devices. Compared to the previous cancellation method, the BER performance is improved considerably...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} used the Amplatzer septal occluder to close Fontan fenestrations. Between June 1998 and December 1999, 13 patients underwent transcatheter occlusion of their Fontan fenestrations. Systemic blood flow decreased significantly without a concomitant decrease in pulmonary blood flow. All residual shunts detectable by oximetry were at sites separate from those into which occlusion devices were implanted. One patient developed severe tricuspid regurgitation following the procedure requiring surgical {{removal of the}} device. At the last follow-up, all patients were doing well clinically. There were no shunts detectable through or around the devices by echocardiography. Our experience indicates that {{the location of the}} fenestration within the Fontan baffle is critical to avoiding <b>device</b> <b>interference</b> with other intracardiac structures. The Amplatzer septal occluder offers an effective means of transcatheter closure of Fontan baffle fenestrations. Although more experience is needed, our current follow-up data suggest that long-term outcomes will be favorable. Cathet. Cardiovasc. Intervent. 51 : 301 – 304, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

The temperature-dependent magnetization measured by superconducting quantum <b>device</b> <b>interference</b> (SQUID) from 5 K to 800 K was characterized by three different critical temperatures (T* C ~ 45 K, T C 1 ~ 630 - 650 K and T C 2 ~ 805 - 825 K).

40|$|BackgroundLeft atrial {{appendage}} (LAA) closure devices {{have been introduced}} recently as an alternative for oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Because of potential overlap of ablation target areas and the previously implanted LAA closure device, as well as potential complications such as mechanical damage to the device, left atrial (LA) ablation remains a subject of debate in these patients. ObjectiveWe report on the feasibility and clinical efficacy of LA ablation after implantation of LAA closure devices. MethodsEight patients (6 men; age 69 ± 8 years) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF (n = 5) or persistent AF (mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score 3. 6 ± 0. 7, mean HAS-BLED score 3. 6 ± 1. 5) and previously implanted WATCHMAN (7 patients) or AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug (1 patient) LAA closure devices received radiofrequency-based LA ablation (4 via circumferential pulmonary vein isolation [CPVI], 4 via CPVI and additional LA linear lesions or complex fractionated atrial electrograms) after a mean of 201 days (range 41 – 756 days) after LAA closure. ResultsSuccessful LA ablation was achieved without <b>device</b> <b>interference</b> or periprocedural complications. After a mean of 503 days (range 113 – 1006 days), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed in all patients to assess for device-related complications. No device dislocation or leakage was observed. In 1 patient (12. 5 %), a device-related thrombus was found despite therapeutic OAC with dabigatran. Five patients (63 %) remained in stable sinus rhythm, and no bleeding events or stroke occurred during a follow-up of 554 days (range 218 – 1006 days). ConclusionLA ablation after LAA closure appears to be feasible.
