He scraped the barriers as he came out of the corner with 's Michael Albasini on his left, and sprinted his way to victory. When asked about the seemingly close call he had in the aforementioned turn, the Slovak answered: [...] "The finishes in the Tour de Suisse are never straight so you need to invent something to find some space [...] ".|$|E
