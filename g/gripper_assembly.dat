25|$|Industrial robots usually {{consist of}} a jointed arm (multi-linked manipulator) and an end {{effector}} that {{is attached to a}} fixed surface. One of {{the most common type of}} end effector is a <b>gripper</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E
50|$|An RCC {{changes the}} way the peg {{responds}} to a lateral force at its tip. The RCC is typically placed between the robot's wrist and the gripper, though it can be built into the gripper itself. The RCC lets the <b>gripper</b> <b>assembly</b> move in the plane perpendicular to the peg's axis, allowing the peg to rotate about an axis in {{the plane of the}} top of the hole, effectively moving the center of compliance from the gripper to the hole. With the RCC, the forces generated by any misalignment move the peg in a way that corrects the problem, rather than exacerbate it.|$|E
5000|$|Mobile robots {{have the}} {{capability}} to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location. Mobile robots can be [...] "autonomous" [...] (AMR - autonomous mobile robot) which means they are capable of navigating an uncontrolled environment without the need for physical or electro-mechanical guidance devices. Alternatively, mobile robots can rely on guidance devices that allow them to travel a pre-defined navigation route in relatively controlled space (AGV - autonomous guided vehicle). By contrast, industrial robots are usually more-or-less stationary, consisting of a jointed arm (multi-linked manipulator) and <b>gripper</b> <b>assembly</b> (or end effector), attached to a fixed surface.|$|E

This paper presents a system {{for use in a}} subarea of assembly planning, the configuration of <b>grippers</b> for robotic <b>assembly.</b> The system is fully automated and thus represents a departure from current practice.

50|$|Open-type TBMs have no shield, {{leaving the}} area behind the cutter head open for rock support. To advance, the machine uses a gripper system that pushes against the tunnel walls. Not all {{machines}} can be continuously steered while gripper shoes push on the walls, {{as with a}} Wirth machine, which only steers while ungripped. The machine will then push forward off the grippers gaining thrust. At {{the end of a}} stroke, the rear legs of the machine are lowered, the grippers and propel cylinders are retracted. The retraction of the propel cylinders repositions the <b>gripper</b> <b>assembly</b> for the next boring cycle. The grippers are extended, the rear legs lifted, and boring resumes. The open-type, or Main Beam, TBM does not install concrete segments behind with other machines. Instead, the rock is held up using ground support methods such as ring beams, rock bolts, shotcrete, steel straps, ring steel and wire mesh.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the method}} and {{apparatus}} {{of the present}} invention can be utilized to apply either a uniform or a nonuniform covering of material over many different workpieces, the apparatus (20) is advantageously utilized to apply a thermal barrier covering (64) to an airfoil (22) which is used in a turbine engine. The airfoil is held by a <b>gripper</b> <b>assembly</b> (86) while a spray gun (24) is effective to apply the covering over the airfoil. When {{a portion of the}} covering has been applied, a sensor (28) is utilized to detect the thickness of the covering. A control apparatus (32) compares the thickness of the covering of material which has been applied with the desired thickness and is subsequently effective to regulate the operation of the spray gun to adaptively apply a covering of a desired thickness with an accuracy of at least plus or minus 0. 0015 inches (1. 5 mils) despite unanticipated process variations...|$|E
40|$|Robots {{are widely}} used for {{assembly}} operations across manufacturing industries to attain high productivity through automation. An appropriate robotic assembly sequence further minimizes the total production lead time and overall cost by minimizing the number of assembly direction changes, <b>assembly</b> <b>gripper</b> changes and <b>assembly</b> energy thus selection of a valid optimal robotic assembly sequence is significantly essential to achieve economized manufacturing process. An optimal assembly sequence must comply with various assembly requirements {{in order to make}} sure that the sequence of assembly operations is functionally feasible in physical environment. In order to test an assembly sequence for its practical possibility, necessary assembly information must be collected accurately from the product. Obtaining such assembly information from product drawings or Computer Aided Design (CAD) models in manual mode were involved in lots of complexity and needs high level skills to ensure correctness. Though retrieving such information from products with less number of parts is simple and less time consuming, for products composed of huge number parts it is very complicated and time consuming. Besides retrieving the assembly information, using it for validating an assembly sequence further raises the complexity of the Assembly Sequence Generation (ASG) problem. To perform optimal feasible assembly sequence generation efficiently, an effective computer aided automated method is developed and executed at two phases. The first phase of research is mainly focused on representing the assembly information in a streamlined manner by considering all possible states of assembly configurations for ease of computerization and developing efficient methods to extract the assembly information automatically from CAD environment though Computer Aided Automation (CAA). These methods basically use assembly contact analysis, part transformations and laws of equilibrium & balancing of rigid bodies. From the existing ASG methods, it is observed most of the researchers ignored/not-considered few of the assembly information such as assembly stability data and mechanical feasibility data due to higher complexity in retrieving it from CAD environment [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a design for agile manufacturing workcells intended for light mechanical assembly of products made from similar components (i. e. parts families). We define agile manufacturing {{as the ability}} to accomplish rapid changeover from the assembly of one product to the assembly of another product. Rapid hardware changeover is made possible through the use of robots, flexible part feeders, modular <b>grippers</b> and modular <b>assembly</b> hardware. The flexible feeders rely on belt feeding and binary computer vision for pose estimation. This has a distinct advantage over nonflexible feeding schemes such as bowl feeders which require considerable adjustment to changeover from one part to another. Rapid software changeover is being facilitated by the use of a real-time, object-oriented software environment, modular software, graphical simulations for off-line software development, and an innovative dual VMEbus controller architecture. These agile features permit new products to be introduced with minimal downtime and system reconfiguration...|$|R

40|$|Kongsberg Automotive {{produces}} injection molded parts. These {{are removed}} from the mold with a robot gripper. These robot grippers have grown larger as {{the complexity of the}} molds grew. This has increased the amount of collisions between the mold and the gripper. Kongsberg Automotive wants to find out if it is a possibility to use additive manufacturing to produce smaller and better grippers for their production lines. During this thesis work a new design concept for robot grippers was developed. The purpose of this design is to reduce the production halts resulting from contact between the <b>gripper</b> <b>assembly</b> and its surrounding machinery, and to decrease the wear due to high moments of inertia imposing high loads on the assembly substructures. The design of the structural subunits is utilizing topology optimization. (Optistruct and Inspire by Altair) This thesis is written in collaboration with Kongsberg Automotive, Raufoss. It has also developed and manufactured a prototype gripper that fits the injection molding tool and machinery used in production at Kongsberg Automotive, Raufoss. The gripper subassembly was manufactured using additive manufacturing of metal, utilizing powder bed fusion. The prototype is made from the aluminum alloy powder CL 30 AL, delivered by Concept Laser Co. specifically for use in additive manufacturing. The design for the prototype was narrower than the currently used design, while fulfilling the demands to strength and stiffness. This gives the gripper sufficient room on all sides when it is inside the mold. It also has the quick change tool adapter build into the body of the part. It also has internal tubes for pressurized air to the pneumatic actuators. These significantly reduces the use of hoses which can snag on edges in the mold. The Prototype produced showed some flaws and errors. This was a result from among other things internal stresses in the material during the build process. Many of these flaws could have been repaired by welding the cracks and patching the holes epoxy. Because of these errors there has not been enough time to test the prototype...|$|E

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMA) show a high {{ratio of}} work {{capacity}} per material volume. This {{makes the application}} of SMA especially useful in micron-sized systems. The development of robotic grippers is one important prerequisite for the successful automation of the assembly of micro systems. Therefore the SMA may also play a role, for example, as actuators in micron-sized grippers. This paper presents the development of micron-sized grippers. Due to a special relation between the electrical resistance and the shape change of a NiTi-wire the actuator may also be used simultaneously as a sensor. Besides these functional properties a superelastic SMA {{may be used for}} structural purposes, i. e. as solid-state flexure hinges. The sensoric features of binary and ternary NiTi-based alloys are investigated using different Ti 50 Ni 50 -xCux alloys with 0 < x < 25 at-%. Besides the chemical composition the functional properties are affected by the thermo-mechanical treatment (TMT). Different TMT of Ti 50 Ni 50 -xCux alloys and their influence on the functional properties are compared. The effect of the TMT on the amount and the stability of the shape memory effect has {{to be taken into account}} if the optimum alloy and condition for the use in <b>grippers</b> for micro <b>assembly</b> are investigated.
