40|$|This {{script is}} {{compiled}} based {{of the research}} purposed to conclude and com -pare productivity, income, efficiency, and also to conclude which one giving more benefit for farmers between peanut farming “Macan ” variety with peanut farming “Jepara” variety. The basic method of the research is description analytic and the implement-tation to use survey technique. The research is done in Jepara Regency. The taken area of sample be done on purpose (purposive sampling), based harvest wide and highest production data then Batealit District elected as located of the research. Furthermore, because the limited variety usage and farmers using “Macan” variety data, so criteria to choose village for peanut farming “Macan” variety based “BPP” Batealit District recommendation, then Bantrung Village is chosen as the sampling of village for peanut farming “Macan” variety. While the village sample for peanut farming “Jepara” variety is selected based harvest wide and highest pr oduction of peanut “Jepara” variety data in Batealit District, than Mindahan village is selected. The sample farmer had been chosen each 30 people to peanut farming “Macan” variety or peanut farming “Jepara” variety. The election of sample farming is done according simple random (simple random sampling) with table of random number. The data taken were the primary and secondary data by using observation, interview, and registration. Based of the research can know that the peanut farming “Macan” variety used manure is 30. 93 Kg/Ha Urea; 42. 97 Kg/Ha SP 36; and 39. 78 Kg/Ha Phonska, whereas the number of manure used on peanut farming “Jepara” variety is 54. 61 Kg/Ha Urea; 47. 48 Kg/Ha SP - 36; 73. 90 Kg/Ha Phonska; 81. 21 Kg/Ha Za; and 281. 55 Kg/Ha kandang. Based the number can know that the peanut farming “Jepara” variety is higher used the manure than the farming used “Macan” variety, but based the production, can know that the farming used “Jepara” variety {{is lower than the}} farming used “Macan” variety, this <b>is</b> <b>mean</b> <b>t</b> hat the “Jepara” variety not responsive to manure giving. The research result show that the mean of peanut productivity of “Macan” variety (30. 10 Ku/Ha/PS) having higher than the mean of peanut productivity of “Jepara” variety (24. 39 Ku/Ha/PS). Mean of inc ome of the peanut farming “Macan” variety (Rp 1, 482, 404. 97 /Ha/PS) having higher than the mean of income the peanut farming “Jepara” variety (Rp 1, 042, 067. 81 /Ha/PS), so with using “Macan” variety able to increasing the farmers income in Jepara regency. The efficiency of peanut farming “Macan” variety (R/C ratio = 1. 23) having higher than the efficiency of peanut farming “Jepara” variety (R/C ratio = 1. 15) so the peanut farming “Macan” variety is more efficient. The peanut farming “Macan” variety gives more benefit than peanut farming “Jepara” variety, because the revenue more higher, and than the cost of make an effort which have been spend lower. ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} Gd-DTPA on cartilage T 2 mapping using turbo-mixed (tMIX) imaging, and to show the possible usefulness of the tMIX technique for simultaneously acquiring T 1 and T 2 information in cartilage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty volunteers underwent MRI of the knee using the tMIX sequence before and after gadolinium administration. T 1 and T 2 maps <b>were</b> calculated. The <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 <b>was</b> determined on the pre- and postcontrast T 1 maps. T 2 relaxation values before and after gadolinium administration were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The obtained relaxation values are in correspondence with previously published data. The <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 before gadolinium administration was 449 msec +/- 34. 2 msec (SD), and after gadolinium administration it was 357 msec +/- 55. 8 msec (SD). The postcontrast T 1 relaxation range was 221. 5 - 572. 8 msec. The <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 2 of the precontrast T 2 maps was 34. 2 msec +/- 3. 1 msec (SD), and the <b>mean</b> <b>T</b> 2 of the postcontrast T 2 maps was 32. 5 msec +/- 3. 1 msec (SD). These are statistically significant different values. A correction for the postcontrast T 2 values, using a back-calculation algorithm, yielded a 98 % correlation with the precontrast T 2 values. CONCLUSION: The absolute difference of pre- and postcontrast T 2 is very small and is ruled out using the back-calculation algorithm. Combined T 1 -T 2 tMIX cartilage mapping is a valuable alternative for separate T 1 and T 2 cartilage mapping. status: publishe...|$|R

We combined these methods and present previously unreported data on in vivo UBO microstructure in NF 1. Methods: 3 -Tesla dMRI data were acquired on 17 NF 1 patients, covering 30 white matter UBOs. Diffusion tensor, kurtosis and neurite orientation and dispersion density imaging parameters were calculated within UBO sites and in contralateral normal appearing white matter (cNAWM). Analysis of MET 2 parameters {{was performed on}} 24 UBO–cNAWM pairs. Results: No significant alterations in the myelin water fraction and intra- and extracellular (IE) water fraction <b>were</b> found. <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 2 time of IE water was significantly higher in UBOs.

Eggs of one batch were injected with T, whereas the others were injected with the vehicle (sesame oil), to serve as controls. Injections were made on the acute pole {{by means of a}} 250 μl Hamilton syringe mounting a 25 -gauge, 16 mm-long needle, and the hole sealed immediately afterwards. We verified that injections effectively occurred within the yolk in preliminary trials (see Rubolini et al. 2006). T-eggs were injected with 40 ng T (4 -androsten- 17 β-ol- 3 -one; Sigma, Germany) dissolved in 20 μl sterile sesame oil, corresponding to 2 s. d. of the total amount of T estimated for the average yolk of this species.

Therefore, attempt was made in this study to use the SYBR Green I real-time PCR with melting curves analysis as for detection and differentiation of NDV strains in suspected infected birds. Materials and Methods: Two sets of primers were used to amplify matrix and fusion genes in samples collected from suspectly infected birds (chickens and pigeons). Melting curve analysis in conjunction with real time PCR was conducted for identifying different pathotypes of the isolated NDVs. Clinical samples were propagated on specific pathogen free ECE and tested for MDT and ICIP.

The assay offers an attractive alternative method for the diagnosis of NDV that can be easily applied in laboratory diagnosis as a screening test for the detection and differentiation of NDV infections. Conclusion: As was shown by the successful rapid detection and pathotyping of 15 NDV strains in clinical samples representing velogenic and lentogenic NDV strains, and the agreement with the results of virus isolation, biological pathotyping and pathogenicity indices.

Liver cirrhosis was confirmed via histologic analysis in all patients with liver biopsy. <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 rho values did not correlate with necroinflammatory activity (r = 0. 31; P =. 23), degree of steatosis (r = 0. 016; P =. 68), or presence of iron load (r = 0. 22; P =. 43). <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 1 r values performed well by assessing the Child-Pugh stage, with receiver operating characteristic areas of 0. 95 - 0. 98. Intraclass correlation coefficient values ranged between 0. 890 and 0. 987, which indicated excellent imaging and reimaging reproducibility and interobserver and intraobserver variability. Conclusion: Whole-liver T 1 rho MR imaging at 1. 5 T to detect and assess human liver cirrhosis is feasible. Further investigation and optimization of this technique are warranted to cover the entire spectrum of fibrotic liver disease...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The histopathological {{basis of}} “unidentified bright objects” (UBOs) (hyperintense regions seen on T 2 -weighted {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) brain scans in neurofibromatosis- 1 (NF 1)) remains unclear. New in vivo MRI-based techniques (multi-exponential T 2 relaxation (MET 2) and diffusion MR imaging (dMRI)) provide measures relating to microstructural change. We combined these methods and present previously unreported data on in vivo UBO microstructure in NF 1. Methods 3 -Tesla dMRI data were acquired on 17 NF 1 patients, covering 30 white matter UBOs. Diffusion tensor, kurtosis and neurite orientation and dispersion density imaging parameters were calculated within UBO sites and in contralateral normal appearing white matter (cNAWM). Analysis of MET 2 parameters {{was performed on}} 24 UBO–cNAWM pairs. Results No significant alterations in the myelin water fraction and intra- and extracellular (IE) water fraction <b>were</b> found. <b>Mean</b> <b>T</b> 2 time of IE water was significantly higher in UBOs. UBOs furthermore showed increased axial, radial and mean diffusivity, and decreased fractional anisotropy, mean kurtosis and neurite density index compared to cNAWM. Neurite orientation dispersion and isotropic fluid fraction were unaltered. Conclusion Our results suggest that demyelination and axonal degeneration {{are unlikely to be}} present in UBOs, which appear to be mainly caused by a shift towards a higher T 2 -value of the intra- and extracellular water pool. This may arise from altered microstructural compartmentalization, and an increase in ‘extracellular-like’, intracellular water, possibly due to intramyelinic edema. These findings confirm the added value of combining dMRI and MET 2 to characterize the microstructural basis of T 2 hyperintensities in vivo.

Commonly, the issue of SMEs in general {{is the problem of}} capital. To overcome this issue, there is a model named financial inclusion to encourage the financial system to be accessible by society. Financial inclusion <b>is</b> a <b>means</b> <b>t</b> promote financial sector specially for easy banking service and financial access for people. The purpose of this study to determine the role of financial inclusion to the development of capital SMEs through service, accessibility and monitoring to members of PLUT-KUMKM DIY. This research is quantitative research. The population of this study were members of PLUT-KUMKM DIY and sample in this study were taken using the purposive sampling method. Data collection methods use in this study was a questionnaire, documentation and interviews. Methods of data analysis in this research is test instrument, classic assumption test and test hypotheses using spss 19. 00.

40|$|Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB 1) is a tissue-restricted genome {{organizer}} {{that provides}} a key link between DNA loop organization, chromatin modification/remodeling, and transcription factor association at matrix attachment regions (MARs). The SUMO E 3 ligase PIAS 1 enhances SUMO conjugation to SATB 1 lysine- 744, and this modification regulates caspase- 6 mediated cleavage of SATB 1 at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs). Since this regulated caspase cleavage occurs on only a subset of SATB 1, and the products are relatively stable, proteolysis likely mediates cellular processes other than programmed cell death. However, the mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of SATB 1 sumoylation and caspase cleavage is not known. Here we report that these processes are controlled by SATB 1 phosphorylation; specif-ically, PIAS 1 interaction with SATB 1 is inhibited by phosphorylation. Mutagenesis studies identified interac-tion of the PIAS SAP (scaffold attachment factor-A/B/acinus/PIAS) motif with SATB 1 N-terminal sequences. Notably, phosphorylation of SATB 1 at threonine- 188 regulates its interaction with PIAS 1. Sequences near this phosphorylation site, LXXLL (residues 193 to 197), appear to be conserved among a subset of SUMO substrate proteins. Thus, this motif may be commonly involved in interaction with the PIAS SAP, and phosphorylation may similarly inhibit some of these substrates by preventing their interaction with the ligase.
