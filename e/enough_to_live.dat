5|$|An {{accomplished}} woman, Finch gained {{her appointment}} as royal governess in August 1762 upon {{the birth of}} George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte.

Finch oversaw the princes' education until they became old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in their own households under the watch of governors, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. Finch retired from her role in 1793, though she continued to correspond {{with members of the}} royal family and receive gifts from them.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{once was}} {{credited}} with creating 300 new vicarages within the diocese, largely {{on the basis of}} his surviving documents dealing with this, known as the Liber Antiquus. Further research has shown that a number of the vicarages he was once assumed to have founded were instead earlier foundations that Hugh either augmented or reassessed. Hugh also worked to improve the educational level of this clergy, even refusing to allow some candidates to benefices to be installed because of their lack of education. The bishop also worked to improve the conditions of the poorer clergy in his diocese, attempting to ensure that all the clergy in his diocese had <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on. Previously, it was thought that Hugh had sent out a set of articles of inquiry to his diocesan clergy, but these articles are now shown to have been produced by Hugh's successor, Robert Grosseteste.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis worsens {{with the}} {{severity}} of injury. Most TBIs are mild and do not cause permanent or long-term disability; however, all severity levels of TBI {{have the potential to}} cause significant, long-lasting disability. Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10% of mild injuries, 66% of moderate injuries, and 100% of severe injuries. Most mild TBI is completely resolved within threeweeks, and almost all people with mild TBI are able to live independently and return to the jobs they had before the injury, although a portion have mild cognitive and social impairments. Over 90% of people with moderate TBI are able to live independently, although a portion require assistance in areas such as physical abilities, employment, and financial managing. Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> independently; middle ground is less common. Coma, as it is closely related to severity, is a strong predictor of poor outcome.|$|E

25|$|In 1650 Dryden {{went up to}} Trinity College, Cambridge. Here {{he would}} have {{experienced}} {{a return to the}} religious and political ethos of his childhood: the Master of Trinity was a Puritan preacher by the name of Thomas Hill who had been a rector in Dryden's home village. Though there is little specific information on Dryden's undergraduate years, he would most certainly have followed the standard curriculum of classics, rhetoric, and mathematics. In 1654 he obtained his BA, graduating top of the list for Trinity that year. In June of the same year Dryden's father died, leaving him some land which generated a little income, but not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on.|$|E

Along with his £70 scholarship from St John's College, this was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> at Cambridge. There, Dirac pursued his interests {{in the theory of}} general relativity, an interest he had gained earlier as a student in Bristol, and in the nascent field of quantum physics, under the supervision of Ralph Fowler. From 1925 to 1928 he held an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He completed his PhD in June 1926 with the first thesis on quantum mechanics to be submitted anywhere. He then continued his research in Copenhagen and Göttingen.|$|E
25|$|While the Liberal {{reforms were}} one of Britain's most ambitious welfare reform programmes, there were several {{limitations}} to the reforms they passed. Free school meals were not compulsory. Pensions were refused {{to those who had}} not been in work most of their life and life expectancy at birth at this time was only 55 so relatively few people lived long enough to receive a pension. The labour exchange programme often managed to find people only part-time casual work. The poor had to pay National Insurance Contributions out of their wages and the 7s 6d was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on. Unemployment and sickness pay also only lasted for a limited time. Free medical care was available to only a wage-earner, not the wife or children or grandparents and other relatives. The new National Health Insurance scheme also did not provide coverage for all forms of medical care. It did not provide cover for special advice while many people could not get acquire dental, ophthalmic or other treatment through NHI. Also, other people were not covered for convalescent homes, while the only specialist services for those in NHI were for TB and VD. The welfare measures introduced by the Liberal government concerning the sick, the elderly, and the children did, however, lead to a reduction in poverty, with the total number of paupers falling from 916,377 in 1910 to 748,019 by 1914.|$|E

500|$|Lady Charlotte Finch's {{career as}} royal governess began in August 1762, {{when she was}} {{appointed}} {{a day after the}} birth of George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son and heir of King George III and Queen Charlotte. Walpole called the decision [...] "a choice so universally approved that I do not think she will be abused even in the North Briton". Finch's biographer, Jill Shefrin, writes that the governess was noted for the skill she devoted to the raising of her own children, while Christopher Hibbert suggests that her educated background made her [...] "well-suited" [...] to the position. Lady Charlotte held the role of royal governess for over 30 years, and oversaw 14 of the king and queen's 15 children. She presided over the royal nursery, overseeing the staff members designated for each child; the staff included sub-governesses, teachers, personal attendants, and assistant governesses.

500|$|Denning, {{along with}} his older brother Gordon, began his {{schooling}} at the National School of Whitchurch, one of many {{set up by the}} National Society for the Education of the Poor. Both boys won scholarships to Andover Grammar School, where Denning excelled academically, winning four prizes for English essays on the subjects of [...] "The Great Authors", [...] "Macaulay", [...] "Carlyle" [...] and [...] "Milton". The outbreak of the First World War saw most of the schoolmasters leave to join the British armed forces, being replaced by female teachers. At the time Denning wanted to become a mathematician, but none of the new teachers knew enough mathematics to teach him; instead, he taught himself. He qualified to study at University College, Southampton, but was advised to stay at school and apply to Oxford or Cambridge in a few years. He sat the Oxbridge examination when he was sixteen and was awarded a £30 a year exhibition to study mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford; the money was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on, but he accepted nevertheless. Although he had been accepted by a college he still needed to gain entry to the university as a whole, which meant passing exams including Greek– which had not been taught at Andover Grammar School. Denning managed to teach himself enough of the subject to pass, and matriculated to Oxford in 1916.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{publications}} {{declared the}} gameplay was {{an improvement over}} the original. John Davison of GamePro wrote [...] "BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward, and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci-fi epic." [...] VanOrd praised Mass Effect 2 for possessing an identity, which was something that its predecessor lacked. He noted that the shooting is [...] "more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter". Similarly, GameSpys Gerald Villoria observed that, while the original Mass Effect [...] "walked the line between RPG and shooter [...] Mass Effect 2 has become a much more focused shooter experience". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com credited the combat for being more balanced, stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it. Despite the praise, some publications like GameCritics and RPGamer expressed concerns about the game's simplified RPG elements, calling it [...] "stripped-down" [...] and with a [...] "dumbed-down feeling". Some reviewers also criticized the slow planet scanning. Game Revolution {{felt it was a}} [...] "chore, mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge", but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole [...] "does more than <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to its predecessor".
