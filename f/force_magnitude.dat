40|$|We compute {{displacement}} {{and stress}} {{due to a}} normal fault by means of two-dimensional plane-strain finite-element analysis. To do so, we apply a system of forces to the fault nodes and develop an iterative algorithm serving to determine the <b>force</b> <b>magnitudes</b> for any slip distribution. As a sample case, we compute the <b>force</b> <b>magnitudes</b> assuming uniform slip on a 10 -km two-dimensional normal fault. The numerical model generates displacement and stress fields that compare well to the analytical solution. In fact, we find little difference in displacements (< 5 %), displacement orientation (< 15 DEG), and stress components (< 35 %, half of which due to slip tolerance). We analyze such misfit, and discuss how the error propagates from displacement to stress.

This paper reports a study on the perception of haptic <b>force</b> <b>magnitude</b> during hand movements.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{we found the}} perception of <b>force</b> <b>magnitude</b> to be anisotropic in the horizontal plane. In the current study, we investigated this anisotropy in three dimensional space. In addition, we tested our previous hypothesis that the perceptual anisotropy was directly related to anisotropies in arm dynamics. In experiment 1, static <b>force</b> <b>magnitude</b> perception was studied using a free magnitude estimation paradigm. This experiment revealed a significant and consistent anisotropy in <b>force</b> <b>magnitude</b> perception, with forces exerted perpendicular to the line between hand and shoulder being perceived as 50 % larger than forces exerted along this line. In experiment 2, postural arm dynamics were measured using stochastic position perturbations exerted by a haptic device and quantified through system identification. By fitting a mass-damper-spring model to the data, the stiffness, damping and inertia parameters could be characterized in all the directions in which perception was also measured. These results show {{that none of the}} arm dynamics parameters were oriented either exactly perpendicular or parallel to the perceptual anisotropy. This means that endpoint stiffness, damping or inertia alone cannot explain the consistent anisotropy in <b>force</b> <b>magnitude</b> perception.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to enable a robot to {{actively}} collaborate with a person to move an object in an efficient, smooth and robust manner. For a robot to actively assist a person it is key that the robot recognizes the actions or phases of a collaborative tasks. This requires the robot {{to have the ability}} to estimate a personâs movement intent. A hurdle in collaboratively moving an object is determining whether the partner is trying to rotate or translate the object (the rotation versus translation problem). In this thesis, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are used to recognize human intent of rotation or translation in real-time. Based on this recognition, an appropriate impedance control mode is selected to assist the person. The approach is tested on a seven degree-of-freedom industrial robot, KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R 820, working with a human partner during manipulation tasks. Results show the HMMs can estimate human intent with accuracy of 87. 5 % by using only haptic data recorded from the robot. Integrated with impedance control, the robot is able to collaborate smoothly and efficiently with a person during the manipulation tasks. The HMMs are compared with a switching function based approach that uses interaction <b>force</b> <b>magnitudes</b> to recognize rotation versus translation. The results show that HMMs can predict correctly when fast rotation or slow translation is desired, whereas the switching function based on <b>force</b> <b>magnitudes</b> performs poorly...|$|R
