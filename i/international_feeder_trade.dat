40|$|Comparative {{advantage}} motivates large <b>trade</b> {{flows in}} <b>feeder</b> animals throughout the world. Trade creates externalities when animal diseases can spread beyond the purchasing farm. When growers can choose between open and closed production systems, Nash equilibrium will likely involve socially excessive trading. Supply {{response to an}} increase in marginal costs may be positive. While first-best involves marketwide adoption of either an open-trade or closed-farm system, equilibrium may entail heterogeneous systems. If this is the case, then the <b>feeder</b> <b>trade</b> should be banned. Within a farm, we show how risk of infectious disease can create decreasing returns to scale when the technology is otherwise increasing in returns to scale. Control of disease risk through bilateral contracts or damage-control technologies will increase scale of production in fattening, while better sorting in feeder animal markets will have ambiguous effects on scale. <b>feeder</b> <b>trade,</b> industrialization, information, Nash equilibrium, vertical integration, welfare, food safety. ...|$|R

In 1992, the airline obtained five British Aerospace BAe 146-200 69-passenger regional jets from Discovery Airways and placed an order for twenty new Avro RJ-70s {{in the same year}} which then began {{to be added to the}} fleet in 1993.

40|$|Country of Origin Labelling (COOL) {{regulation}} {{has been}} applied in the United States meat sector since October 2008. The industry must label beef, lamb and pork (ground meat and muscle cuts) sold through retail outlets according to its country of origin. The labelling requirements create differentiation at the retail level and may impose additional costs on producers, processors and retailers in the U. S. and elsewhere. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate whether there has been structural change in U. S. import demand for Canadian hog/pork products. Given that COOL {{has been in place}} for a limited period of time, we implement statistical procedures that are robust to structural change occurring {{at the end of the}} sample. We find evidence that COOL has impacted U. S. /Canada slaughter hog trade flows. While Canadian feeder hog prices appear to have declined concurrently with the introduction of COOL, statistical hypothesis testing found little evidence of structural change for <b>feeder</b> hog <b>trade</b> flows that could be associated with COOL.

A bivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model is applied to estimate the conditional volatility structure, with a possible structural break due to the switch to cash settlement. The results show that the volatility of the futures prices (but not the cash prices) declined after physical delivery was replaced by cash settlement. In terms of futures hedging, cash settlement led to smaller and more stable hedge ratios. The variance of the hedged portfolio also decreased substantially.

40|$|The {{supply of}} corn milling co-products from ethanol {{production}} has increased rapidly {{over the last}} several years. Based on United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projections of corn ground for ethanol production, approximately 38 million tons of distillers grains would have been produced in the 2009 - 10 marketing year, with 40 million tons projected for the 2010 - 11 marketing year. While supply has grown, so too has demand from both domestic and <b>international</b> users. Cattle <b>feeders</b> in particular have found wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS), modified wet distillers grains plus solubles (MWDGS) and dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS) to be excellent feedstuffs that can lower cost of gain through performance efficiencies and lower ingredient costs. United States swine and poultry producers have also increasingly adopted DDGS in rations in response to higher corn prices, while international shipments of DDGS have also grown...|$|R

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceDeposit <b>feeders</b> {{are able}} to process a {{considerable}} volume of sediment, containing large 9 quantities of associated bacteria. However, conclusions concerning the trophic role played by 10 benthic bacteria in marine sediments are still not fully elucidated. This study deals with 11 bacterivory by the gastropod Hydrobia ulvae, {{one of the most}} abundant deposit-feeding 12 species in intertidal mudflats in Western Europe. Ingestion rates of bacteria were determined 13 during grazing experiments using 15 N pre-enriched bacteria. Grazing experiments were 14 performed in order to measure effects of abiotic (temperature, salinity and luminosity) and 15 biotic (bacterial and algal abundances) factors on ingestion rates of bacteria by H. ulvae of an 16 intertidal mudflat (Brouage, Marennes-Oléron, France). The mean ingestion rate of bacteria 17 by H. ulvae was 1149 ngC ind- 1 h- 1. The general trend showed a temperature effect with an 18 optimum around 30 °C, and the assimilation rate was significantly lower at 5 °C. Bacterial 19 assimilation did not significantly differ between salinity 18 and salinity 31. Ingestion was the 20 same in light and in dark conditions. Results were compared with those of other grazing 21 experiments conducted simultaneously in similar conditions with two other grazers with 22 different size and feeding modes: the foraminifera Ammonia tepida and a nematode 23 community from the superficial sediment of the Brouage mudflat. Hydrobia ulvae and 24 nematodes presented a feeding behavior less influenced by environmental changes than A. tepida. Hydrobia ulvae ingested bacteria at a higher rate than smaller meiofaunal grazers and seemed to have a lower ability to selectively ingest diatoms than meiofaunal grazers...|$|R
