2500|$|The {{sport of}} polo came to California in 1876, when the California Polo Club was {{established}} {{with help of}} Bay Area native, Captain Nell Mowry. By the late 1800s, polo in San Francisco was dominated by the Golden <b>Gate</b> <b>Driving</b> Club and the San Francisco Driving Club. In 1906, the Golden Gate Park Stadium was built by private subscription from the driving clubs which contained both a polo field and a cycling velodrome. Later on, the stadium was renamed simply the Polo Field. In the mid 1930s, the City and County of San Francisco used PWA and WPA funds to renovate the polo field. In 1939, additional WPA funds were used to build polo sheds, replacing already-standing horse stables. Polo continued being played through the 1940s but by the 1950s polo stopped being played on the Polo Field because the sport had largely migrated to other bay area cities where land more suitable for polo was available. In 1985 and 1986, polo was {{brought back to the}} Polo Field in Golden Gate Park for the second and third annual San Francisco Grand Prix and Equestrian Festival. Today, polo is not regularly played on the Polo Field, but from 2006 to 2010 Polo in the Park was hosted annually.|$|E

In this it is related that certain peasants entered Rome by the Viridarian <b>Gate,</b> <b>driving</b> two mares laden with timber; that, in crossing the Square of St. Peter's, some servants of the Pope's ran out and cut the cords so that the timber was loosened and the beasts relieved of their burden; they were then led to a courtyard within the precincts of the palace, where four stallions were loosed upon them. [...] "Ascenderunt equas et coierunt cum eis et eas graviter pistarunt et leserunt," [...] whilst the Pope at a window above {{the doorway of the}} Palace, with Madonna Lucrezia, witnessed with great laughter and delight, the show which it is suggested was specially provided for their amusement.|$|E

The time-domain analysis of CMOS <b>gates</b> <b>driving</b> next-generation interconnects consisting of single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) bundles or multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is carried out. Accurate simulation models of SWCNT bundles and MWCNTs are proposed in the frequency domain by using both the multiconductor transmission line (MTL) formulation and the multiequivalent single conductor (MESC) approach. The fast transient voltage responses of two coupled nanointerconnects of 14 and 22 nm technologies to a pulsed input are computed by means of both the MTL and the MESC models.

Analytical expressions characterizing the out-put voltage and propagation delay are also presented for different signal activity conditions. The propagation delay based on these analytical expressions is within 3 % as compared to SPICE, while the estimated delay neglecting the difference between the load ca-pacitances can exceed 45 %.

The accuracy of our gate delay model is evaluated in several gates under various conditions of input transition time and CRC parameters. The maximum error is less than 10. 3 % in the experiments. Our approach will contribute to fast and accurate estimation of circuit speed under various supply voltage, which {{will enable us to}} optimize the circuit speed and power dissipation. 1 Introduction Accurate estimation of critical path delay is essential for the design of high performance VLSI chips.

However, a different input that attempts to set the signal to 0 will show a large increase in quiescent current, signalling a bad part. Typical Iddq tests may use 20 or so inputs. Note that Iddq test inputs require only controllability, and not observability. This is because the observability is through the shared power supply connection.|$|E

These devices are used because of their good performance, but require a gate drive voltage a few volts above the power rail. When the centre of a half bridge goes low the capacitor is charged via a diode, and this charge is used to later drive {{the gate of the}} high side FET gate a few volts above the source or emitter pin's voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both high and low switches.|$|E

Accurate time delay models are developed by studying the nature of the response of simplified circuit models to variations of input waveform rise and fall times and output loading. The nonlinear effects of the CMOS logic devices are minimized to permit easier interpretation of the influence of nonlinear capacitive loads. The performance of a CMOS inverter with a complex nonlinear load consisting of a pass transistor that separates a range of capacitances is compared to the same inverter circuit with a linear capacitive load to develop an understanding of the unique requirements of modeling a nonlinear system. Several methods of modeling the delay of CMOS circuits are reviewed, and a multi-parameter linear model is described. General guidelines for designing CMOS circuits with complex load circuits are developed, emphasizing that the circuit output rise delays and fall delays must be separately analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Active <b>gate</b> <b>driving</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to beneficially shape switching waveforms in Si-and SiC-based power converters. For faster GaN power devices with sub- 10 -ns switching transients, however, reported variable <b>gate</b> <b>driving</b> {{has so far been}} limited to altering a single drive parameter once per switching event, either during or outside of the transient. This paper demonstrates a gate driver with a timing resolution and range of output resistance levels that surpass those of existing gate drivers or arbitrary waveform generators. It is shown to permit active <b>gate</b> <b>driving</b> with a bandwidth that is high enough to shape a GaN switching during the transient. The programmable gate driver has integrated high-speed memory, control logic, and multiple parallel output stages. During switching transients, the gate driver can activate a near-arbitrary sequence of pull-up or pull-down output resistances between 0. 12 and 64 A hybrid of clocked and asynchronous control logic with 150 -ps delay elements achieves an effective resistance update rate of 6. 7 GHz during switching events. This active gate driver is evaluated in a 1 -MHz bridge-leg converter using EPC 2015 GaN FETs. The results show that aggressive manipulation of the gate-drive resistance at sub-nanosecond resolutions can profile gate waveforms of the GaN FET, thereby beneficially shaping the switch-node voltage waveform in the power circuit.

The device features oxide–nitride–oxide (ONO) stack as the charge storage medium {{in one of}} the two gated sides with pure oxide in the other. Owing to the IDG feature, the shift in the device’s transfer characteristics due to a change in the amount of storage charges can be sensed with two different modes, which have one of the two gates applied with a sweeping bias (<b>driving</b> <b>gate)</b> and the other with a fixed bias (control gate). Our analysis and experimental data show that a larger memory window is obtained when the gate of the ONO side is used as the <b>driving</b> <b>gate.</b> Moreover, the memory window of this mode is essentially independent of the bias applied to the control gate.
