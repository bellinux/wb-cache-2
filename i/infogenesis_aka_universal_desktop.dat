40|$|Abstract. Advances {{in digital}} design and {{fabrication}} technologies are leading toward single fabrication systems {{capable of producing}} almost any complete functional object. We are proposing a new paradigm for manufacturing, which we call <b>Universal</b> <b>Desktop</b> Fabrication (UDF), and a framework for its development. UDF will be a coherent system of volumetric digital design software able to handle infinite complexity at any spatial resolution and compact, automated, multi-material digital fabrication hardware. This system aims to be inexpensive, simple, safe and intuitive to operate, open to user modification and experimentation, and capable of rapidly manufacturing almost any arbitrary, complete, high-quality, functional object. Through the broad accessibility and generality of digital technology, UDF will enable vastly more individuals to become innovators of technology, and will catalyze a shift from specialized mass production and global transportation of products to personal customization and point-of-use manufacturing. Likewise, the inherent accuracy and speed of digital computation will allow processes that significantly surpass the practical complexity of the current design and manufacturing systems. This transformation of manufacturing will allow for entirely new classes of human-made, peerproduced, micro-engineered objects, resulting in more dynamic and natural interactions with the world. We describe and illustrate our current results in UDF hardware and software, and describe future development directions. ...|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} {{is concerned with}} studying and recreating human intelligence. Humans distinguish themselves from other animals and primates through their use of a rich and expressive communication system: natural language. The enterprise of studying human intelligence can not be complete without studying human natural language. When one is confronted with the efforts of linguists over the last decades to capture our knowledge of language, {{it becomes clear that}} this is not as easy as it may have seemed. Linguists have been searching for a set of rules that determine whether a sentence is grammatical or not. As yet no such set has been found that is capable of describing even one human natural language. Some linguists claim that the fact that such a ruleset has not been found by intelligent researches proves that children are born with a 'language module' (<b>aka</b> <b>universal</b> grammar). Luc Steels' Artificial Intelligence Lab in Brussel has been trying to use computer models to investigate what aspects of language can be explained without assuming that they have to be innate. They try to show that language is a self-organizing complex dynamic system that emerges from human cultural interactions. The human brain must possess some mechanisms that other animals do not, but these {{does not have to be}} specific for language. Using populations of interacting agents, it has already been shown that some aspects that were assumed to be innate can be explained by cultural transmission (eg vowel systems (Bart de Boer) and colorcategories (Tony Belpaeme)). My research focussed on the cultural transmission of action categories. The experiments have been performed on a robotic arm that uses four degrees of freedom and a stereoscopic camera. Using the arm and camera as embodiment, agents engage in games where they try to imitate the action they saw the other agent perform. The only feedback between agents during the experiment is given by the initiator of the game as one bit of information on whether he judges the game's outcome as successful. In my experiment actions are not coupled to meaning, so it is not a model of the cultural learning of real gestures. But it turns out that a population using a scheme as simple as described is able to develop a shared repertoire of action categories in a very robust manner. ...|$|R

40|$|Feature {{selection}} {{is the task}} of choosing a small subset of features that is sufficient to predict the target labels well. Here, {{instead of trying to}} directly determine which features are better, we attempt to learn the properties of good features. For this purpose we assume that each feature is represented by a set of properties, referred to as meta-features. This approach enables prediction of the quality of features without measuring their value on the training instances. We use this ability to devise new selection algorithms that can efficiently search for new good features {{in the presence of a}} huge number of features, and to dramatically reduce the number of feature measurements needed. We demonstrate our algorithms on a handwritten digit recognition problem and a visual object category recognition problem. In addition, we show how this novel viewpoint enables derivation of better generalization bounds for the joint learning problem of selection and classification, and how it contributes to a better understanding of the problem. Specifically, in the context of object recognition, previous works showed that it is possible to find one set of features which fits most object categories (<b>aka</b> a <b>universal</b> dictionary). Here we use our framework to analyze one such universal dictionary and find that the quality of features in this dictionary can be predicted accurately by its meta-features...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the authentication and key agreement (<b>AKA)</b> protocol for <b>universal</b> mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) mobile networks, where a new protocol is proposed. In our proposed protocol, the mobile station {{is responsible for}} generating of authentication token (AUTN) and random number (RAND). The home location register is responsible for comparison of response and expected response to take a decision. Therefore, the bottleneck at authentication center is avoided by {{reducing the number of}} messages between mobile and authentication center. The authentication time delay, call setup time, and signalling traffic are minimized in the proposed protocol. A fluid mobility model is used to investigate the performance of signalling traffic and load transaction messages between mobile database, such as home location register (HLR) and visitor location register (VLR) for both the current protocol and the proposed protocol. The simulation results show that the authentication delay and current load transaction messages between entities and bandwidth are minimized as compared to current protocol. Therefore, the performance and the authentication delay time have been improved significantly.|$|R

The first principal was Charles Gore; Vincent Stuckey Coles was principal from 1897 to 1909. The next principal was Darwell Stone. Pusey House celebrated its 125th anniversary of foundation on 31 October 2009, with a Solemn High Mass at which the preacher was Fr Robin Ward, Principal of St Stephen's House.

40|$|It is now commonplace to {{say that}} {{information}} and communications technologies are rapidly transforming the world of research. We {{are only beginning to}} recognize, however, that management of the scientific enterprise must adapt if we, as a society, are {{to take full advantage of}} the knowledge and understanding generated by researchers. One of the most important areas of information and communication technology (ICT) -driven change is the emergence of escience, briefly described as <b>universal</b> <b>desktop</b> access, via the Internet, to distributed resources, global collaboration, and the intellectual, analytical, and investigative output of the world’s scientific community. The vision of e-science is being realised in relation to the outputs of science, particularly journal articles and other forms of scholarly publication. This realisation extends less to research data, the raw material at the heart of the scientific process and the object of significant annual public investments. Ensuring research data are easily accessible, so that they can be used as often and as widely as possible, is a matter of sound stewardship of public resources. Moreover, as research becomes increasingly global, there is a growing need to systematically address data access and sharing issues beyond national jurisdictions. The goals of this report and its recommendations are to ensure that both researchers and the public receive optimum returns on the public investments in research, and to build on the value chain of investments in research and research data. To some extent, research data are shared today, often quite extensively within established networks, using both the latest technology and innovative management techniques. The Follow Up Group drew on the experiences of several of these networks to examine the roles and responsibilities of governments as they relate to data produced from publicly funded research. The objective was to seek good practices that can be used by national governments, international bodies, and scientists in other areas of research. In doing so, the Group developed an analytical framework for determining where further improvements can be made in the national and international organization, management, and regulation of research data. The findings and recommendations presented here are based on the central principle that publicly funded research data should be openly available to the maximum extent possible. Availability should be subject only to national security restrictions; protection of confidentiality and privacy; intellectual property rights; and time-limited exclusive use by principal investigators. Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest. As such they should remain in the public realm. This does not preclude the subsequent commercialization of research results in patents and copyrights, or of the data themselves in databases, but it does mean that a copy of the data must be maintained and made openly accessible. Implicitly or explicitly, this principle is recognized by many of the world’s leading scientific institutions, organizations, and agencies. Expanding the adoption of this principle to national and international stages will enable researchers, empower citizens and convey tremendous scientific, economic, and social benefits. Evidence from the case studies and from other investigation undertaken for this report suggest that successful research data access and sharing arrangements, or regimes, share a number of key attributes and operating principles. These bring effective organization and management to the distribution and exchange of data. The key attributes include: openness; transparency of access and active dissemination; the assignment and assumption of formal responsibilities; interoperability; quality control; operational efficiency and flexibility; respect for private intellectual property and other ethical and legal matters; accountability; and professionalism. Whether they are discipline-specific or issue oriented, national or international, the regimes that adhere to these operating principles reap the greatest returns from the use of research data. There are five broad groups of issues that stand out in any examination of research data access and sharing regimes. The Follow Up Group used these as an analytical framework for examining the case studies that informed this report, and in doing so, came to several broad conclusions: • Technological issues: Broad access to research data, and their optimum exploitation, requires appropriately designed technological infrastructure, broad international agreement on interoperability, and effective data quality controls; • Institutional and managerial issues: While the core open access principle applies to all science communities, the diversity of the scientific enterprise suggests that a variety of institutional models and tailored data management approaches are most effective in meeting the needs of researchers; • Financial and budgetary issues: Scientific data infrastructure requires continued, and dedicated, budgetary planning and appropriate financial support. The use of research data cannot be maximized if access, management, and preservation costs are an add-on or after-thought in research projects; • Legal and policy issues: National laws and international agreements directly affect data access and sharing practices, despite the fact that they are often adopted without due consideration of the impact on the sharing of publicly funded research data; • Cultural and behavioural issues: Appropriate reward structures are a necessary component for promoting data access and sharing practices. These apply to both those who produce and those who manage research data. The case studies and other research conducted for this report suggest that concrete, beneficial actions can be taken by the different actors involved in making possible access to, and sharing of, publicly funded research data. This includes the OECD as an international organization with credibility and stature in the science policy area. The Follow Up Group recommends that the OECD consider the following: • Put the issues of data access and sharing on the agenda of the next Ministerial meeting; • In conjunction with relevant member country research organizations, o Conduct or coordinate a study to survey national laws and policies that affect data access and sharing practices; o Conduct or coordinate a study to compile model licensing agreements and templates for access to and sharing of publicly funded data; • With the rapid advances in scientific communications made possible by recent developments in ICTs, there are many aspects of research data access and sharing that have not been addressed sufficiently by this report, would benefit from further study, and will need further clarification. Accordingly, further possible actions areas include: o Governments from OECD expand their policy frameworks of research data access and sharing to include data produced from a mixture of public and private funds; o OECD consider examinations of research data access and sharing to include issues of interacting with developing countries; and o OECD promote further research, including a comprehensive economic analysis of existing data access regimes, at both the national and research project or program levels. National governments have a crucial role to play in promoting and supporting data accessibility since they provide the necessary resources, establish overall polices for data management, regulate matters such as the protection of confidentiality and privacy, and determine restrictions based on national security. Most importantly, national governments are responsible for major research support and funding organizations, and it is here that many of the managerial aspects of data sharing need to be addressed. Drawing on good practices worldwide, the Follow Up Group suggests that national governments should consider the following: • Adopt and effectively implement the principle that data produced from publicly funded research should be openly vailable to the maximum extent possible; • Encourage their research funding agencies and major data producing departments to work together to find ways to enhance access to statistical data, such as census materials and surveys; • Adopt free access or marginal cost pricing policies for the dissemination of researchuseful data produced by government departments and agencies; • Analyze, assess, and monitor policies, programs, and management practices related to data access and sharing polices within their national research and research funding organizations. The widespread national, international and cross-disciplinary sharing of research data is no longer a technological impossibility. Technology itself, however, will not fulfill the promise of escience. Information and communication technologies provide the physical infrastructure. It is up to national governments, international agencies, research institutions, and scientists themselves to ensure that the institutional, financial and economic, legal, and cultural and behavioural aspects of data sharing are taken into account. 42 page...|$|R
