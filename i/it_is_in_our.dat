5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

I am fiscally conservative: I {{think we need}} to reduce the deficit and get entitlement spending under control. I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies. And I am very much in favor of America acting as a world leader: I believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets as we have been doing {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foreign Policy In January 2010, Carnahan {{partnered with}} Republican Congressman Joseph Cao of Louisiana {{to create the}} American Engagement Caucus, its stated purpose being the {{promotion}} of a multilateral foreign policy in which the United States works closely with other countries to address global problems. As a joint editorial between the two congressmen stated, [...] "We live {{in an age of}} interdependence. America's security, economic, environmental, and moral interests are inextricably linked with those of the international community. Simply put, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> vital national interest to support international engagement.". He has since introduced multiple other bills related to science diplomacy.|$|E

And, although the Church has always recognized this supreme generosity and the perfect harmony of graces and has daily studied them more and more throughout the course of the centuries, still <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own age that the privilege of the bodily Assumption into heaven of Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, has certainly shone forth more clearly".|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, Murphy {{published}} a column deploring the ongoing agitation against college football. He responded to charges {{that it was}} a brutal sport as follows: [...] "I am not disposed to deny that football is a rough game. But when cleanly played as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> big colleges, and when properly safeguarded the element of danger is almost entirely eliminated." [...] In response to proposals to replace football in American universities with either soccer or Canadian rugby, Murphy expressed disdain: [...] "Both of these are jokes when compared to the American game. They lack the science of our football and certainly would not prove very interesting to the spectators." [...] Murphy spoke in favor of removing restrictions on the forward pass, which he viewed as a spectacular play and one that weakens the defense. His main suggestions for eliminating injuries were to abolish the diving tackle, develop better padding, and eliminate the kickoff. With respect to the kickoff, Murphy noted: [...] "I have always felt that it was in the crash of the two teams that most accidents occurred." ...|$|E

[...] Turner sided with the NYPD's intelligence gathering of Arab-Americans, and supported more funding for defense. Upon being chosen to serve on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he stated, [...] "I intend to forward my beliefs that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> national interest to defend our Middle East ally, Israel, and I will oppose further attempts by the U.N. to recognize a Palestinian state." [...] He co-sponsored H.R. Bill 556, which condemned Iran for human rights abuses, and urged Pres. Obama to challenge Iran for its nuclear armament policies Turner pushed for strict economic sanctions on the Iranian Central Bank, and criticized Sen. Harry Reid for stalling H.R. 1905, which would have allowed the U.S. to restrict Iran's trade internationally and bar U.S.-Iran diplomacy.|$|E
2500|$|Nouri al-Maliki was at loggerheads {{with the}} leader of ethnic Kurds, who brandished the threat of secession in a growing row over the {{symbolic}} issue of flying the Iraqi national flag at government buildings in the autonomous Kurdish north. Maliki's Arab Shi'ite-led government was locked in a dispute with the autonomous Kurdish regional government, which has banned {{the use of the}} Iraqi state flag on public buildings. The prime minister issued a blunt statement on Sunday saying: [...] "The Iraqi flag is the only flag that should be raised over any square inch of Iraq." [...] But Mesud Barzani, president of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, told the Kurdish parliament the national leadership were [...] "failures" [...] and that the Iraqi flag was a symbol of his people's past oppression by Baghdad: [...] "If at any moment we, the Kurdish people and parliament, consider that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> interests to declare independence, we will do so and we will fear no one." [...] The dispute exposes a widening rift between Arabs and Kurds, the second great threat to Iraq's survival as a state after the growing sectarian conflict between Arab Sunnis and Shi'ites.|$|E
2500|$|The Bahá'ís of Jaipur {{registered}} a complaint, (technically a First Information Report,) {{with police}} that their community burial ground {{had been attacked}} by a mob of about 40-50 people [...] "led by a sarpanch", or head of the local Gram panchayat, on Friday Oct 31, 2015 about 11:30am in Shri Ram Ki Nangal village. The Hindu newspaper claimed the Sarpanch was Nathu Jangid, head of the village government, based on witness statement. The security guard was injured and the guard's room and prayer house were damaged. The FIR was registered by the local assembly treasurer for the Bahá'ís. In a public meeting representatives of the Bahá'ís stated that they {{believe this is the}} first such incident {{in the history of the}} religion in the country, named the sarpanch, and recalled that during elections about a year and a half ago he had promised to take away the burial site and make it a playground or school that had been theirs since 2002. The Bahá'ís made no comment on the political statement then because [...] "as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> religion to be apolitical.” Indian newspaper The Wire published pictures of the site and damage and a claim by Sarpanch Jangid that the land had been illegally sold to the Bahá'ís.
