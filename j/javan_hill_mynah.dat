40|$|<b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> Gracula religiosa is a {{monomorphic}} bird {{of which}} the discrimination of sex is a crucial problem in captive breeding programs. In the past ten years, the wild population of the two subspecies found in Thailand, G. r. intermedia and G. r. religiosa, have drastically decreased due to the demand of the pet market to trade them as talking birds. Sexing <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> {{will be an important}} part in breeding them in captivity. Various methods had been experimented to sex them. Best of all was to obtain sex chromosomes from feather pulp. Male is the homogametic sex (ZZ) whereas female is the heterogametic sex (ZW). To identify Z and W chromosomes in <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> is undoubtedly an easy task since Z chromosome is nearly twice the size of W chromosome. It is subtelocentric and medium in size of macrochromosomes or the same size as pairs 4, 5, 6 while W chromosome is submetacentric and smaller, the same size as pairs 7, 8, 9. The diploid chromosome number of <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> was found to be 80. The karyotype consisted of ten pairs of macrochromosomes, nine pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosome and thirty pairs of microchromosomes.

40|$|A {{study on}} {{external}} characteristics of 749 live <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynahs</b> throughout Thailand classified morphological variants into five groups including two known subspecies and three new groups: northern, modified northern, intermediate, modified southern and southern. Zoogeography of these variations was studied by mapping the locations where each group inhabited related with body mass {{in order to}} understand the occurrence of three new <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> groups. The results showed that there were only northern group inhabited between 16 o and 20 o 30 ´ N and only southern group inhabited between 5 o 30 ´ and 6 o N. Three new <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> groups were found between 6 o and 16 o N: with northern group between 9 o and 16 o N and with southern group between 6 o and 9 o N.

40|$|Nesting {{habitats}} of <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> Gracula religiosa {{were studied}} {{in order to}} gain a perspective of habitat features which were favoured by natural selection. A total of 76 nest trees and 310 neighbour trees of northern <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> (G. r. intermedia) and 25 nest trees and 136 neighbour trees of southern <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> (G. r. religiosa) were studied in eight provinces of Thailand between 6 and 20 N from 1991 to 1999. Nest characteristics including nest height, nest size, nest depth, cavity entrance, angle of nest cavity and cavity entrance were recorded. The characters of nest trees, including condition types, the height, canopy and trunk were studied. Habitat characteristics were measured within a square plot of 20 x 20 m around nest trees. Number and the characters of neighbour trees around each nest tree, distance from nest trees to the nearest neighbour trees were recorded. The results showed that <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> nest trees were taller, bigger and had thicker canopies than their neighbour trees. Their nests were higher and farther from the tree boles in dense canopies. Nest trees were live and solitary in the areas with foliage cover. Habitats of successful nests were different from unsuccessful ones in the term of higher first branches, bigger canopies, more surrounding trees and farther from neighbour trees.

40|$|The {{study on}} eleven {{characteristics}} including head, bill, body, wattle, wing, tail and tarsus of <b>hill</b> <b>Mynahs</b> from different populations inhabited throughout Thailand discriminated birds into five groups: Northern, Modified Northern, Intermediate, Modified Southern and Southern. Specifically, {{there were five}} characters of the yellow connection between the anterior and posterior wattles. The differences among the averages of these characteristics of five different groups were statistically significant. On the other hand the karyological study did not show any correlation between phenotypic variation and genetic divergence in chromosomal aspect. There was no geographical difference in karyotypes. The sizes and shapes of five different <b>hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> group chromosomes were similar. The diploid chromosome number (2 n) was 80 : ten pairs of macrochromosomes and thirty pairs of microchromosomes. There was a karyotypical invariance among various morphological populations of <b>hill</b> <b>Mynahs</b> from different areas in this study.

40|$|Previous studies {{classified}} morphological {{variants of}} <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynahs</b> in Thailand into five groups, including two well-recognized subspecies Gracula religiosa intermedia, the northern group and G. r. religiosa, the southern group and three new groups that represented intermediate characteristics. The degree of morphological variation among <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> population was studied {{in order to}} detect population dynamics of this species. <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynahs</b> were enumerated at 233 feeding trees of 93 study sites in 31 provinces throughout Thailand. Three new groups were found, intermingled with the northern and the southern groups, between 6 ° and 16 ° N which denoted the contact zone of the two original subspecies found in Thailand. The three new groups which were the interbred outcomes comprised 40 % of the studied population and outnumbered their northern and southern counterparts which were 36 and 24 %, respectively. Prior to 2002, the morphological variation of this species has never been investigated.

40|$|The {{appearances}} of the morphological variation, especially body sizes and wattle characters of <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> population found in Thailand bring the questions if <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynahs</b> use these variations for survival through the communication {{in order to}} determine status signals within flocks and which character is the most propagated. The study was conducted both in the aviaries and in the field. The experiments in the aviaries revealed that they used body sizes and wattle characters including aggressive behavior to communicate {{in order to determine}} social status in flocks in captivity. The bigger birds were always dominant ones and gained more food. The observation in the field did not show that the bigger birds mated more than the others, but it depended on the population density of each group which inhabited in particular areas. Although the results did not indicated the specific character that propagated most, the body size and wattle variations in <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> which corresponded with aggressive behavior were used for survival in nonbreeding season. Because birds used these character variations to communicate social signals, the dominant birds approached to the resources first, obtained more food and left the flocks for mating before the others...|$|R

40|$|To study vocal mimicry in captive <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> Gracula religiosa, four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine 1) factors of development influenced the ability of learning 2) prior residence determined the ability of producing vocal mimicry 3) vocalization manipulated the social dominance. It showed that birds were able to well imitate if were hand-reared individually when they were less than five weeks old. No matter how good birds could do vocal mimicry after learning, if they were put into the resident aviaries, they almost stopped producing vocal mimicry. Dominance, through the prior residence played the important roles in this matter. Prior residence effect overcame other factors in the case that even resident birds produced fewer times of vocal mimicry, they still dominated the newcomers {{which used to be}} fluently vocal mimicry producers. Nevertheless, in initial grouping, with unfamiliar birds, ones which originally produced more times in vocal mimicry, had more advantage to get dominant position in captivity. These suggested that although prior residence overrode vocal mimicry ability, vocalization, anyhow, which led birds to gain dominance...|$|R
40|$|Gracula religiosa {{is one of}} the {{channels}} to understand vocal learning in birds. Experiments were designed in order to study the critical period and social interaction affecting this learning behaviour. The variations of learning ability depended upon subspecies, sexes and sex hormone levels were also investigated. The studies were divided into five experiments. The results showed that the hand-reared nestlings in individual cages, after learning Thai words and phrases before six months of age for a year, were the most effective group to show vocal imitation (18 times/h). Meanwhile, wild birds older than six months, though reared and trained in individual cages, did not produce vocal imitation. The variations of vocal imitation between subspecies and sexes were not found. However, male birds with high vocal imitation efficiency (15 times/h) had higher testosterone levels than those with lower vocal imitation efficiency. Estradiol levels were high in female birds with high vocal imitation.

40|$|In {{the present}} study {{seasonal}} changes of gonadotropins, prolactin and sex steroid hormones in captive <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> were measured from October 1995 to September 1996. During the breeding season, these hormone levels were higher than during the non-breeding one. Plasma levels of FSH in males and females rose in December, prior to the onset of breeding and remained elevated throughout the breeding season except in May. LH, testosterone and estradiol in both sexes were elevated in January, the onset of breeding. The maximum levels of these hormones were coincident with development of the gonads, secondary sex characters, territorial aggression and sexual behavior. Plasma testosterone and estradiol titers in males and females respectively were evidently bimodal with peaks in January and April which corresponded to the norm of two clutches per breeding season of this species. Progesterone levels in females surged in March, April and May which was the period of egg laying and incubation. Circulating prolactin in females was high during the parental phase of the breeding cycle in April and June. In addition, social cues such as sexual partner and external stimuli such as eggs or nestlings influenced the reproductive endocrinology...|$|R
40|$|Two {{subspecies}} of <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> (Gracula religiosa) {{occur in}} Thailand, the northern race (G. r. intermedia) {{and the southern}} race (G. r. religiosa). The southern race {{is larger than the}} northern race and has two separate patches of yellow wattle on the ear-coverts, whereas the northern race has a yellow connection between the anterior and posterior wattles. The variation in morphology was investigated by measuring eleven external morphological characteristics of 749 live birds from different habitats throughout Thailand. Birds from different latitudinal zones of Thailand were studied in five equal-interval zones from 5 ° 30 ` to 20 ° 30 ` N. A descriptive analysis of morphological variables for birds from each latitudinal zone indicated that the average head area, bill size, body size, wing length and tarsus length increased toward the south. One-way analysis of variance among the zones for all morphological parameters showed significant F-ratios. All morphological measurements were negatively correlated with latitude except for tail length which had a positive coefficient. Comparison of morphological variation with climatic variation especially with relative humidity suggests that climatic adaptation may account for subspecific variation in the morphology of this species...|$|R
40|$|The Indian <b>Hill</b> <b>Mynah</b> (Gracula religiosa) was {{studied in}} the field in Assam in {{north-east}} India. The aims of the study were two-fold: (i) to understand better this bird's exceptional ability in captivity to imitate human speech; and (ii) to provide background understanding to studies of the importance of early auditory experience and of vocal imitation in the development of normal song patterns in birds. First is given {{a brief description of the}} distribution, general behaviour, and breeding biology of this arboreal, sexually isomorphic, semi-gregarious species. The remainder of the monograph deals with vocalizations; these were either tape-recorded in the field, or transcribed directly using a written notation developed for the purpose. Any wild adult Mynah of either sex possesses four categories of vocalizations: (i) 'Chip-call'; a loud piercing squeak made in contexts which include alarm. (ii) 'Um-sound'; a soft grunt, acting in close range social contexts, and (like chip-calls) common to all individuals. (iii) 'Whisper-whistles': several soft sounds of types unique to the individual. (iv) 'Calls': several loud noises, of extremely varied patterns. The bulk of the monograph deals with 'calls', as defined thus. Calls were compared quantitatively with one another by a method developed which measured the degree of overlap of one sonogram with a tracing of a second sonogram. Both by this method and by ear, calls were divided into discrete types, without intermediates. Birds of either sex have a repertoire of usually between five and twelve such call types, some of which are produced much more commonly than others. Repertoires tend to be larger in birds which call more frequently, or which have mates with large repertoires. The repertoire of a given bird stays largely constant from year to year in size. composition, and proportions. No bird shares any of its call types with its mate, but it shares several of them with near neighbours of the same sex. There is a progressive change of dialect with distance, such that birds nesting more than about 14 km apart have no call types in common. No general characteristics of call structure could be found which were indicative of the sex of the caller, but in a known locality the call type made immediately reveals the sex of the bird producing it. Call types are learnt by selective imitation of neighbouring individuals during a young bird's first several months. A call type common in the repertoire of one bird tends also to be common in the repertoire of a neighbour, except at the edge of the limited range of that call type. Which particular call type a calling bird selects from among those in its repertoire is discussed. Few call types could be related to non-auditory contexts. A bird is likely to repeat the call type last made, and also tends to standardize the order in which it produces its different call types; this standard order tends to be the same as that of its neighbours. A birdtends also to reply at once and to standardize the call type it makes in immediate reply to a particular call type of its mate; again, neighbouring pairs of birds tend to use the same standardized call and reply types. The length of the interval between a particular call and its reply tends to be constant in a given pair of birds, and approximately the same in neighbouring pairs. These are all further aspects of extensive but selective vocal imitation by Mynahs of adult birds; other species are not imitated. Information on calling when in contact with other pairs came mainly from playback experiments, when single calls were presented to nesting pairs of Mynahs. Response strength was measured by the incidence of flight, number of subsequent vocalizations, latency of response, and proportion of playbacks ignored. When presented with playbacks of calls of familiar types (of neighbours) and of unknown types (of strangers), birds responded more strongly to the familiar than to the unknown call types. They did, however, respond somewhat to the unknown call types, which were of patterns never previously heard by them, presumably recognizing these as being Mynah calls by their sound quality. Mynahs responded as strongly to playbacks of neighbours' calls which were not in their own repertoire as to playbacks of neighbours' calls which were. A bird tends to match at once the call last heard (either from a tape recorder or from a wild neighbour), itself producing the same call type at once, if it possesses it in its own repertoire. That call type, and others associated with it, also occurs more frequently thereafter. Thus calls heard affect calls made, and vice-versa since other individuals nearby behave similarly. A change of nearest neighbours in successive years was shown to affect one pair's repertoire proportions. Further playback experiments showed that Mynahs were able to distinguish between a single call made by their neighbours and a single call of the same call type made by their mates. Small but consistent differences were found in the sonograms of such calls of the same type made by different birds. The structure of a single call type may change gradually with distance. The development of vocalizations with age is briefly described. In the final discussion sections, the ways in which, and the extent to which, Mynahs are able to determine the species, home locality, sex and individual identity of other Mynahs are outlined. There follow consideration, and comparison with other species: (i) of various aspects of repertoires; (ii) of the distribution of call types among different individuals; (iii) of the dynamic aspects of calling, and a scheme is proposed which accounts for the selection for utterance of a particular call type from the repertoire; and (iv) of the organization and coordination of calling. The lack of imitation of other species in the wild is discussed, and contrasted with the several ways in which wild Mynahs imitate one another in various aspects of their calling...|$|R
