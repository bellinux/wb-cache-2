40|$|The {{polymeric}} materials are widely applied in many industries {{because they have}} a number of advantages, which allow their use instead of traditional materials. Nevertheless, the issues of manufacturing products from {{polymeric materials}} and their applications are insufficiently studied. The same can be said about high-frequency (HF) electrothermics of polymers. Therefore, mathematical simulation of electrothermic processes is of interest both in terms of science and in terms of applications. Traditionally, the technological scheme with one insulator made of cardboard is used to implement the HF heating processes for welding of polymers without analyzing their insulating properties. For welding of polymer parts with various thickness it is interesting to consider the scheme with two <b>heat</b> <b>insulators</b> in the form of five-layer plate, including electrodes, insulators, and processed material. As a result of the conducted research activities the article presents a mathematical model {{in the form of a}} system of differential equations of unsteady heat conductivity taking into account internal sources of heat with appropriate boundary conditions, and software to implement it. The software that implements a mathematical model enables to study the mutual influence between the geometrical and electro-physical parameters of technological system of HF heating of the thermoplastics. From the calculations presented in numerical and graphic form the following areas of heating polymer are identified: uniform heating, regional zones of thermal influence of insulators. The article presents the research results of influence of <b>heat</b> <b>insulators</b> with different thickness on the distribution of thermoplastics temperature field. It is determined that the zone of maximum value of heating polymer can be displaced by modifying the parameters of insulating layers, thereby improving the welding quality of polymeric items. According to research results, we can conclude that there is a demand for creating a technological process for electro-thermic welding of polymers with a possibility to displace a zone of maximum heating (melting) polymer owing to changing heat insulation thickness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop low color, atomic oxygen {{resistant}} polyimides for potential applications on spacecraft in low earth orbit. The material is {{needed in order to}} protect satellites and spacecraft from the gases and radiation found at those altitudes. Phosphorous containing polyimides {{have been shown to be}} especially resistant to corrosion and weight loss under oxygen plasma. Unfortunately the color of these phosphorous containing polyimides is still too high for them to be good <b>heat</b> <b>insulators.</b> While they are not as effective as teflon, the current material of choice. polyimides are much less dense than teflon and would be especially valuable if they could be made with low color. The approach taken was to synthesize a monomer which would contain the elements needed for giving the final polyimide its desired properties. In particular the monomer should incorporate phosphine or phosphine oxides and have bulky side groups to block any color forming charge transfer structures. The target molecule, 3, 5 -di-(trifluoromethylphenyl) -bis(3 -aminophenyl) phosphine oxide, (containing both a phosphine oxide group and a bulky ditrifluoromethylphenyl group) was synthesized via three reactions in overall yield of 21 percent. In addition, a model compound, bis(3 -phenylamine) phenyl phosphine oxide, was synthesized two different ways in order to establish the conditions for the nitration of phosphine oxides and their reduction to the amine. Finally, a trisubstituted phosphine oxide was synthesized. In all, seven phosphorus containing organic compounds were synthesized, purified and characterized. The model compound was reacted with oxydiphthalic anhydride to form a polyamic acid with inherent viscosity of 0. 34. This material was cast into a film and heated, forming a normally colored fairly strong polyimide with a Tg of 240 C.

40|$|Continuous {{downscaling}} of Si complementary {{metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) technology and progress in high-power electronics demand more efficient heat removal techniques to handle the increasing power density and rising temperature of hot spots. For this reason, {{it is important to}} investigate thermal properties of materials at nanometer scale and identify materials with the extremely large or extremely low thermal conductivity for applications as heat spreaders or <b>heat</b> <b>insulators</b> in the next generation of integrated circuits. The thin films used in microelectronic and photonic devices need to have high thermal conductivity in order to transfer the dissipated power to heat sinks more effectively. On the other hand, thermoelectric devices call for materials or structures with low thermal conductivity because the performance of thermoelectric devices is determined by the figure of merit Z=S^ 2 e/K, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, K and e are the thermal and electrical conductivity, respectively. Nanostructured superlattices can have drastically reduced thermal conductivity as compared to their bulk counterparts making them promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. Other applications calling for thin films with low thermal conductivity value are high-temperature coatings for engines. Thus, materials with both high thermal conductivity and low thermal conductivity are technologically important. The increasing temperature of the hot spots in state-of-the-art chips stimulates the search for innovative methods for heat removal. One promising approach is to incorporate materials, which have high thermal conductivity into the chip design. Two suitable candidates for such applications are diamond and graphene. Another approach is to integrate the high-efficiency thermoelectric elements for on-spot cooling. In addition, there is strong motivation for improved thermal interface materials (TIMs) for heat transfer from the heat-generating chip to heat-sinking units. This dissertation presents results of the experimental investigation and theoretical interpretation of thermal transport in the advanced engineered materials, which include thin films for thermal management of nanoscale devices, nanostructured superlattices as promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials, and improved TIMs with graphene and metal particles as fillers providing enhanced thermal conductivity.

In this study, silica was used as the matrix filler of polysiloxane as the application of heat insulation. Polysiloxane were mixed with different percentage of both types of silica powder, which ranges of silica weight percentage from 0 wt% to 12 wt%. Casting process was conducted for the preparation of polysiloxane mixed with silica. The silica powder itself was evaluated based on its physical property and crystal structure by XRD analysis. As for the polysiloxane filled with silica, several testing were done such as density test, tensile test, thermogravimeric analysis and also heat insulation test. As for XRD analysis, phase identification was achieved by comparing the diffraction patterns of silica powder with JCPDS 46 - 1045 as for standard synthetic silica. Density test show that rice husk amorphous silica filler shown higher density than the synthetic silica filler. For tensile strength, both silica filler show different pattern of highest tensile strength, as rice husk filler shown at 10 wt%, while synthetic at 2 wt%.
