50|$|Noble Drilling and Wood {{subsidiary}} Mustang Engineering, {{part of the}} Wood Group, won {{the contract}} for Front-End Engineering Design (FEED). They proposed a single steel jacket with an integrated topsides deck with processing facilities, accommodation and a separate modular drilling rig. The steel jacket for Clair is located over the existing 206/8-10z well. The jacket is a four-legged single steel structure with a height of approximately 165 m. At its base, the jacket measures 45 by 50 m, has a height of 169 m, and a total weight of 8,800 tons. Both jacket and topsides are designed for fabrication, transportation and installation as single fully <b>integrated</b> <b>lifts</b> (maximum 10,500t) that require access to the heaviest lift capability vessels on the installation market.

In {{order to provide}} data for next generation systems, a wind tunnel test of an all-wing cruise efficient, short take-off and landing (CE STOL) configuration was conducted in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center (LaRC) 14 - by 22 -foot Subsonic Wind Tunnel. The test s purpose was to mature the aerodynamic aspects of an <b>integrated</b> powered <b>lift</b> system within an advanced mobility configuration capable of CE STOL. The full-span model made use of steady flap blowing and a lifting centerbody to achieve high lift coefficients. The test occurred during April through June of 2007 and included objectives for advancing the state-of-the-art of powered lift testing through gathering force and moment data, on-body pressure data, and off-body flow field measurements during automatically controlled blowing conditions.

5000|$|The station, {{built in}} 1865, was {{substantially}} modified in 2012 {{to accommodate the}} erection of a footbridge with an <b>integrated</b> <b>lift.</b> This structure was required as a planning permission clause related {{to the construction of}} a new housing estate in the fields across the line from the station. It was not possible to fit a ramped bridge in the available space, hence the need for a lift, making Inverkip one of the few unmanned stations in Scotland to have a lift (other examples can be found at [...] and [...] ). The shelter was replaced and relocated further west and the steps from station Avenue were relocated slightly further east. Temporary steps were put in place during the year-long construction project. The lift serves the platform level and the footbridge level. Strangely, it is necessary to exit the station in order to access the steps to the footbridge since there are no steps directly from the platform to the bridge. There are no steps to the bridge on the other side of the line due to the steep embankment there.|$|E

40|$|A solution-adaptive {{grid method}} has been {{developed}} for computing tip-vortex flowfields around rectangular wings.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study was}} conducted to better understand experimental results obtained from wind-tunnel tests of a Mach 4 conical-flow-derived waverider and a comparative reference configuration, which showed that the aerodynamic performance of the reference configuration was slightly better than that of the waverider. The computational results showed that the predicted surface pressure values and the <b>integrated</b> <b>lift</b> and drag coefficients were much lower for the reference model because the reference model bottom is an expansion surface. However, the lift-drag ratios for the reference model were higher due to a relatively low drag for a comparable amount of lift. The results also showed that the reference model exhibited the same shock attachment characteristics as the conical-flow-derived waverider, and is therefore also a waverider. The shock attachment characteristic gives the waverider a performance advantage over conventional hypersonic vehicles, and the results suggest that altering the bottom surface does not cause significant performance degradation. Flowfield solutions also show that the conical-flow waverider model has better propulsion/airframe integration characteristics than the reference configuration. The results also suggest that generating flowfields other than conical ones may be used to design waveriders with improved aerodynamic performance...|$|E
40|$|This talk {{considers}} simplified {{finite element}} discretization techniques for first-order systems of conservation laws {{equipped with a}} convex (entropy) extension. Using newly developed techniques in entropy symmetrization theory, simplified forms of the Galerkin least-squares (GLS) and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method have been developed and analyzed. The use of symmetrization variables yields numerical schemes which inherit global entropy stability properties of the POE system. Central {{to the development of}} the simplified GLS and DG methods is the Degenerative Scaling Theorem which characterizes right symmetrizes of an arbitrary first-order hyperbolic system in terms of scaled eigenvectors of the corresponding flux Jacobean matrices. A constructive proof is provided for the Eigenvalue Scaling Theorem with detailed consideration given to the Euler, Navier-Stokes, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. Linear and nonlinear energy stability is proven for the simplified GLS and DG methods.
