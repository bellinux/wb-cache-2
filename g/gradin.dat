Edler had previously tried out for Modo's youth program, but was cut. Future Canucks teammates Markus Näslund, Henrik Sedin and Daniel Sedin had also played in the Modo system before joining the NHL. In Edler's lone season with Modo, he recorded eight goals and 23 points over 33 games in 2004–05.

The proof of Wulff's theorem is stated in a concise mathematical form. Some typical equilibrium shapes of liquid crystalline drops are described. When there is orientational order of the molecules in the liquid crystal but no translational order, the equilibrium shape may be an ellipsoid or a tactoid; when there is translational order as well, the shape may have plane faces, possibly with sharp edges and corners. The formation of the stepped drop, goutte à <b>gradins,</b> is interpreted as analogous to the stepwise roughening of a flat crystal surface whose orientation does not occur amongst the boundary surfaces of the Wulff shape...|$|R
500|$|Edler {{was largely}} unknown during his NHL Draft year, unranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau the entire season. He {{was brought to}} the {{attention}} of the Vancouver Canucks by the team's head scout in Sweden, Thomas <b>Gradin,</b> who saw Edler playing with Jämtlands HF. Although <b>Gradin</b> would refer to the team's level of play as little more than beer-league-calibre, he was impressed with Edler and encouraged Canucks management to draft him (Edler's number 23 with the Canucks would later be chosen by team trainers in honour of <b>Gradin).</b> The Canucks traded up in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft to acquire the Dallas Stars' third-round draft pick in exchange for their own third-round pick in the 2005 Draft, and used the pick to select Edler 91st overall. The deal was made with the Stars in lieu of speculation that the Detroit Red Wings had a high interest in Edler and wanted to draft him in the third round as well. Detroit had discovered Edler in Sweden through their European scout Håkan Andersson, who was responsible for such previous Red Wings late-round picks as Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk. At the time of his draft, Canucks General Manager Dave Nonis described Edler as a [...] "smooth skater [...] big guy."

This option required that they play junior ice hockey in North America, which was not their intention.

40|$|The model {{proposed}} by Maxwell for a visco-elastic medium is generalized {{by combining the}} properties of a crystalline solid and an anisotropic fluid. The basic equations are derived taking the elastic constants and the coefficients of viscosity both to be tensors of rank four. Expressions are given for the complex velocity of propagation of elastic waves of small amplitude {{as a function of}} direction. The theory is then applied to the 'stepped drop' (goutte a <b>gradins)</b> discovered by Grandjean, which consists of a number of exactly parallel layers, each layer terminating in a sharp step. The layers slide over one another very easily, but in any other direction the drop is extremely viscous. It is shown that for vibrations of frequency less than about 109 s- 1, only the longitudinal wave is propagated normal to the layers, the two transverse waves being heavily damped. In the plane of the layers the longitudinal wave and one transverse component are propagated...|$|R

[...] Franzén was big, had a heavy shot, with very good skating abilities for his size, and Andersson believed Franzén could at least be a good checking center.

As the first group descends, sixteen further Chinese, both mandarins and slaves, {{come out of their}} habitations .... All these form eight rows of dancers who, rising and dipping in succession, imitate fairly well the billows of a stormy sea. All the Chinese, having descended, begin a character march. There are a mandarin, borne in a rich palanquin by six white slaves, whilst two negros draw a chariot on which a young Chinese woman is seated. They are preceded and followed by a host of Chinese playing various musical instruments .... This march concluded, the ballet begins and leaves nothing to be desired either in the diversity or in the neatness of the figures. It ends in a contredanse of thirty-two persons whose movements trace a prodigious number of new and perfectly designed attitudes, which form and dissolve with the greatest of ease. At the end ... the Chinese return to their place on the amphitheatre, which is transformed into a china cabinet. Thirty-two vases, which rise up, conceal ... the thirty-two Chinese one saw before. Considering that most performances (theatrical and ballet) before this took place in either the royal courts or in inn yards, taverns, or pubs, having that many people on the stage at one time was unheard of. However, Lincoln Kirstein adds that it [...] "consisted of dance pictures with little plot, incorporating elements of the real and ideal, including the exotic China of travelers and explorers and the fantastic Cathay of Rococo chinoiserie designers." [...] Furthermore, the costumes were [...] "untraditional"—they were based on Roman armor and had Chinese embellishments on them.|$|R
