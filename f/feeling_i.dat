5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or <b>feeling.</b> <b>I</b> carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

500|$|The {{relatively}} disappointing {{box office}} returns for Licence to Kill led to Albert Broccoli questioning his own {{leadership of the}} series, and he put Danjaq, holders of the Bond film copyright, up for sale. Timothy Dalton was quoted {{at the time as}} saying [...] "My feeling is this will be the last one. I don't mean my last one, I mean the end of the whole lot. I don't speak with any real authority, but it's sort of a <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> have".|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon {{a letter of}} {{congratulations}} in early December 1946. The two men met for an hour at Voorhis's office and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. Voorhis's final letter as a congressman, on December 31, was to his father, who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career, [...] "It has been primarily due to your help, your confidence, your advice... above all to a <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> have always had that your hand was on my shoulder. Thanks... God bless you." ...|$|E

500|$|Richardson was {{not known}} for his {{political}} views. He reportedly voted for Winston Churchill's Conservative party in 1945, {{but there is little}} other mention of party politics in the biographies. Having been a devoted Roman Catholic as a boy, he became disillusioned with religion as a young man, but drifted back to faith: [...] "I came to a kind of <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> could touch a live wire through prayer". [...] He retained his early love of painting, and listed it and tennis in his Who's Who entry as his recreations.|$|E
500|$|On October 6, 2012, Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Everybody" [...] during The MDNA Tour in San Jose {{to celebrate}} the single's 30th anniversary.

I remember the amazing <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> had when I heard the song on the radio the first time." [...] Aidin Vaziri from San Francisco Chronicle commented that [...] "Three decades later, the simple synth-pop lift and naive R melody still felt amazing. It was an off-script moment that inadvertently became the highlight of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} Duke of Windsor {{and the rest}} of the royal family were {{strained}} for decades. The Duke had assumed that he would settle in Britain after a year or two of exile in France. King George VI (with the support of Queen Mary and his wife Queen Elizabeth) threatened to cut off Edward's allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation. Edward became embittered against his mother, Queen Mary, writing to her in 1939: [...] " [...] destroy the last vestige of <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> had left for you... made further normal correspondence between us impossible." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{realized}} it was the applause of the fans that really kept me going. Because I {{would be ready to}} go onstage and just be crying hysterically not understanding even how I was <b>feeling.</b> <b>I</b> was feeling very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them down and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just broke my heart. So I went out every night and I played and I played and I played until I couldn't walk one night." ...|$|E
500|$|Del Toro and Soderbergh both {{attended}} the French premiere in late November 2008, where they took {{questions from the}} press. Del Toro remarked that the [...] "legendary rebel" [...] was still pertinent because [...] "the things that he fought for in the late 1950s and mid 1960s are still relevant today", adding that [...] "he did not hide behind curtains ... he stood up for the forgotten ones". When asked why he made the film, Soderbergh stated, [...] "I {{needed to make the}} film, and that is a different <b>feeling.</b> <b>I</b> felt like, if I am worth anything, I have to say yes. I can't say no". The following day, the Dubai International Film Festival would describe Soderbergh's narrative as a [...] "magisterial ... compelling experience", with Del Toro's performance as [...] "blue-chip".|$|E
500|$|... "The <b>Feeling</b> <b>I</b> Get", [...] "Just Chillin'", and the Latin-influenced [...] "Dancing in the House", are all {{original}} compositions by Brown; {{the latter}} two are considered moderately upbeat. [...] "Night Drive", [...] "Won't You Stay", and [...] "In My Life" [...] are also credited in part to Brown. [...] "Night Drive", co-written by Phil Davis, contains a trumpet performance by Braun. In addition to Brown, [...] "Won't You Stay" [...] was co-written by Vikter Duplaix and James Poyser; [...] "In My Life" [...] was co-written by Edwin Lugo. The album also includes [...] "Feeling the Way" [...] (Derek Allen, Juanita Wynn), John Stoddart's [...] "I Still Believe", a cover version of Janet Jackson's [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] (Melanie Andrews, Jackson, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis), and Christopher Bolden's [...] "Not Like You Do." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|... "Marry the Night" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga and Fernando Garibay while {{on the road for}} The Monster Ball Tour, and was {{produced}} by both. It was first mentioned by Gaga as a track from her album, Born This Way, Ryan Seacrest's radio show, where she described it as one of her favorite songs from the album. Gaga and Garibay had worked previously on the song [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] (2009), from Gaga's previous release, The Fame Monster. Before starting work on [...] "Marry the Night", Gaga listened to [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] and decided she wanted to top that song's energy with her new collaboration with Garibay. [...] "I remember being backstage and hearing the concert start, so I go out there and hear 'Dance in the Dark' open up the whole concert, and I wanted to outdo that <b>feeling.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to outdo that moment that opens up the show. I'm just that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Former congressman Hoeppel, who {{gathered}} just over {{one percent of}} the vote, wrote Nixon after the election, stating that he had never expected to win, and that his purpose had been [...] "to expose what I considered to be the alien-minded, un-American, PAC, Red, congressional record of the Democratic incumbent". [...] Despite any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon a letter of congratulations in early December 1946. Nixon and Voorhis met for an hour at Voorhis's office, and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. In 1971, Voorhis said that the two had never spoken again. [...] Voorhis's final letter as a congressman, written on December 31, was to his father, who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career.

500|$|The {{character}} of Yori and her user, Dr. Lora Baines, {{do not appear}} in the sequel, even though the film refers to Alan Bradley being married to Lora. Fans have lobbied for actress Cindy Morgan to be in the film with active campaigns online, such as [...] "Yori Lives" [...] on Facebook, which is independent of Morgan herself. [...] "All I know is what I'm seeing online," [...] Morgan said. [...] "I am so thrilled and touched and excited about the fan reaction and about people talking about the first one and how it relates to the second one. I can't tell you how warm a <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> get from that. It just means so much." [...] No one from Tron: Legacy had contacted Morgan, and she did not directly speak with anyone from the sequel's cast and crew. As Dr. Lora Baines, Cindy Morgan had appeared with Bruce Boxleitner (as Alan Bradley) at the Encom Press Conference in San Francisco, April 2, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Federer {{plays with}} the Wilson Prostaff RF97 Autograph, a 97 square inch tennis racquet with 21.5mm beam, 360 g weight, 331 swing weight and 16x19 string pattern (all strung with overgrip). Since the 1998 Wimbledon Junior Championships Federer played with a Pro Staff 6.0 85 racquet. He {{switched}} to a bigger custom-built 90 tennis racquet since 2003, which is characterised by its smaller hitting area of 90 square inches, heavy strung weight of 364grams, and thin beam of 17.5 millimetres. His grip size was 4 3/8inches (sometimes referred to as L3). [...] Federer strung his racquets at 21.5kg mains/20kg crosses pre-stretched 20 percent, using Wilson Natural Gut 16 gauge for his main strings and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough 16L gauge (polyester) for his cross strings. When asked about string tensions, Federer stated [...] "this depends on how warm the days are and with what kind of balls I play and against who I play. So you can see– it depends on several factors {{and not just the}} surface; the <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> have is most important." ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them is my best friend. That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm <b>feeling.</b> <b>I</b> want it to really reflect the song. So I wanted to make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E
