5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility.

5|$|Rain and fog {{were heavy}} {{throughout}} {{the morning of}} July 6, and visibility was limited for the emplaced troops. Just after daybreak, 13 North Korean T-34 tanks were spotted stopped at the bridge. Following them were two columns of infantry. The American forces originally believed {{that they might be}} survivors of Task Force Smith until they realized the forces were deploying in numbers too great, and began preparing to attack the unsuspecting North Koreans. The battalion's commander ordered mortar fire on the North Korean forces, causing them to disperse as the lead tank began firing on the positions of A Company, on a hill southwest of the road. Mortar fire destroyed a truck, but a round from a North Korean tank stunned the artillery observer and no one took his place in the confusion, ending the American mortar attack. North Korean forces immediately began advancing on A Company's position, but the company was not able to return fire effectively, with <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> of its soldiers using their weapons.

Within fifteen minutes, B Company was able to return fire effectively, and by this time the North Korean forces had advanced steadily toward 1st Battalion's position. Later examinations found many American soldiers' weapons were assembled incorrectly or were dirty or broken. The Americans had nothing with which to fight the tanks, and were unable to do anything to stop them.|$|E

By the fifth edition, Stanley was able to list important customers such as several government departments, the Army, the Royal Navy, railways at home and abroad, and London University. From 1865, he worked on improving the elegance and stability of surveying instruments, especially the theodolite, whose construction he simplified.

40|$|Objectives: We {{tested the}} {{following}} hypotheses: (i) risk-averse general practitioners (GPs) {{are more likely}} to be vaccinated against influenza; (ii) and risk-averse GPs recommend influenza vaccination more often to their patients. In risk-averse GPs, the perceived benefits of the vaccine and/or the perceived risks of the infectious disease might indeed outweigh the perceived risks of the vaccine. Patients/Methods: In 2010 - 2012, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a nationwide French representative sample of 1136 GPs. Multivariate analyses adjusted for four stratification variables (age, gender, urban/suburban/rural practice location and annual patient consultations) and for GPs' characteristics (group/solo practice, and occasional practice of alternative medicine, e. g., homeopathy) looked for associations between their risk attitudes and self-reported vaccination behavior. Individual risk attitudes were expressed as a continuous variable, from 0 (risk-tolerant) to 10 (risk-averse). Results: Overall, 69 % of GPs reported that they were very favorable toward vaccination in general. Self-reported vaccination coverage was 78 % for 2009 / 2010 seasonal influenza and 62 % for A/H 1 N 1 pandemic influenza. Most GPs (72 %) reported recommending the pandemic influenza vaccination to at-risk young adults in 2009, but <b>few</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> (42 %) to young adults not at risk. In multivariate analyses, risk-averse GPs were more often vaccinated against seasonal (marginal effect = 1. 3 %, P = 0. 02) and pandemic influenza (marginal effect = 1. 5 %, P = 0. 02). Risk-averse GPs recommended the pandemic influenza vaccination more often than their more risk-tolerant colleagues to patients without risk factors (marginal effect = 1. 7 %, P = 0. 01), but not to their at-risk patients and were more favorable toward vaccination in general (marginal effect = 1. 5 %, P = 0. 04). Conclusion: Individual risk attitudes may influence GPs' practices regarding influenza vaccination, both for themselves and their patients. Our results suggest that risk-averse GPs may perceive the risks of influenza to outweigh the potential risks related to the vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Long-term average {{rates of}} channel erosion and {{sediment}} transport {{depend on the}} frequency–magnitude characteristics of flood flows that exceed an erosion threshold. Using a Poisson model for rainfall and runoff, analytical solutions are developed for average rates of stream incision and sediment transport {{in the presence of}} such a threshold. Solutions are derived and numerically tested for three erosion/transport formulas: the Howard–Kerby shear-stress incision model, the Bridge–Dominic sediment transport model, and a generic shear-stress sediment transport model. Results imply that non-linearity resulting from threshold effects can have a first-order impact on topography and patterns of dynamic response to tectonic and climate forcing. This non-linearity becomes significant when <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> about <b>half</b> of flood events are capable of detaching rock or sediment. Predicted morphology and uplift-gradient scaling is more closely consistent with observations and laboratory experiments than conventional slope-linear or shear-linear erosion laws.
