5|$|Citing {{opposition}} {{from within the}} Republican Party, as well as fallout from controversial comments he made about the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi, McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8. Following McCarthy's departure from the race, Republicans renewed their efforts to recruit Ryan as a candidate. Boehner personally called Ryan twice to ask <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> and Chaffetz said that he would not run against Ryan if he chose to enter the race. Ryan also received calls from Mitt Romney and Trey Gowdy, among others, encouraging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for Speaker. Additional Ryan endorsements came from Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, 2016 Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise from Louisiana. On October 9, close aides of Ryan confirmed that Ryan was reconsidering the possibility of a run.|$|E

Some years later, Helmut Kohl {{offered him a}} safe seat for the 1965 elections, even {{going so far as}} to have Chancellor Konrad Adenauer write two letters urging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> but Weizsäcker declined, due to his work in the German Evangelical Church Assembly, wanting to avoid a {{conflict}} of interest.

He {{involved}} himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA, which nominated <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> in the 1921 provincial election as its candidate in Vermilion. The UFA won the election, and Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of Premiers Herbert Greenfield and John Edward Brownlee, where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal conservatism. When a sex scandal forced Brownlee from office in 1934, Reid was the caucus' unanimous choice to succeed him as Premier.|$|E

In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H.

In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, {{he went to work}} with the National Research Council. He attempted to develop a means of detecting submarines by measuring the disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field. His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; attempts to get it to work on a metal ship such as a destroyer failed.|$|E

5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.|$|E

5|$|As {{the state}} {{conventions}} drew nearer, Blaine {{announced that he}} would not be a candidate. His supporters doubted his sincerity and continued to encourage <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> but Blaine still demurred. Hoping to make his intentions clear, Blaine left the country and was staying with Carnegie in Scotland when the 1888 Republican National Convention began in Chicago. Carnegie encouraged Blaine to accept if the convention nominated him, but the delegates finally accepted Blaine’s refusal. John Sherman was the most prominent candidate and sought to attract the Blaine supporters to his candidacy, but instead found them flocking to former senator Benjamin Harrison of Indiana after a telegram from Carnegie suggested that Blaine favored him. Blaine returned to the United States in August 1888 and visited Harrison at his home in October, where twenty-five thousand residents paraded in Blaine’s honor. Harrison defeated Cleveland in a close election, and offered Blaine his former position as Secretary of State.|$|E
