40|$|This {{study was}} a {{comparative}} investigation of face-to-face and written <b>electronic</b> <b>conferences.</b> The participants were advanced English {{as a second language}} (hereafter: ESL) students. The two types of conferences were compared in terms of textual features and participation. There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of words that students produced in an equivalent amount of time in the two types of conferences. The discourse in written <b>electronic</b> <b>conferences</b> displayed greater lexical range, and students in these conferences produced more discourse demonstrating interactive competence. The statistically significant finding of increased lexical range in written <b>electronic</b> <b>conferences</b> persisted even when the interactive discourse was eliminated from the conference transcripts and the transcripts were reanalyzed. This finding suggests that, during written <b>electronic</b> <b>conferences,</b> students were better able to use and practice a wider range of vocabulary related to the topics. For one of the groups, participation in written <b>electronic</b> <b>conferences</b> was more balanced among students, while for the other group participation was about equally balanced regardless of the conference setting. This last finding came as a surprise and points to a need for further research into variables that might mediate balanced participation in face-to-face and written <b>electronic</b> <b>conferences...</b>|$|R

40|$|Argumentation can {{be defined}} at {{different}} levels and serve different purposes, but its role in knowledge understanding and construction has given it a central place in education, particularly at tertiary level. The advent of computer-supported text-based conferences has created new sites where such educational dialogues can take place, but {{the quality of the}} interaction and whether it is serving its educational purpose is still uncertain. This paper reports on a framework of analysis that has been developed to illuminate the arguing process within an asynchronous <b>electronic</b> <b>conferencing</b> environment, showing how it is both similar to, and different from, argumentation in the more traditional forums of multi-party, face-to-face discussion and traditional written essays. The framework develops earlier work by the authors and is applied to two <b>electronic</b> <b>conferences</b> within the same postgraduate course, comparing overall patterns of argumentation. Findings are presented {{on the extent to which}} the technology of <b>electronic</b> <b>conferencing</b> shapes and supports studentsâ€™ participation in academic literacy practices relating to argumentation, proposing, at the same time, that the teaching strategy adopted by the lecturer is also an important variable...|$|R

40|$|In {{a context}} of {{financial}} restraint and enterprising university managers, teacher-researchers {{have reason to be}} sceptical about the trend towards online teaching and away from learning for its own sake. This article departs from both economic and technological determinism and turns instead to ideas about technology embedded in social and political institutions. Activity theory offers a useful means of analysing such embeddedness. Its Marxian assumptions about human nature specify a non-deterministic approach to technology. Its dynamic model of the subjects, tools, and objects of activity within {{a context of}} rules, a community, and a division of labour helps to specify aspects of the authors process of learning how to use <b>electronic</b> <b>conferencing</b> effectively. A full deployment of activity theory would also analyse the activity of students. Here the evidence comes mainly from the activity of researcher-teachers engaging greater activity among students. The numbers of students involved precludes reliable quantitative analysis but qualitative evidence from students does support conclusions about researcher-teachers learning how to make best use of <b>electronic</b> <b>conferencing.</b> <br /...|$|R
