To minimize the camera image blur resulting from the dynamic influence of deflection plate potentials acting on photocathode electrons, it was necessary to design a circuit that would rise from 0 to the 99 % voltage level in under 100 nS. Once this voltage was reached, it was necessary to stay within 1 % of the attained voltage level for a duration of 1 uS. This was accomplished with the use of MOSFET solid state switching...|$|E

To clarify some misunderstandings in frame testing, a multi-directional rating test method for bicycle frame stiffness has been developed.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 46 - 47) Nanoindentation is {{a technique}} developed {{over the last two}} decades for studying the mechanical properties of materials at micro or nano scales. The availability of depth-sensing indentation instruments with capabilities for measuring displacements on the order of nanometers now makes it possible to study mechanical properties of finely structured materials where small volumes need to be probed. Flexure-based compliant mechanisms have been used in an ultra-precision stage, stage for nano imprint machines, AFM scanner, and MEMS structures, etc. Flexure stages employ a non-conventional flexure bearing' mechanism in the system, in which the moving platform is linked to a static base by flexure hinges. The platform's movement, driven by piezo actuators, is guided by the flexure mechanism. The guiding motion is generated by elastic deformation of the flexure material. Therefore, the linkage is friction and stiction free, resulting in smooth motion. This thesis discusses the development of Nanoindentation system with a flexure-hinged mechanism. The key components which the system consists are: Flexure based linear motion stage (the Z-axis stage) that provides vertical positioning of the tool tip in addition to measuring the contact load of the tool upon the sample, Berkovich indenter is used as a tool tip and flexure based stage (the XY-stage) for positioning the sample horizontally below the tool. As load is applied to the indenter and sample, reaction forces cause the load frame to be elastically deflected. This can lead to an overestimate of penetration depth into the sample. Thus actual penetration depth is found by subtracting the load <b>frame</b> <b>deflection</b> out of the load-depth curve. To verify the system performance, we conducted standard indentation tests on a fused silica sample and a nickel specimen prepared by Current Activated Tip-based Sintering (CATS). For fused silica, hardness and elastic modulus determined through testing were shown to be close to literature values and for nickel sintered specimen the hardness determined through testing were shown to be close to the results determined from the Vickers test...|$|E

The study then investigates the effect of secondary members on the optimum design. It is shown that incorporating the secondary members is important for portal frames having spans less than 12 m.

The results show that the proposed GA is efficient and reliable. Two different sets of serviceability deflection limits are then considered: deflection limits recommended by the Steel Construction Institute (SCI), which is based on control of differential deflections, and other deflection limits based on suggestions by industry. Parametric studies are carried out on frames with spans ranging between 15 m to 50 m and column heights between 5 m to 10 m. It is demonstrated that for a 50 m span frame, use of the SCI recommended deflection limits can lead to frame weights that are around twice as heavy as compared to designs without these limits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A comb-actuated {{torsional}} microscanner is devel-oped for high-resolution laser-scanning display systems. Typical torsional comb-drive scanners have fingers placed {{around the}} perimeter of the scanning mirror. In contrast, the structure in this paper uses cascaded frames, where the comb fingers are placed on an outer drive frame, and the motion is transferred to the inner mirror frame with a mechanical gain. The structure works only in resonant mode without requiring any offset in the comb fingers, keeping the silicon-on-insulator-based process quite simple. The design intent is to improve actuator efficiency by removing the high-drag fingers from the high-velocity scanning mirror. Placing them on the lower velocity drive frame reduces their contribution to the damping torque. Furthermore, placement on the drive frame allows an increase of the number of fingers and their capacity to impart torque. The microscanner exhibits a parametric response, and as such, the maximum deflection is found when actuated at twice its natural frequency. Analytical formulas are given for the coupled-mode equations and <b>frame</b> <b>deflections.</b> A simple formula is derived for the mechanical-gain factor.

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} interest has evolved concerning seat integrated safety belts in cars, regarding both 3 - and 4 -point belts in various configurations. One safety advantage of seat integrated safety belts {{appears in the}} case of so-called small overlap crashes. One consequence of a small overlap crash can be that the colliding cars strike each other's sides hitting both the A- and B-pillar. Hence, the A- as well as the B-pillar are pushed inwards and backwards. In this case, belt anchor points on the B-pillar may also be pushed backwards and the belt will be stretched over the occupant. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate seat integrated safety belt configurations that may involve a seat structure design that intentionally deforms and absorbs energy during a crash. Common 3 -point configurations were used as references. The aim was to investigate how the physical properties influence the interaction of the seat back frame and the safety belt. Numerical simulations were carried out using the explicit LS-DYNA FE-analysis software. A FE-model of a seat structure, floor pan and B-pillar was established. A 50 th percentile Hybrid III FE-dummy model was used as occupant and for studying the biomechanical responses. Different physical properties of the seat structure and different belt load limit forces were used as parametric variables. Only frontal crashes were considered. Responses concerning chest deflection, head- and chest displacement, change of pelvis angle, pelvis submarining tendency, lap- and torso belt forces, seat back <b>frame</b> <b>deflection,</b> ride-down efficiency, seat structure natural frequency, upper neck loads and neck injury criteria were studied. The results indicate that the belt-webbing distribution between the lap and the torso belts via a slip-ring and in combination with a non-rigid seat back frame increases the ride-down efficiency compared to a system with no belt-webbing distribution. Further, the combined use of different energy absorption mechanisms influences the biomechanical response as well as the structural response of an integrated safety belt configuration. An optimal solution with respect to multiple objectives requires a proper combination of parameters. Beside the optimisation of traditional biomechanical responses, the multiple objectives can be the minimisation of weight and cost as well as optimal control of passenger kinematics. The present study will hopefully create a basis for future research and possibly for the design of seat integrated safety belts. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E

40|$|Aluminium is a {{material}} commonly used for smaller boats and high speed crafts {{due to its}} low weight. Traditionally the hull construction is performed {{in a similar manner}} as that of steel ships, with longitudinal stiffeners fitted through cut-outs in the transverse web frames and welded to the shell plating. This requires much fitting and welding, making the production of hulls a slow and expensive task due to the manual labour needed. An alternative method for construction of aluminium hulls is to extrude panels consisting of both the shell plating and stiffener. These pre-fabricated panels are then welded directly to the transverse frames, thus reducing the manual labour related to hull production significantly. This thesis continues the work previously performed by Jon Englund on floating panels. He found that the stresses will increase significantly in a floating frame structure compared to that of a traditional, fixed structure. It was discovered that the main challenge of a floating frame structure is out-of-plane bending stresses occurring in the stiffeners webs due to <b>frame</b> <b>deflections.</b> By use of finite element analyses and analytical calculations, a compartment of the JumboCat 60 is analysed, and proposals for achieving acceptable stresses are given. The stiffener stresses mentioned above are found to be drastically reduced by increasing the bending- and axial stiffness of the transverse web frames. Local stress concentrations are found in the intersection between stiffener and web frame. Nonlinear finite element analyses show that substantial strain-hardening can be achieved in the stiffeners webs through cyclic loading. The loss of strength due to welding may thus be partly recovered. </p...|$|R

Increased diaphragm flexibility changes the demands on the whole structure. That is, it increases the structural period, and this affects the forces entering the structures thereby changing the force demands and displacements of the elements. It changes the distribution of forces between the vertical lateral force-resisting elements.

40|$|Abstract — In the {{building}} construction, framed structures are frequently used due to ease of construction and rapid progress of work. Masonry infill panels {{have been widely}} used as interior and exterior partition walls for aesthetic reasons and functional needs. When infill walls are omitted in a particular storey, a soft storey is formed compared to much stiffer other stories. The masonry infill has been modeled by equivalent struts. Normally in structural analysis it is considered that the Equivalent Static Analysis is more conservative against ground shaking for regular structures or structures of smaller height. In this paper the behavior of reinforced concrete (R. C.) frames with brick masonry infill for various parametric changes have been studied to observe their influences in deformation patterns of the frame. The present study is also aimed at findings out the effect of soft storey on frame structures due to horizontal loading. In both cases of wind and earthquake loads, if number of bay increases, then the deflection eventually decreases. As the story level of a building <b>frame</b> increases, <b>deflection</b> due to lateral loads naturally increases due to additional lateral loads. Deflection increases linearly if the span of bay increases linearly because of linearly increased loads. Deflection for a soft storey building frame is 1. 4 to 2. 0 times greater than that observed excluding the soft storey effect. Deflection for R. C. frames with 5 inch wall thickness is observed 10 to 20 % higher than that for frames with 10 inch wall thickness. As the beam and column size increases, deflection pattern decreases with increased stiffness. Two different theories for modeling the equivalent struts (Mainstone and Saneinejad theory) have used in this work and these two different theories of Equivalent Strut Method have little bearing on the variations of results...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis is to produce a direct method to design structures subject to deflection constraints at the working loads. The work carried out {{can be divided into}} four main parts. In the first part, a direct design procedure for plane steel frames subjected to sway limitations is proposed. The stiffness equations are modified so that the sway in each storey is equal to some specified values. The modified equations are then solved by iteration to calculate the cross-sectional properties of the columns {{as well as the other}} joint displacements. The beam sections are selected initially and then altered in an effort to reduce the total material cost of the frame. A linear extrapolation technique is used to reduce this cost. In this design, stability functions are used so that the effect of axial loads in the members are taken into consideration. The final reduced cost design is checked for strength requirements and the members are altered accordingly. In the second part, the design method is applied to the design of reinforced concrete frames in which the sway in the columns play an active part in the design criteria. The second moment of area of each column is obtained by solving the modified stiffness equations and then used to calculate the mlnlmum column depth required. Again the frame has to be checked for all the ultimate limit state load cases. In the third part, the method is generalised to design pin-jointed space <b>frames</b> for <b>deflection</b> limitatlions. In these the member areas are calculated so that the deflection at a specified joint is equal to its specified value. In the final part, the Lagrange multiplier technique is employed to obtain an optimum design for plane rigidly jointed steel frames.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a new technique}} for studying the non-linear behaviour of reinforced concrete frames with flexible joints. The method {{is based on the}} concept of establishing an equilibrium deflected shape of a structure. The computations involve two basic levels of iteration. First, starting with an assumed nodal deformation, equilibrium deflected shapes and end forces of individual members in a structure are calculated using moment-thrust-curvature relations. The out of balance forces are computed by considering equilibrium of member forces at nodal points. In the second level of iteration based on a numerically computed nonlinear stiffness matrix, the nodal deformation are updated until the out of balance forces are negligible. The interaction of torsion with flexure has been assumed to be independent and further, the members are assumed to behave linearly in torsion. The influence of floors and cladding is ignored and only the skeleton frame is considered in the analysis. The associated computer program SWANSA based on the above method {{can be used as a}} design tool for sway and nonsway concrete frames with or without flexible joints. An interactive data entry facility allows the user to enter data by answering simple questions or by returning default values. Full scale experiments were carried out on eight column beam subframes to validate the computer program. Each subframe consisted of a two storey column with a short length of a typical mid-storey beam. Four types of connection commonly used in precast construction were selected to connect the beam to the column at mid height. Two sets of subframes were made for each connection, one each of a pair of subframes was tested for upward and downward rotations. The numerical technique is further validated with results published in literature, including experiments and the finite element method. All the comparisons show that the analysis developed in this thesis can be used to predict the behaviour of precast and other reinforced concrete <b>frames</b> for <b>deflections,</b> strains and for the ultimate loads. Finally, it is shown how a computer program based on the new numerical method can be used as an alternative method of designing rigid jointed or semi-rigid jointed precast concrete 3 -dimensional frames, taking into account material and geometrical nonlinearities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{peculiar}} {{motion of}} an observer {{with respect to}} the CMB rest <b>frame</b> induces a <b>deflection</b> in the arrival direction of the observed photons (also known as CMB aberration) and a Doppler shift in the measured photon frequencies. As a consequence, aberration and Doppler effects induce non trivial correlations between the harmonic coefficients of the observed CMB temperature maps. In this paper we investigate whether these correlations generate a bias on Non-Gaussianity estimators fNL. We perform this analysis simulating a large number of temperature maps with Planck-like resolution (lmax = 2000) as different realizations of the same cosmological fiducial model (WMAP 7 yr). We then add to these maps aberration and Doppler effects employing {{a modified version of the}} HEALPix code. We finally evaluate a generalization of the Komatsu, Spergel and Wandelt Non-Gaussianity estimator for all the simulated maps, both when peculiar velocity effects have been considered and when these phenomena have been neglected. Using the value v/c = 1. 23 × 10 − 3 for our peculiar velocity, we found that the aberration/Doppler induced Non-Gaussian signal is at most of about half of the cosmic variance σ for fNL both in a full-sky and in a cut-sky experimental configuration, for local, equilateral and orthogonal estimators. We conclude therefore that when estimating fNL it is safe to ignore aberration and Doppler effects if the primordial map is already Gaussian. More work is necessary however to assess whether a map which contains Non-Gaussianity can be significantly distorted by a peculiar velocity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} six full-scale laboratory tests conducted on cold-formed steel portal frame buildings in order to investigate the effects of joint flexibility and stressed skin diaphragm action. The frames used for the laboratory tests were of 6 m span, 3 m height, 10 ° pitch and the frame spacing was 3. m. Vertical loading was applied in two tests, and horizontal loading was applied in another four tests. The laboratory test set-up represented a building having two gable frames and two internal frames. Tests were conducted on frames having two joint types, both with and without roof sheeting. It was shown {{that as a result}} of stressed skin action, the internal frame with roof sheeting resisted approximately three times more horizontal load than the bare <b>frame</b> and the <b>deflection</b> of the internal frame was reduced by 90 % relative to the bare frame. When the difference in loads between 2 D (bare frame model) and 3 D (stressed skin model) were considered, it was shown that the joint flexibility of the frame has a significant effect on the load transfer between frames through the roof sheeting. It was found that the 'true' loads transferred to the gable frames are between three and seven times higher than the loads deriving from tributary area. By using stressed skin analysis, it is possible to assess the shear force in the roof sheeting so that damage to the fixings is prevented and a more economical design is possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{peculiar}} {{motion of}} an observer {{with respect to}} the CMB rest <b>frame</b> induces a <b>deflection</b> in the arrival direction of the observed photons (also known as CMB aberration) and a Doppler shift in the measured photon frequencies. As a consequence, aberration and Doppler effects induce non trivial correlations between the harmonic coefficients of the observed CMB temperature maps. In this paper we investigate whether these correlations generate a bias on Non-Gaussianity estimators f_NL. We perform this analysis simulating a large number of temperature maps with Planck-like resolution (lmax = 2000) as different realizations of the same cosmological fiducial model (WMAP 7 yr). We then add to these maps aberration and Doppler effects employing {{a modified version of the}} HEALPix code. We finally evaluate a generalization of the Komatsu, Spergel and Wandelt Non-Gaussianity estimator for all the simulated maps, both when peculiar velocity effects have been considered and when these phenomena have been neglected. Using the value v/c= 1. 23 × 10 ^- 3 for our peculiar velocity, we found that the aberration/Doppler induced Non-Gaussian signal is at most of about half of the cosmic variance σ for f_NL both in a full-sky and in a cut-sky experimental configuration, for local, equilateral and orthogonal estimators. We conclude therefore that when estimating f_NL it is safe to ignore aberration and Doppler effects if the primordial map is already Gaussian. More work is necessary however to assess whether a map which contains Non-Gaussianity can be significantly distorted by a peculiar velocity. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceSutton F. StephensCold‐formed steel {{has become}} a {{preferred}} building material for wall framing in {{many different types of}} structures. One of its main uses has been as non‐structural members in curtain wall assemblies of structural steel framed buildings. In an exterior wall application, the main purpose of the curtain wall is to transfer out of plane loads to the steel frame while not supporting any superimposed gravity loads. Therefore, when the curtain wall is in the plane of the structural steel <b>frame,</b> the vertical <b>deflection</b> of the spandrel beam directly above the wall must be known to provide the appropriate deflection gap between the beam and the curtain wall so that gravity loads are not transferred to the wall. Common practice is to size the gap for the deflection from 100 % of the live load. In some cases, the deflection gap may be significant, and since this gap must also be provided in the exterior cladding of the wall, it creates a design issue for the architect. This report presents the results of an investigation into the feasibility of reducing the size of the deflection gap when the wall is located directly under the spandrel beam. In this study, analytical models were developed for common design situations of curtain walls constructed of cold‐formed steel studs in structural steel framed buildings. This study investigates two common stud heights combined with different floor live loads. Taking into account that wall studs have some available axial compressive strength, a procedure was developed to determine an appropriate reduction for the gap. Using an iterative process a relationship is made between the axial compressive strength of the stud and the amount of axial load the stud can support to establish a factor which gives the percentage the live load gap for 100 % live load can be safely reduced by...|$|R
40|$|The Adaptive Paddling Program at California Polytechnic State University has {{sponsored}} {{the construction of}} an adaptive kayak seat, the Tide Rider 360, to provide paddlers with disabilities sufficient trunk support while out on the water. In particular, this design focused on providing the least restrictive environment for all users while still providing sufficient lateral, neck, back, and hip support. This seat is intended for use in the quarterly Adaptive Paddling Program to allow people with disabilities to experience the joys of kayaking in the most comfortable and supportive environment possible. The following report details the background research, design development, manufacturing, and testing processes that went into designing this seat. It provides in-depth breakdowns on aspects such as the concept generation and material selection methods in order to prove that this kayak seat meets the requirements of the Adaptive Paddling Program. In particular, this seat was designed for use in marine environments with maximum levels of adjustability, support, and comfort. It was designed to fit to all different types of people in terms of weight, disability, and paddling ability. This kayak seat was manufactured out of aluminum tubing and joints, high density polyethylene sheets, and polyethylene foam. In addition to these materials, we added pre-manufactured wheelchair support components for the lateral supports, headrest, hip supports, and seat base. The total cost for the manufacturing of this prototype came out to be approximately $ 2100 and the final weight was just around 30 pounds. We conducted multiple levels of testing on the kayak seat, including a load test and in-pool assessment. Our load testing proved that the aluminum seat <b>frame</b> experiences minimal <b>deflection</b> and bending when subjected to a constant weight {{for an extended period of}} time. The in-pool testing verified that the seat is able to support a paddler while still allowing them a wide range of motion, if so desired. The prototype as is does have a few shortcomings, such as some hard to reach adjustment bolts, but the Adaptive Paddling Program still feels confident in the ability of this seat and the fulfillment of the preset requirements. We believe that with a few slight modifications to the seat back angle and some additional reach of the supports, this product would be able to change the lives of the participants in the Adaptive Paddling Program...|$|R
