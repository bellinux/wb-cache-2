25|$|In linear algebra, {{an inner}} product space is a vector space with an {{additional}} structure called an inner product. This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the space with a scalar quantity known as the inner product of the vectors. <b>Inner</b> <b>products</b> allow the rigorous introduction of intuitive geometrical notions such as {{the length of a}} vector or the angle between two vectors. They also provide the means of defining orthogonality between vectors (zero inner product). Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean spaces (in which the inner product is the dot product, also known as the scalar product) to vector spaces of any (possibly infinite) dimension, and are studied in functional analysis.|$|E
