The article includes elements of optimization of machine structure and relevant directions aimed to improve the working qualities and constructive behavior of tractor aggregate and MATINA machine. The multifunctional aggregate for soil working in agricultural holdings, which this paper analyzes, calls the attention on preserving agriculture system, which ensures competitive productions, similar in terms of quantity and quality to those obtained through classical system, but with diminished costs and high rate of return, by improving, at the same time, soil features and environement protection. By a single passage, the multifunctional soil working aggregate MATINA performs: deep soil loosening (25 รท 30 cm), <b>germinating</b> <b>bed</b> preparation (12 รท 15 cm) and additional soil chopping and levelling...|$|E

Smoke, coming from an oasting fireplace (via smoke channels) is {{then used to}} heat the wooden floor and the sprouted grains. The temperature is usually around [...] A typical floor maltings is a long, single-storey building with a floor that slopes slightly {{from one end of}} the building to the other. Floor maltings began to be phased out in the 1940s in favour of [...] "pneumatic plants". Here, large industrial fans are used to blow air through the <b>germinating</b> grain <b>beds</b> and to pass hot air through the malt being kilned. Like floor maltings, these pneumatic plants are batch processes, but of considerably greater size, typically 100 ton batches compared with 20 ton batches for floor malting.|$|R

In response, in October 2014, the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority (PNG-FA) undertook a three-day training {{program in the}} township of Goroka. Farmers received training in nursery techniques including seed collection, preparing nursery <b>beds,</b> <b>germinating</b> seedlings and out-planting seedlings. Farmers were supplied with seed, shade-cloth and polybags {{to start their own}} home nurseries. Follow-up interviews found that nine of thirteen participants had raised seedlings. However, for those farmers living outside of the Goroka environs, problems have emerged. A severe shortage of seed has resulted in farmers using inappropriate Pinus species. In PNG, land is often community-owned but managed by individual farmers. Long-term tenure is therefore subject to negotiation between clan members. Technology sharing is also not common between clans. In the grasslands, fire is always a problem. These findings indicate a need for an approach to forest extension which accommodates a low rate of technology diffusion between clans and in which farmers in remote locations receive almost one-to-one follow-up extension assistance and access to seed, and guidance to inter-crop planting patterns which provide protection from fire...|$|R
