5|$|Metallic {{scandium}} {{was produced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 by electrolysis of a <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides, at 700–800°C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Silver also forms alloys {{with most}} other {{elements}} on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with {{silver in the}} condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry {{comes from the fact}} that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we are {{interested}} in the eutectic processing of chloride compounds and decided to focus on ammonium based compounds that can provide sufficient insight in the fundamental chemistry. 10 types of ammonium based chloride compounds namely ammonium chloride, methanaminium chloride, dimethylammonium chloride, trimethylammonium chloride, tetramethylammonium chloride, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride, phenyltrimethylammonium chloride, benzyltrimethylammonium chloride and (vinylbenzyl) trimethylammonium chloride were used in this study. This research led to a hypothesis that the ammonium based chloride compounds could be reacted with urea through complexation reaction giving <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures.</b> However, functional groups have plays an important role to influence melting points of these <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures.</b> This is regarded to be a motivating finding that will be important for the most future research work involving complexation reaction for the production of <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form many {{intermetallic}} compounds {{with each other}} and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries, such as the sodium amalgams with mercury, including Na5Hg8 and Na3Hg. Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with gold, the most electronegative of metals, as an example, NaAu and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and CsAu are semiconductors. NaK is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature, although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air. The <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> melts at −12.6°C. An alloy of 41% caesium, 47% sodium, and 12% potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy, −78°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (<b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
25|$|Molten salt {{reactors}} (MSRs) {{are cooled}} by circulating a molten salt, typically a <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> of fluoride salts, such as FLiBe. In a typical MSR, the coolant {{is also used}} as a matrix in which the fissile material is dissolved.|$|E
50|$|In <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> the solidus and {{liquidus}} temperatures coincide {{at a point}} {{known as}} the eutectic point. At the eutectic point, the solid congruently melts (i.e., melts completely).|$|R
30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{theoretical}} mass ratios of CA–MA–PA ternary <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> calculated from Eq. (1) (as discussed below), a series of ternary <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> were prepared by heating CA–MA–PA (64.8 : 22.6 : 12.6) with different CA, MA, and PA contents at a constant temperature of 70  °C, then stirring at 1200  rpm with a magnetic stirrer (2 MHL, REMI) to ensure the homogeneity of the mixtures, and slowly cooling to room temperature. The optimum mass ratio of CA–MA–PA to xG-F or xG-A for preparation of CA–MA–PA/xG was 95 : 5 and obtained under assistance of high speed ultrasonication.|$|R
40|$|Formic acid is a {{promising}} compound {{with regard to}} hydrogen storage and generation, {{as it can be}} formed via the hydrogenation of CO 2 and decomposed to form H 2 and CO 2. The electrochemistry of formic acid, aqueous solutions of ammonium formate, and ammonium formate/formic acid <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> (1. 0 : 1. 25 mol/mol, respectively) have been investigated.

25|$|In aqueous {{solutions}} {{hydrogen peroxide}} {{differs from the}} pure material due {{to the effects of}} hydrogen bonding between water and hydrogen peroxide molecules. Hydrogen peroxide and water form a <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture,</b> exhibiting freezing-point depression; pure water has a melting point of 0°C and pure hydrogen peroxide of −0.43°C. The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points (125.1°C). It occurs at 114°C. This boiling point is 14°C greater than that of pure water and 36.2°C less than that of pure hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
25|$|Using lead as {{the liquid}} metal {{provides}} excellent radiation shielding, {{and allows for}} operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a lead-bismuth <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture.</b> In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it {{is not quite as}} transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian Alfa class submarine uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.|$|E
500|$|In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic table, which had empty spaces for elements directly above and under yttrium. Mendeleev made several predictions {{on the upper}} neighbor of yttrium, which he called eka-boron. [...] Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team discovered the missing element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite and prepared 2grams of scandium(III) oxide of high purity. He named it scandium, from the Latin Scandia meaning [...] "Scandinavia". Chemical experiments on the element proved that Mendeleev's suggestions were correct; along with discovery and characterization of gallium and germanium this proved the correctness of the whole periodic table and periodic law. Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev. Metallic scandium was produced {{for the first time}} in 1937 by electrolysis of a <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture,</b> at 700–800°C, of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides.|$|E
25|$|Reactor salts {{are usually}} close to <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{to reduce their}} melting point. A low melting point {{simplifies}} melting the salt at startup and {{reduces the risk of}} the salt freezing as it is cooled in the heat exchanger.|$|R
30|$|The key to {{producing}} less toxic DESs may {{reside in the}} use of materials of natural origin. Recently, Choi et al. (2011) revealed that a number of primary metabolic substances (e.g. sugars, amino acids, choline, and some organic acids) form intracellular <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> to assist plants during specific developmental stages (germination, cryopreservation). These eutectics provide cells with a third type of solvent/media, completely different from lipids and water. The presence of these eutectic mixtures—termed natural deep <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> (NADESs)—intracellularly, entails their cellular tolerance and presume safer cytotoxic profiles. Recent studies have provided a list of the composition of these mixtures as well as their molar ratios (Choi et al. 2011; Dai et al. 2013).|$|R

500|$|Titan {{is likely}} {{differentiated}} into several layers with a [...] rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystalline forms of ice. Its interior {{may still be}} hot enough for a liquid layer consisting of a [...] "magma" [...] composed of water and ammonia between the ice Ih crust and deeper ice layers made of high-pressure forms of ice. The presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as [...] (for <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> with water). [...] The Cassini probe discovered the evidence for the layered structure {{in the form of}} natural extremely-low-frequency radio waves in Titan's atmosphere. Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of extremely-low-frequency radio waves, so they may instead be reflecting off the liquid–ice boundary of a subsurface ocean. Surface features were observed by the Cassini spacecraft to systematically shift by up to [...] between October 2005 and May 2007, which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior, and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer. [...] Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the solid core comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn. Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR-based topography observations also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid.|$|E

40|$|Three {{solution}} models: ideal, regular, and quasi- regular, {{were used}} to predict the melting point of <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> containing Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 400 and PEG 4000 with nine poorly water- soluble drugs: 1 -naphthoic acid, estrone, griseofulvin, indomethacin, phenobarbital, paracetamol, salicylic acid, salicylamide and naproxen. PEG 400 was physically mixed with drug at different weight percentages to determine the melting points of the pure drugs and the melting point depression using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The PEG 4000 <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> were processed by the solvent evaporation method. In both the PEG 400 and PEG 4000 study, the quasi-regular solution model accounted for the most realistic conditions of entropy and enthalpy of the mixtures compared to ideal and regular solution models...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{preparation}} and performance analysis {{of a series of}} form-stable phase change materials (FSPCMs), based on <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> as phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) -ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) polymer as supporting materials. The PCMs were <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> of tetradecanol (TD) –capric acid (CA), TD–lauric acid (LA), and TD–myristic acid (MA), which were rarely explored before. Thermal properties of <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixtures</b> and FSPCMs were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The onset melting/solidification temperatures of form-stable PCMs were 19. 13 °C/ 13. 32 °C (FS TD–CA PCM), 24. 53 °C/ 24. 92 °C (FS TD–LA PCM), and 33. 15 °C/ 30. 72 °C (FS TD–MA PCM), respectively, and latent heats were almost greater than 90 J/g. The surface morphologies and chemical stability of form-stable PCM were surveyed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, respectively. The thermal cycling test revealed that the thermal reliability of these three form-stable PCMs was good. Thermal storage/release experiment indicated melting/solidification time was shortened by introducing 10 wt % aluminum powder (AP). It is concluded that these FSPCMs can act as potential building thermal storage materials in terms of their satisfactory thermal properties...|$|R

2500|$|The {{properties}} of silicon {{can be used}} to modify alloys with metals other than iron. [...] "Metallurgical grade" [...] silicon is silicon of 95–99% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys (silumin alloys) for aluminium part casts, mainly for use in the automotive industry. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a <b>eutectic</b> <b>mixture</b> which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.|$|E
