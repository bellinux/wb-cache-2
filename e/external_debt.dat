5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which are also a form of <b>external</b> <b>debt).</b> Households also took on {{a large amount of}} debt, equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} <b>external</b> <b>debts</b> on economic growth in Malaysia. The analysis is conducted both at aggregate and disaggregate levels. The empirical results are based on VAR estimates using GDP, <b>external</b> <b>debts,</b> capital accumulation, labor force and human capital. Estimation results at the aggregate level indicate that total <b>external</b> <b>debts</b> affect economic growth positively. In particular, one percentage point increase in total <b>external</b> <b>debts</b> generates 1. 29 percentage point of {{economic growth in the}} long term. Meanwhile, the positive effects of project loan has been detected at the disaggregate level. However, market loan has not shown any significant effect on economic growth.

The estimation results indicate that the full effects of the public and private <b>external</b> <b>debts</b> on GNP are small and of an opposite sign, whereas an increase in the GNP level raises substantially the public and private <b>external</b> <b>debts.</b> These findings support Bulow-Rogoff’s proposition that the <b>external</b> <b>debts</b> of developing countries are not a primary cause of economic slowdown. * Amnon Levy is an Associate Professor and Khorshed Chowdhury is a lecturer at the Department o...|$|R

5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. <b>External</b> <b>debt</b> increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with influence of the <b>external</b> public <b>debt</b> of Ukraine on the country’s basic macroeconomic indicators. An analysis was carried out using the impulse response of the specified indicators and the <b>external</b> public <b>debt</b> {{on the basis of}} building the vector autoregressive models (VAR). A comparison of the results obtained with the results of the computer simulations of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of effect of the <b>external</b> public <b>debt</b> has been done. It has been determined that a positive shock of the <b>external</b> public <b>debt</b> can affect the growth of public expenditures. It has been proven that the most significant is the interference of the <b>external</b> public <b>debt,</b> volume of foreign investment, and the total consumption expenditures. However, interdependence between the <b>external</b> public <b>debt,</b> inflation and the rate of the national currency is insignificant. This is confirmed by the real trends in the Ukrainian economy in recent years, when both the significant inflation and the devaluation of the national currency in any way do not reduce demand of the State on external borrowings. These results correspond with the findings obtained on the basis of building a dynamical stochastic general equilibrium model...|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's <b>external</b> <b>debt</b> was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E
