5|$|Charlton was an {{immediate}} success with Andrew Fisher and was promoted to the temporary chairmanship of committees in the House in 1913, however Charlton threatened to resign in 1915 over a dispute in government delays in granting the committee increased powers. Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his loyalty to the new Labor leader Billy Hughes by voting for Hughes' conscription referendum bill, {{even though he was}} vehemently opposed to conscription and fought <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> it. However, Charlton seemed to accept the affirmative result of the referendum and again proved his loyalty to Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism. Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the war, Fort Bayard came under attack only once. During the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864, Confederate general Jubal Early {{launched}} a 25,000-man raid into Maryland with the hope of drawing off some of General Ulysses S. Grant's troops, who were pressing <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> the Army of Northern Virginia in the Siege of Petersburg. The raid hoped to attack Washington, thereby distracting Grant and potentially allowing the Confederate forces time to rest and regroup. On the morning of July 11, Confederate cavalry and infantry under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland advanced towards Washington with the goal of capturing Fort Reno, which defended the village of Tenleytown. Though they drove back the skirmish line in front of Fort Bayard, the Confederate cavalry were met with a heavy barrage of cannon fire from Bayard and its supporting forts. Discouraged by the resistance, McCausland's brigade moved to join up with the rest of Early's force, which was grouping for an assault on Fort Stevens.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, {{most of the}} American {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into areas that were not studded with Rommelspargel. Some flights, however, came up <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> the defense. Accompanying the 82nd Airborne Division, Tito Moruza landed on D-Day with orders to don civilian clothing and make his way to Paris to seize Gestapo papers. His glider hit a wooden pole defense which tore into the three soldiers sitting next to him, mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted during delivery of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E

5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} {{the wreck of the}} Oberon and Leo runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
5|$|The French {{fell back}} c. 3km and {{attempted}} to regroup to hold the village of San Giuliano. With the French outnumbered and driven from their best defensive position, the battle {{was as good as}} won by the Austrians. Melas, who was slightly wounded, and 71, handed over command to his chief-of-staff, General Anton von Zach, and Kaim. The Austrian centre formed into a massive pursuit column in order to chase the French off the battlefield, with the advance guard commanded by GM Franz Xaver Saint-Julien. The column formed up around Spinetta, southeast of Marengo, and advanced down the New Road. However, delays in the flanks led to the Austrian army forming a crescent shape with a thinly stretched central sector. On the Austrian right wing, O'Reilly wasted time hunting down a 300-man French detachment led by Achille Dampierre (which was finally captured) and moved southeast. This took his troops out of supporting distance from the Austrian main body. On the Austrian left, Ott hesitated to press <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> the French because GdB Jean Rivaud's small brigade of French cavalry hovered to the north.|$|E

25|$|The plan {{involved}} {{using the}} series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In southern Finland, armies were to isolate the fortifications and first {{take control of the}} whole of southern Finland before advancing further to the north. Forces in Savolax were to press <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> the Swedes and reach the Gulf of Bothnia towards Uleåborg and Vasa to cut off the retreat of {{the main body of the}} Swedish army.|$|E
25|$|Attlee's Health Minister, Aneurin Bevan, fought <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> {{the general}} disapproval {{of the medical}} establishment, {{including}} the British Medical Association, by creating the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. This was a publicly funded healthcare system, which offered treatment free of charge for all {{at the point of}} use. Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8½million dental patients and dispensed more than 5million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1817 Morillo {{launched}} the assault, which began at eight thirty in the morning. The struggle was fierce, with the Spanish pressing <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> the defensive front. In his later {{report on the}} battle, Morillo paid tribute to the stubborn courage of the republicans, who repelled repeated cavalry charges. During {{the course of the}} fighting, many unarmed men and women from the town joined the defenders, taking up the arms of those who had been killed or wounded. General Esteban Gómez himself was hit by bullets several times, and his horse was killed under him.|$|E

25|$|The {{murder of}} Severus Alexander by his {{soldiers}} {{and its aftermath}} which resulted in disturbances in Rome, motivated Ardashir to attack Rome again. In about the years 237-238, Ardashir took Nusaybin and Harran and attacked the city Dura; then he marched toward Hatra, which was a commercial city {{and the center of}} the traffic of commercial caravans. Hatra stood <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> the Persian siege and did not fall until April or September 240; it seems that Hatra was chosen as a point for pushing and operation against Roman Mesopotamia. The fall of Hatra might have been the cause of Gordian III's wars with Persia.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the statute}} was badly worded: to {{circumnavigate}} the laws, the salesmen simply fixed posts into the ground, creating market stalls similar in design to their modern counterparts. The stalls were covered for use and left uncovered in situ {{when not in}} use, thus both abiding by the law and designating a permanent venue for their sales. The people using these facilities fought <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> {{the power of the}} richer businessmen and successfully defended the right of the marketeers to operate alongside them. The location of the Market Place remains virtually unchanged to this day and still houses a bustling market on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.|$|E
25|$|On France's {{northeast}} frontier in March 1794 the Army of the North fielded 126,035 {{troops or}} 194,930 {{if all the}} garrisons were added. The subordinate Army of the Ardennes numbered only 6,757 soldiers ready for action but 32,773 men when all its garrisons were counted. The combined total was 227,703 men, far too large a number for any one general to manage at that time. Against these, the Coalition fielded 150,000 troops to defend the Austrian Netherlands and the Dutch Republic and 20,000 more to hold Luxembourg. The Coalition plan was to press <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> the French defenses and perhaps open the way to Paris.|$|E

25|$|Peace with England and France {{implied that}} Spain could focus her {{energies}} on restoring her rule to the Dutch provinces. The Dutch, led by Maurice of Nassau, {{the son of}} William the Silent had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of Breda. Following the peace with England, the new Spanish commander Ambrosio Spinola pressed <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> the Dutch. Spinola, a general of abilities to match Maurice, was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain's renewed bankruptcy in 1607. Fortunately, Spanish forces had regained enough of the military initiative to convince a politically divided United Provinces to sign a truce in 1609.|$|E
25|$|From 1806 to 1815 Cosenza fought <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> French domination. Cruel suppressions characterised {{that period}} and in 1813 the town, a cradle of the Carbonari secret societies, saw many rebels executed. The local riots of 1821 and 1837 heralded the Risorgimento. They were {{followed}} by the uprising of 15 March 1844, which reached its climax with the “noble folly” of the Bandiera Brothers, who were executed together with some of their followers in the Vallone di Rovito in Cosenza. In 1860, some months after the rapid and overwhelmingly heroic deeds of Garibaldi’s troops, a plebiscite proclaimed the annexation of Calabria to the new Kingdom of Italy.|$|E

A further force also joined the fray, with the Fifteenth Air Force and No. 205 Group RAF beginning to fly from Italy. During early 1944, the emphasis began to change. As the invasion of France drew closer, the independent role of the bomber forces was considerably reduced, and eventually were placed under the direction of General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Harris and his American counterparts fought <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> being placed under Eisenhower, but they eventually lost.|$|E
