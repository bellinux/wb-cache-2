5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States in 1925, he first took an extensive course in advanced aviation tactics with the U.S. Army Air Service at Kelly Field, Texas, and then attended the Company Officers' Course at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. He graduated with the highest grades ever attained by any student up to that time. For physical reasons, however, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his flying status in 1927 and continue {{his career as a}} ground officer. He was then assigned to duty as Ordnance Officer at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up.|$|E

During the stage in the Alps, Émile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification. Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead. In the seventh stage, Marcel Cadolle, {{at that time in}} second place, fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up.|$|E

5|$|Horsfield {{made his}} second debut for Halifax in October 1996. On {{the last day}} of the 1996–97 season, needing to beat Stevenage Borough to avoid relegation from the Conference, Horsfield scored the goal that {{clinched}} a 4–2 victory. The following season, Halifax won the Conference title by a nine-point margin, thus regaining their Football League status. Horsfield's 30 goals in 40 league games, including hat-tricks against Yeovil Town, Telford United and Hereford United, made him that season's Conference top scorer. Together with team-mate Mark Bradshaw, Horsfield was selected for England's semi-professional representative team for a match against their Dutch counterparts, but injury prevented him from playing. In the Conference, Horsfield had still been working in the building trade while playing football part-time, but promotion to the Football League meant <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his job to become a full-time footballer. Seven goals in his first ten games in the Third Division attracted a bid from Fulham, then in the Second Division and managed by Kevin Keegan.|$|E
5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944 the Luftwaffe {{initiated}} Operation Steinbock. Cunningham filed two claims {{during the}} offensive which lasted until May 1944. On {{the night of}} the 20/21 February 1944 he claimed Junkers Ju 188 damaged at 22:09 near Staplehurst. One Ju 188 was lost and its destruction was attributed to another pilot. On {{the night of the}} 23/24 February he claimed a probable victory against another Ju 188 off Beachy Head. One Ju 188E-1 landed at Coulommiers after surviving an attack by a night fighter. Werknummer 260222, code U5+AN from 5./KG 2 returned with two crewmen injured—Unteroffizier Johann Triebel and Wihelm Spönemann. During these missions Cunningham was nearly shot down. Closing in on a Ju 188 from astern, the gunners suddenly opened fire and the Junkers took evasive manoeuvres. A single round struck the windshield nearly shattering it. Glass fragments struck Cunningham in the face which were later removed in a field hospital. Later, a captured German crew told intelligence officers a new radar was being used in the rear of German aircraft to detect night fighters. Bombers were now more difficult to surprise. Cunningham's last encounter with the enemy in 1944 was in pursuit of an Me 410. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up when his windshield iced over near the French coast.|$|E

Having qualified as a doctor in November 1879, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> priority to his new practice in Bristol for the next five years. As a result, his cricket sometimes had to be set aside. He had other troubles including a serious bout of mumps in 1882.

25|$|In 1616, the 22-year-old Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden {{started looking}} around for a Protestant bride.

He received reports with the most flattering descriptions of the physical and mental qualities of the beautiful 17-year-old princess Maria Eleonora. Elector John Sigismund was favorably inclined towards the Swedish king, but he had become very infirm after an apoplexic stroke in the autumn of 1617. His determined Prussian wife showed a strong dislike for this Swedish suitor, because Prussia was a Polish fief and the Polish King Sigismund III Vasa still resented his loss of Sweden to Gustavus Adolphus' father Charles IX.|$|E
25|$|The Code only allows claims {{substantiated}} by documents, or in {{some cases}} the oath of witnesses. Saving contracts and receipts thus assumed a vital importance in Babylon - in fact it could literally be a matter of life or death. A buyer had to be sure of the seller's title. If he bought (or received on deposit) property from even a minor or a slave without witnessing contracts, he would be executed as a thief (§7). If purchased goods were stolen and the rightful owner reclaimed them, he had to prove his purchase by producing the seller and the deed of sale, or witnesses to it; otherwise, he would be adjudged a thief and die. If he proved his purchase, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the property but could pursue a remedy against the seller or, if the seller had died, could reclaim fivefold from his estate.|$|E

In 1924, the Left lost control of the PCd’I to a pro-Moscow group whose leader, Gramsci, became the Party's General Secretary in June. At the third Congress of PCd’I, held in exile in Lyons in January 1926, the manoeuvre of the pro-Moscow group was completed; without the support of the International Communist to escape from fascist control, few members of the Left were able to arrive to the Congress, so the 'theses' drawn up by Bordiga were rejected and those of the Stalinist minority group accepted.|$|E
