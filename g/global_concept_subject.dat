40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to comparative environmental politics by integrating comparative analysis with debates about ontological politics and Science and Technology Studies (STS). Comparative environmental analysis makes two tacit assumptions: {{that the subject}} of comparison (e. g. an environmental policy framework) is mobile and can be detached from its contexts; and that studying this subject {{in more than one}} location can identify its diffusion and implementation anywhere. These assumptions are sites of ontological politics by predetermining (or restricting) environmental outcomes. Environmental analysis needs to consider how far its own comparative acts might reify supposedly global frameworks rather than acknowledge how different localities appropriate and give meaning to them in diverse ways. The concept of civic epistemologies illustrates how domestic politics are organized around supposedly <b>global</b> <b>concepts,</b> rather than how <b>global</b> <b>concepts</b> diffuse around the world, as illustrated here by a comparative analysis of the United Nations’ Green Economy Initiative...|$|R

He worked 'deductively' on the <b>global</b> <b>concept</b> first, then consecrated on the perceptive details. Gris referred to this technique as 'synthetic', in contradistinction from the process of 'analysis' intrinsic to his earlier works.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades we have seen an {{enormous}} growth of change concepts available. Availability of these concepts has grown considerably due to the ongoing globalization process. A growing amount of literature has recently been focusing on the processes of the spread of these concepts. We try to take this discussion further by analyzing the implementation of such a <b>global</b> change <b>concept</b> in a Norwegian oil company. The <b>global</b> change <b>concept</b> {{is based on a}} “Business Process Reengineering ” (BPR) implementation of an ERP-system. Our focus is the micro political processes that appear in the process were this <b>global</b> <b>concept</b> meets the local context, the realization of the concept into concrete action. The different perspectives, the different experiences and interests between affected actors cause processes of translations, interpretations, negotiations and constructions of meaning. The result is a complexity of agendas and understandings influencing the change initiatives. Through these discussions we illustrate the mechanisms affecting the implementation process and its unpredictability. ...|$|R
