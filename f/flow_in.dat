A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E

5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high <b>flows</b> <b>in</b> winter, high <b>flows</b> and floods <b>in</b> spring, and low <b>flows</b> <b>in</b> summer and autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation <b>flows</b> <b>in</b> summer and autumn and low <b>flows</b> <b>in</b> winter and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.|$|R

However, the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter, following several concerns from the public, and from state senator Jim Ellis.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Fossil Creek {{is one of}} {{only two}} streams in Arizona {{included}} in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The creek and its riparian corridor provide habitat {{for a wide variety of}} flora and fauna, some listed as endangered or otherwise imperiled.

Since restoration of the stream's natural <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> 2008, an increase in recreational visits has raised concerns about overuse and has led to road closings and other restrictions.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{controlled}} access highways on Hamersley's southern and western boundaries physically isolate the suburb from its neighbours and limit southbound exits to just two, Erindale Road and Wanneroo Road. This results in considerable rush hour congestion on {{the stretch of}} Erindale Road between Eglinton Crescent and Reid Highway. In 2004, Main Roads Western Australia provided a grant of $48,000 to the City of Stirling under its Black Spot Programme to improve the traffic <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> this area.|$|E
