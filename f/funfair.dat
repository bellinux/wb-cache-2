5|$|Details of Evans’ {{early life}} are unknown, {{apart from his}} birth date. No book {{has been written about}} him, {{although}} he wrote his memoirs, Living The Beatles' Legend, from which extracts were released on 20 March 2005. What is known about him starts in 1961, when Evans married a Liverpool girl, Lily, after meeting her at a <b>funfair</b> in New Brighton opposite Liverpool on the Wirral. Their first child, Gary, was born in the same year. The Beatles were the resident group at Liverpool's Cavern Club when Evans first heard them perform during his lunch break. He was then living in Hillside Road, Mossley Hill and working as a telephone engineer for the Post Office. He became a committed fan, even though his musical hero at the time was Elvis Presley.|$|E
5|$|Early on Boxing Day 1964, Hindley {{left her}} {{grandmother}} at a relative's house {{and refused to}} allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night. On the same day, 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey disappeared from a <b>funfair</b> in Ancoats. Despite a huge search, she was not found. The following day, Hindley brought her grandmother back home. By February 1965, Patricia Hodges had stopped visiting 16Wardle Brook Avenue, but David Smith was still a regular visitor. Brady gave Smith books to read, and the two discussed robbery and murder. On Hindley's 23rd birthday, her sister and brother-in-law, who had until then been living with relatives, were rehoused in Underwood Court, a block of flats not far from Wardle Brook Avenue. The two couples began {{to see each other}} more regularly, but usually only on Brady's terms.|$|E
5|$|Many {{visitors}} {{arriving on}} the steamers {{never left the}} pier and Birnbeck Island which between them housed the cafe, pavilion, amusements and <b>funfair.</b> These were destroyed by fire on 26 December 1897 and replaced by the present buildings, although these have been altered over the years. The attractions included Mutoscopes, a shooting gallery, merry-go-round, park swings, a theatre of wonders and a licensed bar. In 1891 a telephone was installed only {{six months after the}} first one was installed in the town. In 1909, the amusement area was expanded by an extension on iron supports along {{the south side of the}} island. However, this was not built to the proper specifications so was demolished in 1912; a larger concrete platform was added in its place in 1932.|$|E

5|$|The {{concert hall}} was {{converted}} into a tea room and the theatre redesigned as a restaurant in the early 1950s. A <b>funfair</b> was added around the same time. By the 1960s, the pier was suffering from serious financial difficulties. In 1965, it was bought by a company that owned some seafront hotels and entertainment venues. They had ambitions for the pier but were unable to cope with increasing maintenance costs. Some portions of wood and iron from the pier fell on the beach, and the pierhead was closed in 1970 due to safety concerns. The pier was Grade II listed in 1969 and the council served compulsory repair notices, but the company was unable to afford them and opted for voluntary liquidation. The remainder of the pier was closed in 1975 when the Brighton Corporation declined to buy it, passing control to the Crown Estate Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|The pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, and was designed to attract tourism in Brighton. It was the town's second pier, joining the Royal Suspension Chain Pier of 1823. It was extended in 1893, and a concert hall was added in 1916. The pier reached its peak attendance during this time, with 2 million visitors between 1918 and 1919. Its popularity began to decline after World War II, and concerts were replaced by a <b>funfair</b> and tearoom. A local company took ownership in 1965, but could not meet the increased maintenance cost, and ultimately filed for bankruptcy. They {{could not find a}} suitable buyer, so the pier closed in 1975 and subsequently fell into disrepair.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{industry}} in Enugu, {{managed by the}} Enugu State Tourism Board (ESTB), is small; however, the state government recognises a variety of historic and recreational sites.

The Polo amusement park is a <b>funfair</b> that is among {{the first generation of}} public parks in the city; other parks in the city include the Murtala Muhammed Park. Enugu's former coal mines, Onyeama and Okpara, are open to public visits.

Other galleries include the Bona Gallery.|$|E
