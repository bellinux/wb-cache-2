25|$|Comparative {{genomics}} approaches {{were used}} to predict the function-relevant variants {{under the assumption that}} the functional <b>genetic</b> <b>locus</b> should be conserved across different species at an extensive phylogenetic distance. On the other hand, some adaptive traits and the population differences are driven by positive selections of advantageous variants, and these genetic mutations are functionally relevant to population specific phenotypes. Functional prediction of variants’ effect in different biological processes is pivotal to pinpoint the molecular mechanism of diseases/traits and direct the experimental validation.|$|E

25|$|The <b>genetic</b> <b>locus</b> most {{significantly}} associated with primary SS is the major histocompatibility complex/human leukocyte antigen (MHC/HLA) region, {{as demonstrated by the}} preliminary results of the first genome-wide association study (GWAS). This GWAS included data from a discovery cohort of 395 patients of European ancestry with primary SS, and 1,975 healthy control individuals, and from a replication study that comprised 1,234 cases and 4,779 healthy controls. Associations with polymorphisms located at six independent loci were also detected; IRF5, STAT4, BLK, IL12A, TNIP1, and CXCR5. This also suggested the activation of the innate immune system, notably through the IFN system, B-cell activation through CXCR5-directed recruitment to lymphoid follicles and B-cell receptor (BCR) activation involving BLK, and T-cell activation owing to HLA susceptibility and the IL-12-IFN-γ-axis.|$|E
500|$|The ruff {{has three}} male forms, which differ in mating {{behaviour}} and in appearance: the typical territorial males {{which have a}} dark neck ruff, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and the very rare cryptic males known as [...] "faeders" [...] which have female-like plumage. [...] The behaviour and appearance of each individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by a simple genetic polymorphism. Territorial behaviour and appearance is recessive to satellite behaviour and appearance, [...] while preliminary research {{results suggest that the}} faeder characteristics are genetically controlled by a single dominant gene. [...] It was originally thought that the difference between territorial and satellite males was due to a sex-linked genetic factor, but in fact the <b>genetic</b> <b>locus</b> relevant for the mating strategy is located on an autosome, or non-sex chromosome. That means that both sexes can carry the two different forms of the gene, not just males. The female does not normally show evidence of its genetic type, but when females are given testosterone implants, they display the male behaviour corresponding to their genotype.|$|E

2500|$|EEC {{can be both}} {{familial}} and sporadic, {{both cases}} relating back to abnormalities of the p63 gene. This means that in some cases, EEC expresses de novo in a child of unaffected parents (sporadic) due to spontaneous mutation, {{in addition to the}} existing autosomal dominant inherited form. There seems to be significant interfamilial and intrafamilial variability in expressivity, more noticeably between rather than within families. Because of this variability, it is possible that {{there is more than one}} <b>genetic</b> <b>locus</b> involved in the actual manifestation of the syndrome in any given person.

50|$|Knockin {{technology}} {{is different from}} knockout technology in that knockout technology aims to either delete part of the DNA sequence or insert irrelevant DNA sequence information to disrupt {{the expression of a}} specific <b>genetic</b> <b>locus.</b> Gene knockin technology, on the other hand, alters the <b>genetic</b> <b>locus</b> of interest via a one-for-one substitution of DNA sequence information or by the addition of sequence information that is not found on said <b>genetic</b> <b>locus.</b> A gene knockin therefore {{can be seen as a}} gain of function mutation and a gene knockout a loss of function mutation, but a gene knockin may also involve the substitution of a functional gene locus for a mutant phenotype that results in some loss of function.|$|E

Also, GWAS have identified 35 <b>genetic</b> <b>loci</b> related to blood pressure; 12 of these <b>genetic</b> <b>loci</b> influencing blood pressure were newly found. Sentinel SNP for each new <b>genetic</b> <b>loci</b> identified has shown an association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby Cpg sites. These sentinel SNP are located within genes related to vascular smooth muscle and renal function. DNA methylation might affect in some way linking common genetic variation to multiple phenotypes even though mechanisms underlying these associations are not understood. Single variant test performed in this study for the 35 sentinel SNP (known and new) showed that genetic variants singly or in aggregate contribute to risk of clinical phenotypes related to high blood pressure.|$|R
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} affects {{more than}} 33 million people worldwide {{and increases the}} risk of stroke, heart failure, and death(1, 2). Fourteen <b>genetic</b> <b>loci</b> have been associated with atrial fibrillation in European and Asian ancestry groups(3 - 7). To further define the genetic basis of atrial fibrillation, we performed large-scale, trans-ancestry meta-analyses of common and rare variant association studies. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) included 17, 931 individuals with atrial fibrillation and 115, 142 referents; the exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) involved 22, 346 cases and 132, 086 referents. We identified 12 new <b>genetic</b> <b>loci</b> that exceeded genome-wide significance, implicating genes involved in cardiac electrical and structural remodeling.

50|$|Most {{proteins}} {{that make up}} the archaellum are encoded within one <b>genetic</b> <b>locus.</b> This <b>genetic</b> <b>locus</b> contains 7-13 genes which encode proteins involved in either assembly or function of the archaellum. The <b>genetic</b> <b>locus</b> contains genes encoding archaellins (flaA and flaB) - the structural components of the filament - and core components (flaI, flaJ, flaH). The locus furthermore encodes accessory proteins (FlaG, FlaF, FlaX) and signaling components (FlaC, FlaD, FlaE). Genetic analysis in different archaea revealed that each of these components is essential for assembly of the archaellum. Whereas most of the fla-associated genes are generally found in Euryarchaeota, {{one or more of these}} genes are absent from the fla-operon in Crenarchaeota. The prepilin peptidase (called PibD in crenarchaeota and FlaK in euryarchaeota) is essential for the maturation of the archaellins and is generally encoded elsewhere on the chromosome.|$|E

40|$|As an {{increasing}} number of genome-wide association studies reveal the limitations of attempting to explain phenotypic heritability by single <b>genetic</b> <b>loci,</b> there is growing interest for associating complex phenotypes with sets of <b>genetic</b> <b>loci.</b> While several methods for multi-locus mapping have been proposed, it is often unclear how to relate the detected loci to the growing knowledge about gene pathways and networks. The few methods that take biological pathways or networks into account are either restricted to investigating a limited number of predetermined sets of loci, or do not scale to genome-wide settings. We present SConES, a new efficient method to discover sets of <b>genetic</b> <b>loci</b> that are maximally associated with a phenotype, while being connected in an underlying network. Our approach is based on a minimum cut reformulation of the problem of selecting features under sparsity and connectivity constraints that can be solved exactly and rapidly. SConES outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of runtime, scales to hundreds of thousands of <b>genetic</b> <b>loci,</b> and exhibits higher power in detecting causal SNPs in simulation studies than existing methods. On flowering time phenotypes and genotypes from Arabidopsis thaliana, SConES detects loci that enable accurate phenotype prediction and that are supported by the literature.

Phenotypic analysis revealed that stem lignin content is significantly higher than that in root and the quantified traits can be classified into four distinct groups, with strong correlations observed among components within organs. Altogether, 179 coordinating QTLs were detected, and they were co-localized into 49 <b>genetic</b> <b>loci,</b> 27 of which appear to be pleiotropic.
