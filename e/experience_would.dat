5|$|The three {{infantry}} classes {{may have}} retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, {{but at least}} officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve in the first line, older men with some military <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> serve in the third line.|$|E
5|$|Jason Weaver as Teddy, a {{close friend}} of Rashad's. Weaver {{impressed}} producer Austin in his previous film Drumline enough to get a role in ATL. The director felt that Weaver, the veteran of the young cast, and his <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> be helpful to the other cast members.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{announced}} that he would double-up with the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the Beijing Summer Olympics, and the new 100 m world-record holder was the favourite to win both. Michael Johnson, the 200 m and 400 m record holder, personally backed the sprinter, saying that he did not believe that a lack of <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> work against him. Bolt qualified for the 100 m final with times of 9.92 s and 9.85 s in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Stone {{had many}} {{nautical}} <b>experiences</b> that <b>would</b> shape his creative imagination, {{some of these}} described in his memoir Prime Green, published in 2007. These first-hand <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> at times turn violent: Stone witnessed the French Army bombing Port Said.|$|R
50|$|Pigeonhole the writer, {{with the}} {{diversity}} of genres {{in which he has}} <b>experienced,</b> <b>would</b> eliminate the possibility of creativity.|$|R
60|$|As Mr. Lorry {{received}} these confidences, and as {{he watched}} the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> revive the old danger.|$|R
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|To help {{design the}} next major show, Laliberté and Caron hired Franco Dragone, another {{instructor}} from the National Circus School {{who had been working}} in Belgium. When he joined the troupe in 1985, he brought with him his experience in commedia dell'arte techniques, which he imparted to the performers. Although his <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> be limited in the next show due to budget restraints, he would go on to direct every show up to, but not including Dralion.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
50|$|By {{creating}} {{a framework for}} collaboration between academics and professionals representing two distinct cultures, {{it was hoped that}} the exchange of knowledge, ideas and <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> stimulate “creativity and imagination to set the spark for new visions for sustainable urban development".|$|R

30|$|Results from Experiment 2 reaffirm that {{hands-on}} experiences might {{highlight the}} heaviness {{of objects and}} thus lead to mistaken performance. In {{order to understand the}} seriousness of these effects, we next examined whether the negative influence of hands-on <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> persist over time.|$|R
5|$|Between 1932 and 1933, Burnet took {{leave of}} absence to {{undertake}} a fellowship at the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute {{had been given a}} large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> make Burnet—whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist—better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.|$|E
5|$|Kagame and Rwigyema {{joined the}} NRA {{primarily}} to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote. They {{also had a}} long-term goal of returning with other Tutsi refugees to Rwanda; military <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> enable them to fight the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army. In the NRA, Kagame specialized in intelligence-gathering, and he rose to a position close to Museveni's. The NRA, based in the Luwero Triangle, fought the Ugandan army {{for the next five}} years, even after Obote was deposed in a 1985 coup d'état and the start of peace talks.|$|E
5|$|By mid-December, Eisenhower {{had been}} {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and moved to England. As media attention surrounding the incident began to subside, McCloy told Patton he would indeed be eventually returning to combat command. Patton was briefly considered to lead the Seventh Army in Operation Dragoon, but Eisenhower felt his <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> be more useful in the Normandy campaign. Eisenhower and Marshall privately agreed that Patton would command a follow-on field army after Bradley's army conducted the initial invasion of Normandy; Bradley would then command the resulting army group. Patton was told on 1 January 1944 only {{that he would be}} relieved of command of the Seventh Army and moved to Europe. In his diary, he wrote that he would resign if he was not given command of a field army. On 26 January 1944, formally given command of a newly arrived unit, the Third United States Army, he went to the United Kingdom to prepare the unit's inexperienced soldiers for combat. This duty occupied Patton throughout early 1944.|$|E
50|$|Dionysiou {{was born}} in Nigrita, Serres prefecture, to Asia Minor {{refugees}} Angelos and Anastasia Dionysiou. At age 13, he lost his father. These early childhood <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> have a deep impact on the style of Stratos' music, and were a great influence to him.|$|R
50|$|The only check he <b>would</b> have <b>experienced</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} at the Prussian post of Mont-Saint-Guibert; which, however, {{in the case of an}} active reconnaissance, as above, might have been {{attacked}} by a strong Detachment in front, and turned by Corbaix on its left.|$|R
25|$|In her youth, she {{had been}} a showgirl and a {{freelance}} writer for Fleet Street in London and had published several short stories and two novels. These early <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> converge in her career in Hollywood, which spanned nearly four decades, as a successful columnist and author.|$|R
5|$|Chnodomar's {{men were}} of much less even quality than Julian's. His best warriors were the {{professional}} retinues of the regales (royal class, called ring-givers by the Germans), organized in warbands. They were well equipped with armour and swords, as behove their masters' status. The {{majority of his}} men, however, were temporary levies, lightly equipped and often inexperienced, like most contemporary Germanic forces relying on light equipment and speed. On the Alamanni side, {{there is little evidence}} of formation manoeuvres. The professional retainers of the regales may have had some capacity for this, especially as Germanic armies were by now very familiar with the Roman way of war. Ammianus' account mentions a globus (mass) of the best warriors coming together {{in the thick of the}} battle and breaking through the Roman line. In addition, several would likely have served in the Roman army in the past. But the majority of Chnodomar's men consisted of temporary levies, whose equipment and <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> have been limited. According to Ammianus, they had to rely on a concentrated frontal charge to try to break through by weight of numbers, and proved no match for the Romans in the final phase of the battle, a prolonged struggle of attrition at close-quarters.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
5|$|On Saint David's Day (1 March 1915), the new {{division}} was inspected by Lloyd George. During April, the Fourth New Army was broken up to provide reinforcements for deployed combat units. The Fifth New Army, in turn, was renamed the Fourth New Army. As {{part of this}} re-organisation, the 38th Division became the 31st Division. On 29 April, the 43rd was renamed the 38th (Welsh) Division. The division spent most of 1915 dispersed, with the majority located across North Wales with units training at Pwllheli, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Rhyl; some units were based in the south at Abergavenny. At these locations, the men undertook basic training, were drilled, and trained for open warfare. On 19 August, the division moved to Winchester, England, where it assembled {{for the first time}} as a division. Final training took place and limited instruction was given on tactics for trench warfare, on the assumption that practical <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> be easier to gain in France. Following training, it took until November for the division to be fully equipped with rifles. To be declared fit for overseas service, the division's soldiers had to fire 24 rounds on a rifle range. On 29 November, the {{division was}} inspected for the last time before its deployment; Queen Mary and Princess Mary reviewed the troops at Crawley Down.|$|E
50|$|Chin {{wrote the}} script for the 1967 {{documentary}}, And Still Champion! The Story of Archie Moore. Chin's script was narrated by actor Jack Palance. Some of Chin's <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> be worked into his first play, in which the protagonist is making a documentary about a boxer.|$|R

50|$|After a {{whole year}} on the move, the band decided to pause the touring and explore their {{individual}} interests in other settings. Each member traveled to {{different parts of the}} globe: Asia, North America, South America and Europe. These <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> have a musical input in their subsequent releases.|$|R
25|$|In 1947, {{on board}} a {{merchant}} navy coaster, he sailed {{for two years in}} the Baltic Sea and North Sea. This <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> later find echoes in Seven Days at Sea, The Drummer-Crab and even in Above the Clouds.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, back in California {{while her}} husband served in the military, Henry studied {{lithography}} at San Francisco School of Fine Arts and worked drafting engineering drawings at Hewlett-Packard; this drafting <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> later allow her to draw uncommonly straight lines freehand in executing her paintings.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{he pursued}} {{a career in}} public {{administration}} in the Ministry of Grace and Justice. That choice prevented him from participating in the decisive battles of the Risorgimento (the unification of Italy), for which his temperament was not suited anyway, but this lack of military <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> be held against him {{as long as the}} Risorgimento generation was active in politics.|$|E
50|$|While in Canton, March {{played in}} or watched {{hundreds}} of football games featuring the best professionals {{of the day}} such as Christy Mathewson, Fielding Yost, Walter Okeson, Knute Rockne and Pudge Heffelfinger. These <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> inspire and help him to write Pro Football:It's Ups and Downs in 1934.|$|R
50|$|While in the South, {{he would}} submit {{articles}} to the Daily Worker, which got him arrested numerous times. These <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> inspire his next play, Marching Song. It {{was put on}} by the radical Theatre Union and it opened on February 17, 1937 and ran for sixty-one performances.|$|R
25|$|Apparitional <b>experiences</b> <b>would</b> seem to lend {{support to}} the {{importance}} of central factors, since they represent a form of quasi-perceptual experience in which the role of external stimuli is minimal or possibly non-existent, while the experience nevertheless continues to be phenomenologically indistinguishable from normal perception, at least in some cases.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time David Collins had been {{dispatched}} from London in response to King's initial request, and departed from England in April 1803, in command of HMS Calcutta with orders to establish a colony at Port Phillip. Collins {{had been a member}} of the First Fleet which had founded Sydney 15 years earlier, and the Colonial Office felt this <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> be invaluable in the creation of a second settlement.|$|E
25|$|In August 1996, Schumacher {{tested for}} the McLaren team at Silverstone. In September, it was {{announced}} that Schumacher had signed a three-year contract to drive for the Jordan team. The deal also brought in a further £8 million from Schumacher's sponsor Bitburger brewery, with a small percentage going towards his salary. In January 1997, Giancarlo Fisichella was confirmed as Schumacher's teammate replacing Martin Brundle, who expressed a desire to remain with the team. Schumacher believed that Brundle's <b>experience</b> <b>would</b> have helped him in the coming season.|$|E
25|$|However, Machiavelli's success did not last. In August 1512 the Medici, {{backed by}} Pope Julius II used Spanish troops {{to defeat the}} Florentines at Prato, but many historians have {{argued that it was}} due to Piero Soderini's unwillingness to {{compromise}} with the Medici, who were holding Prato under siege. In the wake of the siege, Soderini resigned as Florentine head of state and left in exile. The <b>experience</b> <b>would,</b> like Machiavelli's time in foreign courts and with the Borgia, heavily influence his political writings.|$|E
