5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E
500|$|Assuming {{it was a}} {{legitimate}} checkpoint, McCoy informed the others inside the minibus of a military checkpoint up ahead and pulled in at the lay-by as directed by the armed men. As McCoy rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and produced his driving licence, gunmen {{came up to the}} minibus and one of them said in a Northern Irish accent, [...] "Goodnight, fellas. How are things? Can you step out of the van {{for a few minutes and}} we'll just do a check". The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E
60|$|The lodging-house seemed full of gurgling and rushing; the cistern overflowing; water {{bubbling}} and squeaking {{and running}} along the pipes and streaming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R

500|$|By May 6, the jails were so full that Connor {{transformed}} the stockade {{at the state}} fairgrounds into a makeshift jail to hold protesters. Blacks arrived at white churches to integrate services. They were accepted in Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Presbyterian churches but turned away at others, where they knelt and prayed until they were arrested. Well-known national figures arrived to show support. Singer Joan Baez arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel. Comedian Dick Gregory and Barbara Deming, a writer for The Nation, were both arrested. The young Dan Rather reported for CBS News. The car of Fannie Flagg, a local television personality and recent Miss Alabama finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her. Flagg worked at Channel 6 on the morning show, and after asking her producers why the show was not covering the demonstrations, she received orders never to mention them on air. She rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and shouted to the children, [...] "I'm with you all the way!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1900, Gates won $600,000 on a $70,000 bet on a {{horse race}} in England, exaggerated at over $1 million, which conferred on him the {{nickname}} [...] "Bet-A-Million". The Waldorf's Oscar Tschirky recalled that Gates {{did not like the}} nickname, but did little to repudiate the claims as he would bet on practically everything. Oscar recalled a rainy afternoon in the Waldorf's Oak Room as Gates and two associates watched raindrops trickle down the windows. Gates remarked that the drops did not move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at the same speed. [...] One of Gates' associates spotted two raindrops that were moving at the same rate and pointed them out to him. [...] Gates selected a raindrop and bet his associate that it would reach the bottom of the window first. [...] His associate took him up on the bet and before Gates' raindrop had won the race, the bets had changed from hundreds of dollars to thousands. Gates believed that all life was a gamble; a farmer gambled that he would have a successful harvest when planting crops, a merchant gambled that customers would buy items when ordering stock and a traveler gambled on arriving safely when setting out on a journey.|$|E
2500|$|On May 17, 2007, Method Man was {{captured}} in New York City for marijuana allegations. His SUV was pulled over near the Battery Tunnel toll booths for having an expired inspection sticker. An unidentified source said, [...] "It was {{like something out of}} Cheech & Chong. He rolls <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and the smoke would choke a horse." [...] The arresting officer noticed two blunts and a plastic bag containing marijuana in plain view. Upon further inspection more marijuana was found under the driver's seat. Method Man was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, criminal possession of marijuana, DWI, and driving an uninspected motor vehicle. He reached a plea agreement to perform community service including rapping to young kids about the dangers of drugs.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between the Eagle and Master. The easiest to identify is the post between the front door wing <b>windows</b> and <b>the</b> roll <b>down</b> <b>windows.</b> On <b>the</b> Eagle the chrome divider between these two <b>windows</b> goes <b>down</b> as <b>the</b> <b>window</b> goes <b>down,</b> where as on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go <b>down</b> with <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Shipman {{said that}} after arriving, {{she was aware of}} someone {{following}} her to an airport satellite parking area. When she got into her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly locked the door. Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months. Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being [...] "more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship". Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.|$|E

25|$|On Xbox 360, {{pressing}} <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> key performs <b>the</b> same {{action as}} the Guide button on Xbox 360 Controller or remote controls, opening the Xbox Guide. Holding <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> key and pressing M opens a pop up conversation window over gameplay, if an instant message conversation is in progress. On a PlayStation 3 console, pressing <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> key performs <b>the</b> same action as the PS Button on the Sixaxis Controller, opening the XrossMediaBar.|$|R
60|$|At this {{juncture}} a waiter came forward, and closed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> {{and the balance}} of the conversation was lost to the two Rover boys.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Beth, he's sent you..." [...] began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy, {{but she got}} no further, for Jo {{quenched}} her by slamming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Knight let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> {{and looked}} ahead. 'There {{are a great}} many people at the station,' he said. 'They seem all to be on the {{look-out}} for us.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese recalls that, [...] "I {{left that}} room feeling hurt and humiliated. I did {{something}} I virtually never do, as I said much earlier: I {{went out and}} got drunk. Outside in the Dunedin night the rain was trickling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> and <b>the</b> wind was blowing. It was cold and horrible, which exactly reflected my mood. The drops of rain on <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> could have been tears in my soul." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few moments}} later {{we came to a}} {{standstill}} in the town station. Feurgéres let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and talked for a few minutes with the station-master. Then he resumed his seat.|$|E
60|$|I glanced towards Guest. There {{was a new}} fire in his eyes. I {{saw that}} the idea appealed to him. Nervously he flung <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and let in the fresh air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said she, [...] "there is some mistake here. I do {{not know}} by what right you prevent me from pulling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and giving my {{directions}} to the coachman." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{filled the}} bowl of his pipe, and sat him <b>down</b> by <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> For <b>the</b> moment I was silent with sheer surprise.|$|R
50|$|The Series CA Master {{replaced}} the 1933 Eagle mid {{way through the}} model year when the 1933 Standard model (Series CC) was introduced. Several changes {{were made to the}} Eagle when the name was changed to Master. The easiest to identify is the post between the front door wing <b>windows</b> and <b>the</b> roll <b>down</b> <b>windows.</b> On <b>the</b> Eagle the chrome divider between these two <b>windows</b> goes <b>down</b> as <b>the</b> <b>window</b> goes <b>down,</b> where as on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go <b>down</b> with <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R

60|$|Unc Nunkie made {{no reply}} for a time. Then he shut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and turned his}} chair to face the room, for the sun was sinking behind the tree-tops and it was growing cool.|$|E
60|$|The train slackened speed. The {{lights of}} Dover flashed out on either side. They drew {{up at the}} town station and waited there for some minutes. Reist let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and {{addressed}} a porter.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there came}} an interruption. The shrill {{whistling}} of the engine, the shutting off of steam, the violent {{application of the}} brake. The train came to a standstill. The man put <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and looked out.|$|E
60|$|So {{she went}} away, and Catherine took {{her work and}} sat <b>down</b> at <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Suddenly <b>the</b> door burst open, and in came her Destiny.|$|R

5000|$|In February 1975, when UNESCO {{officials}} {{visited the}} mosque, they reported {{it to have}} been [...] "totally vandalised", with [...] "the minaret pulled <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> blocked, <b>the</b> roof {{in a state of}} collapse". By September 1975, the building had been restored except for the minaret that was being rebuilt. In 1985, the minaret was still under construction. In 1990, the mosque was restored and in 2003 it was opened to worship.|$|R
