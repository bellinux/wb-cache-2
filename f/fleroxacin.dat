50|$|<b>Fleroxacin</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} {{with a history of}} hypersensitivity to the substance or any other member of the quinolone class, or any component of the medicine. <b>Fleroxacin,</b> like other fluoroquinolones, can cause degenerative changes in weightbearing joints of young animals. The antibiotic should only be used in children when the expected benefits are outweigh the risks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fleroxacin</b> is a {{quinolone}} antibiotic. It is {{sold under}} the brand names Quinodis and Megalocin.|$|E
50|$|After oral {{administration}} <b>fleroxacin</b> is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and shows a good bioavailability. The antibiotic is widely {{distributed throughout the}} body and in the different biological tissues. In many biologic specimens the levels of <b>fleroxacin</b> {{are similar to those}} in plasma, but in bile, nasal secretions, seminal fluid, lung, bronchial mucosa, and ovaries, the drug concentrations are 2-3 times higher than those in plasma.The serum elimination half-life, in subjects with normal renal function, is relatively long (9-12 hours), which permits once-daily dosing.Approximately the urinary excretion is 38% of an orally administered dose within 48 h, and in urine is possible detect 8.6% of the N-demethyl metabolite and 4.4% of the N-oxide metabolite. <b>Fleroxacin</b> can penetrate into milk of nursing women. As quinolones are known to induce arthropathy in juvenile animals, administration of the drug to breast-feeding women cannot be allowed.|$|E
50|$|S. xylosus is {{normally}} sensitive to <b>fleroxacin,</b> methicillin, penicillin, teicoplanin, erythromycin and tetracycline, and resistant to novobiocin. It is highly active biochemically, producing acid {{from a wide}} variety of carbohydrates.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fleroxacin</b> is {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} a wide variety of infections, particularly uncomplicated cystitis in women, acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, gonorrhea, bacterial enteritis, traveler's diarrhea, respiratory tract infections ( [...] including exacerbation of chronic bronchitis).|$|E
50|$|<b>Fleroxacin</b> is a {{bactericidal}} {{drug that}} inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Like other quinolones and fluoroquinolones the compound eradicates bacteria by interfering with DNA replication (bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair and recombination).Fleroxacin is active against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is especially active against Shigella species., Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.|$|E
50|$|Phototoxicity {{was noted}} in 2.0% of {{sparfloxacin}} recipients, {{with the average}} delay in onset being 6.3 :t 4.5 days (range 1 - 14 days) after commencing sparfloxacin. Mostly this consisted of erythema on the face and hands which lasted an average of 6.4 :t 4.2 days.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{sucralfate}} on the pharmacokinetics of <b>fleroxacin</b> was assessed in 20 healthy male volunteers. The study {{was of a}} two-way crossover design in which subjects were randomized {{to one of the}} following two regimens at the time of entry: (i) a single 400 -mg dose of <b>fleroxacin</b> alone or (ii) a 400 -mg dose of <b>fleroxacin</b> given once and 1 g of sucralfate given every 6 h starting 24 h before <b>fleroxacin</b> treatment and continuing for 48 h after <b>fleroxacin</b> treatment. Blood samples were collected immediately before <b>fleroxacin</b> administration and at 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 h postdosing. <b>Fleroxacin</b> concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. While concurrent of <b>fleroxacin</b> and sucralfate resulted in a decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, a decrease in the maximum concentration, and an increase in the time to the maximum concentration (P < 0. 05), these changes were modest compared with the interaction of other quinolones with sucralfate. The relative bioavailability of <b>fleroxacin</b> given with sucralfate, calculated from the area under the concentration-time curve, was 76 % compared with that of <b>fleroxacin</b> alone. This is significantly better than the bioavailabilities of other quinolones (1. 8 to 12. 3 %) when they are administered with sucralfate...|$|E
40|$|A 400 mg dose of <b>fleroxacin</b> was {{administered}} orally to six healthy male volunteers. Concentrations of <b>fleroxacin</b> and the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites were determined in serum and urine by HPLC. The serum metabolite levels were negligible. The N-oxide metabolite {{was measured in}} the serum of five subjects but did not exceed 4 % of the corresponding <b>fleroxacin</b> level. N-demethyl <b>fleroxacin</b> was not detected (less than 0. 1 mg/l).

40|$|In this open-label study, the {{disposition}} of <b>fleroxacin</b> in liver disease in 12 healthy male volunteers, 6 male cirrhotics without ascites (group A), and 6 male cirrhotics with ascites (group B) was evaluated. <b>Fleroxacin</b> (400 mg) was administered orally and intravenously to each subject in a random crossover fashion. <b>Fleroxacin</b> was completely absorbed and achieved similar peak concentrations in plasma in all three study groups (P greater than 0. 05). The volume of distribution exceeded 1 liter/kg in healthy controls and was not affected by liver impairment (P greater than 0. 05). Only group B demonstrated differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated: the systemic and renal clearances of <b>fleroxacin</b> and the renal clearances and clearances {{of the two major}} metabolites of <b>fleroxacin</b> formed, N-demethyl <b>fleroxacin</b> and <b>fleroxacin</b> N-oxide, were significantly lower and the half-lives of the parent drug and its metabolites were significantly longer in group B than in healthy controls and group A (P less than 0. 05). The elimination of the two metabolites appeared to be formation rate limited in all three study groups. It was concluded from this study that a 50 % reduction in the <b>fleroxacin</b> maintenance dose in patients with liver disease appears justified only in patients with ascites. However, no change in the <b>fleroxacin</b> loading dose is needed in patients with compromised liver function...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{profile of}} <b>fleroxacin</b> was studied in eight noninfected patients receiving regular hemodialysis (four women and four men; mean age, 63 years; age range, 48 to 73 years). Dialysis clearances (mean +/- standard deviation) {{calculated from the}} amount of drug recovered in the dialysate exceeded those calculated from rates of extraction from plasma for <b>fleroxacin</b> (126 +/- 29 versus 73 +/- 11 ml/min) and its metabolite N-demethylfleroxacin (103 +/- 31 versus 72 +/- 15 ml/min) but not that for the metabolite <b>fleroxacin</b> N-oxide (100 +/- 25 versus 100 +/- 12 ml/min). Data were fitted to a two-compartment model over the total observation period of 8 days (six oral daily doses of 200 mg of <b>fleroxacin</b> on days 1 to 6 and hemodialysis treatments on day 1, 3, and 6) by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The random variability of plasma <b>fleroxacin</b> concentrations was 13 % about its prediction. The estimated metabolic clearance was 25 ml/min (coefficient of variation, 43 %), and the calculated steady-state volume of distribution was 84 liters (coefficient of variation, 16 %). The model was expanded for the two major metabolites {{by the addition of}} a two-compartment metabolite distribution. Formation clearances of N-demethylfleroxacin and <b>fleroxacin</b> N-oxide were estimated to be 54 and 33 % of fleroxacin's metabolic clearance, respectively. The conclusions were as follows. Because of the slow metabolic clearance and intermittent dialysis treatment, steady-state conditions were not reached after 1 week of oral <b>fleroxacin</b> therapy, and there was relevant accumulation of <b>fleroxacin</b> {{as well as that of}} <b>fleroxacin</b> N-oxide in our patients with end-stage renal disease. We recommend that infected hemodialysis patients be treated with an initial oral dose of 400 mg of <b>fleroxacin</b> and then daily oral doses of 200 mg. One cannot recommend the treatment of this patient population with <b>fleroxacin</b> over prolonged time periods until more date about the levels of accumulation of <b>fleroxacin</b> and its metabolites in infected patients with renal disease are available...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>fleroxacin</b> versus that of vancomycin {{was assessed by}} using the rabbit model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Animals were treated with <b>fleroxacin</b> (30 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h) or vancomycin (17. 5 mg/kg every 6 h) for 4 days. These antimicrobial agents were equally effective in clearing bacteremia, reducing bacterial counts in vegetations and tissues, and curing endocarditis. However, resistance to <b>fleroxacin</b> at fivefold the MIC arose in the test strain of S. aureus in 8 % of animals that received the drug. We conclude that <b>fleroxacin</b> is as efficacious as vancomycin in this model of a serious systemic S. aureus infection, but modest resistance to <b>fleroxacin</b> may develop during therapy...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four Staphylococcus {{species or}} {{subspecies}} were examined for their susceptibilities to the fluoroqui-nolone <b>fleroxacin</b> (Ro 23 - 6240) by disk diffusion (5 -jig disk) and by agar dilution for {{the determination of}} MICs. Resistant strains were further tested for their susceptibilities to oxacillin and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Reference strains of the novobiocin-resistant species (Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus arlettae, and Staphylococcus gallinarum) had an intrinsic intermediate susceptibility (MIC, 4,ug/ml) to <b>fleroxacin.</b> <b>Fleroxacin</b> resistance was not observed in the reference strains of the novobiocin-susceptible species (MIC, 0. 5 to 2. 0,uglml). Clinical isolates of coagulase-negative species were generally less susceptible to <b>fleroxacin</b> than were reference strains. Seven percent of the Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical strains were resistant (MIC,- 8 jig/ml) to <b>fleroxacin.</b> Of these strains, 77 % were resistant to oxacillin and 50 % were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Thirty-four percent of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus clinical strains were resistant to <b>fleroxacin,</b> and 9 % had intermediate susceptibility.

40|$|The {{activities}} of <b>fleroxacin</b> against 22 clinical Legionella isolates {{were determined by}} agar and broth microdilution susceptibility testing. The <b>fleroxacin</b> MIC required to inhibit 90 % of strains tested on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar medium supplemented with 0. 1 % alpha-ketoglutarate was 0. 64 micrograms/ml and was 0. 04 microgram/ml when testing was done with buffered yeast extract broth supplemented with 0. 1 % alpha-ketoglutarate. <b>Fleroxacin</b> (0. 25 microgram/ml) reduced the bacterial counts of two L. pneumophila strains grown in guinea pig alveolar macrophages by 1 log 10 CFU/ml, but regrowth occurred over a 3 -day period; <b>fleroxacin</b> was significantly more active than erythromycin in this assay. Single-dose (10 mg/kg of body weight given intraperitoneally) pharmacokinetic studies performed in guinea pigs with L. pneumophila pneumonia revealed peak levels in plasma and lungs to be 3. 3 micrograms/ml and 3. 5 micrograms/g, respectively, at 0. 5 h and 0. 8 microgram/ml and 0. 8 microgram/g, respectively, at 1 h. The half-life of the terminal phase of elimination from plasma and lung was approximately 2 h. All 17 infected guinea pigs treated with <b>fleroxacin</b> (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 days survived for 14 days post-antimicrobial therapy, as did all 16 guinea pigs treated with the same dose of <b>fleroxacin</b> for 5 days. Only 1 of 16 animals treated with saline survived. The animals treated with <b>fleroxacin</b> for 2 days lost more weight and had higher temperatures than those treated with the antibiotic for 5 days. <b>Fleroxacin</b> is effective against L. pneumophila in vitro and in a guinea pig model of Legionnaires' disease. <b>Fleroxacin</b> should be evaluated {{as a treatment for}} human Legionnaires' disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{quinolone}} antibiotics on nucleoid segregation in growing Escherichia coli were examined by using <b>fleroxacin</b> (Ro 23 - 6240, AM 833) as a prototype compound. At levels that {{were close to}} its MIC and induced growth arrest and filamentation, <b>fleroxacin</b> caused large nucleoids to appear in midcell, suggesting inhibition of nucleoid segregation. With increasing <b>fleroxacin</b> concentrations, nucleoids became progressively smaller, suggesting inhibition of DNA replication. Removal of <b>fleroxacin</b> restored normal cell and nucleoid morphology in filaments with large nucleoids but not in filaments with small nucleoids.

One hundred and fifty-one patients, of whom 49 received placebo, 54 received <b>fleroxacin</b> 400 mg for one day and 48 received <b>fleroxacin</b> 400 mg for two days, were included in the analysis of efficacy. The results showed that <b>fleroxacin</b> was significantly superior to placebo, but that {{there was no significant difference}} in terms of efficacy between the one- and two-day regimens. Adverse events, particularly minor neuropsychiatric disturbances such as headache and insomnia, were significantly more common amongst patients receiving active treatment. In conclusion, a single dose of <b>fleroxacin</b> 400 mg could be recommended as self-treatment for visitors to high-risk countries who develop travellers ' diarrhoea...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} efficacy of <b>fleroxacin</b> {{in combination with}} clindamycin or metronidazole in mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections, we used a rat model of intra-abdominal abscesses in which the inoculum consisted of pooled rat feces mixed with BaSO 4. Two hours after bacterial challenge, antimicrobial therapy was begun intravenously with regimens designed to simulate human pharmacokinetics. A combination of clindamycin and gentamicin was included as an established treatment regimen. After 8. 5 days of therapy, final bacterial counts in abscesses showed that <b>fleroxacin</b> alone or combined with metronidazole or clindamycin eflectively eradicated Escherichia coli, with bacterial densities of- 2. 84 ± 0. 1, ' 2. 9 ± 0. 1, and < 2. 95 ± 0. 1 (mean ± standard error of the mean) log 1 o CFU/g, respectively. The addition of either clindamycin or metronidazole to <b>fleroxacin</b> substantially enhanced {{the effectiveness of the}} regimens against Bacteroidesfragilis, with bacterial counts of c 3. 0 ± 0. 1 or c 2. 9 ± 0. 1 log 1 o CFU/g, respectively, versus 9. 2 ± 0. 2 log 1 o CFU/g for <b>fleroxacin</b> alone.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>fleroxacin,</b> {{including the}} formation of N-demethyl and N-oxide <b>fleroxacin</b> after the administration of single intravenous (100 -mg) and oral (400 -mg) doses, was investigated in 26 subjects with various levels of renal function, including 7 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. <b>Fleroxacin</b> was well tolerated by all subjects. The volume of distribution, systemic availability, and peak concentration after the administration of oral <b>fleroxacin</b> were independent of the glomerular filtration rate. As a consequence of a declining renal clearance but not nonrenal clearance, the total body clearance of <b>fleroxacin</b> declined with decreasing glomerular filtration rate from 1. 41 +/- 0. 23 ml/min per kg in subjects with normal renal function to 0. 58 +/- 0. 13 ml/min per kg in patients with end-stage renal disease (r = 0. 84, P less than 0. 001). The analysis revealed that the N-oxide metabolite exhibited formation-limited kinetics and the N-demethyl metabolite exhibited elimination-limited kinetics. The areas under the curve of both metabolites increased with declining renal function. In patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis the mean dialysate/plasma concentration ratio of <b>fleroxacin</b> increased from 0. 52 +/- 0. 11 to 0. 71 +/- 0. 13 (P less than 0. 001) with increasing dwell time, resulting in a 7. 8 +/- 3. 6 % recovery of unchanged <b>fleroxacin</b> in peritoneal dialysate. In conclusion, (i) a 50 % reduction of the maintenance dose is recommended in patients with a renal function below 20 to 30 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, and (ii) therapeutic concentrations of <b>fleroxacin</b> in the peritoneal dialysate should be achievable after oral administration in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of multiple doses of <b>fleroxacin</b> on the plasma clearance and the urinary excretion of theophylline was studied in 19 young and 18 elderly male volunteers. A theophylline dosage individualized {{to obtain a}} mean theophylline concentration in plasma of 10 +/- 3 micrograms/ml was administered for 1 week to each subject. At week 2, oral <b>fleroxacin</b> (400 mg once daily) was added. Theophylline concentrations in plasma were measured with TDx (Abbott Diagnostics, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and urinary excretion of theophylline and its three major metabolites was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Total theophylline clearance remained essentially unchanged throughout the study period (3. 5 and 2. 9 liters/h in {{the young and the}} elderly, respectively) both after a single <b>fleroxacin</b> dose and after multiple doses. Although significant changes occurred in the urinary excretion of unchanged theophylline and its metabolites after a single <b>fleroxacin</b> dose, no changes were observed after multiple doses. Side effects consisted mainly of gastrointestinal and sleep disturbances, more related to theophylline; photosensitivity was observed in six subjects and was attributed to <b>fleroxacin.</b> We conclude that <b>fleroxacin</b> may be administered concomitantly with theophylline in either young or elderly patients.

All M. tuberculosis,M. kansasii, M. xenopi,M. scrofulaceum, M. marinum,and M. malmoense isolates including those resistant to conventional antimycobacterials were inhibited by 0 · 5 mg/l of <b>fleroxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin, the lowest tested concentration. <b>Fleroxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin along with ofloxacin,pefloxacin, ansamycin, clofazimine and cycloserine were also tested against 14 isolates of the M. avium complex. Nine of 14 strains (64 %) of the M. avium complex were found susceptible to 4 mg/l of <b>fleroxacin</b> and a similar percentage to the other quinolones. On the basis of its in-vitro potency and its favourable pharmacokinetic properties <b>fleroxacin</b> appears to be sufficiently active to warrantfurther experimental trials against difficult to treat mycobacteri...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>fleroxacin</b> {{and other new}} 4 -quinolones on {{cellular}} functions and topoisomerase II of HeLa cells were investigated. The potency of cytotoxicity increased in the order <b>fleroxacin</b> < nalidixic acid < ofloxacin < norfloxacin < ciprofloxacin. The cytotoxicity was well correlated with inhibitory effects of 4 -quinolones on topoisomerase II. However, the cytotoxicity did not correlate with antibacterial activity, and cytotoxicity was observed only at greater than IOO-fold higher concentrations than the minimum inhibitory concentrations of new 4 -quinolones for Enterobacteriaceae. Judging from the serum levels attainable after oral administration, new 4 -quinolones, especially <b>fleroxacin,</b> will have little effect on topoisomerase in eukaryotic cells...|$|E
40|$|Forty {{patients}} with chronic cholecystitis or cholelithiasis were prospectively randomized for therapy with either ciprofloxacin or <b>fleroxacin</b> to study the penetration of these two agents into gallbladder tissue, plasma, and bile. Patients received a 3 -day course of ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day) or <b>fleroxacin</b> (400 mg once daily) and were subdivided into four groups reflecting intraoperative sample collection at 4, 7, 14, and 25 to 26 h following the last quinolone dose. Mean concentrations in plasma for ciprofloxacin and <b>fleroxacin</b> at 4 and 25 to 26 h postdose were 2. 5 and 10 micrograms/ml and 0. 3 and 1. 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The concentrations of ciprofloxacin and <b>fleroxacin</b> in bile and gallbladder wall tissue at 25 to 26 h postdose were 4. 5 and 8. 6 micrograms/ml and 1. 2 and 4. 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Both agents demonstrate rapid tissue penetration with persistence at levels appropriate for treatment of biliary pathogens...|$|E
40|$|In a murine {{model of}} renal {{infection}} (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli), sparfloxacin was compared with ciprofloxacin and <b>fleroxacin.</b> After intrarenal inoculation, mice were treated orally for 5 days. The drugs were administered at five different dosages, ranging from 3. 125 to 50 mg/kg {{of body weight}} per day for S. aureus and from 0. 78 to 12. 5 mg/kg/day for E. coli. Evaluation of efficacy {{was based on the}} proportional reduction of bacterial counts in the kidney tissues of treated animals compared with those of untreated control animals. For S. aureus, the doses required to clear the infection in 50 % of mice were as follows: sparfloxacin, 10 mg/kg/day; ciprofloxacin, 33 mg/kg/day; and <b>fleroxacin,</b> 16 mg/kg/day. For E. coli renal infection, the corresponding dosages were as follows: sparfloxacin, 1. 5 mg/kg/day; ciprofloxacin, 2. 45 mg/kg/day; and <b>fleroxacin,</b> 1. 8 mg/kg/day. Sparfloxacin and <b>fleroxacin</b> have a lower effective dose than ciprofloxacin in these models, probably because ciprofloxacin has a shorter serum half-life than the other two compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of oral <b>fleroxacin</b> {{were compared}} {{in men and}} premenopausal women. The total volume of distribution of the drug was significantly smaller in women in the single-dose trial. No difference in other pharmacokinetic parameters was noted. Since adverse events appear to occur in women more commonly than in men, dose-response studies of <b>fleroxacin</b> in women may be appropriate. <b>Fleroxacin</b> is a trifluorinated, quinolone antibiotic with a long half-life in serum and broad gram-negative bacterial ac-tivity. Approximately 23 % of the drug is protein bound, with 45 to 70 % of the drug being renally eliminated (3). Like many available quinolone antibiotics, <b>fleroxacin</b> is as-sociated {{with a variety of}} adverse effects. Generally, adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sleeplessness and nightmares, headache, and dizziness are seen in patients (10, 11). Central nervous system effects are seen in 7 to 17 % of patients, and digestive system adverse reactions are seen in 11 to 17 % of patients. Nineteen to 32 % of all patients experienc...|$|E
40|$|Steady-state {{pharmacokinetics}} of oral <b>fleroxacin</b> {{were studied}} in six males who had skin or skin structure infections {{and who were}} receiving 400 mg of <b>fleroxacin</b> once a day. Blood samples (n = 10) and total urine output were collected during a 24 -h dosing interval. <b>Fleroxacin</b> concentrations in serum and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The maximum concentration in serum and the time to achieve that maximum were 6. 2 +/- 2. 2 micrograms/ml and 0. 94 +/- 0. 62 h, respectively. The absorption half-life, alpha half-life, beta half-life, apparent steady-state volume of distribution, apparent total body clearance, and renal clearance were 0. 56 +/- 0. 37 h, 0. 78 +/- 0. 51 h, 10. 56 +/- 1. 40 h, 0. 85 +/- 0. 31 liters/kg, 129. 2 +/- 19. 6 ml/min, and 53. 3 +/- 16. 7 ml/min, respectively. <b>Fleroxacin</b> disposition in this patient population {{was similar to that}} in noninfected volunteers with normal renal function...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of sub-minimal {{inhibitory}} concentrations (sub-MIC) of ciprofloxacin and <b>fleroxacin</b> on capsulated (K+) and non-capsulated (K-) Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli O 1 :K 1, O 7 :K 1, O 1 :K-, O 7 :K-, and Klebsiella oxytoca) {{as well as on}} Staphylococcus aureus and we investigated the interaction of antibiotic pretreated bacteria with human serum and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Following overnight growth in the presence of 1 / 2 MIC of the antibiotics, bacteria were opsonized in human serum and incubated with PMN. Opsonophagocytosis was quantified as the ratio of uptake by PMN of radioactively labeled bacteria. Ciprofloxacin and <b>fleroxacin</b> enhanced the phagocytosis rate of E. coli K+ strains (control 5 - 10 %; 1 / 2 MIC of ciprofloxacin and <b>fleroxacin</b> 70 - 80 %) of K. oxytoca (control O- 2 %; 1 / 2 MIC of ciprofloxacin and <b>fleroxacin</b> 35 - 40 %) as well as of Staph. aureus (control 5 - 10 %; 1 / 2 MIC of the antibiotics 35 - 40 %). Opsonophagocytosis of K- strains was not altered. The enhancement of opsonophagocytosis was a complement dependent process. Exposure of capsulated E. coli to ciprofloxacin as well as to <b>fleroxacin</b> resulted in decreased amounts of the capsular antigen...|$|E
40|$|The renal {{handling}} of <b>fleroxacin</b> was studied by renal clearance and stop-flow techniques in rabbits and dogs and {{by analyzing the}} pharmacokinetics with and without probenecid in humans. In rabbits the excretion ratios (<b>fleroxacin</b> intrinsic renal clearance/glomerular filtration rate) were greater than unity (2. 01) without probenecid and were decreased to a value below unity (0. 680) with probenecid. In dogs, on the other hand, the excretion ratios were less than unity (0. 608 and 0. 456) both without and with probenecid, and so were not affected by probenecid. This fact suggested that <b>fleroxacin</b> was excreted into urine by both glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion in rabbits, but only by glomerular filtration in dogs, accompanied by partial renal tubular reabsorption in both species; these mechanisms were also supported by stop-flow experiments. In humans probenecid treatment induced increases in the elimination half-life and area under the serum concentration-time curve and decreases in apparent serum clearance, renal clearance, and urinary recovery of <b>fleroxacin.</b> The excretion ratio without probenecid was 1. 13, which was significantly decreased to 0. 750 with probenecid. These results indicated that both renal tubular secretion and reabsorption contributed to renal excretion of <b>fleroxacin</b> in humans. The contribution of tubular secretion was species dependent and was extensive in rabbits, minimal in dogs, and moderate in humans. Renal tubular reabsorption was commonly found in every species. The long elimination half-life of <b>fleroxacin</b> in humans might be explained by its small total serum clearance and small renal clearance, which are attributed to less tubular secretion and more tubular reabsorption...|$|E
