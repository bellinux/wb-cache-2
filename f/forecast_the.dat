5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days.

As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the National Hurricane Center <b>forecast</b> <b>the</b> outer edge of the hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} moved northwestward due to {{a weakness}} in the subtropical ridge. Despite early predictions of steady strengthening to reach 60mph (95km/h) within 48hours, the depression remained weak due to strong south-southwesterly wind shear. The shear remained strong, and though the National Hurricane Center <b>forecast</b> <b>the</b> system to remain a depression through September 30, the depression unexpectedly strengthened to Tropical Storm Kate on September 27, coinciding {{with an increase in}} deep convection near the center. Kate turned to the north and northeast, and despite 35mph (55km/h) of shear over the storm Kate continued to strengthen. A banding eye developed early on September 29, and later that day it intensified into a hurricane while located 655mi (1,055km) southwest of the Azores.|$|E

As the hurricane crossed Mobile Bay it turned to the north-northeast, and within twelve hours Ivan rapidly weakened to tropical storm status. The circulation became less-defined, and early on September 17 the cyclone deteriorated into a tropical depression over northeastern Alabama. Ivan accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, dropping heavy rainfall along its path and also producing a widespread tornado outbreak from Alabama through Maryland. Late on September 18, the remnants of Ivan transitioned into an extratropical low as it merged with the cold front over the Delmarva Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 12. Convection increased as it moved through the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the cloud pattern organized sufficiently to warrant Dvorak classifications for the system on September 15. Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 16 while located around 290miles (465km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Due to the tropical depression moving over an area of warm water temperatures with favorable upper level outflow, the National Hurricane Center <b>forecast</b> <b>the</b> tropical depression to slowly intensify to 70mph (110km/h) winds within 72hours the forecast early on September 16.|$|E

5|$|By August30, strong outflow {{developed}} around Luis despite convection remaining {{displaced from}} the low pressure center. Once the shear began to relent, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the center, allowing the storm to intensify. Around 1800UTC that day, Luis attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; however, operationally Luis was not upgraded to a hurricane until 0900UTC on August31. The newly upgraded hurricane steadily intensified as banding features developed around {{the periphery of the}} cyclone. By the morning of August31, cold cloud tops surrounded a developing eye. Around this time, Luis was located due south of the area of high pressure and tracking steadily towards the west-northwest. Further development resulted in the appearance of a ragged eye appearing on visible satellite images. Winds within the eyewall were estimated at 100mph (155km/h), making Luis a low-end Category2 hurricane. Later that day, the storm became increasingly organized, with a symmetrical structure and a well-defined center.

5|$|Roughly {{paralleling}} the North Carolina coast {{beginning on}} September26, Helene's slow movement and strong intensity resulted in moderate to heavy impacts in coastal {{areas of the}} state. Despite the hurricane's Category4 hurricane intensity, due to its closest approach to land remaining offshore, its storm surge remained less than initially <b>forecast.</b> <b>The</b> hurricane's track also placed its strongest storm surge in the eastern hemisphere of the storm, away from any landmasses. Surge heights peaked at 6ft (1.8m) near Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. In Wilmington, Helene produced ocean swells at the coast 2.5 â€“ 3 times per minute, indicative of a strong hurricane. There, the cumulative sea level was roughly 9ft (2.7m) above normal. However, {{as a result of}} the storm striking at low tide, damage caused by storm surge was mostly mitigated. Despite this, sand dunes in southern areas of Fort Fisher, were mostly destroyed by waves. On Cedar Island, strong winds produced by the hurricane pushed waves inland, inundating homes.
