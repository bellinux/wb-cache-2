5|$|Many dwarf galaxies may orbit {{a single}} larger galaxy; the Milky Way <b>has</b> <b>at</b> {{least a dozen}} such satellites, with an {{estimated}} 300–500 yet to be discovered. Dwarf galaxies may also be classified as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance to large ellipticals, they are often called dwarf spheroidal galaxies instead.|$|E
5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family <b>has</b> <b>at</b> most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle <b>has</b> <b>at</b> most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E

5|$|To combat {{pathogens}} that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, {{causing them}} to agglutinate. Since an antibody <b>has</b> <b>at</b> least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always <b>has</b> <b>at</b> least one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order {{to prove the}} statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae <b>has</b> <b>at</b> times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax {{may turn out to be}} large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Bronze {{vessels are}} made and placed one above the other at {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water.

The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E
