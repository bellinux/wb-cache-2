2500|$|The {{first major}} job that faced the {{development}} committee was finding and selecting a suitable {{site for a}} 700 unit housing project in northern New Jersey. The United States Housing Authority provided two site selection experts, and the New Jersey State Planning Commission provided assistance throughout the site selecting process. The final location had to be relatively inexpensive to purchase, be located near major utility networks for water, gas, electric and sewer connections, and be in a financially stable host community with underutilized public facilities and services. Major urban areas in northern New Jersey were eliminated early {{because there were no}} plots of land large enough for the project. The marshy rural areas near the shipyards were also found to be unacceptable early on. Quickly the committee began focusing its attention on the surrounding suburban communities, which were very popular among its work constituency. [...] Suburban communities, however, lacked financial stability, because they lacked the industrial rateables necessary to keep residential property taxes low. [...] The people of these prospective host communities were also frightened that the new project would be a <b>direct</b> <b>liability</b> rather than an asset for their towns.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the world}} {{maritime}} industry, {{a key issue}} raised by the [...] "Prestige" [...] incident was whether classification societies can {{be held responsible for}} the consequences of incidents of this type. In May 2003, the Kingdom of Spain brought civil suit in the Southern District of New York against the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), the Houston-based international classification society that had certified the [...] "Prestige" [...] as [...] "in class" [...] for its final voyage. [...] The [...] "in class" [...] status states that the vessel is in compliance with all applicable rules and laws, not that it is or is not safe. [...] On 2 January 2007, the docket in that lawsuit (SDNY 03-cv-03573) was dismissed. [...] The presiding judge ruled that ABS is a [...] "person" [...] as defined by the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC) and, as such, is exempt from <b>direct</b> <b>liability</b> for pollution damage. [...] Additionally, the Judge ruled that, since the United States is not a signatory to the International CLC, the US Courts lack the necessary jurisdiction to adjudicate the case.

50|$|United States Notes, {{also known}} as Legal Tender Notes, succeeded Demand Notes as the main {{currency}} form of the United States. They were not redeemable but were receivable for all taxes and debts, which is what persuaded people to circulate them. They had a red seal and were originally issued in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1,000. $5,000 and $10,000 notes were issued in 1878 and have not been issued anytime after. United States Notes switched to small size in 1928 and were introduced in denominations of only $1, $2 and $5. In 1934, when Federal Reserve Notes stopped being redeemable in gold, {{the only difference between}} them and Legal Tender Notes was that the first were liabilities of the Federal Reserve while the latter were <b>direct</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the United States Treasury Department. The $2 and $5 were issued through 1966, and the $2 note was only available as a United States Note. In 1966 the $5 United States Note was discontinued and the $2 denomination was discontinued altogether. In 1966 a $100 US note was issued to meet legal requirements about the amount of notes in circulation. In 1971 the production of US notes was halted and they were officially discontinued in 1994.|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the fiscal {{position of a}} country, contingent liabilities and other sources of fiscal risk need to be considered. The authors develop a framework to assess and manage fiscal risk in Bulgaria. Bulgaria's Currency Board Arrangement has effectively imposed fiscal discipline, but leaves only limited room to accommodate potential fiscal shocks. Through risks embedded in the portfolio of government contingent and <b>direct</b> <b>liabilities,</b> significant fiscal pressures could arise in the future. Major sources of risk include environmental liabilities and investment requirements, collection capacities of the social protection institutions, and further engagement in off-budget programs, such as government guarantees. To limit the Government's exposure to risks, yet accommodate investment needs crucial to growth and development, Bulgaria must find an optimal strategy for liability management, fiscal reserves, and risk mitigation. Priorities for dealing with existing risks and limiting further accumulation of risks include: 1) Mitigating currency and interest rate risks in the government liability structure. 2) Implementing proposed institutional and finance reform of the country's pension and health care systems. 3) Building adequate contingency reserves. 4) Introducing risk-sharing arrangements. 5) Prioritizing and placing strict limits on the amounts of new guaranteed obligations. 6) Developing government capacity to analyze and manage risks. 7) Fully integrating fiscal risk management with other policy considerations in fiscal management, {{as part of an}} integrated asset and liability management strategy.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question whether}} and how co-benefits, through disaster resilience building, can be further promoted. Co-benefits are defined as positive externalities that arise deliberately {{as a result of}} a joint strategy that pursues several objectives synergistically at the same time, such as disaster risk management and development goals, or disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. Of particular interest is the question of how the economic and broader benefits of disaster risk management can be recognized and realized by those in charge of fiscal policy decisions. The paper considers the interplay between public disaster risk management investment and fiscal policy, and provides an overview of the current debate as well as assessment methods, tools, and policy options. In fiscal budgeting, it has been standard practice to focus on <b>direct</b> <b>liabilities</b> and recurrent spending. Costs of disasters are often dealt with after the fact only, rather than being considered as contingent liabilities. As a consequence, the full costs of disasters have often not been budgeted for, and, with a price signal missing, there is lack of clear incentives for investing in disaster risk management. Overall, the paper identifies four steps and three dividends to be harnessed: (i) understanding fiscal risk; (ii) protecting public finance through risk financing instruments, the first dividend; (iii) managing disaster risk comprehensively, the second dividend; and (iv) pursuing a synergistic, co-benefits strategy of concurrently managing disaster risks and promoting development, the third dividend...|$|R

50|$|Another {{reason that}} future {{security}} threats or losses are under-assessed is that often only the direct {{cost of a}} potential loss is considered instead of the spectrum of consequential losses that are concomitantly experienced.

40|$|Generally it {{is assumed}} that caput in the phrase noxa caput sequitur refers to the delinquent slave or filius familias. The {{liability}} for the delict is attached to his person. It is argued, however, that caput refers to the pater familias of the delinquent. The Twelve Tables contained a rule on their <b>direct</b> and personal <b>liability</b> (with surrender to the autorities). The introduction of the edicts on furtum and the lex Aquilia, with the <b>direct</b> and exclusive <b>liability</b> of the pater familias for the wrongdoings of those, subjected to his potestas, led to a correction: the pater could now refuse to defend them and surrender them to the authorities, or engage in the process, with afterwards still the possibility to surrender, now to the plaintiff. The phrase as such refers then to the inclusion of the decemviral rule on liability of persons subjected to patria potestas, into the formulas for the delicts. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden...|$|R

The mere fact that Netcom's system incidentally made temporary copies of plaintiff's work did not mean Netcom had caused the copying. The court further stated that although copyright was a strict liability statute, some element of volition or causation was still required to constitute copyright infringement. Since such element was lacking, Netcom was not liable for direct infringement.|$|E

40|$|To {{control the}} {{expansion}} of government contingent liabilities and reduce fiscal vulnerability, one {{must be able to}} identify and measure them. The authors discuss how this may be done and demonstrate how the assessment of fiscal adjustment may change substantially when a broader picture of government liabilities is included. They base their analysis on experience in analyzing fiscal adjustment in the Czech Republic and Macedonia. Their work demonstrates the importance of including contingent liabilities when analyzing fiscal sustainability. To the extent that explicit expenditures are shifted off-budget or replaced by guarantees, the achieved improvement in fiscal balances is overstated. For the Czech Republic, adjustment may have been overstated by some 3 to 4 percent of annual GDP. A stabilization program accompanied by a build-up of contingent liabilities, particularly state guarantees and obligations to cover <b>liabilities</b> emerging from <b>directed</b> credit, may not be sustainable. In Macedonia, the present fiscal equilibrium may be temporary because the stock of existing contingent liabilities could add 2 to 4 percent of GDP to future deficits. And methods used to reduce the"traditional"deficit are unlikely to be sustainable without further modification. The authors conclude that governments: 1) must find better ways to identify and evaluate contingent liabilities arising from the banking system, nonbanking financial institutions, public enterprises, or the contingent and <b>direct</b> <b>liabilities</b> of subnational governments; 2) need to better manage their risks [...] for example, building adequate reserve funds and hedging risk, where possible; and 3) should examine the implications of the bias toward adding contingent liabilities and develop administrative reform as part of analyzing budget management.

50|$|Many {{employers}} seek {{to mitigate}} the financial risk of self funding claims under the plan by purchasing stop loss insurance from an insurance carrier. These policies typically provide for risk retention limitations both on a specific claim and aggregate claims basis. An important aspect of self funded group health plans lies in the requirement that the employer remain liable for funding of plan claims regardless of the purchase of stop loss insurance. What this means, in turn, is a fund or company's own bank account creates a pool of their employees and is managed & distributed to claim payouts. In other words, only the employer has a contractual relationship with plan participants and beneficiaries. The stop loss policy runs solely between the employer and the stop loss carrier and creates no <b>direct</b> <b>liability</b> to those individuals covered under the plan. This feature provides the critical distinction between fully insured plans (subject to State law insurance regulations) and self funded health plans which, under the provisions of Section 514 of ERISA, are exempt from state insurance regulations.|$|E

Arden LJ emphasised that piercing the corporate veil was not necessary. There would be <b>direct</b> <b>liability</b> in tort for the parent company if it had interfered in the subsidiary's affairs. The High Court before it had held that liability would exist if the parent exercised control, all applying ordinary principles of tort law about liability of a third party for the actions of a tortfeasor.
