5000|$|Although vehicle {{excise duty}} was first {{introduced}} in the United Kingdom in 1889, it wasn't until 1 January 1921 that it became compulsory to display a tax disc on the vehicle. Initially, they were issued quarterly or annually. Early discs were made from plain paper, without perforations; the selvedge was cut or folded to create the main circular shape. Colour printing was introduced in 1923. Advertising on the reverse of the disc was allowed from 1924, with companies such as Shell Oil placing advertisements. This was abolished in 1926, after which the reverse showed text relating to the refund available for unexpired licences. Perforations were used from 1938, enabling a better fit within the standard disc holders; however, the perforations were missing from 1942 to 1952, perhaps {{as a result of}} equipment damage during the war. [...] In 1961 major changes occurred, with a redesign of the printed pattern - for better security - and a new system of monthly issues, rather than the standard December expiry of the past. From then on, the <b>expiry</b> <b>month</b> was displayed. From 2001, watermarking and embossing were added to prevent fraud.|$|E

The substandard tetanus toxoid vaccine might increase the incidence of neonatal tetanus. WHO has taken many steps to help national regulatory authorities and vaccine manufacturers to make sure its quality and efficacy.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to ensure the efficacy of tetanus vaccine produced by manufacturer of private sector (Amson Vaccine and Pharma (Pvt) LTD. Islamabad, Pakistan). All stability studies performed on final products stored at 2 - 8 ⁰C and evaluated at near expiry and even three months after its <b>expiry</b> <b>month.</b> The study gives efficacy comparison between Tetanus vaccine injection filled from imported RTF Bulk and Formulated Tetanus Toxoid Bulk from the private sector.

Results indicate a dramatic improvement in liquidity and a subsequent reduction in transaction costs since carbon futures began trading in 2005.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} implicit cost of trading in money and futures markets. The research provides empirical evidence on several issues of {{significance to the}} growing number of institutional investors in these markets. I address four unique research questions with scarce or conflicting prior research findings. The empirical evidence presented in this dissertation can be used by researchers, investors, and regulators to understand and manage the cost of trading in money and futures markets. The first issue examined in this dissertation is the price impact of block trades in futures markets. The study examines 14 stock index futures contracts in 11 different international markets and finds that on balance, part of the initial price movement associated with a block trade is temporary. This suggests block trades in futures markets incur a liquidity premium. The study also finds strong evidence that large buyer- and seller-initiated trades have permanent effects on prices, implying they convey information. The study concludes, similar to research based on equity markets, that traders in futures markets are informed. The second issue examined is an inconsistency in the literature regarding institutional transactions in futures markets. One strand of the literature documents that single trades in futures markets contain information, while another strand finds trade packages in futures markets do not contain information. The second study in this dissertation controls for methodological and sample differences in examining the price impact of individual trades and trade packages, and finds little evidence that transactions in futures markets contain information. The third issue examined in this dissertation is the anomalous negative relation between execution costs and trade size in opaque markets. Prior literature attributes this relation to information asymmetry and broker-client relationships; however, previous empirical studies are unable to analyse these contributing factors individually. The study addresses this issue by empirically examining the effect of each factor on execution costs in Australian money markets. Results imply that a trader’s ex ante price information and the relationship a trader has with their broker are both significant determinants of a trader’s execution costs in an opaque market; however, traders who establish a strong relationship with their broker will achieve a greater reduction in execution costs than traders with ex ante price information. The study also finds evidence that trade size has little explanatory power after controlling for a trader’s ex ante price information and broker-client relationships. There is a scarcity of empirical research examining the carbon market – a new and rapidly growing financial market developed to support the trading of carbon emissions. The fourth issue examined in this dissertation is the cost of trading in the largest and most liquid carbon market: the European carbon futures market. Results from prior studies of transaction costs are not necessarily applicable to carbon futures, given the unique features of carbon futures contracts and the immaturity of the carbon market. This study is of interest as it represents the first empirical analysis of liquidity and transaction costs in the carbon futures market. Results from the study imply a substantial increase in liquidity and subsequent reduction in transaction costs as carbon markets mature through time. Unlike traditional futures contracts, where liquidity clusters in quarterly <b>expiry</b> <b>month</b> contracts (March, June, September, December), liquidity in the carbon futures market is concentrated in December <b>expiry</b> <b>month</b> contracts to coincide with annual emissions audits. Further, the study also provides evidence of information asymmetry in carbon futures markets and a permanent price adjustment following medium and large trades...|$|E

During training, Davis suffered a serious shoulder injury that would bring her away from the ring passed the 6 <b>month</b> <b>expiry</b> rematch clause day of March 24. Due to this, Helu and Meleisea were allowed to fight for the vacant titles, with the winner to face Davis when she is healed 100%. Helu lost the bout by a controversial split decision.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{trade with}} time to <b>expiry</b> of y <b>months,</b> the <b>expiry</b> date is found by first calculating the spot date, then moving forward y months from the spot {{date to the}} {{delivery}} date. If the delivery date is a non-business day or a US holiday, move forward until an acceptable delivery date is found. Finally, calculate the expiry date using an [...] "inverse spot" [...] operation; e.g., find the expiry date for which the delivery date would be its spot. When finding the expiry date from the delivery date, there must be one clear business day and one weekday (not including 1 January) in any applicable non-USD/non-CAD, non-USD/non-TRY, non-USD/non-PHP, non-USD/non-RUB, non-USD/non-KZT and non-USD/non-PKR currency. If one leg of the currency pair is a non-deliverable currency, the expiry date must be a business day of that currency.|$|R
5000|$|... 3) Implied {{volatility}} against realized volatility [...] In {{a number}} of markets such as commodities and rates, the implied volatility, as implied by straddle prices {{is higher than the}} realized volatility of the underlying forward. One way to 'exploit' this is to sell a short <b>expiry</b> (e.g. 1 <b>month)</b> straddle and delta-hedging it until it is alive. The strategy makes money if at expiry, the sum of the premium received (and accrued at money market), the (negative) final value of the straddle and the (positive/negative) value of the forwards (entered into to delta-hedge the straddle) is greater than zero. A variation of this, and more common solution in equity, is to sell either a one-month or three-month variance swap - usually on the Eurostoxx 50E or S&P500 index - that pays a positive performance if the implied volatility (strike of the swap) is above the realised volatility at expiry; in this case {{there is no need to}} delta-hedging the underlying movements.|$|R
