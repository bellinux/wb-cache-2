2500|$|The slime glands {{themselves}} are {{deep inside the}} body cavity, each {{at the end of}} a tube more than half the length of the body. The tube both conducts the fluid and stores it until it is required. The distance that the animal can propel the slime varies; usually it squirts it about a centimetre, but the maximal range has variously been reported to be ten centimetres, or even nearly a foot, although accuracy drops with range. It is not clear to what extent the range varies with the species and other factors. One squirt usually suffices to snare a prey item, although larger prey may be further immobilised by smaller squirts targeted at the limbs; additionally, the fangs of spiders are sometimes targeted. The slime, which can account for up to 11% of the organism's dry weight, is 90% water; its <b>dry</b> <b>residue</b> consists mainly of proteins — primarily a collagen-type protein. 1.3% of the slime's dry weight consists of sugars, mainly galactosamine. The slime also contains lipids and the surfactant nonylphenol. Onychophora are the only organisms known to produce this latter substance. It tastes [...] "slightly bitter and at the same time somewhat astringent". The proteinaceous composition accounts for the slime's high tensile strength and stretchiness. Upon ejection, it forms a net of threads about twenty microns in diameter, with evenly spaced droplets of viscous adhesive fluid along their length. It subsequently dries, shrinking, losing its stickiness, and becoming brittle. Onychophora eat their dried slime when they can, which is appropriate, because it takes an onychophoran about 24 days to replenish an exhausted slime repository. The lipid and nonylphenol constituents may serve one of two purposes. They may line the ejection channel, stopping the slime from sticking to the organism when it is secreted; or they may slow the drying process long enough for the slime to reach its target.|$|E

Owing to their anti-bacterial properties, red barberry and the <b>dried</b> <b>residue</b> of red grape could be suitable replacers for nitrite. Materials and Methods: Agar dilution method was employed in order to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the barberry extract and the <b>dried</b> <b>residue</b> of red grape. The anti-microbial effects of the barberry extract (0 - 600 mg/kg), the <b>dried</b> <b>residue</b> of red grape (0 - 2 %) and nitrite (30 - 90 mg/kg) were investigated on the total viable counts of Clostridium perfringens, as well as on the psychrophilic bacteria after 30 days of storage at 4 °C. Finally, the effects of the three independent variables in the optimal sample were examined on the growth of the inoculated C. perfringens. Results: The MIC of the barberry extract and the <b>dried</b> <b>residue</b> of red grape on Staphylococcus aureus was 3 and 6 (mg/ml), respectively. In the case of Escherichia coli, it was 4 and 7 (mg/ml), respectively. The barberry extract and nitrite reduced the growth of the living aerobic bacteria significantly. The spores of the inoculated C. perfringens had no growth in the optimum sample during storage.

Producing it from coconut milk involves grating the coconut and mixing it with water, then squeezing out the oil.

Different single-, two-, and three-element solutions (0. 01 - 1 g/L) were prepared in picoliter volume (around 130 pL) with a thermal inkjet printing technique.

50|$|In the Kraft Process, high {{alkalinity}} {{and temperature}} converts the esters and carboxylic acids in rosin into soluble sodium soaps of lignin, rosin, and fatty acids. The spent cooking liquor is called weak black liquor {{and is about}} 15% dry content. The black liquor is concentrated in a multiple effect evaporator and after the first stage the black liquor is about 20 - 30%. At this stage it is called intermediate liquor.

A good soap skimming operation reduces the soap content of the black liquor down to 0.2 - 0.4% w/w of the <b>dry</b> <b>residue.</b> The collected soap is called raw rosin soap or rosinate.

5000|$|In the 1990s, new {{polymers}} began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) {{soil particles}} into dry residues on contact. In the conventional cleaning process surfactant molecules attach themselves to oily soil particles, suspending them (emulsification) {{so that they}} can be easily rinsed away. Surfactant (detergent) molecules and emulsified soils which escape being rinsed away, remain in the fibre and continue to attract soiling, causing the condition of the carpet to degenerate; often re-soiling faster than before it was subjected to the cleaning process. Encapsulators are speciality detergent polymers which become part of the detergent system. As drying occurs (20-30 min. drytime), after cleaning, these encapsulators bind the detergent molecules and residual soils in a brittle, crystalline structure. Detergent and soil particles can no longer attract other soils and are easily removed by dry vacuuming. In addition to binding the detergent and soil residues the encapsulation chemistry coats the clean fibre with the same brittle film. This reduces the fibre’s affinity for oily and particulate soils. As this brittle film"breaks away" [...] and more soil is removed, the appearance of the fibre improves as opposed to soiling more rapidly. Products which also employ fluorochemical technology, display dramatically extended anti re-soiling time periods.Cleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, brush applicator, or compression sprayer. <b>Dry</b> <b>residue</b> is vacuumable immediately (20-30 min. drytime), either separately or from a built-in unit of the cleaning-system machine.|$|E
5000|$|The Onychophora forcefully squirt glue-like slime {{from their}} oral papillae; {{they do so}} either in defense against predators or to capture prey. The {{openings}} of the glands that produce the slime are in the papillae, a pair of highly modified limbs {{on the sides of}} the head below the antennae. Inside, they have a syringe-like system that, by a geometric amplifier, allows for fast squirt using slow muscular contraction. High speed films show the animal expelling two streams of adhesive liquid through a small opening (50 to 200 microns) at a speed of 3 to 5 m/s. The interplay between the elasticity of oral papillae and the fast unsteady flow produces a passive oscillatory motion (30-60 Hz) of the oral papillae. The oscillation causes the streams to cross in mid air, weaving a disordered net; the velvet worms can only control the general direction where the net is thrown.The slime glands themselves are deep inside the body cavity, each at the end of a tube more than half the length of the body.

Recently, a <b>dried</b> <b>residue</b> specimen preparation method was developed {{as an alternative to}} the established aqueous approach. The method currently certified to prepare plutonium for gallium analysis by XRF involves dissolving the sample and removing the plutonium with ion exchange chromatography. The gallium remaining in solution is then analyzed. This method has been thoroughly developed, and relative accuracy and precision values less than 1 % can be achieved. However, this process is time consuming, and the specimen solution is radioactive due to the presence of residual plutonium and trace americium.
