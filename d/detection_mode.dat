This mode has been demonstrated to operate also in ESEM {{by the use of}} the light pipes after they were cleared of the scintillating coating previously used for BSE detection. However, not much is known on its use outside the experimental prototype originally tested. Clearly, ESEM is more powerful and meaningful under this <b>detection</b> <b>mode</b> than SEM, since the natural surface of any specimen can be examined in the imaging process. Cathodoluminescence is a materials property, but with various specimen treatments required and other limitations in SEM the properties are obscured or altered or impossible to detect and hence this mode of detection has not become popular in the past. The advent of ESEM with its unlimited potential may provoke more interest in this area too, in the future.|$|E
50|$|Both Mode 1 and 2 sectors use {{the first}} 16 bytes for header information, but {{differ in the}} {{remaining}} 2,336 bytes due {{to the use of}} error correction bytes. Unlike an audio CD, a CD-ROM cannot rely on error concealment by interpolation; a higher reliability of the retrieved data is required. To achieve improved error correction and <b>detection,</b> <b>Mode</b> 1, used mostly for digital data, adds a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code for error detection, and a third layer of Reed-Solomon error correction using a Reed-Solomon Product-like Code (RSPC). Mode 1 therefore contains 288 bytes per sector for error detection and correction, leaving 2,048 bytes per sector available for data. Mode 2, which is more appropriate for image or video data (where perfect reliability may be a little bit less important), contains no additional error detection or correction bytes, having therefore 2,336 available data bytes per sector. Note that both modes, like audio CDs, still benefit from the lower layers of error correction at the frame level.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the above}} developments, devoted BSE {{detectors}} in the ESEM have {{played an important}} role, since the BSE remain a most useful <b>detection</b> <b>mode</b> yielding information not possible to obtain with SE. The conventional BSE detection means have been adapted {{to operate in the}} gaseous conditions of the ESEM. The BSE having a high energy are self-propelled to the corresponding detector without significant obstruction by the gas molecules. Already, annular or quadrant solid-state detectors have been employed for this purpose but their geometry is not easily adaptable to the requirements of ESEM for optimum operation. As a result, no much use has been reported of these detectors on genuine ESEM instruments at high pressure. The [...] "Robinson" [...] BSE detector is tuned for operation up to around 100 Pa at the usual working distance of conventional SEM for the suppression of specimen charging, whilst electron collection at the short working distance and high pressure conditions make it inadequate for the ESEM. However, plastic scintillating materials being easily adaptable have been used for BSE and made to measure according to the strictest requirements of the system. Such work culminated in the use of a pair of wedge-shaped detectors saddling a conical PLA1 and abutting to its rim, so that the dead detection space is reduced to a minimum, as shown in the accompanying figure of [...] The photon conduction is also optimized by the geometry of the light pipes, whilst the pair of symmetrical detectors allow the separation of topography (signal subtraction) and atomic number contrast (signal addition) of the specimen surface to be displayed with the best ever signal-to-noise-ratio. This scheme has further allowed the use of color by superimposing various signals in a meaningful way. These simple but special detectors became possible in the conditions of ESEM, since bare plastic does not charge by the BSE. However, a very fine wire mesh with appropriate spacing has been proposed as a GDD when gas is present and to conduct negative charge away from the plastic detectors when the gas is pumped out, towards a universal ESEM. Furthermore, since the associated electronics involve a photomultiplier with a wide frequency response, true TV scanning rates are readily available. This is an essential attribute to maintain with an ESEM that enables the examination of processes in situ in real time. In comparison, no such imaging has been reported with the electron avalanche mode of the GDD yet.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{methodology}} of the design of suitable background electrolytes (BGEs) in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is described. The principal aspects {{of the role of}} a BGE in CZE are discussed with respect to an appropiate migration behavior of analytes, including the transport of the electric current, the buffering of pH, the Joule heat, the electro-endosmotic flow (EOF) and the principal migration and <b>detection</b> <b>modes.</b> The impact of the composition of the BGE upon migration and detection is discussed. It is shown that the total concentration of the BGE is a principal factor and the adjustment of migrating analyte zones according to the Kohlrausch regulating function (KRF) is the principal effect in most of the sample stacking techniques. The number of co-ions and their properties are of key importance for peak shapes of the analyte peaks and for the existence of system zones. The detection of UV-transparent analytes may advanteously be done in the indirect UV mode, by using UV-absorbing co-ions, however, both peaks and dips may be expected in the UV trace in case of multiple co-ionic BGEs. Properties of BGEs can be predicted applying mathematical models and it is shown that with SystCharts, predictions can be given concerning the existence of system zones, <b>detection</b> <b>modes</b> and the peak shapes of analytes for a given BGE. Practical examples of methodological considerations are given in the design of suitable BGEs for four principal combinations of migration and <b>detection</b> <b>modes.</b> The properties of the BGEs selected are exemplified with experimental results.

In this work, malic, citric, succinic, pyruvic, acetic and lactic acids are separated using a sodium hydrogen phosphate background electrolyte with direct <b>detection</b> <b>mode</b> with a diode array detector. The separation exhibits lower sensitivity than equivalent methods with indirect <b>detection</b> <b>mode,</b> however, the risk of co-migration with unknown compounds in beer matrixes is significantly reduced. This is due to (i) a higher efficiency (250, 000 – 400, 000 theoretical plates), (ii) a higher selectivity than any equivalent method using an indirect <b>detection</b> <b>mode,</b> and (iii) the possibility to monitor other wavelengths in parallel (260 nm for example) to check for possible co-migration with phenolic or benzoic acids.

40|$|The use of {{capillary}} electrophoresis {{as a tool}} to conduct immunoassays has been an area of increasing interest over the last decade. This approach combines the efficiency, small sample requirements, and relatively high speed of CE with the selectivity of antibodies as binding agents. This review examines the various assay formats and <b>detection</b> <b>modes</b> that have been reported for these assays, along with some representative applications.

Fluorescent labels are most commonly used for detection in these assays, but enzyme labels have also been utilized for such work. Some additional work has been performed in CE immunoassays with heterogeneous methods in which either antibodies or an analog of the analyte is immobilized to a solid support.
