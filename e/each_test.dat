5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the last}} players selected, Woodfull scored a double century and century in his first two innings in England to earn his debut in the first Test. He played in <b>each</b> <b>Test,</b> scoring two centuries. Woodfull made eight centuries during the tour and topped the Australian averages and was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Able and Baker are {{the first}} two letters of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, used from 1941 until 1956. Alpha and Bravo are their {{counterparts}} in the current NATO phonetic alphabet. Charlie is the third letter in both systems. According to eyewitness accounts, the time of detonation for <b>each</b> <b>test</b> was announced as H or How hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or Mike hour is used instead.|$|E
5|$|England {{dominated}} the 2004 series and claimed the first English whitewash in the Wisden Trophy's history. England won <b>each</b> <b>Test</b> comfortably, as the West Indian bowlers {{struggled to get}} wickets. Only Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo had bowling averages lower than 30. This whitewash meant that England had won seven consecutive Tests {{for the first time}} in 75 years. The series was the beginning of a run that would see England win the Ashes the following year.|$|E
5000|$|The PCI of <b>each</b> <b>tested</b> {{sample unit}} is {{calculated}} {{using the method}} defined in the standard. In summary this involves calculating the distress quantities and the distress densities for <b>each</b> <b>tested</b> unit. These values are used to determine a deduct value and this deduct value is subtracted from 100 to give the PCI value.|$|R

5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of <b>each</b> <b>test</b> publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for <b>each</b> <b>test,</b> 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E
5|$|Miller had a light {{workload}} in the 1947–48 home Test {{series against}} India, which Australia won 4–0; his teammates often finished off the opposition {{before he had}} an opportunity, particularly with the bat. He was required to bat just once in <b>each</b> <b>Test,</b> accumulating 185runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries. His 72overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. Lindwall and Miller were selected by captain Donald Bradman and his fellow selectors for the 1948 tour of England as the intended new ball pairing.|$|E

5|$|Miller had a light {{workload}} in the 1947–48 home Test {{series against}} India, {{who were on}} their first tour to Australia. India were well beaten, losing 4–0, {{three of the four}} defeats by an innings. Miller was required to bat just once in <b>each</b> <b>Test,</b> accumulating 185runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries, while the batsmen ahead of him plundered the bowling. His bowling duties were also light; his 72overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. In both his fifties, Miller featured in century partnerships with his partners, respectively Bradman and Hassett in the First and Fourth test respectively. His 58 in the First Test at Brisbane featured many big hits.|$|E
5|$|The 1985–86 {{series in}} the West Indies ended in another {{whitewash}} with the West Indies winning <b>each</b> <b>Test</b> comfortably, the closest match being a seven wicket victory. Like the previous series the English batsmen provided little resistance against the West Indian bowlers with only Gower averaging above 30. Poor performances from Botham and Mike Gatting's injury ensured an easy series win for the West Indies. England’s attitude also {{played a part in}} their defeat with big players such as Gower and Botham showing a certain reluctance to net training. The then chairman of selectors Peter May questioned the team's attitude and called for greater resolve, a view that seemed to be shared by the general public at the time.|$|E
5|$|England {{had four}} captains in Gatting, John Emburey, Chris Cowdrey and Graham Gooch, but <b>each</b> <b>Test</b> ended in West Indian dominance. They won each match except the first Test, which was drawn because of rain, and the series {{finished}} 4–0. The West Indies pace attack {{was the main}} difference between teams with Marshall being the most dangerous bowler, taking 35 wickets at an average of 12.65. This included a 7/22 in the third Test which he bowled with a broken left hand. Marshall was supported by Ambrose's bowling which yielded 22 wickets. After this series both teams would go into decline. Many of the great West Indian players such as Richards and Marshall would soon retire, and their dominance of the Test stage was nearing its end.|$|E

5|$|In the Tests, Woodfull unselfishly {{broke up}} his opening {{combination}} with Ponsford by dropping down to No. 6 {{to accommodate the}} prodigiously talented young batsman Archie Jackson. Woodfull was uncomfortable batting out of position, scoring six, 58 and 17 {{in the first three}} Tests. Woodfull batted only once in <b>each</b> <b>Test,</b> as Australia easily won the first Test by ten wickets, and the next two by an innings. Woodfull was restored {{to the top of the}} order for the fourth Test in Melbourne after Jackson's illness became too much, forcing the young batsman to withdraw from competition. Woodfull struck 83 run out as Australia took a third consecutive innings victory. He then scored his first century for the season, making 177 and 27 not out in a state match against South Australia.|$|E

25|$|Since 2002, the ICC has two {{panels of}} umpires: namely the Elite Panel of Umpires (two of which are, in theory, {{appointed}} to <b>each</b> <b>Test</b> Match) {{and the larger}} International Panel of Umpires.|$|E

25|$|Neyman–Pearson {{theory can}} {{accommodate}} both prior probabilities {{and the costs}} of actions resulting from decisions. The former allows <b>each</b> <b>test</b> to consider the results of earlier tests (unlike Fisher's significance tests).

25|$|The matches were officiated by two {{independent}} umpires of the ICC panel.
