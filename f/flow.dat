5|$|A <b>flow</b> is {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time. More specifically, in a one-dimensional geometric <b>flow</b> such as the curve-shortening <b>flow,</b> the points undergoing the <b>flow</b> belong to a curve, and what changes is the shape of the curve, its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of each of its points.|$|E
5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, {{there is more}} than one definition of curvature, including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) measures such as the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the mean curvature <b>flow</b> (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature), the Ricci <b>flow</b> (an intrinsic <b>flow</b> on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore <b>flow</b> (the gradient <b>flow</b> for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature). The curve-shortening <b>flow</b> is a special case of the mean curvature <b>flow</b> for one-dimensional curves.|$|E

40|$|We utilize a large firm-level panel dataset {{to explore}} the links between gross job <b>flows</b> and gross worker <b>flows.</b> Our {{findings}} have relevance for models of job creation and destruction, of labour reallocation and of employment adjustment costs. We find churning <b>flows</b> (the difference between worker and job <b>flows</b> at the firm) to be high, pervasive, and highly persistent over time within firms. We find the dynamic relationship between job and worker <b>flows</b> to be quite complex: lagged job <b>flows</b> raise churning <b>flows,</b> but the effect of churning <b>flows</b> on job <b>flows</b> is asymmetric.

5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette <b>flow</b> is the <b>flow</b> of a {{viscous fluid}} {{in the space}} between two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The <b>flow</b> is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the <b>flow</b> direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like <b>flow</b> in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of <b>flow</b> is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening <b>flow</b> is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening <b>flow</b> {{is an example of a}} geometric <b>flow,</b> and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature <b>flow.</b> Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening <b>flow,</b> geometric heat <b>flow,</b> and arc length evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous <b>flow</b> velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid <b>flow).</b> Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass <b>flow</b> compared to inviscid <b>flow</b> with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass <b>flow</b> as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the <b>flow</b> velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The <b>flow</b> velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E
30|$|In section IV, we {{analyze the}} decline in gross worker <b>flows</b> (hires and separations), {{employing}} some helpful identities that relate gross worker <b>flows</b> to gross job <b>flows</b> (job creation and job destruction), {{as well as to}} job-to-job <b>flows.</b> We find that {{the decline in}} gross job <b>flows</b> can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job <b>flows</b> only explains {{about a third of the}} decline in gross worker <b>flows.</b> This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the declines in gross job <b>flows,</b> there are different forces that are driving the declines in gross worker <b>flows.</b> Analyzing the relationship between gross worker <b>flows</b> and job-to-job <b>flows,</b> we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job <b>flows</b> are driving the declines in gross worker <b>flows.</b>|$|R
40|$|Job <b>flows</b> (job creations and job destructions) {{and worker}} <b>flows</b> (hires and quits) {{are central to}} recent {{analysis}} of labor market. The scale of gross job <b>flows</b> (creations + destructions) compared to net job <b>flows</b> (creations - destructions) has {{a part in the}} renewal of Schumpeterian analysis. It is usually accepted that gross job <b>flows</b> are roughly of the same magnitude in such different countries as France and the USA. This study takes advantage of the possibility to follow employees for two years - thanks to the DADS database - and improves the measure of job <b>flows</b> by eliminating spurious <b>flows</b> related to plants identifier changes. Thus job <b>flows</b> are divided by two and appear to be by far less important in France than in the USA. The same database allows the study of the link between job <b>flows</b> and worker <b>flows.</b> Churning <b>flows</b> (worker <b>flows</b> minus job <b>flows)</b> depend more on industry characteristics than on job <b>flows.</b> Their magnitude, scaled up by this study, reflects more the segmentation of the labor market than the strength of the creative destruction process.

5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} <b>flow</b> problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar <b>flow</b> studies since the mean <b>flow</b> is also the instantaneous <b>flow</b> because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution {{often referred to as the}} Blasius boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|When {{the general}} <b>flow</b> pattern buckles from a zonal pattern to the meridional pattern, a slower {{movement}} in a north or southward direction is more likely. Meridional <b>flow</b> patterns feature strong, amplified troughs and ridges, generally with more northerly and southerly <b>flow.</b>|$|E
5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar <b>flow</b> breaks down and transitions to a turbulent <b>flow.</b> From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent <b>flow</b> as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar <b>flow,</b> however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E
40|$|Using monthly data, we {{investigate}} the cyclicality of international fund <b>flows</b> employing correlation and regression analysis. International fund <b>flows</b> are investments by funds like mutual funds, exchange traded funds, closed-end funds and hedge funds. Our {{results suggest that}} contemporaneously international fund <b>flows</b> tend to be counter-cyclical, i. e. in an economic downswing fund <b>flows</b> move into the country. The cyclicality of bond <b>flows</b> is more significant than that of equity <b>flows.</b> Global factors dominate the behavior of international fund <b>flows,</b> especially for equity <b>flows...</b>|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Ocate {{volcanic}} field is that the oldest basaltic <b>flows</b> form the highest mesas, and the youngest <b>flows</b> form surfaces lower in elevation. This reverse stratigraphy occurred because after the older <b>flows</b> were erupted about 8.3-5.7 m.y. ago on a relatively flat alluvial plain, the entire area was uplifted, and canyons were cut into the older basalt <b>flows.</b> Younger basalt <b>flows</b> then filled the major stream canyons. When uplift ceased, the youngest basalt <b>flows</b> of the Ocate volcanic field <b>flowed</b> on top of intermediate-aged <b>flows.</b>|$|R

The Saddle Mountain Basalt is composed of the Umatilla Member <b>flows,</b> the Wilbur Creek Member <b>flows,</b> the Asotin Member <b>flows</b> (13 million years ago), the Weissenfels Ridge Member <b>flows,</b> the Esquatzel Member <b>flows,</b> the Elephant Mountain Member <b>flows</b> (10.5 million years ago), the Bujford Member <b>flows,</b> the Ice Harbor Member <b>flows</b> (8.5 million years ago) and the Lower Monumental Member <b>flows</b> (6 million years ago).|$|R
5|$|Several {{relatively}} young obvious lava flows {{exist in the}} area around Adams. Most of these flows are {{on the north side of}} the mountain and include the <b>flow</b> in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows <b>Flow,</b> and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava <b>Flow</b> to the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious <b>flow</b> appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening <b>flow</b> {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening <b>flow</b> to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this <b>flow,</b> and the <b>flow</b> may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening <b>flow</b> for space curves has been used as a way to define <b>flow</b> past singularities in plane curves.|$|E
5|$|Vortex {{streets are}} zigzagging {{patterns}} of whirling vortices {{created by the}} unsteady separation of <b>flow</b> of a fluid, most often air or water, over obstructing objects.

30|$|Lamb et al. (2010, p. 1398) {{in their}} attempt to explain the origin of {{submarine}} canyons by hyperpycnal <b>flows</b> stated that “In fact, hyperpycnal <b>flows</b> might erode the seabed, which offers a potentially interesting feedback between plunging hyperpycnal <b>flows</b> and submarine canyon formation (e.g., Pratson et al. 1994)”. However, Pratson et al. (1994, p. 411) concluded that “As reviewed here, mass wasting initiated the subsea sediment <b>flows</b> that began canyon formation and enhanced canyon growth by widening the canyons through retrogressive sea-floor failures, for example, the gullying of canyon walls observed by Farre and others (Farre et al. 1983)”. Clearly, Pratson et al. (1994) were not referring to hyperpycnal <b>flows</b> because their term “sediment flows” was meant for sediment-gravity <b>flows</b> (Middleton and Hampton 1973). Sediment-gravity <b>flows</b> are composed of grain <b>flows,</b> debris <b>flows,</b> fluidized sediment <b>flows,</b> and turbidity currents (Middleton and Hampton 1973, their Fig. 1).

40|$|Previous returns {{studies have}} shown that extreme {{earnings}} and extreme cash <b>flows</b> from operations are less informative than moderate (i. e., less extreme) earnings and moderate cash <b>flows.</b> Studies also report that cash <b>flows</b> supplement to earnings in firm valuation by showing a higher association of cash <b>flows</b> with returns when earnings are extreme than when earnings are moderate. We propose that this supplementary role of cash <b>flows</b> is affected by cash <b>flows</b> extremity. Using data from the US capital markets, we find that the supplementary role of cash <b>flows</b> exists only when cash <b>flows</b> are not extreme. We also investigate the supplementary role of earnings to cash <b>flows</b> and search for a higher association of earnings with returns when cash <b>flows</b> are extreme than when cash <b>flows</b> are moderate. Similar to results on cash <b>flows,</b> our findings show that the supplementary role of earnings exists only when earnings are not extreme. Our results imply that investors and researchers should consider "both" earnings "and" cash <b>flows</b> extremity when assessing the information content of these variables.

25|$|A {{breath is}} one cycle of {{positive}} <b>flow</b> (inspiration) and negative <b>flow</b> (expiration) {{defined in terms}} of the flow-time curve.

25|$|A <b>flow</b> {{that is not}} a {{function}} of time is called steady <b>flow.</b> Steady-state <b>flow</b> refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent <b>flow</b> is known as unsteady (also called transient). Whether a particular <b>flow</b> is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar <b>flow</b> over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background <b>flow,</b> the <b>flow</b> is unsteady.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>flow</b> in {{a channel}} becomes supersonic, one {{significant}} change takes place. The conservation of mass <b>flow</b> rate leads one {{to expect that}} contracting the <b>flow</b> channel would increase the <b>flow</b> speed (i.e. making the channel narrower results in faster air <b>flow)</b> and at subsonic speeds this holds true. However, once the <b>flow</b> becomes supersonic, the relationship of <b>flow</b> area and speed is reversed: expanding the channel actually increases the speed.|$|E

The {{contemporaneous}} relation is positive: funds with high <b>flows</b> outperform funds with low <b>flows</b> {{during the month}} of the <b>flows.</b> This immediate reaction, combined with feedback trading, gives rise to a cycle: <b>flows</b> exert price pressure, this effect on returns induces more <b>flows,</b> and these <b>flows</b> cause further price pressure. The cycle is so strong that it takes almost two years before a full return reversal is witnessed. This flow-return cycle also contributes to the observed persistence in hedge fund performance.
