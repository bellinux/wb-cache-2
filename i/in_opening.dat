5|$|The Angels {{have played}} in three home ball parks. They played their first season in Wrigley Field, which was {{designed}} to look like Wrigley Field in Chicago, but never played an Opening Day home game there.

5|$|In the new year, O'Sullivan {{failed to}} reach the quarter-final stages of a ranking event {{for the first time}} this season: losing 4–5 to Joe Swail in the last 16. This began a run of poor form that saw O'Sullivan lose in the opening round of the Masters 2–6 to Jimmy White and then in the second round of the Thailand Masters 4–5 to Shokat Ali (losing the {{deciding}} frame on a re-spotted black). O'Sullivan returned to winning ways, by capturing the Irish Masters title by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8 in the final, before he experienced another dip in form losing to Mark Davis <b>in</b> <b>opening</b> round of the Scottish Open.|$|E
5|$|Plane Food was {{announced}} in December 2007 to launch upon the opening of Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 5 on 27 March 2008.

He also expanded his restaurant empire in other areas during 2008, with Murano (alongside Angela Hartnett), York & Albany and Maze Grill also opening.

5|$|When Quatermass and {{his team}} reach the crash area and succeed <b>in</b> <b>opening</b> the rocket, they {{discover}} that {{only one of the}} three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the interior of the rocket, and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but {{there is no sign of}} the other two crewmen.|$|E
5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded <b>in</b> <b>opening</b> a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay <b>in</b> <b>opening</b> the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E

5|$|On June 14, 1981, Har Mar Mall {{was damaged}} {{by a large}} tornado during the {{afternoon}} hours. While the mall wasn't heavily damaged and only affected the mall's cosmetic appearance, several nearby local businesses and residences were left in ruins following the impact. Shortly after the tornado, a large renovation occurred to update the mall's appearance and fix any damage left by it. In 1988, another expansion took place, allowing Har Mar to acquire several larger retailers in the newly constructed space; the opening of Highland Superstore and TJ Maxx appeared later this year, along {{with the addition of}} a new food court with seating for over 400 people. Three years later, the Highland Superstore was converted to BizMart, a regional office supply store. BizMart was later acquired by OfficeMax in 1992 before ultimately closing in 1995; HomePlace opened in the space vacated by OfficeMax, and is currently leased by HomeGoods, the successor of HomePlace. In the 2000s, Har Mar underwent a cosmetic makeover that cost previous owner Emmes Realty Services nearly $12 million; Emmes sparked interest <b>in</b> <b>opening</b> a Von Maur at the center, but the proposal eventually dissolved.|$|E
