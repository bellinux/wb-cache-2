40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2000 Dr. Shigeko Nariyama. Nominal arguments, such as the subject and the object are not grammatically required to be overt in Japanese, and are frequently unexpressed, approximately 50 % {{of the time in}} written narrative texts. Despite this in high frequency of ellipsis, Japanese is not equipped with such familiar devices as the cross-referencing systems and verbal inflections commonly found in pro-drop languages for referent identification. Yet the mechanisms governing argument ellipsis have been little explicated. This thesis elucidates the linguistic mechanisms with which to identify the referents of ellipted arguments. These mechanisms stem from three tiers of linguistic system. Each sentence is structured {{in such a way as}} to anchor the subject., (using Sentence devices following the principle of direct alignment), with argument inferring cues on the verbal <b>predicate</b> (using <b>Predicate</b> <b>devices).</b> These subject oriented sentences are cohesively sequenced with the topic as a pivot (using Discourse devices). These subject oriented sentences are cohesively sequenced with the topic as a pivot (using Discourse devices). It is this topicalised subject which is most prone to ellipsis. I develop an algorithm summing up these mechanisms, using naturally occurring texts. I demonstrate how it can detect the existence of ellipsis in sentences and track the referential identity of it. A generalisation for ellipsis resolution and the way in which the algorithm is constituted is as follows. Sentence devices formulate sentences to make the subject most prone to ellipsis, discourse devices enable the interaction of wa (the topic maker) and ga (the nominative marker), which mark the majority of subjects, to provide the default reading for referent identification of ellipsis, and <b>predicate</b> <b>devices</b> furnish additional cues to verify that reading. Since Japanese is an SOV language, it is intuitively tenable from the perspective of language processing that the interplay of wa/ga representing subjects gives initial cues from <b>predicate</b> <b>devices.</b> This multiple layering of mechanisms, therefore, can determine referents for ellipted arguments more accurately.

40|$|The {{construction}} of periodic matter and nanomechanical devices are central goals of DNA nanotechnology. The minimal requirements for components of designed crystals are [1] programmable interactions, [2] predictable local intermolecular structures and [3] rigidity. The sticky-ended association of DNA molecules fulfills {{the first two}} criteria, because it is specific and diverse, and it results {{in the formation of}} B-DNA. Stable branched DNA molecules permit the formation of networks, but individual single branches are too flexible. Antiparallel DNA double crossover (DX) molecules can provide the necessary rigidity, so we use these components to tile the plane. It is possible to include DNA hairpins that act as topographic labels for this 2 -D crystalline array, because they protrude from its plane. By altering sticky ends, it is possible to change the topographic features formed by these hairpins, and to detect these changes by means of AFM. We can modify arrays by restricting hairpins or by adding them to sticking ends protruding from the array. Although individual branched junctions are unsuitable for use as crystalline components, parallelograms of four 4 -arm junction molecules are sufficiently rigid that they can be used to produce 2 D arrays. The arrays contain cavities whose dimensions are readily tuned by changing the edges of their parallelogram components. We have used these arrays to measure directly the angle between the helices of the Holliday junction. The rigidity of the DX motif can also be exploited to produce a nanomechanical <b>device</b> <b>predicated</b> on the B-Z transition. Two DNA double crossover molecules have been joined by a segment of DNA capable of undergoing the B-Z transition. In the B-conformation, the unconnected helices of the two molecules are {{on the same side of}} the connecting helix, whereas in the Z conformation they are on opposite sides, leading to movements of as much as 60 Å. This effect is shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, because dyes attached to the unconnected helices have different separations in the two states...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an encoding of major parts of domain theory and fixedpoint {{theory in the}} Pvs extension of the simply-typed -calculus; these formalizations comprise the encoding of mathematical structures like complete partial orders (domains), domain constructions, the Knaster-Tarski fixed-point theorem for monotonic functions, and variations of fixed-point induction. Altogether, these encodings form a conservative extension of the underlying Pvs logic. A major problem of embedding mathematical theories like domain theory {{lies in the fact}} that developing and working with those theories usually generates myriads of applicability and type-correctness conditions. Our approach to exploiting the Pvs <b>devices</b> of <b>predicate</b> subtypes and judgements to establish many applicability conditions behind the scenes leads to a considerable reduction in the number of the conditions that actually need to be proved. We illustrate the applicability of our encodings by means of simple examples including a mechanized fixed-point induction proof in the context of relating different semantics of imperative programming constructs.

Because a newborn can acquire GBS during and after delivery, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that pregnant women be screened for rectovaginal GBS colonization during the antepartum period between weeks 35 and 37 of gestation and, if they are colonized, that intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis be administered. A prospective investigational study was undertaken from 2 May 2006 to 14 August 2006 at three sites to establish the performance characteristics of the Smart GBS LB assay on the SmartCycler II system for detecting GBS colonization in subjects in the antepartum period from combined vaginal/rectal swab-based specimens after broth enrichment.

In addition, QUORUM aims at providing foundations for building a repair expert system. The problem in constructing such a representation is the difficulty of recognizing a feasible ontology with which we can express the behavior of mechanical devices and, more importantly, faulty behaviors of a device and their causes. Unlike most other approaches, our ontology employs the notion of force and energy transfer and motion propagation. We discuss how the overall behavior of a device can be derived from knowledge of the structure and the topology of the device, and how faulty behaviors can be predicted based on information about the perturbation of some of the original conditions of the <b>device.</b> Necessary <b>predicates</b> and functions are constructed to express the physical properties {{of a wide variety of}} basic and complex mechanisms, and the connection relationships among the parts of mechanisms.

These benefits originate from the inherent characteristics of the ultrasonic mechanism, but further improvements were thought possible through optimization of the energy delivery during application. The study reported here compared a new ultrasonic device, Harmonic ACE®+ Shears with Adaptive Tissue Technology, with a commercial <b>predicate</b> <b>device,</b> Harmonic ACE® Shears (both Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). Methods: Devices were evaluated in an in vivo porcine model intraoperatively and after a 30 -day survival period. Both devices were used to seal a variety of vessels 1 – 5 mm in diameter, and compared for hemostasis, histological thermal damage, and adhesion formation. Sealed vessels were evaluated ex vivo for burst pressure, and visual obstruction caused by plumage from device application was assessed quantitatively. Results: ACE+ produced significantly less thermal damage, had fewer adhesions, offered faster transection, involved less visual obstruction, and had higher burst pressures than the <b>predicate</b> <b>device.</b> All vessel seals, evaluated {{over the course of}} a 30 -day survival period in pigs, remained intact. Conclusion: The new Adaptive Tissue Technology algorithm assists the surgeon in achieving better control of energy delivery to the tissue, sealing vessels with supra-physiological burst pressures, and low thermal damage. These preclinical results with Harmonic ACE+ may translate into meaningful clinical benefits, providing greater precision along with more efficient and effective cutting and coagulation in open or laparoscopic procedures.

TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION XMP is Adobe’s description format for Network Publishing. Based on World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C) standards, the XMP framework provides an open standard for eXtensible Markup Language (XML) metadata exchange. Because XMP encloses metadata inside application files, it creates significant opportunity in areas of digital rights management and workflow automation. Adobe Acrobat ® 5. 0, Adobe InDesign ® 2. 0, and Adobe Illustrator ® 10 support XMP. Eventually, XMP will be integrated into the next generation of all Adobe applications. Designed for integration with publishing workflow systems of all kinds, XMP facilitates easy metadata exchange between applications and systems. Documents that exit these systems retain the metadata and therefore retain their context and intent. Network Publishing is built on standards XMP is a labeling system for documents and digital assets. The labels are designed to be machine readable. When applications and systems read these labels, they can act on the documents they describe. Because XMP and all Adobe Network Publishing technology is built on standards, XMP provides a way of labeling documents that is both easy to implement and beneficial to workflow systems of all kinds.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{translation}} of Italian word reduplication into English, e. g. piccino piccino (teeny weeny). Word reduplication is common in Italian. From a sociolinguistic point of view, it is a diastratic, colloquial variant, extremely frequent in substandard Italian. Although not widely perceived, it is also present – but, it seems, not so common - in English (e. g. bad bad news). Now, if reduplication is a numerically minor pattern in English, and a relatively more marked choice, {{when it comes to}} its English translations what we expect is systematic recourse to other linguistic <b>devices,</b> most notably <b>predicate</b> (i. e. head) to intensifier collocations (e. g. vecchio vecchio [very old]), intensifying similes (e. g. zitto zitto [quiet as a wisper]), and superlative predicates (e. g. cattivo cattivo cattivo [disgusting]). It makes sense therefore to focus on the implications for the translator.

Informal caregiving {{by family members}} has been a substantial, cost-effective resource for the medical system. More recently, complex devices {{have made it possible}} to sustain patient's lives at home in more acute situations for longer periods of time. The arguments supporting the use of home care <b>devices</b> have been <b>predicated</b> on improving patients' quality of life since patients want to live out their life in their home. Ethically, this has been advocated as a means by which medicine can support patient-autonomy. This assumes the patient had a choice in using these devices and, more broadly, that the family caregiver had any choice. Autonomy fails to distinguish that a patient's autonomous choice is based on the expectation of use and that family will provide care. I will argue that neither the care recipient nor caregiver has autonomy and that the relationship they share is far more important. This usual deference to patient-autonomy overlooks the caregiver, the true user, on whom the patient and the system is reliant. Pushing this cultural objective of sustaining autonomy are the home care technologies themselves through the force of the technological imperative. While we often conceive of technologies as neutral objects, I argue they are cultural artifacts reflecting social values and practices. These values are imbued in these technologies' development and design by biomedical scientists and engineers who create them. These same people, though, are separated from the values and needs of family caregivers, challenging the goals of home care. I will argue they should not be separated since they are not neutral but rather moral actors within the larger context of the medical sociotechnical system...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{endovascular}} {{treatment of}} intracranial saccular aneurysms {{has been shown}} to be an effective treatment method, but it remains marked by aneurysm recanalization despite continued development of new device technologies. Polyurethane-based shape memory polymer (SMP) foams are advantageous biomaterials for endovascular embolization applications, however previously developed devices utilizing SMP foam for neurovascular embolization treatment were limited by required catheter sizes, insufficient flexibility and radiopacity, and inconsistent device stability within the aneurysm sac. Solvent-stimulated actuation of hydrophobic SMP foams using DMSO and EtOH was shown to be an effective alternative shape memory trigger to direct heating. Dramatic decreases in Tg were observed with exposure to water, DMSO, and EtOH. Rapid shape recovery and volume swelling were observed for SMP foams in high concentrations of both DMSO and EtOH, as well as in decreased concentrations of EtOH. A SMP foam-over-wire (FOW) neurovascular embolization device was evaluated using in vitro and in vivo saccular aneurysm models as an initial prototype design. In vivo porcine aneurysms were successfully occluded using FOW devices with theoretical volume occlusion values greater than reported values for <b>predicate</b> <b>devices</b> and rapid, stable thrombus formation. FOW devices were successful in treating sidewall aneurysm models, though the study suggested a need to improve the deliverability and radiopacity of the devices and to evaluate the occlusion effectiveness in more clinically relevant aneurysm geometries. A SMP foam-coated coil (FCC) embolization device was designed and demonstrated clinician-familiar deliverability and use combined with large packing density and scaffolding capability of porous SMP foam. Excellent cytocompatibility is a promising early result in showing biocompatibility. FCC devices exhibited smooth delivery, but difficult packing in both benchtop and rabbit elastase aneurysm models highlights the need to improving device stiffness. However, though packing in rabbit aneurysms was poor, the tissue response suggests a desired healing process and a promising indication that the more effectively packed FCC devices will prompt stable, long-term tissue healing. Overall, the device designed through this work demonstrates excellent potential for improving long-term clinical outcomes for patients with intracranial saccular aneurysms, whether ruptured or unruptured...|$|R

The main requirement of a suitable method for spinal wear simulation {{has to be the}} ability to distinguish between design concepts and allow for a direct comparison of <b>predicate</b> <b>devices.</b> The objective of our study was to investigate the influence of loading and kinematic patterns based on two different protocols for spinal wear simulation (ISO/FDIS 18192 - 1 (2006) and ASTM F 2423 - 05). In vitro wear simulation was performed with six activ® L lumbar artificial disc devices (Aesculap Tuttlingen, Germany). The applied kinematic pattern of movement was multidirectional for ISO (elliptic track) and unidirectional with a curvilinear shape for ASTM. Testing was done for 10 million cycles in the ISO loading mode and afterwards with the same specimens for 5 million cycles according to the ASTM protocol with a customized six-station servohydraulic spinal wear simulator (EndoLab Thansau, Germany). Gravimetrical and geometrical wear assessment, a slide track analysis correlated to an optical surface characterization, and an estimation of particle size and morphology were performed. The gravimetric wear rate for the first 10 million cycles was ISOinitial =  2. 7  ±  0. 3  mg/million cycles. During the ASTM test period (10 – 15 million cycles) a gravimetric wear rate of 0. 14  ±  0. 06  mg/million cycles was estimated. The wear rates between the ISO and ASTM driven simulations differ substantially (approximately 20 -fold) and statistical analysis demonstrates a significant difference (p <  0. 001) between the test groups. The main explanation of divergency between ISO and ASTM driven wear simulations is the multidirectional pattern of movement described in the ISO document resulting in a cross-shear stress on the polyethylene material. Due to previous retrieval observations, it seems to be very unlikely that a lumbar artificial disc is loaded with a linear wear path. Testing according to ASTM F 2423 - 05 with pure unidirectional motion does not reflect the kinematics of TDA patients‘ daily activities. Based on our findings it seems to be more reliable to predict the clinical wear behavior of an artificial disc replacement using the ISO/FDIS 18192 - 1 method...|$|R
