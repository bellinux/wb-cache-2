5000|$|What made Townshend's advance {{possible}} was the anomalous administration {{arrangements that}} he operated under. India was a British Crown Colony {{with its own}} army. The Army of India, which comprised the Indian Army {{and all of the}} British troops in India, was responsible to the Viceroy of India, not the War Office in London, which in practice meant that the Army of India had a considerable degree of autonomy from London. Through London had the ultimate say in the deployment of the Army of India, the Viceroy Lord Hardinge fought hard to preserve his control of his forces, and the War Office had to negotiate with him {{when it came to the}} deployment of his forces as if they were dealing with an allied nation instead of a Crown Colony. Most of the revenue used to fund the Army of India came from selling opium to China, and the end of opium sales to China in 1910 had cost the Indian government about £4 million (about £50 million in 1984 values) without any replacement. For Lord Hardinge, having to operate on reduced means and whose mandate dictated that securing the North-West Frontier was his primary responsibility, the demand to send troops to Europe was unwelcome, and he fought hard to keep the Army of India in India. Failing that, Hardinge wanted the Persian Gulf to be the exclusive responsibility for the Raj, since this was considered a quiet theatre that would not drain away too many troops and by having the Raj protect Britain's oil supplies, allowing him to say that India was making a major contribution to the war effort. The India Office in London wanted the operations in Persian Gulf to be managed by the Raj as a way of showing off how well-run India was under their watch. Most of the oil Britain used came from a series of oil fields around the city of Abadan in Persia-which happened to be very close to the border with the Ottoman Empire-and as most of the British Army was engaged in Europe, the War Office asked Lord Hardinge to provide the troops to take Basra and thus prevent the Ottomans from violating Persian neutrality to seize Abadan. In exchange for giving up control of the Indian divisions sent in the fall of 1914 to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, Hardinge had the entire Persian Gulf region made the exclusive responsibility of the Army of India. As a consequence, Force D with its headquarters in Basra that was operating in Mesopotamia took its orders from the Indian Army's headquarters in Shimla, while the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) with its headquarters in Cairo that was operating in the Sinai took its orders from the CIGS in London. Despite the fact that both Force D and the Egyptian Expeditionary Force were engaged against the Ottoman Empire, co-operation between the two forces was very poor, with for example, two intelligence services operating in the Near East that refused to share information with one another under the grounds that the other service was a [...] "rival". The intelligence service based in Cairo had a number of Arabic and Turkish speakers attached to it, while there were few intelligence officers in the Indian Army who were fluent in Arabic or Turkish, which meant the EEF had better intelligence. The lack of good intelligence was to be a recurring problem for Townshend, who consistently received intelligence that underestimated both the quantity and quality of the Ottoman forces against him. As all of the troops in Mesopotamia were responsible to Lord Hardinge, who was not much interested in what his officers were doing in the Middle East-saying that ruling the Empire of India was enough work-and was inclined to give them a free rein to do whatever they wanted. Likewise, Beauchamp Duff, the commander of the Army of India, lived in Shimla, which was a long way from Basra and simply had no interest in Mesopotamia, being known as the [...] "hermit clerk", owing to his reclusive nature and his obsession with paperwork at the expense of everything else. Because the War Office in London had no operational control over the forces in Mesopotamia until 1916 and Lord Hardinge and Duff lacked the willingness to assert their authority, officers on the ground had much freedom to conduct their policies. [...] The War Secretary, Field Marshal Sir Herbert Kitchener, was opposed to the idea of an advance to take Baghdad, arguing that it would drain away resources needed for the Western Front to take a target of no real military value for prestige, but the Persian Gulf was Lord Hardinge's area of responsibility, and Kitchener could not convince the cabinet to stop the operation. The Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leading his nation during a world war, and under his leadership cabinet meetings tended to drag on and on, as he sought a consensus between opposing factions instead of deciding <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>course</b> or another. The Asquith cabinet reached a compromise: allow Force D to advance on Baghdad, but give first priority to supplying the Western Front.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the use of nested parallelism. Our claim {{is that if the}} problem {{naturally}} possesses multiple levels of parallelism, then applying parallelism to all levels may significantly enhance the scalability of your algorithm. This claim is sustained by numerical experiments. We also discuss how to implement multi-level parallelism using OpenMP. We find current OpenMP implementation, based on version 1. 0, to have severe limitation for implementing nested parallelization. We then show how this can be circumvented by explicitly assign task to threads. Load balancing issues become more complicated with two (or more) levels of parallelism. To handle this problem, we have designed a distribution algorithm which groups threads into teams, each team being responsible <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>course</b> grain outer-level task. This algorithm is proven to produce the optimal load balance, under given assumptions. Keywords: OpenMP, SMP-parallelism, nested parallelism 1...|$|E
