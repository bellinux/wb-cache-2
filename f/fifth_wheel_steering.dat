40|$|Abstract- This paper discuses sensor {{steering}} mechanism (SSM) for a laterally guided vehicle with a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism. The authors {{have demonstrated the}} geometry of SSMs for front <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> type and reverse phase four-wheel steering type vehicles. SSMs allow stable lateral guiding performance for automated vehicles following a path with straight and curved portions created by a guideway. On other hand, no SSM has been established for a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> type vehicle. Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles include forklifts and backward moving conventional motor vehicles which are front wheel vehicles. A SSM for rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles would enable a forklift to move into any spaces using automation. This paper proposes a SSM relation for a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicle and describes the construction of experimental robotic vehicle with the proposed SSM.

50|$|Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> {{tends to}} be {{unstable}} because in turns the steering geometry changes hence decreasing the turn radius (over steer), rather than increase it (under steer). Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is meant for slower vehicles that need high-maneuverability in tight spaces, e.g. fork lifts.|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} {{investigated in}} this study are (1) the design and analysis of strategies to control the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> on four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> automobiles; and (2) the estimation of lateral stability regions for a nonlinear 2 DOF vehicle;Rear Wheel Controllers are developed using linear optimal control theory under the assumption that all states are available, however, this assumption is rarely true. A methodology is then developed to use a minimum number of measurable states to obtain suboptimal rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> controllers which are less expensive and could be practically implemented. The methodology is based on achieving zero phase lag difference between yaw rate and lateral acceleration, and zero sideslip angle;It is shown analytically, using Routh Hurwith criteria, eigenvalue analysis and Lyapunov method, that at high speeds the suboptimal rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> controllers enhances the stability and improves the performance of four wheel fixed and free steering control vehicles. At low speeds, the effects of time lagged lateral tire force on front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles are studied and new stability conditions are derived;The influence of vehicle rolling motion is examined and a new rear wheel controller which includes roll parameters is developed. New steady-state handling conditions for the front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles are also derived;To further enhance vehicle design, the nonlinear numerical optimization method of sequential quadratic programming is used in conjunction with Routh Hurwitz criteria to determine the most restrictive stability conditions for front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles;Lyapunov second method, constrained optimization, and reverse trajectory methods are employed to estimate the lateral stability region, of a nonlinear two degree of freedom vehicle model, analytically and with minimal computation. New analytic expressions are derived for the equilibrium points for a nonlinear 2 DOF vehicle. These expressions assist in defining the outer limits of the lateral stability regions;The robustness of the rear wheel controllers are investigated via an eight degree-of-freedom nonlinear spread tire vehicle model. The results indicate that the high speed handling of four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles are generally superior to the corresponding front <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} an active safety {{system for a}} wheeled armored vehicle to encounter {{the effect of the}} firing force. The firing force which acts as an external disturbance causes unwanted yaw moment occurred at the center of gravity of the wheeled armored vehicle. This effect causes the wheeled armored vehicle lose its handling stability and the traveling path after the firing condition. In order to overcome the stability problem, a Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active Front <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> system is proposed in this study. This system is developed based on two established systems, namely, Firing-On-the-Move and Active Front <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> systems. The proposed system is designed to improve the handling and directional stability performances of the armored vehicle while fires in dynamic condition. Four types of control strategies are designed and investigated in this study to identify the most optimum control strategy as the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active Front <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> system using optimization tool, genetic algorithm. The control strategies for the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active Front <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> are evaluated using various types of vehicle speeds and firing angle in order to obtain an appropriate control structure as the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an Active Front <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> system for the wheeled armored vehicle...|$|R

5000|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> for motorized trucks is often credited to US inventor Charles H. Martin of the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> Co. who invented the device in 1915. [...] It was submitted for patent in 1915, and finalized in 1916. Herman Farr invented it, and Martin hooked up with him and became the assignee. When they formed the Martin <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> company Martin was president and Farr was named secretary. The 5th wheel was Farr's invention. Martin capitalized on it. [...] "It's a fair question whether you really can consider the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> as a milestone separate from the semi-trailer. After all, {{the purpose of the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> is to link the tractor and the trailer; indeed, trailers existed before Charles H. Martin introduced the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> in 1915. At the time, the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> literally was a wheel that moved with the trailer—unlike today’s technology that secures a kingpin. What makes the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> so important is the ability it gave fleet owners to attach large trailers to tractors easily and safely and the freedom it gave them to switch out trailers. Without a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the modern distribution system would look quite different as drop-and-hook would not be easy. The semi-trailer increased the capacity of trucks, but it was the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> that brought the flexibility for drivers to keep moving while receivers unloaded the loads they just delivered." ...|$|R

40|$|Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is a {{well-known}} technology that has been researched for many years but have only had limited market acceptance in niche applications. Increased urbanization {{and the advent of}} autonomous drive could change the impact of rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> in favor of greater market acceptance but in what way needs to be better understood. Low-speed maneuverability and highway lateral comfort are two attributes believed to be affected by the introduction of rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> Lateral comfort includes comfort in the general sense with vibrations and high-frequency oscillations, but also low-frequency oscillations which may lead to motion sickness. A literature study was conducted in order to better understand the nature of motion which causes discomfort in automobiles, and means of evaluating comfort. A frequency weighting according to ISO-standard was used for comfort and a weighting found in literature was used for motion sickness in the lateral direction as this is still an unexplored area. Maneuverability was assessed using two analytical cases; curvature and swept path width, and two driving scenarios; rear-end parking and driving through a T-crossing. Two control laws were used; one feedforward and one feedback. The feedforward control law was designed to keep the body side slip angle zero at steady state cornering, and the feedback control was taken from literature with the aim of dampening yaw rate. This control law is mainly designed for stability, and was thus not used in low-speed maneuvers and only used for comparison in highway maneuvers. The angle on the rear wheels was limited to +/- 5 °. Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> performed well at low speeds, improving the maneuverability by increasing the maximum curvature for a given <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angle by 12 % and decreasing the swept path width up to 14 %. The vehicle with rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> also performed better in the driving scenarios by occupying less space during the maneuver. Overtaking and a sinus steer were the two maneuvers used to assess comfort and motion sickness. Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> at high speeds decreased the measures of discomfort by 8. 17 % in the sinus steer maneuver and with 18. 16 % for a passenger in the rear seat, and MSDV is decreased by 7. 32 % in the sinus steer and by 4. 04 % in the overtaking maneuver for a passenger in the rear seat, implying that a vehicle equipped with rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is more comfortable. Yaw stability was assessed as a final objective where it was shown that rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> both the feedforward and feedback control, improved stability leading to a safer vehicle. To conclude, {{the results of this study}} implies that rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> can lead to improved maneuverability in low-speeds, improved comfort during highway driving, and improved safety in terms of stability...|$|R
