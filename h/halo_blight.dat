The implementation and adoption of MAS in {{breeding for disease resistance}} is advanced compared to the implementation of MAS for insect and abiotic stress resistance. Highlighted examples of breeding in common bean using molecular markers reveal the role and success of MAS in gene pyramiding, rapidly deploying resistance genes via marker-assisted backcrossing, enabling simpler detection and selection of resistance genes in absence of the pathogen, and contributing to simplified breeding of complex traits by detection and indirect selection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major effects. The current status of MAS in breeding {{for resistance}} to angular leaf spot, anthracnose, Bean common mosaic and Bean common mosaic necrosis viruses, Beet curly top virus, Bean golden yellow mosaic virus, common bacterial <b>blight,</b> <b>halo</b> bacterial <b>blight,</b> rust, root rots, and white mold is reviewed in detail. Cumulative mapping of disease resistance traits has revealed new resistance gene clusters while adding to others, and reinforces the co-location of QTL conditioning resistance with specific resistance genes and defense-related genes. Breeding for resistance to insect pests is updated for bean pod weevil (Apion), bruchid seed weevils, leafhopper, thrips, bean fly, and whitefly, including the use of arcelin proteins as selectable markers for resistance to bruchid seed weevils. Breeding for resistance to abiotic stresses concentrates on drought, low soil phosphorus, and improved symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The combination of root growth and morphology traits, phosphorus uptake mechanisms, root acid exudation, and other traits in alleviating phosphorus deficiency, and identification of numerous QTL of relatively minor effect associated with each trait, reveals the complexity to be addressed in breeding for abiotic stress resistance in common bean.

50|$|Common {{beans in}} {{moderate}} temperature regions {{are victims of}} halo blights. Main hosts are lima beans, red kidney bean, cranberry yellow eye field beans, snap beans, scarlet runner, kudzu vine and common P.vulgaris. <b>Halo</b> <b>blight</b> is affected by environment factors and enter through plant injuries or natural openings. The development of the <b>Halo</b> <b>blight</b> is highly favored by cool temperature (such as 20-23°C), unlike other common bacterial blights. In warm temperatures (over 24 °C), the production of phaseolotoxin decreases and symptoms become less obvious. Phaseolotoxin is a toxin produced by <b>Halo</b> <b>blight</b> pathogen which causes systemic chlorosis. <b>Halo</b> <b>blight</b> causes small water-soaked spots on leaves. These spot progressively turn dark brown and are surrounded by a wide greenish yellow halo. The necrotic spots remain small unlike that of common blight. Similar to foliage symptoms, halo blights causes water-soaked spots on vegetative pods. It also causes streaks along pod sutures. If lesions becomes severe on the pods, it may penetrate the pod walls or expand into the pod sutures which causes the seed to be wrinkled and discolored (yellow patches on the seed coat). Systemic infections are not common, but occur more favorably in some dry bean varieties. If the disease develops a systemic infection, it will cause curling, yellowing and death of young leaflets.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacterial <b>halo</b> <b>blight,</b> {{caused by}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae, is an {{important}} disease of coffee crop occurring in Brazil and other countries. In recent years, outbreaks of this disease have damaged several coffee crops in Brazil. Aggressiveness and genetic diversity of 25 strains of P. s. pv. garcae, obtained between the years 1958 and 2011, in 23 cities of São Paulo and Minas Gerais states, as well as three strains from Kenya were evaluated in this study. The strains were inoculated on coffee seedlings cultivar Mundo Novo, and their genetic diversity was evaluated by ERIC-PCR, REP-PCR, and their combination. All the strains were pathogenic to the coffee seedlings; the results of pathogenicity tests, in both experiments, could be divided in four aggressiviness classes (highly aggressive; aggressive; moderately aggressive and less aggressive). The Kenyan strains grouped separately from the Brazilian strains with ERIC-PCR and the combination of ERIC- and REP-PCR. The Brazilian strains could be grouped in two sub-clusters, the first including the older strains, obtained from 1958 to 1978, and the other comprising the remaining strains. With a few exceptions, strains isolated from 1997 to 2011, grouped mainly by their region of origin, were predominantly isolated from higher altitude regions, above 800 m.

Diseaseresistant cultivars should ensure improved seed yields and yield stability, and seed quality, and reduce pesticide application. Upright growth habit, combined with a porous plant canopy, can provide an avoidance mechanism to reduce white mold by improving air circulation, resulting in rapid drying of dew on the foliage (Deshpande et al., 1995). An adapted, highyielding Great Northern cultivar with resistance to strains of the above bacterial and rust pathogens prevailing in Nebraska is needed. An architectural avoidance of white mold is also required {{because there is no}} high level of physiological resistance in common beans to that pathogen. Presently, there is no Great Northern variety with this combination of desirable traits. The Great Northern ‘Weihing’ cultivar released in 1998 has the above combination of traits, and should reduce production costs. Origin ‘Weihing’ was derived from intercrosses of advanced lines developed from crosses of adapted and exotic dry bean parents possessing desired traits (Fig. 1). Pedigree selection was used to develop near-homozygous lines for intercrossing cycles. The advanced lines used for intercrossing possessed resistance to rust and levels of resistance to common bacterial blight and <b>halo</b> <b>blight,</b> as well as some avoidance of white mold disease because of upright and more open architecture. Multiple parents were used in the crosses. GN Nebr. # 1 sel. 27 was a source of resistance to common blight and <b>halo</b> <b>blight</b> (Coyne and Schuster, 1974). ‘Tacaragua’ (black bean) (source: N. E.

Early inheritance studies observed both monogenic and polygenic resistance (reviewed by Schwartz, 1989). More recently, a host– pathogen differential series based on leaf reaction was developed and used to identify five putative major resistance (R) genes in the host and corresponding avirulence genes in the pathogen (Tever-son, 1991; Taylor et al., 1996 a,b). The host resistance genes R 1, R 2, R 3, R 4, and R 5 were characterized primarily by segregation in F 2 populations for reaction to discerning races from a set of nine differ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the reaction of tolerant and susceptible parents and F 1 hybrids between these parents to race 1 and race 2 of the <b>halo</b> <b>blight</b> bacterium when inoculated with a high and low bacterial cell concentration, the inheritance of the leaf, systematic chlorosis, and immature pod reactions to race 1 and to determine if these different reactions were under the control of the same genes or different genes. Included in the study was a test to determine if the same gene controlled the reaction to race 1 and 2 in a cross between a susceptible x tolerant line. A test was also performed to determine if the same gene controlled the reaction to race 1 in a cross between two tolerant lines. Advisors: Dermot P. Coyne and M. L. Schuste...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448 a (P. syringae 1448 a), the causative {{agent of}} bean <b>halo</b> <b>blight,</b> is a {{bacterium}} capable of occupying diverse biological niches. Under conditions of iron starvation P. syringae 1448 a secretes siderophores for active uptake of iron. The primary siderophore of P. syringae 1448 a is pyoverdine, a fluorescent molecule that is assembled from amino acid precursors by non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes. Whereas {{other species of}} Pseudomonas often exhibit structural variations in the pyoverdine produced by different strains, all P. syringae pathovars previously tested {{have been found to}} make an identical pyoverdine molecule. P. syringae 1448 a also appears to have the genetic potential to make two secondary siderophores, achromobactin and yersiniabactin, each of which has previously been detected in different P. syringae pathovars. Results Five putative pyoverdine NRPS genes in P. syringae 1448 a were characterized in-silico and their role in pyoverdine biosynthesis was confirmed by gene knockout. Pyoverdine was purified from P. syringae 1448 a and analyzed by MALDI-TOF and MS/MS spectroscopy. Peaks were detected corresponding to the expected sizes for the pyoverdine structure previously found in other P. syringae pathovars, but surprisingly P. syringae 1448 a appears to also produce a variant pyoverdine species that has an additional 71 Da monomer incorporated into the peptide side chain. Creation of pyoverdine null mutants of P. syringae 1448 a revealed that this strain also produces achromobactin as a temperature-regulated secondary siderophore, but does not appear to make yersiniabactin. Pyoverdine and achromobactin null mutants were characterized in regard to siderophore production, iron uptake, virulence and growth in iron limited conditions. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence of a P. syringae pathovar producing a side chain variant form of pyoverdine. We also describe novel IC 50 and liquid CAS assays to quantify the contribution of different siderophores across a range of iron starvation conditions, and show that although achromobactin has potential to contribute to fitness its contribution is masked by the presence of pyoverdine, which is a significantly more effective siderophore. Neither pyoverdine nor achromobactin appear to be required for P. syringae 1448 a to cause bean <b>halo</b> <b>blight,</b> indicating that these siderophores are not promising targets for crop protection strategies. </p...|$|E
