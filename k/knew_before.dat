[...] According to actress Jennifer Morrison, they chose this particular story as a way to further reveal Emma's history, as she lacked a fairytale counterpart. Morrison explained, [...] "They’re using Hansel and Gretel as they did Cinderella to reveal some of Emma’s backstory. So what Emma goes through to try to help these children ends up becoming very personal for her, as her own life [...] is in a sense revealed." ...|$|E

Orr did not play in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, and he wanted badly to play for Canada. Orr {{had been unable to}} play in the Summit Series due to knee surgery, although he did participate as a non-player.

500|$|With Chelsea {{unable to}} garner maximum points in their next two matches, Arsenal <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> their game away at Tottenham that a draw would {{guarantee}} {{their status as}} champions. Cole returned for the derby, after sitting out the Leeds match with an ankle injury. Arsenal took an early lead when Vieira finished off a counter-attacking move. Incisive football brought about the second goal, ten minutes before the break. Bergkamp passed the ball to Vieira, who cut it back for Pirès to sidefoot. Tottenham replied {{in the second half}} by scoring twice – the equaliser a penalty – but it did not stop the Arsenal players celebrating at the final whistle [...] "in front of their supporters' White Hart Lane enclave". This marked the second time the club had been crowned league champions at their rivals' ground: the first time had been in 1971. Wenger praised his team for their success, telling the BBC: [...] "We've been remarkably consistent, haven't lost a game and we have played stylish football. We have entertained people who just love football." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} round of the League Cup, Arsenal faced Derby County at Pride Park. Wenger made several first team changes to give his younger players playing time; Arsenal ran out 2–1 winners, a {{performance}} where [...] "every touch by a Derby player was greeted with ironic cheers." [...] However, the team were beaten comprehensively in the next round to Chelsea at Highbury, losing 0–5. The result inflicted Arsenal's biggest defeat in over eight years and Wenger defended his team selection, virtually a 'second team': [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> the game that this kind of thing might happen. You only had to look at the team sheets. If we had won I would still have gone on playing the same side because the players need the experience." [...] Bergkamp, who was rested for the match, echoed his manager's comments: [...] "We had a lot of young players on the field against Chelsea and, although they were feeling very down after losing like that, they will learn from it. To be honest, the scoreline doesn't mean anything, whether it was 1–0 or 5–0. The supporters will feel bad but I hope they understand Saturday will be a different game [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Under normal conditions, {{games are}} {{considered}} to be official games after five innings, or four and a half if the home team is leading at that point. [...] However, both Rays and Phillies management <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> the first pitch that Commissioner Bud Selig, who is responsible for the scheduling of post-season games, would not allow a team to clinch the Series by winning a rain-shortened game. Thus, the game resumed on October 29 {{in the middle of the}} sixth inning at Citizens Bank Park, with the Phillies batting in the bottom of the sixth inning. Pinch hitter Geoff Jenkins led off with a double and was bunted to third by Rollins. Batting third, Jayson Werth batted in Jenkins to give the Phillies the lead, 3–2. Rocco Baldelli re-tied the game at three runs with a solo home run in the top of the seventh inning, but Jason Bartlett was thrown out at home to end the inning on a fake throw-over by Utley, who could not get the ball to first in time to catch the speedy Akinori Iwamura. In the bottom of the seventh, Pat Burrell led off with a double; Eric Bruntlett entered as a pinch runner and scored on a hit by Pedro Feliz to put the Phillies up by a run again. Brad Lidge gave up a single and a stolen base but struck out Eric Hinske for the final out, sealing the Phillies' first World Series championship since the 1980 World Series, and the city's first major sports championship in 25 years.|$|E

2500|$|Sudak {{proved to}} be a {{productive}} writing time for Parnok and in 1919, she published in an almanac a substantial number of lyrics, which focused on her new-found spiritual journey. She prepared most of the poems for two journals which would be published later. These demonstrated her poetic evolution from her past to her future. Her collection Roses of Pieria (1922) clearly evoked the influence of Sappho, with her acknowledgement of the first lesbian poet. The poems reflected her attempt to write of her experiences and desire as a sexually active lover of women, but she stylized her homoerotic verse {{in a way that was}} almost alien to her natural poetic voice. She was unsatisfied with the collection and <b>knew</b> <b>before</b> it was published that her next collection was more authentically her own. The Vine (1923) incorporated the influence of Eugenia Gertsyk, presenting her own account in lyrical form of her development as a lesbian poet. Using biblical symbolism, she wrote of the physical rapture and suffering of her body which diverted her quest to grow spiritually and produce poetry as her dedicated vocation.|$|E

The Gemara asked how Noah would know. Rav Hisda taught that Noah led them past the Ark, and those that the Ark accepted had certainly not been the object of sin, while those that the Ark rejected had certainly been the object of sin.
