5000|$|With series’ like Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder and Jane the Virgin, we {{are finally}} seeing {{a rise of}} {{representation}} for of women of color on television. Not only are we seeing a rise in supporting roles but many are leading shows on a major network during prime-time. With rising numbers of representation in cast members and TV shows, {{it is important to}} note that this took approximately 38 years after Teresa Graves starred in Get Christie Love!, a 1974 series on ABC that marked the first African American woman to star in an hour-long drama. There would be no woman of color leading a television show until 2012 when Kerry Washington starred in Shonda Rimes’ Scandal on ABC. Due to Washington’s work, for “the second season of Scandal, Washington was nominated for an Emmy at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, becoming the first African-American woman to be nominated in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 18 years.” [...] While these shows are making positive waves and impact on society, {{it is important to note}} that “Minorities account for more than 40% of the US population in 2014” and will continue to rise until they are the dominant race. Yet, “minorities remain underrepresented nearly six to one in broadcast scripted leads and nearly two to one among cable scripted leads”. That number gets significantly smaller when we look at women of color, who accounted for only 4% of ALL television shows in the 2016-2017 new television season. The number get significantly more depressing when Variety magazine wrote an article on upcoming television shows that featured a female minority in 2016. “There were no non-white female showrunners on new shows for ABC, CBS, or the CW as of press time for any new upcoming show premiers that feature a woman of color at this point in time”. [...] These numbers show how unimportant a female minority leading a show is to Hollywood. According to Hollywood Reports, the majority of Americans want films and or television with more diversity in them. Their numbers also imply that “minorities accounted for the majority of ticket sales for four of the top ten films in 2014. Including the highest grossing film of the year.” With numbers like these it is astonishing to see how minorities are only encompassing 10% of the 2016-2017 season line ups. In the words of Dr. Stacy Smith, we are witnessing an epidemic of invisibility. Dr. Smith, the Director of the Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative which is a “leading think tank dedicated to addressing issues of inequality in entertainment”, presented a speech to Ted Talks titled “The data behind Hollywood's sexism”. Here, Dr. Smith gives hard cold facts about how much sexism is in movies stating that “across the top 100 films of <b>just</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> 48 films didn't feature one black or African-American speaking character. 70 films were devoid of Asian or Asian-American speaking characters that were girls or women. Eighty-four films didn't feature one female character that had a disability. And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual or transgender female speaking characters”. Dr. smith continues to prove that the data for movies have not changed in over half a century even though women are half of the world population. With such an underwhelming amount of representation she gives us hope by stating how we can help turn the tide. One of her proposed solutions is to hire more female directors, writers, and creators. When females are behind the camera, they are likely to hire more women for casting and behind the scenes. We can see this fact put into reality with Shonda Rimes a television producer, screenwriter, creator, and most recently an author. “She is best known as the creator, head writer, executive producer, and showrunner of the television medical drama Grey's Anatomy, its spin-off Private Practice, and the political thriller series Scandal” (...) [...] She is also an executive producer on How to get away with murder, The Catch, Off the Map, and soon to be Still Star-Crossed. All her shows star either a female lead, female supporting cast member, and/or an ensemble of women and always has a woman of color represented within those parameters. With women like Rimes making waves through television, women of color, especially adolescent minorities, can see people who look like themselves on television represented in book smart, fashionable, high entry level jobs, government positions, doctors, surgeons, lawyers, soldiers, and many more positions in life. Not only are they seeing a positive representation of themselves but they are also seeing strong women break out of the normal stereotyped roles that women of color are used to. This is the opposite of how women of color have been represented in the past. According to Jane Caputti and Lauri Sagle, “In her 1994 book, Fatal Women, Linda Hart argues that, first of all, women, of color rarely appear at all in dominate cultural representations” (...) [...] Rimes and others are challenging this stereotype and proving to the public that women of color can be a dominate force on television and in films. Goodbye to film and television shows that depict suburban White middleclass family life, in the way it naturalized class and gender identities through patterns of consumption and the spatial layout of the home, to the female consumer” (...) [...] Goodbye to the stereotypical Mammy, fake Hispanic accents, angry black woman syndrome, and many more stereotypes that have haunted and limited Hollywood for decades and, and hello to Jane the Virgin, Quantico, Empire, Blackish, Orange is the new Black, Angie Tribeca, Sleepy Hallow, Underground, Chewing Gum, Insecure, Being Mary Jane, Dear White People, and the Mindy Project, the new face of Hollywood. All have shattered stereotypical images of women of color. All have rose to critical acclaim and have thrust themselves into the spotlight. All have a diverse background of actors, and all have shown women around the world that the color of their skin is not a limitation and they can anything that they set their minds to.|$|E
