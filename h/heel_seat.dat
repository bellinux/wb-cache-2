40|$|A shoe wearer's comfort {{is related}} to the shape of the footbed of a shoe. Even though the footbed shape is {{important}} in footwear design, there exists no methodology to evaluate the existing guidelines used in last making. Thirty-two females participated in an experiment where <b>heel</b> <b>seat</b> length, <b>heel</b> <b>seat</b> inclination and heel height were investigated using the profile assessment device. The dependent variables were plantar pressure and perceived feeling of each participant. The results show that perceived feel is best for wedge angles of 4 degrees and 5 degrees at a heel height of 25 mm, 10 degrees and 11 degrees at a heel height of 50 mm and 16 degrees and 18 degrees at a heel height of 75 mm. A regression model was derived and this explained approximately 80 % of the variation of perceived feeling with the contact area, peak plantar pressure and percentage of force acting on the forefoot region. Both heel wedge angle and <b>heel</b> <b>seat</b> length {{play an important role in}} the perceived feel of high-heeled shoes. This study, in relation to the load-bearing heel part of a shoe, highlights the importance of good footbed design. The findings can be used to design footwear with enhanced comfort. close 71...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the loaded foot and the footbed is critical for footwear fit and comfort. Previous {{studies have shown that}} altering plantar pressure distributions can affect comfort. Hence a good fitting footbed is important for improving footwear comfort. The focus of this thesis was to investigate the necessary shape for the footbed in order to improve comfort for any foot shape. The perceived footwear fit in midfoot and forefoot in medio-lateral sides was highly correlated with the dimensional differences between foot and shoe-last in the corresponding regions. A fit that is neither tight nor loose can be achieved when the dimensional difference is around 8 mm on the width at toe region and around 15 mm on the midfoot width. In order to study various footbed shapes, a novel mechanical device was invented. The device was able to vary heel height, heel wedge angle, <b>heel</b> <b>seat,</b> shank shape, arch length and toe spring. The footbed shape deformations were estimated using structural bending theories where the largest estimation error found was 3. 70 mm at the midfoot region. Thereafter, the effects of footbed shapes on the plantar foot shape were studied in detail since the changes in foot shape have to be accounted for when designing shoes. It was found that the structure of the midfoot can change independently thereby creating changes in its plantar shape. The participants taking part in the experiment were able to judge these shape changes in the midfoot region and showed different preferences for different midfoot shapes. Knowing the characteristics of midfoot deformation, various footbed shapes were studied at different heel heights to understand their relation to perceived footwear comfort. It was found that there exists a unique footbed surface shape for the foot to feel comfortable at each tested heel height. In order to obtain such a footbed shape there are three conditions that have to be satisfied simultaneously: the contact area has to be higher than that of when standing on a flat surface, the peak pressure has to be lower than approximately 100 kPa and the percentage of force acting on the forefoot has to be approximately within 15 % to 22. 5 % of the total force. Prediction models (i. e. for each heel height) were proposed and validated based on the comfortable footbed shapes to predict the required footbed shape for given basic foot dimensions. An algorithm was proposed to transform an unconstrained 3 D foot shape (when standing on floor) in to a shape where the foot is supported on a comfortable footbed shape. The accuracy of the above mentioned 3 D foot modeling algorithm was within ± 1. 02 cm. The findings from this thesis, including the footbed prediction models and the invented device, have the potential to be integrated into footwear design, thus improving footwear comfort...|$|E

5000|$|If a horse bucks, {{the best}} {{solution}} is to use one direct rein to pull the horse's head sideways and up, turning the horse in a small circle. If a rider pulls the horse's head up with both reins, the horse's neck is stronger and the rider {{is likely to be}} flipped over the horse's head. By turning the horse sideways, the rider has more leverage and a horse cannot easily buck while turning around. When the horse stops bucking, it must be asked to move forward; a horse also cannot buck very hard while moving forward. Usually a horse gives some warning that it is about to buck by dropping its head, slowing down or stopping, and excessively rounding up in the back (cowboys referred to this as [...] "getting a lump in the back"). To discourage bucking when the rider anticipates it, the rider should ask the horse to move forward or in a circle, raise their hands and the horse's head, and deliberately put the horse into a hollowed-out frame for a moment by sitting back a bit with their <b>heels</b> down, <b>seat</b> deep, and shoulders slightly back. This will help a rider stay in balance if the horse bucks, and the act of deliberately raising the head and hollowing out the horse's back reduces the power and severity of the buck. Certain training aids, such as a gag bit, certain types of martingale or, particularly on ponies, an overcheck, may also discourage bucking.|$|R
40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} if exercising with manual compressionfoot-pumps, {{could be used}} as an intervention to improve dialysis efﬁcacy. A  pre test -post test design was used to test the intervention. Subjects were {{invited to participate in the}} study depending on whether they ﬁtted the eligibility criteria of the study. Eight weeks after entry into the study pre-test values of dialysis efﬁcacy (Kt/V) were established prior to the implementation of an eight-week exercise programme followed by the collection of post intervention dialysis efﬁcacy values. Subjects performed <b>seated</b> <b>heel</b> raises with manual compression foot-pumps on their feet (Venous A nti-stasis Slippers) for 20 continuous minutes per hour for the ﬁrst three hours of their dialysis sessions (two or three times per week). Twelve subjects ﬁnished the programme. During the eight weeks of exercise an increaseof 8. 7 % was noted in Kt/V  values with a mean change of 0. 12 (p= 0. 04). It appears that an eight week exercise programme using manual compression foot pumps (Venous A nti-stasis Slippers) may be effective in improving dialysisefﬁciency. These ﬁndings need to be tested in a study with an appropriate sample size. </em...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the incidence and risk factors for developing pressure injuries (PIs) in patients placed on a static air support surfaces: mattress overlay, <b>heel</b> wedge, and <b>seat</b> cushion. DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 176 residents; their mean age was 87 (SD = 6. 76) years; their mean Braden Scale score was 14 (SD = 2. 54). The study was performed on a convenience sample of 6 nursing homes in Belgium. METHODS: Data were collected on 23 care units. The primary outcome measure, cumulative PI incidence (category [stage] II-IV) over a 30 -day observation period, was calculated. Pressure injury occurrence was defined according to the 2014 European and US National Pressure Injury Advisory panels, Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance classification system. RESULTS: The PI incidence for category (stage) II-IV was 5. 1 %. Six residents (3. 4 %) developed a category II PI, and 3 (1. 7 %) developed a category III PI; no category IV ulcers occurred. No significant risk factors for category II-IV PIs were identified using multivariate logistic regression. Time of sitting in a chair was found to be a risk factor for development of nonblanchable erythema (category I PI) (odds ratio = 21. 608; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 20. 510 - 22. 812; P =. 013). The median time to develop a category II-IV PI was 16 days (interquartile range = 2 - 26). The interrater reliability between the observations of the researcher and nurses on-site was almost perfect (0. 86; 95 % CI, 0. 81 - 0. 91). CONCLUSION: We found a low incidence of PIs when using a static air overlay mattress for patients at risk in a nursing home population. Static air support surfaces, alongside patient-tailored patient repositioning protocols, should be considered to prevent PIs in this patient population...|$|R
