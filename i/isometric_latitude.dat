40|$|As {{traditional}} formulae of Gauss projection {{could not}} be used in polar regions, strict equation of complex conformal colatitude was derived with relationship between conformal colatitude and <b>isometric</b> <b>latitude</b> introduced, and then strict forward expressions of Gauss projection suit for polar regions were carried out. Based on relationship between exponential and trigonometric functions, inverse expressions of polar Gauss projection were derived by means of symbol iteration method. With reference to the forward expressions, corresponding equations of length ratio and meridian convergence for polar Gauss projection were achieved. Finally, Taking CGCS 2000 ellipsoid for example, by comparing with results calculated by formulae of Gauss projection in power series forms, correctness of the proposed expressions was verified. Expressions in this paper are all free from bandwidth, and can be used in the entire poles, which could provide important references for polar mapping and navigation...|$|E
40|$|A {{conformal}} approximation to the Transverse Mercator (TM) map projection, global in longitude lambda and <b>isometric</b> <b>latitude</b> q, is constructed. New formulas for {{the point}} scale factor and grid convergence are also shown. Assuming {{that the true}} values of the TM coordinates are given by conveniently truncated Gauss-Kruger series expansions, we use the maximum norm of the absolute error to measure globally {{the accuracy of the}} approximation. For a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone the accuracy equals 0. 21 mm, whereas for the region of the ellipsoid bounded by the meridians +/- 20 A degrees the accuracy is equal to 0. 3 mm. Our approach is based on a four-term perturbation series approximation to the radius r(q) of the parallel q, with a maximum absolute deviation of 0. 43 mm. The small parameter of the power series expansion is the square of the eccentricity of the ellipsoid. This closed approximation to r(q) is obtained by solving a regularly perturbed Cauchy problem with the Poincar, method of the small parameter. ...|$|E

Expressions are deduced showing the equality of these u hyperbolic functions with {{the functions of the}} conformal ellipsoidal latitude, and enclosing them in the Taylor’s series expansion of the latter expression of the difference between the conformal latitude and the corresponding geodetic latitude. We report numerical examples in order to verify that the accuracy of the expressions is driven up to the order of double machine precision eps with which the numerical data in “Floating Point” using electronic computers and various program-ming and computing languages are represented and processed. The mixed polynomial form of expressions, with a low computational cost, will make possible, in a later work, their inversions in order to deduce approximate and accurate closed developments (up to double precision eps) in terms of geodetic latitude circular functions of the corresponding u hyperbolic functions; these inversions and further processing works last goal will be a new method to calculate Gaussian cartographic coordinates, with an adequate accuracy for high longitude in geographic time zones...|$|E
40|$|This paper puts forward an {{approximate}} {{expression of the}} conformal ellipsoidal latitude {{in terms of the}} corresponding geodetic latitude and of the even powers of the first eccentricity with coefficients trigonometric polynomial of the geodetic latitude. From the equality of two different developments of the <b>isometric</b> <b>latitude,</b> suitably cut off, it is first obtained - by successive approximations - the difference between the conformal latitude and the corresponding geodetic one, and finally the approximate expression of the conformal latitude. Because of the high degree of eccentricity powers (up to the 12 th) and of the sine function of geodetic latitude (up to the 11 th), the expression is extremely accurate, so it is possible to achieve an approximation in the order of a (double) precision eps with which the numerical data in “Floating Point” using electronic computers and various programming and computing languages are represented and processed. Numerical examples in order to verify the accuracy of the expression are reported. The approximation, that can be obtained with a lower computational cost compared to other expressions reported in geodetic and cartographic literature, and the specific form of this conformal latitude development are necessary for the application reported in a successive article, in order to implement a new calculating method of the Gaussian cartographic coordinates in wide time zone of longitude and with adequate accuracy...|$|E
