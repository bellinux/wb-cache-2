Though a few real-world measurements of road dust {{have been done}} by automated samplers in Sweden, measurement by BSNE (Big Spring Number Eight) and the estimation of total dust generation from vehicle driving is rare. This study measured and analyzed <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> by BSNE at two unpaved roads in Luleå, Sweden, at the driving speed of 20, 30, 40, and 50 km/h different heights. Even though US EPA excluded vehicle speed as a parameter in estimating <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> factors for unpaved roads, this study confirmed a strong dependence of <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> on vehicle speed. This is in agreement with several recent studies which concluded <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> increases with driving speed exponentially or linearly, however the power law is the best description for the data from this study. The comparison with estimated <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> by US EPA’s equation showed the equation underestimates the <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> more than 50 percent when vehicle speed and silt content is higher than 25. 40 km/h and 2. 17 percent respectively.

40|$|Aeolian dust {{studies are}} of global {{importance}} {{due to the}} impact of mineral dust on global climate, human health and the environment. Recent research, for example IPCC (2007) highlighted the important effects of atmospheric dust on global climate that has led to an increased interest in wind-blown mineral dust. Despite this increased interest, there is a dearth of field observations from dust sources due to their remoteness and hostility. This has limited the overall understanding of <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> and led to an over-reliance on model predictions. Thus, there is a strong requirement for field observations to validate model predictions, especially for the Earth's greatest dust source- the Bodele Depression. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a quantitative description of dust emitted at a field study area within the Bodele Depression. This research demonstrates that particle size data can be used to characterise windblown sediments and produce information regarding <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> mechanisms. The data revealed much evidence of aeolian abrasion that formed the foundation for several research hypotheses that were tested statistically using outputs from a <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> and sandblasting model. Findings showed that sandblasting is significantly correlated with <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> and {{plays a key role in}} <b>dust</b> <b>emission.</b> The spatial variation in <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> at the field study area results from spatially heterogeneous aeolian abrasion that is driven by variation in sediment composition (mineralogy) and particle size. The aeolian abrasion of diatomite by quartz grains is a highly efficient mechanism of dust production in the field study area and this was validated by laboratory experiments. This study demonstrates the importance of controls on <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> that need greater emphasis in dust schemes and makes recommendations for adjustments to models. The findings in this study have important implications for dust schemes that underestimate the roles of mineralogy and particle size since they are so influential in <b>dust</b> production and <b>emission.</b> This research improves the current understanding of <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> and advances the ability to more accurately predict <b>dust</b> <b>emission.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

However, it is unknown what affects <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> in the Sahara and precipitation in the Sahel simultaneously. <b>Dust</b> <b>emission</b> in North Africa also undergoes synoptic variability and high concentration of dust is often observed in the western Sahara, but {{it is unclear whether}} dust over the western Sahara is due to local <b>emission</b> or <b>dust</b> transport from the east. The aim of this thesis is twofold, first, to examine the role the Saharan heat low (SHL) plays in <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> and precipitation from synoptic to decadal timescales. and second, to identify bias of dust in the model. To do so I use reanalysis and satellite products to construct the time series of dust, precipitation and the SHL and perform regression analysis to examine the effect of the SHL on precipitation and winds, which are associated with <b>dust</b> <b>emission.</b> Then I study the lead and lag relationship between the SHL and dust concentration in North African on the synoptic scale to identify source regions. Lastly, I identify the biases in a dust source function using dust output from a climate model. The results from this thesis suggest that the warming of the SHL results in the increase of precipitation in the Sahel and the reduction in <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> by changing low-level winds on the decadal timescale. On the synoptic scale, cool phases of the SHL is associated with more <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> and 10 % of the dust over western Africa is from source regions to the east.

This study aims {{to better understand the}} controlling factors that determine the variation of <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> in North Africa over a 27 -year period from 1982 to 2008, using observational data and model simulations. The results show that the model-derived Saharan <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> is only correlated with the 10 -m winds (W 10 m) obtained from reanalysis data, but the model-derived Sahel <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> is correlated with both W 10 m and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that is obtained from satellite. While the Saharan dust accounts for 82 % of the continental North Africa <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> (1340 - 1570 Tg year- 1) in the 27 -year average, the Sahel accounts for 17 % with a larger seasonal and inter-annual variation (230 - 380 Tg year- 1), contributing {{about a quarter of the}} transatlantic dust transported to the northern part of South America. The decreasing <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> trend over the 27 -year period is highly correlated with W 10 m over the Sahara (R = 0. 92).

40|$|Soil erosion redistributes soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) within {{terrestrial}} ecosystems, {{to the atmosphere}} and oceans. Dust export is {{an essential component of}} the carbon (C) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) budget because wind erosion contributes to the C cycle by removing selectively SOC from vast areas and transporting C dust quickly offshore; augmenting the net loss of C from terrestrial systems. However, the contribution of wind erosion to rates of C release and sequestration is poorly understood. Here, we describe how SOC <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> is omitted from national C accounting, is an underestimated source of CO 2 and may accelerate SOC decomposition. Similarly, long dust residence times in the unshielded atmospheric environment may considerably increase CO 2 emission. We developed a first approximation to SOC enrichment for a well established <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> model and quantified SOC <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> for Australia (5. 83 Tg CO 2 -e yr− 1) and Australian agricultural soils (0. 4 Tg CO 2 -e yr− 1). These amount to underestimates for CO 2 emissions of ≈ 10 % from combined C pools in Australia (year = 2000), ≈ 5 % from Australian Rangelands and ≈ 3 % of Australian Agricultural Soils by Kyoto Accounting. Northern hemisphere countries with greater <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> than Australia are also likely to have much larger SOC <b>dust</b> <b>emission.</b> Therefore, omission of SOC <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> likely represents a considerable underestimate from those nations' C accounts. We suggest that the omission of SOC <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> from C cycling and C accounting is a significant global source of uncertainty. Tracing the fate of wind-eroded SOC in the dust cycle is therefore essential to quantify the release of CO 2 from SOC dust to the atmosphere and the contribution of SOC deposition to downwind C sinks. ...|$|R
