5|$|On 21 December 1979, Malaysia {{published}} a map {{that showed the}} island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together {{with the issue of}} sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions that demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the <b>Joint</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E

Following a meeting on 3 June 2008, the Committee agreed that a technical sub-committee would be established to oversee the conduct of joint survey works to prepare the way for talks on maritime issues in and around the area. If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved. Finally, both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters. In September 2008, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> reported that its Sub-Committee on Joint Survey Works was finalising technical preparations for a hydrographic survey that would provide data for future delimitation discussions.

According to Malaysia, the JTC reached an impasse in November 2013, as both parties had been unable to agree over the meaning of the 2008 judgement as it concerns the South Ledge and the waters surrounding Pedra Branca. Explaining Malaysia's position, Malaysian Attourney-General Apandi said: [...] "Malaysia considers {{that it is necessary to}} request {{an interpretation of the}} 2008 judgement from the ICJ as it would serve as a basis for the maintenance of orderly and peaceful relations between the parties in the management of their respective maritime zones and airspace in the future".|$|E

30|$|The SADC {{configuration}} {{is shown}} in two perspectives represented by boxes B 1 to B 10, and BA to BK. Boxes B 1 to B 10 represent the institutional hierarchy and reporting relationships within the hierarchical structure. Boxes BA to BK represent the functional descriptions associated with the institutional boxes (B 1 to B 10). The summit of the Heads of State to the SADC joint DRM Task Team (boxes B 1 to B 10) represent structures within the SADC system, while boxes BA to BK explain the nature of those structures and what the different administrative levels are responsible for. For the institutional model for collaborative DRM in the SADC, the SADC DRR Inter-Ministerial Committee (B 6) is critical because it provides political direction and stewardship for DRM and reduction in the SADC and is aligned with the theoretical grounding of neoliberal institutionalism of diplomatic strategic relations of states, conflict management, and general governance. Through {{the work of the}} SADC DRR Inter-Ministerial Committee (B 6) and that of its subordinate structures such as the SADC DRR Directorate (B 7), the SADC DRR <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> (B 8), the Forum of non-state agencies (B 9), and the <b>Joint</b> DRR <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> of the SADC (B 10), the actualization of the institutional collaborative model is conducted through SADC DRM Mutual Aid Agreements and Operational Frameworks (Box BK). This implies that the functioning of the administrative units represented in these boxes (B 6, B 7, B 8, B 9, and B 10) will culminate in the SADC collaborative system as shown in box BK (addressing high-level administrative cooperation, as well as all manner of political, economic, and social cross-border transactions).

40|$|The ISO MHEG- 5 {{standard}} {{owes its}} existence {{to the increasing}} convergence of broadcast and interactive technologies. It specifies an encoding format for multimedia applications independently of service paradigms and network protocols. This article introduces the MHEG- 5 standard, describes examples of functionality, and illustrates an implementation that covers both runtime presentation and multimedia authoring applications. Motivation for MHEG- 5 Every design generally represents a compromise between conflicting goals. MHEG- 5 ’s design is no exception, especially if you consider that MHEG- 5 targets a continuously growing and fiercely competitive market where broadcast and interactive technologies converge almost daily. Converging technologies have often stimulated adopting standard solutions. Multimedia applications standards provide {{more than just the}} obvious objectives of portability and interoperability. A good multimedia standard can become a reference solution for system developers and application programmers. It also promotes the use of modular architectures that rely on common components that accomplish a specific functionality, such as interpreting and presenting MHEG- 5 applications to users. This task is performed by a compliant runtime engine (RTE), a resident software component for the OEM market that schedules delivery of an application to the user. It’s aimed at a wide installation base within complete solutions, like a VoD or an ITV system. RTEs help improve a product’s return on investment, abate a product’s per-unit costs, and provide high-quality, robust products due to extensive product testing. The family of MHEG standards MHEG encompasses the family of standards issued by the ISO/IEC JTC 1 <b>joint</b> <b>technical</b> <b>committee’s</b> working group WG 12 —information technology, subcommittee SC 29, coding of audio, picture multimedia, and hypermedia information.

40|$|The {{interest}} of the metrology community towards chemistry started quite late, compared to “classical” metrology. In chemistry there were many metrological activities (for ex. determination of atomic weights, validation of analytical methods) carried out outside the metrological organizations. The mole, the unit of amount of substance, {{was introduced in the}} International System of Units only in 1971. The growing need to assure accuracy, stability, comparability in time and space of chemical measurements led to a better rationalisation and control of the metrological activities, leading to a convergence of the international collaborations inside the Metre Convention {{at the beginning of the}} 90 s with the establishment of CCQM. At European level, in 1991 the Amount of Substance sector within EUROMET (now EURAMET, the European Association of National Metrology Institutes) was founded. In the following years the <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> of Metrology in Chemistry (TC-MC) was established as a <b>Joint</b> EURAMET-Eurachem <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> chaired by EURAMET.

The activities undertaken in its four Technical Subcommittees range from organic and inorganic chemical analysis to electrochemistry and gas analysis. The work is carried out within projects in the framework of both the usual metrological approach (i. e. organisation of measurement comparisons to establish the mutual agreement among European National Metrology Institutes and Designated Institutes) and in the European programmes on metrology (EMRP and EMPIR), where a very successful participation of NMIs and DIs active in the chemical field has been recorded...|$|R

Savings from bag limits were calculated given a particular slot size for the recreational fishery, with no savings for the commercial fisheries in the northern region due to their being managed primarily through a quota. Relative changes in catch-at-age estimates were used to adjust age-specific F and hence calculated escapement through age 4 and static SPR.
