40|$|The current {{invention}} {{relates to}} a system for fast and accurate filling of a two- phase cooling device, comprising a binding device (30) intended to be hermetically mounted onto the cooling device, the binding device (30) comprising a through-hole (32) able to be in fluid contact with the cooling device, said through-hole (32) being extending between a lower surface adapted to the cooling device's surface, and an essentially plane upper surface, the binding device (30) further comprising a <b>gripping</b> <b>head</b> essentially level with said upper surface, allowing for a filling tool (400) {{to be put in}} hermetic contact with said upper surface. In a preferred embodiment, the through-hole (32) can be hermetically sealed by forced insertion of a pin- shaped plug (33). The invention also relates to the filling tool (400) to be used in combination with the binding device (30), allowing gas removal from the cooling device, filling of a working fluid, and hermetic sealing of the cooling device. The invention also relates to the high accuracy of filling by using zero dead volume valves. The binding device (30) is notably particularly well adapted for use in an automated process...|$|E

40|$|A {{finite element}} method (FEM) -based study {{has been carried out}} for the design of flat microtensile samples to {{evaluate}} tensile properties of Pt-aluminide (PtAl) bond coats. The critical dimensions of the sample have been determined using a two-dimensional elastic stress analysis. In the present testing scheme, the ratio of the dimensions of the holding length to the fillet radius of the sample was found important to achieve failure within the gage length. The effect of gage length and <b>grip</b> <b>head</b> length also has been examined. The simulation predictions have been experimentally verified by conducting microtensile test of an actual PtAl bond coat at room temperature. The sample design and testing scheme suggested in this study have also been found suitable for evaluation of tensile properties at high temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{analyses}} one {{of possibilities}} to use new materials based on polyurethane, polypropylene or silicone having highly adhesive contact surfaces for gripping elements designing. In concrete terms, it {{is a case of}} an alternative approach to the solution of designing standard multi-elements vacuum <b>gripping</b> <b>heads</b> with an active control system (vacuum level control) controlling gripping forces in processes of automatic handling flat objects of the plate type. The aim of this new design solution is to replace individual gripping elements (suction cups) by elements, the surfaces of which coming to the contact with the object handled are provided with adhesion materials. The system minimizing energy demands stemmed from this solution, namely in the way that it decreases or even eliminates the pressure air consumption when combined vacuum-adhesive or only adhesive gripping elements are used. Moreover, it is possible to use the adhesive gripping principle profitably in technological processes susceptible to the environment contamination with airflow when manufacturing new products with many functional layers. Besides a general analysis of problems, the paper presents outputs of laboratory tests. Also a computer model of the contact respecting rheological behaviour of the adhesive material basic matrix is given...|$|R

5000|$|The key <b>grip</b> is the <b>head</b> <b>grip.</b> Grips affect shadow effects with lights, and {{occasionally}} maneuver camera cranes, dollies, and platforms under {{direction from the}} Cinematographer. The term grip is used in slightly different ways in American and British or Australian film making. In the British and Australian film industries, a grip mounts and supports cameras, which can include anything beyond a basic tripod. Lighting in British and Australian film-making is headed by the gaffer, who {{is also part of}} the camera department. Grips can also be the people that do the laborious work on sets. These type of grips push, pull, roll, and lift various pieces of equipment under direction from a television director, television producer, or set designer.|$|R

40|$|The effort {{dedicated}} to developing the material properties of engineering ceramics {{has not been}} accompanied by a similar effort in developing design methods that would allow engineers to make full use of these materials. In particular the high temperature creep behaviour of engineering ceramics has received little attention. In this thesis two parallel approaches, one theoretical and one practical, have been taken towards the final aim of constructing design codes for the creep of ceramic materials. In the theoretical work the principles developed for modelling creep and failure in metals were employed and adapted where necessary to provide new models that describe the behaviour of ceramics under multiaxial stresses. Important changes were made to account for differences in microstructure between these two classes of materials. In the practical work equipment was developed to provide suitable multiaxial creep test data with which to verify and further construct models. This involved {{the construction of a}} tension/torsion creep testing machine featuring a radio-frequency heating furnace, cooled <b>grip</b> <b>heads,</b> extensometry equipment, biaxial loading system and a temperature measurement and control system. The machine was capable of operating for at least 300 hours at a temperature of at least 1400 °C. Nine creep tests were conducted on reaction bonded silicon nitride specimens including two unique tests under pure torsion and combined tension/torsion. Four tests were conducted on aluminium oxide specimens including a unique test under combined tension/torsion. Tensile test results showed good agreement with previously published data for both materials confirming the equipment accuracy. Results from the multiaxial tests indicated that reaction bonded silicon nitride fails in response to the value of the effective stress. In addition reasonable agreement was obtained between the test data and predictions from the new models...|$|R

5000|$|A {{variation}} is the [...] "locking wheel nut", {{which is almost}} universally used for alloy wheels in the United Kingdom. One standard lug nut on each wheel is replaced with a nut which requires a special and unique key (typically a computer-designed, rounded star shape) to fit and remove the nut. This helps to discourage theft of wheels. However, universal removal tools are available which <b>grip</b> the <b>head</b> of the locking nut using a hardened left-hand thread. The success of these depends on whether there is room {{to use it in}} the lug hole, and whether the manufacturer has incorporated a free-spinning outer casing to the lock.
