5|$|Around 1671, Anne {{first made}} the {{acquaintance}} of Sarah Jennings, {{who later became}} <b>her</b> <b>close</b> friend {{and one of her}} most influential advisors.

5|$|Bondfield {{remained}} {{active in}} NUGMW affairs until 1938, {{and during the}} Second World War carried out investigations for the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She died in 1953; despite her years of service to party and union, and her successes in breaking through gender boundaries, {{she has not been}} greatly honoured within the Labour movement. According to a later female cabinet minister, Barbara Castle, Bondfield's actions in office had brought <b>her</b> <b>close</b> to betrayal of the movement.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} between 1918 and 1928, the WFL in Swansea {{produced}} two prominent activists in Emily Frost Phipps and <b>her</b> <b>close</b> friend Clara Neal, who were founder members of their branch. Phipps and Neal were teachers and activists, both serving {{as president of the}} National Union of Women Teachers and used that platform to press for equal franchise. Phipps also used her position as editor of the Woman Teacher to urge her colleagues to support public meetings and demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|She {{exhibited}} from 1887 {{until her}} death in Champ de Mars' Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, which was made possible through <b>her</b> <b>close</b> friendship with Puvis de Chavannes. Her works were also shown in Boston, Chicago, and New York City. Norcross shared a studio with Alix d'Anethan, whose paintings, influenced by Puvis, were of pastoral and contemporary life.|$|E
5|$|While in Germany, Wong {{became an}} inseparable {{friend of the}} {{director}} Leni Riefenstahl. <b>Her</b> <b>close</b> friendships with several women throughout her life, including Marlene Dietrich and Cecil Cunningham, led to rumors of lesbianism which damaged her public reputation. These rumors, in particular of her supposed relationship with Dietrich, embarrassed Wong's family who in any case had long been opposed to her acting career, at that time {{not considered to be}} an entirely respectable profession.|$|E

5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind <b>her,</b> <b>close</b> the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|Calment {{was born}} in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhone, Southern France on 21 February 1875. Her father, Nicolas Calment (28 January 1838 – 22 January 1931), was a shipbuilder, and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was {{from a family of}} millers. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of <b>her</b> <b>close</b> family members also lived an above-average lifespan, {{although}} none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to six days shy of 93, and her mother to 86.|$|E
5|$|During her reign, Anne favoured {{moderate}} Tory politicians, {{who were}} more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the Whigs. The Whigs grew more powerful {{during the course of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, until 1710 when Anne dismissed many of them from office. <b>Her</b> <b>close</b> friendship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, turned sour as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge in an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs, which was widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th-century.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor {{was also}} active {{on the home}} front. Beginning in 1941, she co-chaired the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) with New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, working to give {{civilian}} volunteers expanded roles in war preparations. She soon found herself in a power struggle with LaGuardia, who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense, while she saw solutions to broader social problems as equally important to the war effort. Though LaGuardia resigned from the OCD in December 1941, Eleanor {{was forced to resign}} following anger in the House of Representatives over high salaries for several OCD appointments, including two of <b>her</b> <b>close</b> friends.|$|E
5|$|For the {{supporting}} roles, Zarina Wahab was cast as Suhasini Chauhan, Vijay's mother; a role originally played by Rohini Hattangadi. Wahab {{agreed to do}} the film, due to <b>her</b> <b>close</b> association with producer, Johar. For the role of Shiksha Chauhan, newcomer Kanika Tiwri was auditioned and cast among 6500 girls. In order to feature an item number in the film, producer Johar wanted to sign Kareena Kapoor, who refused the offer and Katrina Kaif was eventually contracted. Filming for the song was demanding on Kaif, as she ended up with cuts and blisters on her feet, due to the long, stretched-out schedules.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (née Jenyns, spelt Jennings in {{most modern}} references; 5 June 1660 (Old Style)– 18 October 1744) rose {{to be one}} of the most {{influential}} women of her time through <b>her</b> <b>close</b> friendship with Queen Anne of Great Britain. Sarah's friendship and influence with Princess Anne was widely known, and leading public figures often turned their attentions to her in the hope that she would influence Anne to comply with requests. As a result, by the time Anne became queen, Sarah’s knowledge of government, and intimacy with the Queen, had made her a powerful friend and a dangerous enemy.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode is}} set on the fiftieth {{birthday}} of Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{and much of the}} plot revolves around his concerns with his age and desire to reclaim the happiness of his childhood. At the same time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is forced to deal with her ex-boyfriend Dennis Duffy (Winters) and his self-diagnosis as a sex addict as well as the fact that Dennis slept with <b>her</b> <b>close</b> friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski). A final plotline in the episode involves the desire of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to travel in space, and the efforts by Liz and Jack to deceive him into thinking he has done so.|$|E
5|$|When Victoria became queen in 1837, Lehzen {{served as}} a sort of {{unofficial}} private secretary, enjoying apartments adjacent to Victoria's. The Queen's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 led to significant changes in the royal household. Albert and Lehzen detested each other, and after an illness of the Princess Royal in 1841, Lehzen was quietly dismissed. <b>Her</b> <b>close</b> relationship with the Queen came to an end, although the two continued to write letters to each other. Lehzen spent her last years in Hanover on a generous pension, dying in 1870. Historian K. D. Reynolds writes that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character, in particular giving her the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and life as a young queen.|$|E

After losing her ability to kick, Yip switched from the front crawl to the backstroke and was reclassified from the S5 to the S3 category (lower numbers indicate more severe disabilities).

5|$|According to Quintanilla, Jr., in January 1995 {{he began}} {{receiving}} telephone calls from fans {{who said they}} had paid {{for membership in the}} Selena fan club and had received nothing in return for it, and he began an investigation. Quintanilla, Jr. discovered that Saldívar had embezzled more than $30,000 via forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques. Quintanilla, Jr. held a meeting with Selena and Suzette on the night of March 9 at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies concerning the disappeared funds. Quintanilla, Jr. told her that if she did not provide evidence that disproved his accusations, he would involve the local police. Quintanilla, Jr. banned Saldívar from having any contact with Selena. However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she thought Saldívar was essential {{to the success of the}} clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep <b>her</b> <b>close</b> because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax preparation.|$|E
5|$|After a {{conversion}} {{by his mother}} Mary and older sister Susannah in 1798, all of Hinde's family, including his father, converted to Christianity as Methodists. Thomas delayed a while. Shortly afterward the younger Hinde became close friends with Francis Asbury, who became a prominent bishop in the church. Hinde later described the conversion of his youngest sister, Martha Harrison Hinde, in an 1827 article published in the Methodist Review under his pen name, Theophilus Arminius. Hinde recounted Bishop Asbury visiting his father's home in 1803 and telling Martha that she had better find God, because before he could meet her again she would be dead. The bishop's prophecy came true when Martha died in 1811 without having seen Asbury again. Hinde said she had converted before her death and tried to convert the nonbelievers in the room while on her deathbed. He shared a letter in which his sister had tried to convert <b>her</b> <b>close</b> friends. Hinde named his first daughter after his late sister Martha. Hinde did not immediately convert but attended Methodist camp meetings of the period. During his life, he frequently wrote {{about the importance of}} the camp meeting in bringing Christianity and democracy to the west.|$|E
5|$|Anne, however, {{expected}} {{kindness and}} compassion from her closest friend. Sarah was not forthcoming {{in this regard}} and frequently overpowered and dominated Anne. One major political disagreement occurred when Sarah insisted that her son-in-law, Charles Spencer, the third Earl of Sunderland, be admitted into the Privy Council. Sarah allied herself more strongly with the Whigs, who supported the Duke of Marlborough in the war; and the Whigs hoped to utilise Sarah's position as royal favourite. Anne refused to appoint Sunderland: she disliked the radical Whigs, whom she saw {{as a threat to}} her royal prerogative. Sarah used <b>her</b> <b>close</b> friendship with the Earl of Godolphin, whom Anne trusted, to eventually secure such appointments, but continued to lobby Anne herself. She sent Whig reading materials to Anne in an attempt to win her over to her own preferred political party. In 1704, Anne confided to Lord Godolphin that she did not think she and Sarah could ever be true friends again.|$|E
