5|$|The {{interaction}} of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede, which has an intrinsic magnetic moment, differs from its interaction with the non-magnetized moons. Ganymede's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter's magnetosphere with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters, creating a mini-magnetosphere within Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ganymede's magnetic field diverts the co-rotating plasma flow around its magnetosphere. It also protects the moon's equatorial regions, where the field lines are closed, from <b>energetic</b> particles. The latter can still freely strike Ganymede's poles, where the field lines are open. Some of the <b>energetic</b> particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede, creating mini-radiation belts. <b>Energetic</b> electrons entering its thin atmosphere {{are responsible for the}} observed Ganymedian polar aurorae.|$|E
5|$|According {{to the few}} {{existing}} {{descriptions of}} Vladislav, {{it can be concluded}} that he was <b>energetic,</b> reliable, and hot-tempered.|$|E
5|$|Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, a 9-year-old <b>energetic</b> {{and curious}} boy with an active imagination. Marienthal's {{performances}} were videotaped {{and given to}} animators to work with, which helped develop expressions and acting for the character.|$|E
5|$|For {{about the}} next –, the excess {{electrons}} remained too <b>energetic</b> to bind with atomic nuclei. What followed is a period known as recombination, when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe became transparent to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Further out, {{expanding}} gases {{from the}} Great Eruption collide with interstellar material and are heated to around , producing less <b>energetic</b> X-rays {{seen in a}} horseshoe or ring shape.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly <b>energetic.</b> Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely <b>energetic.</b> The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|Salegy is funky, <b>energetic</b> {{dance music}} {{dominated}} by ringing electric guitars, accordion (real or synthesized), and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, with heavy electric bass and a driving percussion. The percussion section might include a drum kit, djembe, and shakers.|$|E
5|$|Until this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} a {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint {{because they are not}} highly <b>energetic.</b> Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and are extremely <b>energetic.</b> Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive, the distance measurement unequivocally placed the source of the GRB outside the Milky Way, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|A {{mostly white}} breed {{with either a}} smooth, rough or broken coat, it {{conforms}} to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell. It is a feisty, <b>energetic</b> terrier, suited to sports and able {{to get along with}} children and other animals. It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.|$|E
5|$|Although still young, Henry was {{increasingly}} gaining {{a reputation as}} an <b>energetic</b> and capable leader. His prestige and power increased further when he unexpectedly married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152; Eleanor was the attractive Duchess of Aquitaine and the recently divorced wife of Louis VII of France, and the marriage made Henry the future ruler of a huge swathe of territory across France.|$|E
5|$|Andronikos Komnenos {{was a man}} of astounding contrasts. Handsome and eloquent, the new emperor was at {{the same}} time known for his licentious exploits. <b>Energetic,</b> able and determined, Andronikos was a true Komnenos. However, he was also capable of terrifying brutality, {{violence}} and cruelty.|$|E
5|$|Captain Lang is a fully matured character, {{serious and}} calm in his demeanor, yet {{definite}} and <b>energetic</b> when strength was needed. Very good attitude as an officer. Demands of himself first. He understands {{how to reach}} the men under his command correctly. Captain Lang possesses an exemplary concept of service, has initiative and talent for improvisation to a large degree, well rooted in the National Socialist ideas.|$|E
5|$|Carole Lombard (born Jane Alice Peters, October 6, 1908– January 16, 1942) was an American film actress. She was {{particularly}} noted for her <b>energetic,</b> often off-beat {{roles in the}} screwball comedies of the 1930s. She was the highest-paid star in Hollywood in the late 1930s. She was the third wife of actor Clark Gable.|$|E
5|$|Clinton now faced a lesser-known {{candidate}} in Lazio. While a relative moderate among House Republicans, Lazio had frequently supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a largely despised figure among many New Yorkers. Lazio did {{bring to the}} table an ethnic suburban background familiar to many New Yorkers, and had a reputation as an <b>energetic</b> campaigner.|$|E
5|$|Despenser was an <b>energetic</b> {{and able}} {{administrator}} who staunchly defended his diocese against Lollardy. In 1399, {{he was among}} those who stood by Richard, following the landing of Henry Bolingbroke in Yorkshire towards the end of June. He was arrested for refusing {{to come to terms with}} Bolingbroke. The following year, he was implicated in the Epiphany Rising, but was pardoned.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very <b>energetic</b> and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Highly <b>energetic</b> {{chemistry}} {{is thought to}} have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions. The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Sega {{restructured}} {{its internal}} studios {{in preparation for}} the Saturn's launch. To ensure high-quality 3D games would be available early in the Saturn's life, and to create a more <b>energetic</b> working environment, developers from Sega's arcade division were asked to create console games. New teams, such as Panzer Dragoon developer Team Andromeda, were formed during this time.|$|E
5|$|In 875, the unwarlike and pleasure-loving Aghlabid emir Muhammad II ibn Ahmad (r. 864–875) died, and was {{succeeded by}} his more <b>energetic</b> brother, Ibrahim II (r. 875–902). The new emir was {{determined}} to finally capture Syracuse. He appointed a new governor for the island, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, and sent a fleet from Ifriqiya to assist the local Sicilian troops.|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} way, the {{particular}} <b>energetic</b> {{stability of the}} helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion. Some stable helium-3 (2 protons and 1 neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, {{but it is a}} very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4.|$|E
5|$|It is an <b>energetic,</b> free-spirited breed. Even {{though it}} is a gundog, it is also kept as a {{companion}} dog because of its easy-going nature and devotion to the cause. It is a cheerful, active dog and is always ready to play, responding to any form of attention with a happily wagging tail. Russian Spaniels are trainable, can make a good watchdog, and are amiable with children.|$|E
5|$|Leto {{has worked}} on several side {{projects}} during his career, including a collaboration with Antoine Becks, a recording with the short-lived supergroup The Wondergirls, and performing on occasional dates with Street Drum Corps. His creative contribution to music has received praise from musicians and critics. He is noted for his dynamic drumming style and his <b>energetic</b> live performances.|$|E
5|$|Living {{up to her}} nicknames, young Anastasia {{grew into}} a vivacious and <b>energetic</b> child, {{described}} as short and inclined to be chubby, with blue eyes and strawberry-blonde hair. Margaretta Eagar, a governess to the four grand duchesses, said one person commented that the toddler Anastasia had the greatest personal charm of any child she had ever seen.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{responded to}} this outrage in a {{characteristically}} <b>energetic</b> way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia {{at the head of}} a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, who had participated in the attack on Cyprus. Thoros fled into the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between <b>energetic</b> photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of <b>energetic</b> photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E
5|$|N. lasiopterus is understudied {{due to its}} rarity; {{very little}} is known of its mating habits, {{reproductive}} pattern, life cycle and sex ratio. N. lasiopterus, as a Nyctalus species, has an outstanding capability for migration which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in sex ratio. The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly dominant in Greece and the Czech Republic while females were dominant in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and <b>energetic</b> requirements. The females are dominant in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production. On the other hand, males are dominant in cooler locations because of lower <b>energetic</b> demands. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have nursing colonies located in Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Onstage Mambo {{is known}} as an <b>energetic</b> {{performer}} who often includes her audience in her act. She generally collaborates with other artists, working with local bands when she performs and has other people write her songs. The mother of fourth children, as of 2013, she's married to music-video director Steve Wantania.|$|E
5|$|Paul Bruce Dickinson (born 7 August 1958), known professionally as Bruce Dickinson, is an English singer, songwriter, musician, airline pilot, entrepreneur, {{author and}} broadcaster. He {{is the lead}} singer of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden and is renowned for his wide-ranging operatic vocal style and <b>energetic</b> stage presence.|$|E
5|$|Quasars (/ˈkweɪzɑr/) or quasi-stellar radio {{sources are}} the most <b>energetic</b> and distant members of a class of objects called active galactic nuclei (AGN). Quasars are {{extremely}} luminous and were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy, including radio waves and visible light, {{that appeared to be}} similar to stars, rather than extended sources similar to galaxies. Their luminosity can be 100 times greater than that of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Revere {{began the}} 2013 {{season as the}} Phillies; leadoff hitter before being moved down in the lineup {{following}} an injury. His primary strengths are his speed and his defense, while he struggles to hit for power; he has only hit seven home runs in the major leagues. Writers and teammates have described Revere as being a genuine, goofy, <b>energetic</b> player.|$|E
5|$|Spacecraft and space-based modules that do {{particle}} detection, {{looking for}} cosmic rays and electrons. These can be emitted {{by the sun}} (Solar <b>Energetic</b> Particles), our galaxy (Galactic cosmic rays) and extragalactic sources (Extragalactic cosmic rays). There are also Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from active galactic nuclei, those can be detected by ground-based detectors via their particle showers.|$|E
5|$|The Pomeranian is a {{small but}} <b>energetic</b> breed of dog. Although Pomeranians benefit from {{frequent}} attention, they need relatively little exercise: it is recommended to take them on a short daily walk or let them run around an enclosed space.|$|E
5|$|The Sussex Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in Sussex in southern England. It is a low, compact spaniel and {{is similar in}} appearance to the Clumber Spaniel. They can be slow-paced, but can have a clownish and <b>energetic</b> temperament. They suffer from health conditions common to spaniels and some large dogs, {{as well as a}} specific range of heart conditions and spinal disc herniation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} chess tournament was {{organized}} by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess player, and was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading chess master. His brilliant, <b>energetic</b> attacking style was typical for the time. Sparkling games like Anderssen's Immortal game and Evergreen game or Morphy's Opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} the band's manager Antwan (Big Boi) talking to Ice Cold 3000 and Dookie Blasingame backstage. Meanwhile, the {{television}} presenter, portrayed by Ryan Phillippe (another version featured an <b>energetic</b> Phillippe), tries to calm {{a crowd of}} screaming girls on a show being broadcast live in black-and-white. The band performs while {{the girls in the}} audience scream loudly; one girl is carried off by security after rushing the stage, and another faints.|$|E
