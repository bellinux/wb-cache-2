25|$|Conservators and curators tagged {{and packed}} {{each of the}} items, {{including}} the walls, doors, <b>floor,</b> <b>ceiling</b> and dust. The relocated studio opened in 2001. Over 7,000 items were catalogued on a specially designed database, the first computerised archive of the entire contents of a world ranking artist's studio. Every item in the studio has a database entry. Each entry consists of an image and a factual account of an object. The database has entries on approximately 570 books and catalogues, 1,500 photographs, 100 slashed canvases, 1,300 leaves torn from books, 2,000 artist's materials and 70 drawings. Other categories include the artist's correspondence, magazines, newspapers and vinyl records.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground floor}} {{consists}} of one open space with access {{provided by a}} series of recent aluminium-framed doors with fixed glass panels in between. Stairs lead up to the first floor {{at each end of the}} building. These stairs incorporate heavy timber treads and fine steel sections, which run vertically from floor to ceiling and act as a screen and a support for the balustrade. The end of one of the staircases is expressed to form a decorative zigzag pattern. The first <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> lining follows the zigzag line of the roof, exposing the steel roof structure. This floor contains the original steel framed hopper windows and fixed glass panels along the south wall. The flooring is of mixed hardwood. An elevated link joins this building to the neighbouring Commerce Building and Meat Hall.|$|E
25|$|Thirteen steel columns, {{arranged}} in a circle {{in the center of}} the building, support the dome overhead. The columns are irregularly spaced to accommodate building's site and avoid blocking entrances. Horizontal steel beams run outward from these columns to the outer walls, supporting the upper floors. Each of the columns was coated in a thick layer of plaster, with vertical conduits and air ducts embedded and hidden in the plaster. On the first floor, the plaster-coasted columns were clad in marble, but merely painted on the second and third floors. Each of the upper floors was constructed with a concrete base, on top of which were placed brick and red tile arched supports. A wood floor was constructed atop the arched supports, and in parts of the second floor marble tile was laid atop the wood flooring. Intricate embossed bronze brackets supported the second-floor balcony. The first <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling,</b> formed by the second floor balcony, was decorated with highly detailed bronze coffers.|$|E
50|$|Joinery {{throughout}} is {{of cedar}} (some {{of which has}} been painted) and is substantial. The ground <b>floor</b> <b>ceilings</b> have pressed metal finishes, but the first <b>floor</b> <b>ceilings</b> are lined with narrow tongue and groove boards. The front parlours on the ground floor have step-out telescopic windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is about 1100 sq ft {{on an open}} plan. There are four rooms {{on the first floor}} (front parlor, sitting room, formal dining room, and kitchen) and four rooms on the second <b>floor.</b> First <b>floor</b> <b>ceilings</b> are 9 fthigh, the second <b>floor</b> <b>ceilings</b> are 8 ft. The walls are plaster on lath, with sheetrock used to restore damaged areas.|$|R
50|$|Fired clay bricks {{have been}} used {{since the time of}} the Romans. Special tiles are used for roofing, siding, <b>flooring,</b> <b>ceilings,</b> pipes, flue liners, and more.|$|R
25|$|The tower {{has four}} floors, {{of which the}} ground floor doubles as the church's porch. The first floor is the children's gallery; this has a stepped floor to {{accommodate}} the pews, leaving a large, wedge-shaped cavity between the ground <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> and the surface for the seating. The children's gallery is well-lit by large windows, and {{is open to the}} nave, forming a balcony overlooking the pulpit. The opening to the nave was closed off around 1984 with a screen and door. The gallery is accessed separately from the nave via the tower's staircase, allowing the Sunday School children to be brought into the gallery and taken away to lessons without disturbing the service. This gallery is long disused and the steps beside the pews have become rotten and unsafe. The second floor is the clock chamber, containing an 1889 turret clock mechanism by Potts of Leeds, who as of 2014 continue to maintain it. The clock chamber has no windows and is completely dark. The bell chamber is on the third floor and contains the single bronze bell and clapper for the clock.|$|E
2500|$|A {{small fire}} broke out {{on the west side}} of the Old Post Office Pavilion between the ninth <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> and the roof on August 26, 1992. [...] Workers {{repairing}} the roof accidentally caused the blaze, which began at 3:45 P.M. and was extinguished 45 minutes later. Although small, the fire snarled downtown traffic during the evening rush hour.|$|E
2500|$|The deep vat {{building}} is a concrete structure constructed in 1939 with a low-pitched roof and parapetted ends. [...] A double doorway {{is located on the}} east side. [...] The building once contained wine vats sitting in the basement and reaching up to the first <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling.</b> [...] The basement has been filled in and the {{building is}} used for storage.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{leading cause}} of death during {{firefighting}} is structural collapse of a burning building (e.g. a wall, <b>floor,</b> <b>ceiling,</b> roof, or truss system). [...] Structural collapse, which often occurs without warning, may crush or trap firefighters inside the structure. [...] To avoid loss of life, all on-duty firefighters should maintain two-way communication with the incident commander and be equipped with a personal alert safety system device on all fire scenes and maintain radio communication on all incidents(PASS). Francis Brannigan was the founder and greatest contributor to this element of firefighter safety.|$|E
2500|$|The Dairy Industry Hall is a long, narrow, two-storey {{building}} constructed {{along the}} southwest {{side of the}} John Reid Pavilion. The facade to Gregory Terrace is of face brick with the words [...] "Dairy Industry Hall" [...] in steel lettering. The most noticeable features of the building include the zigzag roof structure and glazed south wall. The building consists of three solid walls with the remaining long side-wall completely glazed to allow southern light to flood the internal spaces. This glazed wall is protected by the roof extending to form an arcade along the side. The structural system of the building is expressed, with the concrete structural beams and columns painted externally and in-filled with panels of face brick. The steel roof beams are exposed on the upper <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The dark-varnished and galleried {{staircase}} retains faded gilding and stencilled motifs on {{its first}} <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> and {{on the underside of}} the first landing, visible from the ground floor. The decorative, carved frieze around these ceilings also still has old and faded gilding. The newel post is of unusual design. There are four carved wood and plaster corbels supporting the first floor staircase ceiling. They represent a woman with grapes and flowers, a winged cherub, a man with harvest motifs and a full-bearded man in medieval costume, carrying scrolls. In the latter corbel which overlooks the stairwell, the bearded man's profile is similar to Barber's profile in [...] by David Wilkie Wynfield, and his scrolls are long and slim enough to be building plans. These details beg the question as to whether it is a portrait of the architect, placed to overlook his work. The plaster corbels on the ground floor staircase ceiling are carved with lions, in connection with the Holdsworth family crest.|$|E

2500|$|The {{church was}} built with a nave, chancel and {{north and south}} aisles. The nave and chancel {{together}} make a six-arch arcade, with a [...] wide chancel arch. The west tower is [...] square, with walls [...] thick. The ground <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> which doubles as {{the floor of the}} bell-ringers' chamber in the tower is made of heavy beams and moulded joists; this could testify to a consciousness of the fragility of parishioners and the weight of the bronze bells hanging high above. Barber designed all the original 1878 interior fittings. The nave and chancel ceilings are of open pitch pine woodwork. The interior was built in plain manner, apart from richly carved corbels supporting the chancel arch, the Four Evangelists carved over the priest's door in the south aisle and the rich bas-relief carving of the Caen stone pulpit with scenes from the life of St Paul. The pews in the nave and aisles, the choir stalls and screens were all of pitch pine, and the floor covered with plain encaustic tiles. The pews were still there in 1986. The tower contains eight bells which were cast and hung in 1880. The sanctuary was remodelled in 1928 by diocesan architect Sir Charles Nicholson.|$|E
2500|$|The {{farmhouse}} {{was constructed}} amid towering elm trees, from hand-hewn lumber on a fieldstone foundation {{and finished with}} masonry stucco and lath work. Its architectural features included pine and wood pegged floors, walnut window trims, a main <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> over three metres (10 feet) in height, a low-pitched gabled roof, a gingerbread trim-styled front veranda {{as well as a}} bathtub and shower equipped washroom fitted to an attic or ceiling level rainfall cistern —installed by the younger Bell at a time when few homes in the region had any fixed bathtubs at all. [...] Its shower and oversized bathtub (likely chosen for the younger Alexander's large frame) drew hot and cold water from piping leading to both a ceiling level cistern and to a hot water heater in the basement. The home's layout featured a central hallway plan and its ten rooms included a large kitchen, large dining room, parlour, study plus four bedrooms on its upper floor. A greenhouse conservatory with a workroom at its rear were also added by the Bells {{to the side of the}} house, off of its parlour. They were later removed in the 1920s, and then rebuilt in the early 1970s along with the house's verandah and chimneys.|$|E
2500|$|Architect John Williams of Process Creative Studios of Cleveland {{oversaw the}} {{renovation}} of the rotunda and the Swetland Building's first floor into Heinen's. A number of items were salvaged from the bank rotunda and retained or repurposed during the conversion to a grocery store. [...] In the basement, the four vaults were repurposed into a nightclub, and the iron gate which closed off the vault areas used as the main entrance to the bar. The former main vault became the Bourbon Room, which was decorated with disused safe deposit box covers and keys as well as gears from vault doors. On the second floor, the intricate bronze railing was retained, and the cast terrazzo cloakroom counter was repurposed {{for use by the}} wine shop. The marble teller's counters on the first floor were repurposed as circular tables for the café and wine shop. The marble tiles on the second floor, which at some point had been covered with carpeting, were rediscovered and reused as well. Other architectural elements were restored to close to their original beauty. The bronze brackets and coffers on the first floor had been covered, and soffits added to the second <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> in 1972 to accommodate new HVAC ducts. The soffits lowered the ceiling a full , obscuring the windows. The brackets and coffers were uncovered and restored, and the soffits and ductwork removed. The marble cladding on the rotunda columns and the original first floor flooring were also retained. Also retained was the bronze Cleveland Trust Company seal embedded in the floor of the ground level.|$|E
50|$|A breathing, hollow {{concrete}} slab {{will act as}} the building's <b>floors,</b> <b>ceilings,</b> and HVAC system. A total of 4,300 such slabs {{will be used for}} building. Some of the slabs weigh 60,000 lb.|$|R

50|$|When {{work at the}} St-Mathieu Street exit was {{complete}} in August 2012, similar renovations commenced at the Guy Street entrance. This work included new <b>flooring,</b> <b>ceilings,</b> walls, as well as adding four turnstiles for increased traffic.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl and}} I were linked {{together}} by a rope which permitted us to move only {{about three or four}} feet from each other. When we had entered the compartment we had seated ourselves upon a low bench beneath the porthole. The bench was the only furniture of the room. It was of sorapus wood. The <b>floor,</b> <b>ceiling</b> and walls were of carborundum aluminum, a light, impenetrable composition extensively utilized in the construction of Martian fighting ships.|$|E
60|$|Knight and Smith entered. The inn {{was quite}} silent, and they {{followed}} the passage till they reached the kitchen, where a huge fire was burning, which roared up the chimney, and sent over the <b>floor,</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and newly-whitened walls a glare so intense as to make the candle quite a secondary light. A woman in a white apron and black gown was standing there alone behind a cleanly-scrubbed deal table. Stephen first, and Knight afterwards, recognized her as Unity, who had been parlour-maid at the vicarage and young lady's-maid at the Crags.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{fittings}} {{which are}} early and rare include the lower <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> roses, the lower <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling</b> with associated cornice, the painted glass transom windows and timber joinery.|$|E
5000|$|The upstairs {{rooms have}} TGVJ {{ceilings}} and three bedrooms contain cedar framed fireplaces (all {{of which were}} converted to storage by the Convent [...] The original 1850's roof was shingles. Over time, the roof developed leaks and the original plaster and lathe ceilings became damaged and were replaced (at different times based on the TGVJ boards). There was not visible termite damage to the top <b>floor</b> <b>ceilings,</b> and only the drawing room ceiling appeared to have termite damage on the found floor. It is not known why the other ground <b>floor</b> <b>ceilings</b> were replaced, but presumably the plaster and lathe was too damaged to repair.|$|R
