The attention is focused on the fact that the practice is overtaking the theory because there is lack of models of functioning of such structures. A model of cooperation between the mine and the power station was worked out for the established amount of coal what can describe the situation of particular ultimate pit choice (in long run) or realization of supplies of the constant amount of lignite in frames of the long-term contract (in short run e. g. one of year). It is proposed to treat a negotiation of the lignite price as a constant sum game and a lignite price as the determinant of the total profit division. The choice of lignite price between prices outlining break-even points of the mine and the power station determines the distribution of the profit to both sides. It is similar to the contract curve in the classical bilateral monopoly model. Ten different methods of the profit division are proposed.

The problem was that in reality a higher price existed for commercial contract fuel. This difference was absorbed by the Department of Defense.

The analysis compared the differences in total jet fuel costs between the original and new cost structures.

40|$|We apply {{propensity}} score matching (PSM) to {{the estimation of}} household motor <b>fuel</b> <b>purchase</b> quantities, to tackle problems caused by infrequency of purchase. The results are compared to an alternative, regression-based, imputation strategy using the infrequency of purchase model (IPM). Using data from the UK’s National Travel Survey (NTS) we observe that estimated mean obtained from the PSM imputation {{is closer to the}} estimated mean from the consumption diary, than that obtained from fitted values from the IPM. The NTS also contains an interview question on household mileage which can be used to assess the results of imputation. We find that the order statistics of the imputed distribution are more plausible for the PSM estimates than those obtained using the IPM, judging by the sample distribution of household mileage. We argue that there are some applications for which the PSM method is likely to be superior, including estimates of distributional effects of policies. On the other hand, the IPM is more suitable for analysing conditional effects and associations of consumption with covariates. We illustrate our arguments using a simple microsimulation exercise on CO 2 emissions reduction policies, an area where methods for coping with zero-inflated data seem currently to be under-used. ...|$|E
40|$|Even though rail {{transportation}} {{is one of}} the most fuel efficient forms of surface transportation, fueling costs are one of the highest operating cost head for railroad companies. In US, unlike Europe, fueling costs are indeed, by far, the single highest operating cost. For larger companies with several thousands of miles of rail network, the fuel bills often run into several billions of dollars annually. The railroad fueling problem considered in this paper has three distinct cost components. Fueling stations charge a location dependent price for the fuel in addition to a fixed contracting fee over the entire planning horizon. In addition, the railroad company must also bear incidental and notional costs for each fuelling stop. It is imperative that the number of fueling stops between an origin and destination should be restricted to avoid unnecessary delays. This paper proposes a mixed integer linear program model that determines the optimal strategy for contracting and <b>fuel</b> <b>purchase</b> schedule decisions that minimizes overall costs under certain reasonable assumptions. This model is tested on a large, real-life problem instances. This mathematical model is further enhanced by introducing several feasible MIP cuts. This paper compares the efficiency of different MIP cuts in order to reduce the run-time. Lastly, the paper concludes with an observation that even though the problem scale was expected to diminish the model performance, it was indeed noted that run-time and memory requirements are fairly reasonable. It thus establishes that this problem must be looked beyond the prism of heuristics and other approximate algorithms for actual implementation at railroad companies...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the electric}} demand has become {{as one of the}} main investigation fields in the electric engineering. The electric industry needs to predict the load consumption with lead time in the range from the short term (hours or days ahead) to the long term (with several years ahead). The short-term prediction, in particular, has become increasingly important for various operations in power systems, such as economic scheduling of generating capacity, <b>fuel</b> <b>purchase</b> scheduling, security analysis, and planning activities. In addition, since many countries have recently privatized and deregulated their power systems, load forecasting {{play a crucial role in}} the final price of the energy. Small errors in the load forecasting have a significant economic impact. However, load forecasting is a difficult task because the load series is complex. First, the series exhibits several level of seasonality, and second, there are many exogenous variables that must be considered, specially weather-related variables. Thus, the relationships between hourly load and these factors are non-linear, so the forecasting problem requires a non-linear specification with a wide number of variables. Conventional load forecasting techniques, categorized into statistical methods, such as multiple regression and Box-Jenkins time series methods, present several limitations : complexity of modeling, lack of flexibility, low accuracy of results, mainly in special days, weekends and holidays, etc. In recent times, much research has been carried out on the application of artificial intelligence techniques to the load forecasting problem. Among these techniques, the models with the highest attention have been the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), mathematical tools originally inspired by the way the human brain processes information. ANNs are being applied to forecasting problems since they have a distributed architecture and their weights store interrelationships between variables without specifying them explicitly in advance. ANNs applications to the forecasting problem usually employ supervised learning in order to implement the non-linear mapping between historical data and future values of load. However, although the ANNs are being used by many utilities, there is certain skepticism among the researchers and the industries. And this, among another reasons, because the issues derived from the design of ANN-based forecasting system. In this conference we shall address the problem of designing a proper ANN attending to the main task to be performed, such as data pre-processing, the ANN design itself and its implementation, and the ANN validation...|$|E
