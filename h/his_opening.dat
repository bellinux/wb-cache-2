5|$|In {{the grass}} season warm-ups, Federer, Djokovic, and Murray played while Nadal rested for Wimbledon. Federer lost <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> match of the Stuttgart Open to Tommy Haas, but later {{went on to}} win the 2017 Halle Open without {{dropping}} a set. This title saw Federer once again equal Nadal for the record of most ATP 500 titles won with 18. Djokovic won his first non-major grass title at the 2017 Eastbourne International, while Murray lost in <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> match in the 2017 Queens Club Championship.|$|E

5|$|At the ATP World Tour Finals, Murray lost <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> {{round robin}} match to Kei Nishikori but won his second match against Milos Raonic. However, {{he lost his}} final group match against Federer in {{straight}} sets and only managed to win one game against him, marking his worst defeat since losing to Djokovic in the 2007 Miami Masters, eliminating him from the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{headed south}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes resumed <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> position, while Hassett {{returned}} to his customary position in the middle order. England won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Ray Lindwall's 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced the injured Tallon behind the stumps. England made three changes. Emmett was dropped and Hutton was recalled to take <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> position. Laker replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings, was replaced by all-rounder Cranston.|$|E

5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid {{it as much as}} possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked as}} a {{supporting}} act {{along with the rest}} of Taylor Gang on Wiz Khalifa's 2050 Tour during late 2012 and early 2013. On March 13, Juicy J released the first of many Trippy Tour vlog episodes. Prior to the album's release Juicy J went on the Stay Trippy Tour from April 21 till June 8, 2013, with <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> act ASAP Ferg. He is also planning a possible college tour to take place after the album release.|$|E
5|$|Tanzania {{competed in}} Olympic judo {{for the first}} time in 2016. The nation {{received}} an invitation from the Tripartite Commission to send one judoka to the Games in the men's 73 kg category and selected Andrew Thomas Mlugu. He had previous international experience from having competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. In Rio, Mlugu was defeated in <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> bout by Jake Bensted of Australia and eliminated from the tournament.|$|E

5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. In <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Australia, Macartney {{continued}} to play club cricket and turned out for a final first-class summer. At {{the start of the}} 1926–27 season, he captained a combined Sydney City team against a New South Wales country team, which included the then 18-year-old Bradman. Macartney scored 126 and Bradman 98 in a match viewed as a generational transition in Australian batting. He scored 114 in <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> first-class match of the season, and took wickets in each of his four matches. Macartney totalled 243 runs at 40.50 and took 11 wickets at 17.82.|$|E
5|$|Another {{performance}} issue {{pertains to}} the choice of tempi, which is of special relevance in Schubert's major instrumental works, particularly in the opening movements. Schubert often notated <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> movements with moderate tempo indications, the extreme case being the Molto moderato of the B-flat piano sonata. The latter movement in particular, has been interpreted in vastly different speeds. Ever since the famous performances by Sviatoslav Richter, taking the opening movement at an extremely slow pace, similar tempo interpretations for this movement have been frequent. However, the majority of Schubert scholars tend to dismiss such an interpretation, arguing instead for a more flowing pace, a measured allegro.|$|E

5|$|At the Australian Open, he won <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> {{match against}} Rhyne Williams, but lost to Roberto Bautista-Agut {{in the second}} round, having led two sets to one. Despite his second-round loss, del Potro {{returned}} to being world No. 4 because David Ferrer made it only to the quarterfinals and thus lost 360 points, whereas del Potro lost only 45 points. After the Australian Open, del Potro required treatment for his left wrist, which has been giving him trouble since 2012.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} {{of the rest of the}} 200203 season, Karthik began to make an {{imposing}} case for senior selection. In <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> match of the season for the Tamil Nadu Under-19s, he scored 227 in his team’s 392/7 against Goa, and after making a duck in the first innings against Hyderabad, he hit 126 not out in the second innings. He then registered his third century in four innings, cracking 235 against Andhra Pradesh. His form tapered off and he only made 111 runs in his next six innings, but was nevertheless called up to the senior team to make his first-class debut.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex. England made three changes. Emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on debut and Hutton was recalled to take <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> position. Laker, the off spinner, replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings, was replaced by all-rounder Cranston.|$|E

5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|Karthik had a lean Test {{series against}} Pakistan {{at home in}} late 2008. In the first two Tests, he managed only 39 in two innings, passing single figures only once. In the Third Test in Bangalore, Sachin Tendulkar was injured, and his {{replacement}} Yuvraj scored 170. Karthik, batting down the order with Gautam Gambhir taking <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> position, scored 24 and 52 in a high-scoring draw and kept wickets because of Dhoni's absence with injury. In the first innings, Karthik was behind the stumps as India set a world record for the most extras conceded in a Test innings. The 35 byes that were leaked were the second highest amount in Test history. India won the First Test and the other matches were drawn.|$|E
5|$|Russell repeats <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> monologue, {{but with}} the revelation {{that he is in}} fact hiding behind a fake wall the robbers had {{constructed}} inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell. Frazier confronts Case and urges White to contact the Office of War Crimes Issues at the State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond, slipped into his pocket by Russell.|$|E
