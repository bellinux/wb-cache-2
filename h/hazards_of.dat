We estimate a Cox proportional hazard model finding that age, group association, foreign ownership, being in manufacturing, tariff rates, {{and the number of}} products produced all reduce the <b>hazard</b> <b>of</b> both importing and exporting. Sales, research and development expenses, profit after tax have no effect on either the <b>hazard</b> <b>of</b> exporting, while R&D decreases the <b>hazard</b> <b>of</b> production.

30|$|The {{magnitude}} of the UISA effect varies according to the next event: 34 while the coefficient returns a value of 0.375, translating into a <b>hazard</b> ratio <b>of</b> 1.455 or a 45.5 {{percent increase in the}} <b>hazard</b> <b>of</b> terminating employment when the next event is a new employment relation, the coefficient almost doubles to 0.645, translating into a <b>hazard</b> ratio <b>of</b> 1.906 or a 90.6 percent increase in the <b>hazard</b> <b>of</b> terminating employment when the following event is unemployment. For inactivity as the next event, the coefficient returns a value of 0.504, or a <b>hazard</b> ratio <b>of</b> 1.655 (65.5 percent increase in the <b>hazard</b> <b>of</b> terminating employment). While UISA affiliation has an effect on the duration of employment in all three cases and increases the <b>hazard</b> <b>of</b> terminating employment, the effect is the highest for workers becoming unemployed. The effect is also higher for inactivity compared to changing employment. A possible explanation could present the direct benefit of receiving the accumulated savings in the case of unemployment or inactivity, while a job change does not result in immediate monetary benefits, but reduced opportunity costs.|$|R
5|$|The Comet was {{powered by}} {{two pairs of}} {{turbojet}} engines buried in the wings close to the fuselage. Chief designer Bishop chose the Comet's embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of podded engines and allowed for a smaller fin and rudder, since the <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> asymmetric thrust were reduced. The engines were outfitted with baffles to reduce noise emissions, and extensive soundproofing was also implemented to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay from the fire to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E

5|$|Both Neotrypaea californiensis and the {{mud shrimp}} Upogebia pugettensis live in mudflats and sandy {{substrates}} in the intertidal zone of estuaries in western North America. N.californiensis is found from Mutiny Bay, Alaska to Punta Abreojos, Mulegé, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Its habitat {{is also used}} for the aquaculture of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Since the bioturbation carried out by N.californiensis and U. pugettensis reduces the productivity of the oyster beds, they are considered pests. Their effects may, however, have knock-on effects across the entire ecosystem, and may buffer it from the <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> nutrient enrichment and increase primary and secondary productivity by {{increasing the amount of}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E
5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} {{protection}} from the <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> open land. The prairie could be dangerous in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E

5|$|A scuba diver moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems.

Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, {{was one of the}} few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> ice travel. When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February.

5|$|Farmer {{left school}} to tour {{with a group}} led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods {{seven days a week}} for this job put great {{pressure}} on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the <b>hazards</b> <b>of</b> this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

The domino effect is responsibility for many most destructive accidents in the {{chemical process}} industry. However, domino effect is either not considered at all or is done with much less rigour than is warranted. A method was proposed to evaluate the <b>hazard</b> <b>of</b> chemical process equipment. The inherent hazard and the hazard from domino effect were considered in the method. The procedure for the domino effect analysis among equipments was presented to evaluate the hazard from the domino effect. The method was implemented in a case study.
