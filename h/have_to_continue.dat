5|$|The airline was by September {{again in}} need of new capital. The {{contracts}} with Britannia ended on 1 November. While there was a high demand for 737-300 aircraft, aviation regulations hindered Norway Airlines from wet leaseing the aircraft (with full crew) and limited them to dry leaseing (without crew), which jeopardized the jobs of 86 employees. There were speculations in mid-October that Air Europe was planning to purchase Norway Airlines. Lyng had by then bought Ansett's share and held a 55-percent ownership. Norway Airlines announced on 25 October that they would lease both their aircraft to Air Europe on a five-year contract, one aircraft from November 1988 and one from March 1989. The airline would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> with ad-hoc charters for the one aircraft until March. The deal also involved that the United Kingdom-based International Leisure Group (ILG) would purchase a 33-percent share of Norway Airlines through a private placement of NOK25 million.|$|E

Still in {{need for a}} drummer, the band placed an advertisement in a local newspaper which was answered by Silveria. Shortly after this, the band recorded a demo album which {{was meant to be}} sent out to record companies. Realizing they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the band in a more populated area {{in order for them to}} expand, all of the members but Shaffer left Bakersfield and resided in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California (Shaffer later moved to Hollywood as well). In late 1989, the band hired a man named Arthur as their manager, resulting in them getting signed to Triple X Records. The band recorded and released their first extended play in 1989, but it suffered from poor distribution.|$|E

Four days later on Raw is War, before their title defense against The Holly Cousins, Mick Foley gave the Rock an autographed copy of his book, , but later found it in the trash. Mick confronted The Rock and cursed him out for throwing away his life's work. Later that night, during their match, a crushed Mankind refused to participate as he sat despondently on the steel steps, facing away from the ring, as Hardcore and Crash Holly (with outside interference once again by Triple H) beat The Rock for the tag team titles.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 the Liberal politicians, {{recognizing}} {{that they had}} to choose someone with national stature and popularity to be President if they wanted to keep power, picked General José Félix Estigarribia as their candidate on March 19, 1939. This hero of the Chaco War was serving as a special envoy to the United States, and on June 13 Estigarribia and US Secretary of State Cordell Hull signed the Export-Import Bank loan of US$3.5million. This greatly increased US influence in the country where Nazi sympathies were common. On August 15, 1939, he assumed the presidency and quickly realized that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> many of the ideas of the February Revolution to avoid political anarchy. He began a program of land reform that promised a small plot of land to every Paraguayan family. He reopened the University, implemented monetary and municipal reforms, balanced the budget, financed the public debt, increased the capital of the Central Bank of Paraguay, and drew up plans to build highways and public works with the loan from the United States.|$|E

500|$|While Carle Place was {{complaining}} about the inability to access their section of town, a January 1990 article in The New York Times mentioned that the Court's decision put Westbury alone against the state, then-Governor Mario Cuomo and regional planners, who were worried {{about the safety of}} the roughly 140,000 drivers who used the interchange daily. Local business leaders claimed that Westbury was being selfish in opposing inconvenient construction. Even after the ruling, Strada continued to claim that they wanted to be informed on the impacts of a nearby widening project on the Northern State. NYSDOT officials worried that this would add more bureaucratic levels to getting approval for local road projects and that it could set the project back three years. Officials also {{went out of their way}} to call this a simple [...] "not in my backyard" [...] case. NYSDOT continued to claim that the projects were separate, and filed three years apart, despite the court's ruling that they were similar projects. Cuomo, worried about the safety of drivers, invited Strada to come to Albany to meet with NYSDOT Commissioner Franklin White and State Senator Norman J. Levy to make an agreement. Strada, however, felt that in order to compromise, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the original [...] "violation" [...] of not giving a report.|$|E
500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the {{character}} would reach a [...] "total mental breakdown", which would {{take her to the}} edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is [...] "physical, professional and emotional". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly {{for the rest of her}} life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharon’s past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision because I think it makes the most sense considering her history."
