This paper attempts to give an overview of the ongoing regional integration and conducts a dynamic simulation analysis based on a global CGE model to quantify the impacts of regional economic integration on Vietnam’s economy. The main conclusion is that regional economic integration generally has positive impacts on Vietnam’s economic growth and industrialization, but these positive impacts are in large part brought about by the greater capital inflows. The realization of the potential benefits of regional integration would depend on the capability of Vietnam to attract foreign investment through the {{liberalization of}} <b>investment</b> <b>regimes</b> and improvements in infrastructures and human resources...|$|R

40|$|We explore {{whether there}} exists an {{efficient}} <b>investment</b> <b>regime</b> for {{a panel of}} SP 100 companies over the period 1986 - 2007. We demonstrate that abnormal stock returns are related to corporate total assets growth rate (a proxy variable for exercising real investment options through contraction, abandonment or expansion), change in EPS (a proxy variable for the change in profitability after exercising investment options), and one-year lagged P/B ratio (a proxy variable for the value factor), conditional on one-year lagged market-to-book assets ratio (MBA ratio, a proxy variable for the level of investment opportunity). We utilize the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model to examine the threshold effect of one-year lagged MBA ratio on abnormal stock returns. We find that there exists an efficient <b>investment</b> <b>regime</b> between two threshold values of 0. 4773 and 3. 2728. Our results are robust to predict, approximately 74. 42 %, the movement direction of abnormal stock returns in year 2008.

40|$|Abstract: Using the {{international}} <b>investment</b> <b>regime</b> as its point of departure, the paper introduces notions of bounded rationality {{to the study}} of economic diplomacy.

Thus the behavior of developing country governments with regard to {{the international}} <b>investment</b> <b>regime</b> is consistent with that observed for individuals in experiments and field studies: they tend to ignore high-impact, low-probability risks if they cannot bring specific ‘vivid’ instances to mind...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic investment model that explains {{differences in the}} sensitivity of small- and large-sized firms {{to changes in the}} money market interest rate. In contrast to existing studies on the firm size effects of monetary policy, the importance of firms as monetary transmission channel does not originate from credit market imperfections, but from size-related differences in the degree of investment irreversibility. The degree of investment irreversibility is determined by sunk capital investment expenditures. We show that size-related differences in sunk investment expenditures have two interdependent effects: they (i) affect the optimal investment behavior of small- and large-sized firms and (ii) account for differences in the interest rate sensitivity of small- and large-firm investment. We illustrate that sunk investment expenditures affect the region of zero and non-zero investment activity and, hence, the frequency at which large and small firms change <b>investment</b> <b>regimes.</b> Furthermore, sunk <b>investment</b> costs {{determine the extent to which}} small- and large-firm investment displays discrete jumps. We find that large firms change <b>investment</b> <b>regimes</b> less frequently than small firms and that swings in investment are more accentuated for large than for small firms. We illustrate that the response of small- and large-firm investment to monetary policy actions depends on the magnitude of the monetary policy shock.
