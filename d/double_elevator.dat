50|$|The {{butterfly}} guard involves both of {{the legs}} being hooked with the ankles in between the opponents legs, against {{the inside of the}} opponents thighs. The opponent is controlled using both legs and arms. The butterfly guard is often short-lived since the opponent might be able to move quite freely. The leverage in the butterfly guard allows powerful sweeps. The guard also allows one to elevate or set the opponent off balance and because of this it is particularly useful in avoiding damage from ground and pound and for many transitions. Analogous technique in wrestling and catch wrestling is called <b>double</b> <b>elevator.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the clinical manifestations of subtypes of <b>double</b> <b>elevator</b> palsy and {{to report the}} outcomes of surgery in these patients. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on hospital records of patients with <b>double</b> <b>elevator</b> palsy at Labbafinejad Medical Center over a ten-year period from 1994 to 2004. Patients were classified into three subgroups of primary elevator muscle palsy (9 subjects), primary supranuclear palsy with secondary inferior rectus restriction (4 subjects) and pure inferior rectus restriction (7 subjects) according to forced duction test (FDT), force generation test (FGT) and Bell’s reflex. Patients in the first group underwent Knapp procedure, the second group received Knapp procedure and inferior rectus recession simultaneously and in the third group vertical recess-resect or mere inferior rectus recess operation was performed. Success was defined as final residual deviation ≤ 5 PD and ≥ 25 % improvement in restriction after all operations. Results: Overall 20 subjects including 10 male and 10 female patients with mean age of 12. 6 ± 9. 3 (range 1. 5 - 32) years were operated during the mentioned period which in-cluded 9 cases of primary elevator muscle palsy, 4 patients with primary supranuclea...|$|E

Methods: A 69 -year-old female patient {{with a history of}} amblyopia was referred for intractable filamentary keratitis in the left eye. The strabismus angle was 35 Δ hypertrophic, and ocular motility was within the normal range. Slit-lamp examination of her left eye revealed filamentary keratitis in {{more than one-third of the}} upper cornea behind the upper eyelid. Her right eye was diagnosed as supranuclear <b>double</b> <b>elevator</b> palsy. We performed strabismus surgery on her right eye, including inferior rectus muscle recession (5 mm) in combination with superior rectus muscle resection (5 mm) under local anesthesia. Following surgery, the left eye squint angle was improved. The filamentary keratitis of the left eye disappeared, and there was no recurrence over the following 5 years. Conclusion: The squint surgery of paralyzed right eye decreased the strabismus angle, subsequently resulting in the disappearance of the filamentary keratitis in the left eye via the resolution of the relative blepharoptosis. Although the squint operation performed was not for the purpose of improving binocular function, we want to conclude that it can treat the filamentary keratitis behind the eyelid.

40|$|SUMMARY Thirty-one {{patients}} {{presented for}} surgical correction of unilateral hypotropia {{of the globe}} and blepharoptosis. The hypotropia and pseudoptosis were corrected by Knapp procedures. The Bell's phenomenon was thereby improved, allowing safe correction of the true ptosis, generally by an anterior levator resection whose magnitude depended on measured levator function. The association of unilateral ptosis and hypotropia of the globe arises {{in a number of}} clinical situations, most commonly in congenital <b>double</b> <b>elevator</b> palsy. Their surgical correction was approached by Beard,' who found <b>double</b> <b>elevator</b> palsy in 6 % of his cases of unilateral congenital ptoses. He noted levator resec-tion was less effective where superior rectus weak-ness coexisted, and recommended an additional 4 mm approximately of levator resection. He approached the correction of hypotropia by superior rectus resection and inferior rectus recession with release of the lower lid retractors. Knapp ' subse-quently described transposition of the horizontal rectus tendons to that of the superior rectus. This improved the position of the globe and its elevation. Scott and Jackson, recognised, by forced duction tests, that inferior rectus restriction plays a part in some cases and advocated recession of the muscle with release of the lower lid retractors. This was not combined in their work with the Knapp procedure as they feared anterior segment ischaemia. Callahan' modified the approach (to reduce the risk of ischaemia) by routinely recessing the inferior rectus combining this with a Jensen ' style procedure, in which the active horizontal rectus muscles were split and half of each muscle was sutured to the weak superior rectus. Lee, Collin, and Timms " recommend that a forced duction test is done initially. If the eye moves freely, a Knapp procedure alone is done. If there is limitation, the inferior rectus muscle is recessed, and this is combined with a Knapp procedure except in those cases considered to be at risk of ischaemia, that is, those patients over 25 years of age or with a large globe, in whom they do a Callahan procedure...|$|E

The development of carbonate reservoirs having a complex structure and containing heavy oil is caused by the low rates of extraction and values of oil recovery factors. At present, there are no low-cost technologies that ensure high efficiency of development of such fields. The pilot site of the Bashkirian stage drilled with wells of various structure was considered, including the first in the Republic of Tatarstan experience of drilling complexly designed wells with two horizontal boreholes in complex carbonate reservoirs containing heavy oil and selective operation of each borehole using <b>double</b> <b>elevator</b> unit of dual completion.

40|$|Full tendon width {{vertical}} transposition (Knapp procedure) of {{the horizontal}} recti is an established treatment for <b>double</b> <b>elevator</b> palsy (DEP) but the long-term {{stability of the}} surgical results have not been well studied. We undertook a retrospective study to determine the overall effectiveness of the Knapp procedure, the postoperative stability of alignment, {{and the influence of}} prior inferior rectus muscle recession (IRc) on the magnitude of correction. Nineteen patients with DEP underwent a Knapp procedure. Eight were corrected to within 5 delta of orthophoria, six were undercorrected, and five were overcorrected by at least 5 delta after a mean follow-up of 3 years (to last visit or to further surgical intervention). The average vertical correction was 37. 5 delta in patients who underwent a prior IRc compared with 21. 1 delta in patients with no prior IRc (p = 36 months) follow-up demonstrated an increased magnitude of correction (average = 12. 6 delta) over an average follow-up of 76 months. The Knapp procedure had an increasing effect over time but the amount of vertical correction did not correlate with the size of the preoperative vertical deviation and was less predictable when a prior IRc had been performed...|$|E

For example, the 85th floor restaurants can be accessed from the 60th floor sky-lobby. Restaurant customers must clear their reservations at the reception counter on the 2nd floor.

50|$|Historically, AC motors {{were used}} for single or <b>double</b> speed <b>elevator</b> {{machines}} {{on the grounds of}} cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC motor generator were the preferred solution. The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.|$|R
