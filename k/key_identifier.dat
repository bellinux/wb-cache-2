2500|$|In the 1970s, the {{development}} of lesbian feminism pushed butch-femme roles out of popularity. Lesbian separatists such as Sheila Jeffreys argued that all forms of masculinity, including masculine butch women, were negative and harmful to women. The group of radical lesbians often credited with sparking lesbian feminism, Radicalesbians, called butch culture “male-identified role-playing among lesbians”. This encouraged the emergence of androgyny in lesbian feminist circles, with many women wearing clothing like T-shirts, jeans, flannels, and boots. This dress was very similar to butch dress, weakening a <b>key</b> <b>identifier</b> of butch lesbians. While butch-femme roles had previously been the primary way of identifying lesbians and quantifying lesbian relationships in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, lesbian feminist ideology had turned these roles into a [...] "perversion of lesbian identity". Lesbian feminism turned {{the public face of}} lesbians into white, middle class women, often excluding and alienating working class lesbians and lesbians of color. In these excluded communities, butch-femme roles persisted and grew throughout the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} {{are composed of}} resource constrained tiny sensor devices. They have less computational power and memory. Communication in sensor network is done in multi-hop, and for secure communication, neighboring sensor nodes must possess a secret common key among them. Symmetric and public key cryptography require more processing and memory space. Hence, they are not suitable for sensor network. Key pre-distribution is a widely accepted mechanism for key distribution in sensor network. In this thesis we proposed a deterministic key pre-distribution scheme using BCH codes. We mapped the BCH code to <b>key</b> <b>identifier</b> and the keys corresponding to each <b>key</b> <b>identifier</b> are installed into the sensor nodes before deployment. We compared our proposed scheme with existing one {{and found that it}} has a better resiliency. Our proposed scheme is scalable and requires the same or less number of keys for a given number of nodes than the existing well known schemes. We have also proposed an efficient key revocation technique using a novel distributed voting mechanism in which neighboring nodes of a sensor can vote against it if they suspect the node to be a compromised one. In the proposed key revocation scheme compromised nodes as well as the compromised keys are completely removed from the network. ...|$|E

In this essay I explore the context and consequences of media convergence for a professional identity of journalists. Convergence in this context {{is not just}} a technological process, amplified through digitization. Media convergence must also be seen as having a cultural logic of its own, blurring the lines between different channels, forms and formats, between different parts of the media enterprise, between the acts of production and consumption, between making media and using media, and between active or passive spectatorship of mediated culture. Although many of these developments have been addressed in recent scholarship, little theorizing has taken place on the level of the work environment and professional context of journalists, reporters, and editors...|$|E

Debates relating to innate passivity in women, socialisation processes, differential impact of conflict and coincidental factors are explored. Notions of civil society are also investigated and how women are included (or not) in the theory. In particular, {{it is argued that}} the participation of women is a <b>key</b> <b>identifier</b> of both binding and bridging social capital. The interaction of civil society with the project of peacebuilding is also analysed, where the involvement of civil associations is a factor in building participative democracy and has a role in bypassing conflict elites which often hold societies along lines of division. Using the investment in women's training as part of Peace and Reconciliation funding in Northern Ireland as an example, it is concluded that the empowerment of women through building their capacity to participate is essential to building social capital and creating the conditions for a lasting, inclusive peace...|$|E
30|$|In {{these two}} schemes [2, 3], {{increasing}} the number of compromised sensors increases the percentage of compromised links shared by uncompromised sensors. To overcome this problem, in the same work Chan et al. [3] propose to boost up a unique key for each link through multi-path enhancement. For the same purpose, Zhu et al. [16] propose to utilize multiple logic paths. To improve the efficiency of key discovery in [2, 3], which is realized by exchanging the identifiers of the stored keys, or by a challenge-response procedure, Zhu et al. [16] propose an approach based on the pseudo-random key generator seeded by the node id. Each sensor computes the <b>key</b> <b>identifiers</b> and preloads the corresponding keys based on its unique id. Two sensors can determine whether they have a common key based on their ids only. Note that this procedure does not improve the security of the key discovery procedure since an attacker can still Figure out the <b>key</b> <b>identifiers</b> as long as the algorithm is available. Further, a smart attacker can easily beat the pseudo-random key generator to compromise the network faster [17]. Actually for smart attackers, challenge-response is an effective way for key discovery but it is too computationally intensive. Di Pietro et al. [17] propose a pseudo-random key predeployment scheme that supports a key discovery procedure that is as efficient as the pseudo-random key generator [16] and as secure as challenge-response.|$|R

There is a table of Verbs (split across two disks with the separate tables labelled Verbs_ 1. txt, Verbs_ 2. txt), a table of nominalizations from those verbs, including an indication of where a verb fails to license a nominalization (Nouns. txt) and a table which associates the primary <b>key</b> (<b>Identifier)</b> of each Noun entry with the primary key of the corresponding Verb entry (Links. txt). The latter table, when incorporated into an appropriate relational database, allows a very large range of sophisticated queries to be run on the Nouns and Verbs tables concurrently.

40|$|Using {{language}} and writing to distinguish cultures {{from each other}} is commonplace. They are defining characteristics of culture that enable members to identify themselves within their group - by having communication they are tied together. Oral communication is the <b>key</b> <b>identifier</b> for Nyikina people of northern-Western Australia. However, Nyikina language is severely endangered, and risks being lost altogether. If the language were to die, Nyikina people would lose {{a huge part of}} their cultural identity. Working with the Nyikina community as part of a language revitalisation project sparked my interest in the transition from oral to written literature within the Mediterranean. Why did Nyikina not develop their own script, but Minoans and Etruscans did? It would be beneficial to have Etruscan literature or sound recordings describing how the Etruscan language was influenced by Phoenician and Greek cultures, and to know why they created their own alphabet using elements from both colonising influences. Hence, the experience and situation regarding the Nyikina language may provide a general paradigm for understanding and extrapolating the contextual situations of Minoans and Etruscans with respect to their languages, and vice-versa. This was the spring-board to a Masters thesis exploring such changes...|$|E

30|$|The {{pairwise}} key establishment between any two neighboring nodes {{is the main}} objective. Each sensor node can communicate with each neighboring sensor node using the {{pairwise key}} they shared. Eschenauer and Gligor[7] proposed a well-known key management scheme called basic scheme. In the key predistribution phase, a large pool of P keys and their <b>key</b> <b>identifiers</b> are generated. Each sensor node randomly selects k keys from the key pool P without replacement. In the shared-key discovery phase, any two neighboring sensor nodes can {{find out if they}} share (at least) a common key via exchanging the list of <b>key</b> <b>identifiers</b> on their <b>key</b> rings or using a challenge-response protocol. If any two neighboring nodes can not find out a common key on their key rings, they can perform path-key establishment if the graph is connected. Chan et al.[1] proposed three schemes called q-composite random key predistribution, multipath key reinforcement and random-pairwise keys scheme, respectively. The first and second schemes are the modifications of the basic scheme[7]. The q-composite random key predistribution scheme requires that any two neighboring sensor nodes need to share at least q (q> 1) keys for their link in order to increase the resilience against sensor node compromise. The multipath key reinforcement scheme can strengthen any link between any two neighboring sensor nodes that shared a single key via updating the communication key if enough routing information of them can be exchanged. The random-pairwise keys scheme offers the perfect resistance against node capture and node-to-node authentication. These schemes are all based on probabilistic shared keys.|$|R
