This study is motivated {{by the possibility of}} the Earth's core having been formed by liquid iron diapirs melting their way through the solid, deformable mantle. The principal results are the existence of a critical size for the body for the motion to be maintained under gravity and the ease with which an immiscible liquid body can penetrate at constant velocity compared to a solid one...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} {{can be stored}} by three {{different}} ways, namely 1) Sensible heat storage (SHS), 2) Latent heat storage (LHS), and 3) Thermo-Chemical storage (TCS). The SHS refers to the energy systems that store thermal energy without phase change. The SHS occurs by adding <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> the storage <b>medium</b> <b>and</b> increasing its temperature. Heat is added from a <b>heat</b> source <b>to</b> the liquid or solid storage medium. Heating of a material that undergoes a phase change (usually melting) is called the LHS. The amount of energy stored in the LHS depends upon the mass and latent heat of the material. In the LHS, the storage operates isothermally at the phase change of the material. Lastly, comparison of storage. Thermo-chemical storage (TCS) using chemical reactions to store and release thermal energy...|$|R
40|$|The same {{practical}} precautions {{that apply}} to thermocouples also apply to RTD’s, i. e., use shields and twisted-pair wire, use proper sheathing, avoid stress and steep gradients, use large extension wire, keep good documentation and use a guarded integrating dvm. In addition, the following precautions should be observed. Construction- Due to its construction, the RTD is somewhat more fragile than the thermocouple, and precautions {{must be taken to}} protect it. Self-Heating- Unlike the thermocouple, the RTD is not self-powered. A current must be passed through the device to provide a voltage that can be measured. The current causes Joule (I 2 R) heating within the RTD, changing its temperature. This self-heating appears as a measurement error. Consequently, attention must be paid to the magnitude of the measurement current supplied by the ohmmeter. A typical value for selfheating error is 1 2 ºC per milliwatt in free air. Obviously, an RTD immersed in a thermally conductive medium will distribute its Joule <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> the <b>medium,</b> <b>and</b> the error due to self-heating will be smaller. The same RTD that rises 1 ºC per milliwatt in free air will rise only 1 10 ºC per milliwatt in air which is flowing at the rate of one meter per second. 10 Figure 46 To reduce self-heating errors, use the minimum ohms measurement current that will still give the resolution you require, and use the largest RTD you can that will still give good response time. Obviously, there are compromises to be considered. Thermal Shunting- Thermal shunting is the act of altering the measurement temperature by inserting a measurement transducer. Thermal shunting is more a problem with RTD’s than with thermocouples, as the physical bulk of an RTD is greater than that of a thermocouple...|$|R

40|$|Marine bioinvasion {{has been}} {{increasing}} exponentially due to intensive human activities. To manage the threats posed by marine bioinvasion, {{it is important to}} understand the key factors for invasion success. Stress tolerance is thought to play an important role in the invasion process, however, little is known of the nature of this tolerance, particularly whether stress tolerance is species- or population-specific. To determine this, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate differential tolerance of populations of a cosmopolitan marine invasive mussel, Perna viridis, and whether stress tolerance can be altered through pre-selection of individuals. Comparisons were firstly made between two local P. viridis populations from the intertidal and subtidal zones to test if stress tolerance was population-specific. Individuals from the intertidal population had higher baseline heart rates, lower critical salinity values, Scrit, for cardiac activity and longer survival duration at low salinity than individuals from the subtidal population, supporting the presence of population level differences in stress tolerance. Mortality of P. viridis was also compared at sites in both their introduced range (Hong Kong) and native range (Indonesia) which revealed that individuals from the Hong Kong population were more stress tolerant than their native counterparts in Indonesia. Using the same experimental approach, the effect of pre-selection to stress (a prior pre-selection to hypoxia and a subsequent exposure <b>to</b> <b>heat)</b> showed that stress tolerance can be enhanced by pre-selection. The second part of this study investigated whether invasive mussels, Brachidontes variabilis and P. virdis, were more stress tolerant than the native, non-invasive, Septifer virgatus. Laboratory experiments compared the Scrit as well as critical temperature, Hcrit for cardiac activity. Mortality and byssus thread production were also measured in a factorial design with different combinations of temperature (16, 24 and 32 °C) and salinity (8, 16, 32 p. s. u) for 15 days. The two invasive mussels had a higher Hcrit and lower Scrit, which indicated a higher stress tolerance, than the non-invasive mussel. The mortality rate of P. viridis was faster than in B. variabilis and S. virgatus at 8 p. s. u. whereas S. virgatus was the only mussel that exhibited mortality in the medium hyposalinity (16 p. s. u.) and showed much slower byssus attachment than the invasive mussels, suggesting that the invasive mussels are more stress tolerant <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium</b> hyposalinity than the non-invasive species. Overall, stress tolerance proved to be higher in the invasive than non-invasive species and was also population-specific with higher stress tolerance in the invasive population, which may be attributed to the selection of more tolerant individuals during the invasion process. Such a process may occur when founding individuals successfully pass through an invasion process, which may increase the overall mean population-level of stress tolerance and explain why invasive species are generally more stress tolerant than native species. Thus stress tolerance plays an important role in invasion success and invasive species with high stress tolerance may be favoured by climate change, including ocean warming and increased precipitation, which may extend their current distribution range. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
