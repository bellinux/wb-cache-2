25|$|Customs for {{reciting the}} Mourner's Kaddish vary {{markedly}} among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom {{is that all}} the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the earlier custom was that one mourner be chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest, though most congregations have now adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner's Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> left to recite the Mourner's Kaddish on their behalf. In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi will read a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues try to multiply the number of times that the Mourner's Kaddish is recited, for example, reciting a separate Mourner's Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner's Kaddish {{at the end of the}} service.|$|E

25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that the willingness {{to do this kind of}} trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to confide in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.|$|E

Bingham, overruled his lacrosse coach, and had the player, Lucien Victor Alexis, Jr., sent back to Cambridge on a train. Conant subsequently apologized to the Commandant of Midshipmen.

500|$|Johnson had {{the matter}} investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader {{statistics}} re-checked, discovered {{only the first}} game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at [...]385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, [...] "I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am glad that the controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success." ...|$|E

[...] He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled Mira. A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as Praful de pe tobă ("The Dust on the Drum"). It was taped by Virgil Ierunca and serialized by Radio Free Europe (RFE), which broadcast clandestinely into Romania.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{estimates}} and indicators of loneliness. It {{has been estimated}} that approximately 60 million people in the United States, or 20% of the total population, feel lonely. Another study found that 12% of Americans <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> with whom to spend free time or to discuss important matters. Other research suggests that this rate has been increasing over time. The General Social Survey found that between 1985 and 2004, the number of people the average American discusses important matters with decreased from three to two. Additionally, the number of Americans with no one to discuss important matters with tripled (though this particular study may be flawed). [...] In the UK research by Age UK shows half a million people more than 60 years old spend each day alone without social interaction and almost half a million more see and speak to no one for 5 or 6 days a week.|$|E

Dr. Judson Smith on 27 December 1900, {{before he became}} aware of any criticism, gives this account of the {{collection}} of indemnities: After a month of very hard work, I am glad to report progress to you. I visited - beginning on the south - Wen An, Pao Ting Hsien, Pa Chou, P'ing Ting, Cho Chou, Liang Hsiang, and on the east, Shun Yi. I found the officials in all these places exceedingly friendly and anxious to settle the affairs of the converts, recognizing the right and the need of such claims. I have made no use of foreign soldiers and brought no external pressure to bear, relying on the justice of our claims. Mr. Conger has supported us in the measures and methods taken, though the military people have not failed to make criticisms. The survivors in all our country stations have been recouped for all their losses, again reinstated in their villages, with some money in hand, and a promise of houses restored next spring. Over and above restoration for the converts there has been gathered a fund for the support of widows and orphans, who have no homes and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to look after them." ...|$|E
2500|$|By year's end, the Democratic {{governor}} of Missouri, Warren E. Hearnes, warned that Johnson {{would lose the}} state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a 500,000 margin in 1964. [...] "Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs" [...] had eroded the President's standing, the governor reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in interest rates. Johnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson's approval ratings stayed below 50 percent; by January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16%, from 25 percent four months before. He ran about even with Republican George Romney in trial matchups that spring. Asked {{to explain why he}} was unpopular, Johnson responded, [...] "I am a dominating personality, and when I get things done I don't always please all the people." [...] Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed [...] "complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to be answerable to." [...] He also blamed [...] "the preachers, liberals and professors" [...] who had turned against him.|$|E
2500|$|Butler {{had already}} done the {{institution}} of slavery in the Confederacy considerable damage by instituting his “contraband of war” policy while commanding Fort Monroe on the Virginia peninsula. This policy rationalized the retention of slaves fleeing the seceding states by claiming that the Confederate military was using slave labor for military use {{in the construction of}} fortifications, moving military supplies, and constructing roads and railroad grades of use to the Confederate army. Slaves within areas of Confederate control rapidly spread the word that Union military forces were not enforcing the fugitive slave laws, and that slaves could find refuge within Union military lines and employment as laborers for the Union armies. As a result, the use of slaves in the proximity of Union forces became extremely difficult and expensive, since these slaves would flee at first opportunity to Union lines, depriving the Confederate armies of their labor and their former masters of what they regarded as their valuable property. Since the Confederate government was counting on slave labor to offset the greater numbers of Union soldiers, Butler’s innovative policy struck the Confederacy at a strategic level, destroying an asset counted on to win the military struggle for independence. The flight of the slaves {{in the direction of the}} Union also diverted the resources of the Confederate military and its government in defense of the plantations and the discipline of their labor forces. The planters of Louisiana even appealed for aid from Union authorities, to quote one of them, “Our family has owned negroes for generations… we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> but yourself and Genls Shepley and Butler to protect us against these negroes in a state of insurrection.” The plantations of Jefferson Davis, located in the state of Mississippi on Davis Bend [...] downriver from Vicksburg, were also disrupted by the Union invasion. After Davis' older brother Joseph fled the area with some of the slaves in May 1862, the rest revolted, took possession of the property, and betrayed the location of valuables to Union forces and resisted any efforts by Confederate forces to recapture the area. The slaves in rebellion armed themselves with guns and newspapers, and fought to the death any attempts to infringe upon their newfound freedom. This rebellion within a rebellion began to erode Confederate authority within Louisiana the instant Butler's troops appeared in New Orleans, and as a political fifth column was invaluable to his occupation.|$|E
