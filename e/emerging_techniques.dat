2500|$|As {{the second}} largest class of enzymes behind {{ubiquitin}} ligases and responsible for ~2% of any organism's genes, proteases have drawn the attention of biologists to develop a field aimed to identify and quantify their roles in biology. First coined in 2000 by the Overall Lab in McQuibban et al, degradomics was described as linking proteases to substrates on a proteome basis. The discoveries of novel roles for proteases and breakthroughs in protease-substrate discovery would be summarized later by Dr. Carlos Lopez-Otin and Dr. Chris Overall, introducing degradomics on a system-wide scale. They collated the current and <b>emerging</b> <b>techniques</b> available to describe proteolysis. By drawing attention to how proteolysis serves as an additional irreversible mechanism by which cells could achieve control over biological processes, they outlined the necessity of studying proteases for their functional relevance in processing bioactive molecules. These bioactive molecules play roles in coagulation, complement activation, DNA replication, cell-cycle control, cellular proliferation and migration, hemostasis, immunity, and apoptosis. [...] The degradome was broken down into two concepts, the first referring the entire profile of proteases expressed under by a cell, tissue, or organism under defined circumstances.

Encouraged by this <b>emerging</b> <b>technique,</b> this paper briefly reviews the application of Compressive sampling in speech processing. It comprises the basic study of two necessary condition of compressive sensing theory: sparsity and incoherence.

50|$|<b>Emerging</b> <b>techniques</b> and {{software}} are allowing for motion to be tracked {{without the need}} for radio-opaque markers. By using a 3-D model of the object being tracked, the object can be overlaid on the images of the X-ray video at each frame. The translations and rotations of the model, as opposed to a set of markers, are then tracked relative to the X-ray camera(s). Using a local coordinate system, these translations and rotations can then be mapped to standard anatomical movements. The 3-D model of the object is generated from any 3-D imaging technique, such as an MRI or CT scan. Markerless tracking has the benefit of being a non-invasive tracking method, avoiding any complications due to surgeries. One difficulty comes from generating the 3-D model in animal studies, as the animals are required to be sedated or sacrificed for the scan.|$|E

Special computer algorithms are designed to allow the system to analyze multiple streams of optical input and identify human forms, breaking them down into constituent parts for tracking. ESC entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers Pictures created specially to enable virtual cinematography, including photorealistic digital look-alikes for filming The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions movies, used a technique called Universal Capture that utilized 7 camera setup and the tracking the optical flow of all pixels over all the 2-D planes of the cameras for motion, gesture and facial expression capture leading to photorealistic results.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-18th century, horn players {{began to}} insert {{the right hand}} into the bell to change the {{effective}} length of the instrument, adjusting the tuning up to the distance between two adjacent harmonics {{depending on how much}} of the opening was covered. This technique, known as hand-stopping, is generally credited to the self-same Anton Joseph Hampel who created the Inventionshorn. It was first developed around 1750, and was refined and carried to much of Europe by the influential Giovanni Punto. This offered more possibilities for playing notes not on the harmonic series. By the early classical period, the horn had become an instrument capable of much melodic playing. A notable example of this are the four Mozart Horn Concerti and Concert Rondo (K. 412, 417, 477, 495, 371), wherein melodic chromatic tones are used, owing to the growing prevalence of hand-stopping and other newly <b>emerging</b> <b>techniques.</b>|$|E
