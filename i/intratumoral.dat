50|$|Adoptive {{transfer}} involves either collecting {{from patients}} <b>intratumoral</b> or blood T cells, stimulate them in vitro against antigens {{present in the}} tumors and reinfuse them in large number into the patients, or using gene-modified T cells that recognize a tumor antigen.|$|E
50|$|T cells must {{reproduce}} {{after arriving}} at the tumor site to further increase their numbers, survive the TME's hostile elements and migrate through the stroma to the cancer cells. The TME obstructs all three activities. The draining lymph nodes are the likely location for T cell clonal reproduction, although this also occurs within the tumor. Preclinical models suggest that the TME is the major site of cancer-specific T cell cloning and that the CD8+ T cell replicative response there is orchestrated by the CD103+, Baft3-dependent DC, which can efficiently cross-present cancer cell antigens, suggesting that therapeutic interventions that enhance CD103+ contribute to tumor control. Among such strategies are antibodies to the interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R). In a mammary carcinoma mouse model it neutralized the effects of TAM-produced IL10, relieved the suppression of IL12 production by <b>intratumoral</b> DCs and improved the CD8+ T cell-dependent antitumor effects of chemotherapy. A similar outcome was achieved by neutralizing macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1, which impaired the <b>intratumoral</b> accumulation of TAMs. Another strategy is the administration of antibody-interferon-β (IFN-β) complexes that activate <b>intratumoral</b> DCs to cross-present antigen to CD8+ T cells. They are targeted against oncogenic receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).|$|E
50|$|Tumors with {{insufficient}} {{blood supply}} often cause interstitial hypoxia, which subsequently contributes to acidosis. The <b>intratumoral</b> hypoxia and acidosis may {{extend to the}} surrounding tissue.

50|$|The TME {{may also}} {{directly}} impair <b>intratumoral</b> T cell proliferation. Indole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)—which {{can be expressed}} by DCs, MDSCs and cancer cells—catabolizes tryptophan and generates kynurenine. Both the deprivation of tryptophan and the generation of its metabolic product inhibit clonal T cell expansion. IDO also promotes the conversion of T cells to Treg cells and increases IL-6 expression, which augments MDSC functions. Accordingly, IDO1 genetic deficiency is associated with reduced tumor burden and metastasis and enhanced survival in mouse models of lung and breast cancer. The therapeutic potential of inhibiting IDO, in combination with anti-CTLA-4 was demonstrated in the B16 melanoma model and was associated with increased <b>intratumoral</b> T cells. IDO's capacity to block Treg cell to helperlike cell reprogramming by sustaining transcription factor Eos and the transcriptional program it regulates, also suppresses the immune response.|$|E

Approaches used to target this tumor-specific epitope include unarmed and radiolabeled antibody therapy and cell mediated approaches using peptide vaccines and dendritic cells. Another area of interest involves drug delivery to brain tumors.

Effects included hemorrhagic necrosis, tumor cell lysis and tumor regression. <b>Intratumoral</b> application increased spore concentrations in the tumor and reduced side effects. Bacteriolysis in hypoxic tumor parts can be combined with chemotherapy and/or radiation that are more effective in proliferating, non-hypoxic areas {{at the cost of}} increased toxicity. Normal cells are generally not hypoxic, preventing these bacteria from penetrating such tumors. Bacteria also potentially can stimulate the immune system, possibly offsetting the tumor-induced immunosuppression, such as from PD-L1.|$|E
50|$|Tumor {{cells can}} {{regulate}} gene expression in growing vessels {{and the surrounding}} stroma during tumor neovascularization. T-cadherin expression {{was found to be}} altered in tumor vessels: in Lewis carcinoma lung metastasis the expression of T-cadherin was upregulated in blood vessels penetrating the tumor, while T-cadherin was not detected in the surrounding tumor tissue. In tumor neovascularization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) T-cadherin is upregulated in <b>intratumoral</b> capillary endothelial cells, whereas in surrounding tumor tissue as well as in normal liver no T-cadherin could be detected. The increase in T-cadherin expression in endothelial cell in HCC was shown to correlate with tumors progression. Presumably, T-cadherin could play a navigating role in the growing tumor vessels, which in the absence of contact inhibition from the stromal cells, grow into the surrounding tumor tissue.|$|E
50|$|Tumor {{eradication}} resulted when PD-L1 (also {{induced by}} IFN-β acting on DCs) was neutralized. DC function {{also may be}} adversely affected by the TME's hypoxic conditions, which induces PD-L1 expression on DCs and other myelomonocytic cells {{as a result of}} hypoxia-inducible factors-1α (HIF-1α) binding directly to a hypoxia-responsive element in the PD-L1 promoter. Even the aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells may antagonize local immune reactions via increasing lactate production, which induces the M2 TAM polarization. An M1 to M2 phenotypic transition of <b>intratumoral</b> macrophages was reported after the induction of cancer cell apoptosis in human and mouse gastrointestinal stromal tumors by KIT oncoprotein inhibitor imatinib. The designation of M1 and M2 polarization states over-simplify macrophage biology, since at least six different TAM subpopulations are known. Therefore, TME TAM phenotype descriptors are likely important.|$|E
50|$|Park et al. {{conceptualized}} carcinogenesis of {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} (HCC) as a multistep process involving parenchymal arterialization, sinusoidal capillarization, {{and development of}} unpaired arteries (a vital component of tumor angiogenesis). All these events lead to a gradual shift in tumor blood supply from portal to arterial circulation. This concept has been validated using dynamic imaging modalities by various investigators. Sigurdson et al. demonstrated that when an agent was infused via the hepatic artery, <b>intratumoral</b> concentrations were ten times greater compared to when agents were administered through the portal vein. Hence, arterial treatment targets the tumor while normal liver is relatively spared. Embolization induces ischemic necrosis of tumor causing {{a failure of the}} transmembrane pump, resulting in a greater absorption of agents by the tumor cells. Tissue concentration of agents within the tumor is greater than 40 times that of the surrounding normal liver.|$|E
50|$|In {{ovarian cancer}} {{elevated}} VEGF levels and {{expression of the}} immune regulatory ligand B7H3 (CD276), or the endothelin B receptor (ETBR) on tumor vessels correlate with decreased T cell infiltration and worse clinical outcome. Pharmacological inhibition of ETBR increased T cell adhesion to endothelial cells in an intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)-dependent manner, increasing TIL numbers in mice and a corresponding tumor response. Anti-angiogenic inhibitors targeting VEGF and its receptor VEGFR2 (approved for treatment of multiple cancers) induce vascular normalization. This, in turn, increases TILs and improves ACT and vaccine efficacy in preclinical models. VEGF impairs DC maturation, offering another means to enhance <b>intratumoral</b> immune responses. Deleting the regulator of G-protein signaling, Rgs5 reduced vessel leakiness and hypoxia, enhanced T cell infiltration into mouse pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and prolonged animal survival. Vascular normalization is thus likely more effective than vessel destruction. Targeted delivery of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was reported to normalize tumor blood vessels, increase CD8+ T cell infiltration and enhance vaccine and ACT therapies, unlike inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ).|$|E
5000|$|Activating {{mutations}} in PDGFRA {{have been detected}} in 5-12% of Gastrointestinal stromal tumor. [...] Fusion of PDGFRA {{has been found to}} be responsible for hematological malignances like hypereosinophilic syndrome. [...] The amplification of chromosome 4q12, the site of the PDGFRA gene, has been identified in 13-29% of adult gliomas and in 29% to 36% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), a subset of high-grade gliomas (HGG) in pediatric patients. Activation of PDGFRB, a third member of the type III RTK family, has been implicated in the development of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia due to the fusion of PDGFRB with the TEL gene. [...] Furthermore, PDGFB translocation to the COL1A1 gene locus has been identified to be responsible for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). [...] In cancer cells, PDGFR promotes tumor development and migration via proto-oncogenic downstream mediators like AKT and MEK. In stromal fibroblasts, PDGFRα activation leads to local tissue invasion, production and secretion of VEGF, and elevated <b>intratumoral</b> interstitial pressure. In stromal pericytes, PDGFRβ activation mediates vascular stability. [...] Thus, either FLT3 or PDGF/PDGFR pathway is the primary driver of oncogenesis in the above malignancies and can be targeted by crenolanib therapy.|$|E
40|$|Tumor {{angiogenesis}} {{is essential}} for tumor growth and metastasis, and <b>intratumoral</b> microvessel density correlates with prognosis in breast carcinoma. Yet, how <b>intratumoral</b> microvessel density correlates with tumor cell and <b>intratumoral</b> endothelial cell proliferation remains incompletely understood. To this end, we stained 57 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas with antibody MIB 1 to determine tumor cell Ki 67 labeling index and with anti-CD 34 to observe microvessels. We correlated the tumor cell Ki 67 labeling index and mitotic figure index with <b>intratumoral</b> microvessel density. Using a double labeling technique combining antibody MIB 1 and anti-CD 34, we measured <b>intratumoral</b> endothelial cell proliferation in 20 of these cases and correlated these findings with tumor cell Ki 67 labeling index, mitotic figure index, and <b>intratumoral</b> microvessel density.

Patients and methods. A retrospective cohort of brain tumors from August 2008 to March 2013 was searched, and 58 patients (19 with primary central nervous system lymphoma, 39 with glioblastoma multiforme) satisfied the inclusion criteria. Absence of gross <b>intratumoral</b> hemorrhage was examined on T 2 WI, and an <b>intratumoral</b> susceptibility signal was graded using a 3 -point scale on susceptibility-weighted imaging. Results were compared between primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma multiforme, and values of P < 0. 05 were considered significant. Results. Gross <b>intratumoral</b> hemorrhage on T 2 WI was absent in 15 patients (79 %) with primary central nervous system lymphoma and 23 patients (59 %) with glioblastoma multiforme.

40|$|Despite {{temozolomide}} (TMZ) treatment, {{the prognosis}} {{for patients with}} glioblastoma multiforme is still dismal. As dose escalation of TMZ is limited by systemic toxicity, <b>intratumoral</b> delivery emerges as an attractive treatment modality, which may sustain cytotoxic drug concentrations intratumorally and induce immunogenic cell death. Both clinical and experimental gliomas have responded to immunotherapy, but the benefit of simultaneous chemo- and immunotherapy is inadequately studied. Here, we monitored survival of GL 261 -bearing C 57 BL/ 6 mice following a 3 -day treatment with either <b>intratumoral</b> TMZ (micro-osmotic pump, 4. 2 mg/kg/day) or systemic TMZ (i. p. injections, 50 mg/kg/day) alone, or combined with immunization using GM-CSF secreting GL 261 cells.

We assessed the prognostic influence of <b>intratumoral</b> vessel invasion {{and its ability to}} provide a differential prediction of prognosis for completely resected pathologic stage I non–small cell lung cancer. MethodsWe analyzed 258 patients with non–small cell lung cancer who underwent complete resection between January of 1996 and December of 2005 and were diagnosed with pathologic stage I disease. In addition to the conventional staging factors, <b>intratumoral</b> vessel invasion in the primary lesion was histologically evaluated by both hematoxylin-eosin and elastic staining. We examined the significance of <b>intratumoral</b> vessel invasion in prognosis and compared the outcomes between patients with and without this factor with stage IA and IB disease, respectively. ResultsIntratumoral vessel invasion was found in 124 patients (48 %). Five-year survival of patients with or without <b>intratumoral</b> vessel invasion was 74 % and 93 %, respectively. On multivariate analysis, <b>intratumoral</b> vessel invasion and pleural invasion were shown to be independent prognostic factors. Subgroup analyses suggested that patients with pathologic-stage IA with <b>intratumoral</b> vessel invasion and patients with pathologic-stage IB with both <b>intratumoral</b> vessel and pleural invasion had significantly worse prognosis than patients with the same pathologic stage without these factors.

40|$|Background: Substantial {{evidence}} suggests that the presence of inflammatory cells plays a critical role in the development and/or progression of human tumors. Neutrophils are the common inflammatory cells in tumors; however, the infiltration of <b>intratumoral</b> neutrophils in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and its effect on CRC patients ’ prognosis are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, the methods of tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to investigate the prognostic significance of <b>intratumoral</b> CD 66 b+ neutrophil in CRC. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the cutoff score for high <b>intratumoral</b> CD 66 b+ neutrophil in CRC was defined when the mean counts were more than 60 per TMA spot. In our study, high <b>intratumoral</b> CD 66 b+ neutrophil was observed in 104 / 229 (45. 4 %) of CRCs and in 29 / 229 (12. 7 %) of adjacent mucosal tissues. Further correlation analysis showed that high <b>intratumoral</b> neutrophil was positively correlated with pT status, pM status and clinical stage (P, 0. 05). In univariate survival analysis, a significant association between high <b>intratumoral</b> neutrophil and shortened patients ’ survival was found (P, 0. 0001).
