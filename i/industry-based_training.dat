40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that Industry based learning and teaching, especially through company assigned student projects or training programs, {{is an integral}} part of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. In this paper we show that <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> and experience increases students’ academic performances independent to the organizational parameters and contexts. The literature on <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> focuses on employability and the industry dimension, and neglects in many ways the academic dimension. We observed that the association factors between academic attributes and contributions of <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> are central and vital to the technological learning experiences. We explore international initiatives and statistics collected of student projects in two categories: Industry based learning performances and on campus performances. The data collected were correlated to five (5) universities in different industrialized countries, e. g., Australia N= 545 projects, Norway N= 279, Germany N= 74, France N= 107 and Spain N= 802. We analyzed <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> along with company assigned student projects compared with in comparisons to campus performance. The data that suggests a strong correlation between <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> per se and improved performance profiles or increasing motivation shows that <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> increases student academic performance independent of organizational parameters and contexts. The programs we augmented were orthogonal to each other however, the trend of the students’ academic performances are identical. An isolated cohort for the reported countries that opposed our hypothesis warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> {{is not limited to}} work experience; work {{integrated}} learning, internship or extended vacation work. It is also about bringing back the lost parts of technological education. We experience the unilateral focus on theoretical knowledge at the expense of skills and general competences as one important challenge in technological education. The lacking facilitation and training of practical skills and general competences in the curricula and programs are identified, but many institutions have failed to address the problem. Today’s curricula in many ways reduce technology to abstract concepts, calculations and models, and create a gap between the academic programs and the practical applications in the society. We explore two (Australia and Norway) initiatives on <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> and discuss how these initiatives address and bridge the gap. We argue that these initiatives of <b>industry-based</b> student <b>training</b> contribute to bringing skills and general competences back into technological education, and that the effects are not limited to increased employability, but also include increased academic performance...|$|R

30|$|In both countries, {{commercial}} apprenticeships play {{an important}} role within the VET system. In Switzerland, with approximately 30, 000 trainees, commercial apprenticeships are by far the most popular of the VET programs among male and female youths (Swiss Conference of Commercial Training and Examination Branches 2011 a). Commercial training is allocated to the three following learning locations (SERI 2011): (1) training at the host company; (2) classroom instruction at vocational schools; and (3) training in branch training centers. In the branch courses, trainees spend 8 – 16  days for 3  years at branch training centers, where they are provided with essential practical skills for one of the 21 branches. There is only one commercial apprenticeship that leads to the same VET certificate for all learners. However, the program is differentiated with respect to the 21 commercial branches (e.g., banking, industry, and logistics). The school-based general education is identical and standardized across all branches, whereas the company-based and <b>industry-based</b> vocational <b>training</b> is more flexible and varies among the branches because of their specific business structures and processes (Swiss Conference of Commercial Training and Examination Branches 2011 b).|$|R

40|$|Indigenous {{peoples in}} remote {{contexts}} are engaging with new communication and information technologies, yet {{this may not}} be realised by mainstream vocational education and training (VET) providers. This paper will utilise evidence from recent case studies that suggests that new technologies have a significant role to play in the development of networks, resources and learning spaces for remote Australian Indigenous peoples. We explore key barriers to the use of new technologies including restrictive funding models and poor cross-agency and organisation coordination which hinders the provision of services, interoperability issues and the ability to respond to the demand for emerging uses for technologies. This paper also discusses key issues around the suitability of available resources, applicability of the <b>industry-based</b> nationally accredited <b>training</b> packages in remote contexts, variable educational profiles of the learners, and the variable skills of teaching staff to develop and use suitable resources and technologies...|$|R
40|$|To compete internationally, New Zealand’s {{manufacturing}} SMEs {{must have}} the capability to design and produce innovative products that not only satisfy market requirements in respect to quality and performance, but also capture customers’ imagination. Products involving significant technology or engineering development are particularly challenging in this respect, because product designers and engineers must be able to cover relevant engineering fundamentals as well as the creative and managerial skills required to drive product development. In today's global competitive environment the success of New Zealand manufacturing SMEs depends vitally on their ability to create synergies between a broad spectrum of disciplines such as engineering design, industrial and graphic design, technology management, business innovation, change management, branding and marketing. This paper describes an innovative, multi-disciplinary education program which is aimed at the development of talent pathways for students in engineering, business, science and arts, which reflects the skill requirements of technology-based manufacturing SMEs. Concurrently a professional development framework for design practitioners from the industry is being established that caters to their specific training needs, reflects the requirements of professional bodies and industry training organisations, and is closely integrated with the academic curriculum. Based on this educational framework, a comprehensive design training programme consisting of specific design courses, teaching modules, short courses on particular design related topics, and <b>industry-based</b> <b>training</b> activities such as design internships, practice-based case studies and collaborative project work, is currently developed and implemented. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} reports {{an evaluation}} study which {{was done with}} an educational programme for Automotive Service Technicians which was adapted for South African conditions and derived from a programme used internationally, and originally developed in Schweinfurt, Germany in 2005. The programme was designed to answer to particular problems experienced during automotive driveline-component installations. Since the inception of this programme, ZF Germany had been training representatives from their different subsidiaries over {{the world on the}} essential elements of automotive driveline installation protocol. The representatives were trained to adapt the core programme in accordance with the particulars of the vehicle populations in each respective country, and the researcher has performed this task The aim of this research was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} one particular module known as “Guidelines to clutch replacement” with regard to bringing about the desired changes in knowledge, attitude and behaviour within the trainees. Previous anecdotal feedback from the industry had suggested that the programme had been helpful in the reduction of installation errors, but the extent of the successes and failures of the programme had been unknown until this study. The training department at ZF South Africa was tasked to design further training modules based on the findings of the module under study in order to establish the successes and failures of the core concept for improvement of successive programmes. The approach for this programme evaluation was utilization-focused which allowed the researcher to choose from and combine a variety of data collection strategies over the complete range of summative and formative evaluation approaches. However, in keeping with the stated aim of this study, this study had been limited to a summative inquiry by employing a quantitative data collection strategy at the hand of a quasi-experimental research design. This research report presents the findings of a one-day intervention programme that was offered to Automotive Service Technicians in the Gauteng area. The conceptual framework that was adopted for the research was based on the four level evaluation framework of Kirkpatrick (1998) with the first three levels having been empirically tested and the fourth level discussed on the basis of empirical information. Findings suggest that although the levels of knowledge-acquisition could not to be considered as high, behaviour modification had indeed been observed to be in alignment with the clutch-installation-protocol and almost all the respondents had adopted the protocol as their preferred way of executing clutch installations. In addition, most respondents found the programme to be pleasant and of a high utility value. Certain problems with the programme became evident, such as the pace having been too fast; printed hand-outs were not considered to have high utility value, and sensitivity to personal and cultural differences were found to be lacking. The low levels recorded for knowledge acquisition may be language related which possibly relates to the fast pace of the course. The research findings suggest that the course should be spread over two days instead of one day and be augmented with practical demonstrations and re-designed printed hand-outs. In order to effectively measure level four of the Kirkpatrick framework, criteria of concern should be negotiated with participating organisations in order to provide relative data for answering research questions on this level. Procedures for collecting data over the course of several years need to be established and agreed upon by all stakeholders for such data to be reliable and valid in the inclusion of a time-series study. Regarding a relatively simple programme such as the programme under study with programme objectives that have a predominant procedural-knowledge focus, the Kirkpatrick framework has been found to be effective and its procedures may be applied in other <b>industry-based</b> <b>training</b> programmes. An added academic contribution to the previous one is that the Kirkpatrick framework as utilised in this study has shown that the framework offers a high utility value for fast-paced short courses where contact time with trainees are limited and evaluation designs need to fit in with the practical limitations. The high utility value of the Kirkpatrick framework became evident in the findings of this study where transfer of learning had evidently taken place regardless of possible learning problems such as language barriers.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is an {{evaluation}} of college-based and <b>industry-based</b> craft <b>training</b> courses designed for those wishing to become professional chefs and waiters. The main issues addressed are the effectiveness of college-based craft training courses in meeting the future requirements of the hotel and catering industry, {{the needs of the}} employer and the future career horizons of craft students once they leave college. Having identified the main issues for research, the ways of evaluating college-based craft courses are considered. The thesis is presented in seven parts. Each section or chapter is concerned with a particular facet of the environment in which craft courses operate and their purpose. Research methods included surveys, field research, desk research, interviews and participative observation. At the outset, the reasons are outlined why the thesis is of importance to the writer as a craft lecturer and the likely benefits that may accrue to those who design and teach craft courses are discussed. This is followed by a description of how the data were gathered. An overview of recent research into craft training and education then follows as a basis for further development and application. An audit is made of the commercial, economic and manpower predictions for the industry; and this is followed by a discussion on technological developments, eating fashions and eating trends that will inevitably have an effect upon craft training. A profile of craftspeople in the industry is presented and predictions made of numbers required within the different industrial sectors. An analysis is made of the tasks and skills needed, and areas of knowledge considered by craftspeople as essential in the performance of their work. This leads into a consideration of the college environment, craft courses, their design, structure and content. Teaching approaches are discussed, together with the personal development of those who teach craft subjects. The findings are then brought into the context of the different views held by those involved in catering training and education; this sets the scene for the drawing together of the key findings and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary The energy {{development}} assumptions {{identified in the}} Department of Energy's position paper, 20 % Wind Energy by 2030, projected an exploding demand for wind energy-related workforce development. These primary assumptions drove a secondary set of assumptions that early stage wind industry workforce development and training paradigms would need to undergo significant change if the workforce needs were to be met. The current training practice and culture within the wind industry is driven by {{a relatively small number}} of experts with deep field experience and knowledge. The current training methodology is dominated by face-to-face, classroom based, instructor present training. Given these assumptions and learning paradigms, the purpose of the National Wind Distance Learning Collaborative was to determine the feasibility of developing online learning strategies and products focused on training wind technicians. The initial project scope centered on (1) identifying resources that would be needed for development of subject matter and course design/delivery strategies for <b>industry-based</b> (non-academic) <b>training,</b> and (2) development of an appropriate Learning Management System (LMS). As the project unfolded, the initial scope was expanded to include development of learning products and the addition of an academic-based training partner. The core partners included two <b>training</b> entities, <b>industry-based</b> Airstreams Renewables and academic-based Lake Area Technical Institute. A third partner, Vision Video Interactive, Inc. provided technology-based learning platforms (hardware and software). The revised scope yielded an expanded set of results beyond the initial expectation. Eight learning modules were developed for the industry-based Electrical Safety course. These modules were subsequently redesigned and repurposed for test application in an academic setting. Software and hardware developments during the project's timeframe enabled redesign providing for student access through the use of tablet devices such as iPads. Early prototype Learning Management Systems (LMS) featuring more student-centric access and interfaces with emerging social media were developed and utilized during the testing applications. The project also produced soft results involving cross learning between and among the partners regarding subject matter expertise, online learning pedagogy, and eLearning technology-based platforms. The partners believe that the most significant, overarching accomplishment of the project was the development and implementation of goals, activities, and outcomes that significantly exceeded those proposed in the initial grant application submitted in 2009. Key specific accomplishments include: (1) development of a set of 8 online learning modules addressing electrical safety as it relates to the work of wind technicians; (3) development of a flexible, open-ended Learning Management System (LMS) : (3) creation of a robust body of learning (knowledge, experience, skills, and relationships). Project leaders have concluded that there is substantial resource equity that could be leverage and recommend that it be carried forward to pursue a Next Stage Opportunity relating to development of an online core curriculum for institute and community college energy workforce development programs...|$|R
