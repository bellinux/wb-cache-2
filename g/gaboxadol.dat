5000|$|<b>Gaboxadol,</b> {{also known}} as 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP), is a conformationally {{constrained}} derivative of the alkaloid muscimol that was first synthesized in 1977 by the Danish chemist Povl Krogsgaard-Larsen. In the early 1980s <b>gaboxadol</b> {{was the subject of}} a series of pilot studies that tested its efficacy as an analgesic and anxiolytic, as well as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and spasticity. It was not until 1996 that researchers attempted to harness gaboxadol's frequently reported sedative [...] "adverse effect" [...] for the treatment of insomnia, resulting in a series of clinical trials sponsored by Lundbeck and Merck. In March, 2007, Merck and Lundbeck cancelled work on the drug, citing safety concerns and the failure of an efficacy trial. It acts on the GABA system, but in a different way from benzodiazepines, Z-Drugs, and barbiturates. Lundbeck states that <b>gaboxadol</b> also increases deep sleep (stage 4). It is, however, not reinforcing like benzodiazepines are.|$|E
50|$|Also {{note that}} some GABAA {{agonists}} such as muscimol and <b>gaboxadol</b> do bind {{to the same}} site on the GABAA receptor complex as GABA itself, and consequently produce effects which are similar but not identical to those of positive allosteric modulators like benzodiazepines.|$|E
50|$|The {{active site}} of the GABAA {{receptor}} is the binding site for GABA and several drugs such as muscimol, <b>gaboxadol,</b> and bicuculline. The protein also contains {{a number of different}} allosteric binding sites which modulate the activity of the receptor indirectly. These allosteric sites are the targets of various other drugs, including the benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines, neuroactive steroids, barbiturates, ethanol, inhaled anaesthetics, and picrotoxin, among others.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gaboxadol,</b> a {{selective}} extra synaptic GABA(A) receptor agonist, {{has been in}} clinical development {{for the treatment of}} insomnia. Development of tolerance to therapeutic effects (e. g. hypnotic and anticonvulsant and sedative) and withdrawal symptoms (e. g. REM sleep rebound and reduced seizure threshold) upon treatment discontinuation is reported for GABA(A) receptor allosteric modulators acting via the benzodiazepine binding site, e. g. zolpidem and indiplon. We conducted a head to head comparison in rats of the hypnotic (sleep EEG after 21 daily doses and 24 and 48 h after the last dose) and seizure threshold modifying (bicuculline assay 24 h after 28 daily doses) effects of <b>gaboxadol</b> and benzodiazepine ligands. Furthermore, we investigated in further details a previously reported apparent rapid development of tolerance to gaboxadol's effects in a rat rotarod motor coordination assay and related this effect to CNS exposure levels and in vitro potency at extra synaptic GABA(A) receptors. Sleep EEG studies demonstrated lack of tolerance and withdrawal effects after 28 daily doses with <b>gaboxadol,</b> whereas zolpidem produced both tolerance and withdrawal effects under a similar dosing regimen. Daily dosing with <b>gaboxadol,</b> zolpidem or indiplon for 28 days and acute discontinuation of treatment left the threshold to bicuculline-induced seizures unchanged. The rapidly attenuated effect of repeated <b>gaboxadol</b> dosing was confirmed in the rotarod model. However, re-challenge of <b>gaboxadol</b> insensitive animals with <b>gaboxadol</b> produced a maximum response, ruling out that receptor desensitisation accounts for these effects. By comparing CNS exposure at rotarod responses and concentration response relation at cloned GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes it appears that the decline in response in the rotarod model coincides with the steep part of the concentration response curve for <b>gaboxadol</b> at extra synaptic GABA(A) receptors. In conclusion, rat sleep EEG repeated dose studies of <b>gaboxadol</b> confirm a hypnotic-like profile and no withdrawal effects, whereas tolerance and withdrawal effects were shown with zolpidem. Withdrawal from <b>gaboxadol,</b> zolpidem and indiplon did not affect the seizure threshold to bicuculline. Gaboxadol's apparent rapid development of tolerance in the rotarod assay appears to be kinetically determined. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Sleep is {{a dynamic}} process {{comprising}} multiple stages, each associated with distinct electrophysiological properties and potentially serving different functions. While these phenomena are well described in vertebrates, it is unclear if invertebrates have distinct sleep stages. We perform local field potential (LFP) recordings on flies spontaneously sleeping, and compare their brain activity to flies induced to sleep using either genetic activation of sleep-promoting circuitry or the GABAA agonist <b>Gaboxadol.</b> We find a transitional sleep stage associated with a 7 - 10 Hz oscillation in the central brain during spontaneous sleep. Oscillatory activity is also evident when we acutely activate sleep-promoting neurons in the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) of Drosophila. In contrast, sleep following <b>Gaboxadol</b> exposure is characterized by low-amplitude LFPs, during which dFB-induced effects are suppressed. Sleep in flies thus appears to involve at least two distinct stages: increased oscillatory activity, particularly during sleep induction, followed by desynchronized or decreased brain activity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Neural {{inhibition}} {{plays an}} important role in auditory processing and attentional gating. Extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (GABAAR), containing a 4 and d GABAAR subunits, are thought to be activated by GABA spillover outside of the synapse following release resulting in a tonic inhibitory Cl 2 current which could account for up to 90 % of total inhibition in visual and somatosensory thalamus.

40|$|The {{neurotransmitter}} GABA mediates {{the majority}} of rapid inhibition in the CNS. Inhibition can occur via the conventional mechanism, the transient activation of subsynaptic GABAA receptors (GABAA-Rs), or via continuous activation of high-affinity receptors by low concentrations of ambient GABA, leading to “tonic” inhibition that can control levels of excitability and network activity. The GABAA-R α 4 subunit is expressed at high levels in the dentate gyrus and thalamus and is suspected to contribute to extrasynaptic GABAA-R-mediated tonic inhibition.

Behaviorally, knockout mice are insensitive to the ataxic, sedative, and analgesic effects of the novel hypnotic drug, <b>gaboxadol.</b> These data demonstrate that tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells and thalamic relay neurons is mediated by extrasynaptic GABAA-Rs containing the α 4 subunit and that <b>gaboxadol</b> achieves its effects via the activation of this GABAA-R subtype...|$|E
40|$|The {{gamma-aminobutyric acid}} (GABA) Type A {{receptor}} (GABAA-R) mediates {{the majority of}} rapid inhibition in {{the central nervous system}} and is the site of action for many clinically used drugs. GABAA-R mediated inhibition can occur via the conventional mechanism - the transient activation of synaptic receptors i. e. phasic inhibition, or via continuous activation of extrasynaptic, high affinity receptors by low concentrations of ambient GABA, leading to "tonic" inhibition. The GABAA-R alpha 4 subunit is expressed at high levels in the dentate gyrus and thalamus and when partnered with the delta subunit, it is suspected to contribute to tonic inhibition. In vitro studies have found that GABAA-Rs containing alpha 4 and delta are highly sensitive to ethanol and to competitive GABAA-R agonists such as <b>gaboxadol</b> and muscimol. In light of these findings, the central hypothesis tested in this thesis was that extrasynaptic GABAA-Rs mediate the depressant effects of these drugs. To provide a model for understanding the precise role of alpha 4 containing GABAA-Rs in drug action, mice were engineered to lack the alpha 4 subunit by targeted disruption of the Gabra 4 gene. alpha 4 Subunit knockout mice were viable and superficially indistinguishable from wild-type mice. In electrophysiological recordings, alpha 4 knockout mice showed a lack of tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells and thalamic relay neurons. alpha 4 knockout mice were also less sensitive to the behavioral effects of <b>gaboxadol</b> and muscimol. However, alpha 4 knockout mice did not differ in ethanol-induced changes in anxiety, locomotion, ataxia, coordination, analgesia, or thermoregulation. These data demonstrate that tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells and thalamic relay neurons is mediated by extrasynaptic GABAA-Rs containing the alpha 4 subunit and that <b>gaboxadol</b> and muscimol likely achieve their effects via the activation of this GABAA-R subtype. These data also suggest that GABAA-Rs containing the alpha 4 subunit are not necessary for many acute behavioral responses to ethanol...|$|E

40|$|SummaryEarly {{studies from}} {{psychology}} suggest that sleep facilitates memory retention by stopping ongoing retroactive interference caused by mental activity or external sensory stimuli. Neuroscience research with animal models, {{on the other}} hand, suggests that sleep facilitates retention by enhancing memory consolidation. Recently, in Drosophila, the ongoing activity of specific dopamine neurons was shown to regulate the forgetting of olfactory memories. Here, we show this ongoing dopaminergic activity is modulated with behavioral state, increasing robustly with locomotor activity and decreasing with rest. Increasing sleep-drive, with either the sleep-promoting agent <b>Gaboxadol</b> or by genetic stimulation of the neural circuit for sleep, decreases ongoing dopaminergic activity, while enhancing memory retention. Conversely, increasing arousal stimulates ongoing dopaminergic activity and accelerates dopaminergic-based forgetting. Therefore, forgetting is regulated by the behavioral state modulation of dopaminergic-based plasticity. Our findings integrate psychological and neuroscience research on sleep and forgetting...|$|E

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) {{is caused by}} the absence of a functional transcript of the protein dystrophin. DMD is associated with a range of cognitive deficits that are thought to result from a lack of the protein dystrophin in brain structures involved in cognitive functions. The CNS involvement extends to an impairment of cognitive abilities, with many DMD boys having significant reduction in IQ. In the cerebellum, dystrophin is normally localized at the postsynaptic membrane of GABAergic synapses on Purkinje cells. Here, we investigate the effect of an absence of dystrophin on the number of GABA(A) channels located at the synapse in cerebellar Purkinje cells of the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were performed in cerebellar slices from mdx and littermate control mice. Our results showed that the number of receptors at GABAergic synapses in the cerebellar Purkinje cell was significantly reduced in mdx mice (38. 38 ± 2. 95) compared to littermate controls (53. 03 ± 4. 11). Furthermore, when <b>gaboxadol</b> was added to the bath, the change in holding current in mdx mice was significantly enhanced (65. 01 ± 5. 89 pA) compared to littermate controls (37. 36 ± 3. 82 pA). The single channel unitary conductance and the rise and decay time of mIPSCs were not significantly different in these two groups of mice, indicating that those GABA(A) channels located at the postsynaptic sites in the mdx mice function normally. Conclusion: There is a {{reduction in the number of}} functional receptors localized at GABAergic synapses in the cerebellar Purkinje cells of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice and an increase in a <b>gaboxadol</b> induced holding current, which is evidence for an increase in extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in mdx mice. We hypothesize that the absence of dystrophin, from mdx Purkinje cells, reduces the number of post-synaptic GABA(A) receptors and as a result there is an increase in peri-synaptic receptors. If similar changes occur in the CNS in boys with DMD, it will impact on the function of neural networks and may contribute to some of the motor, behavioral and cognitive impairment apparent in many boys with DMD...|$|E
40|$|The “ambient” GABA that {{is present}} in the {{extracellular}} space surrounding all neurons of the brain is believed to be capable of persistently activating high‐affinity extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors to generate a tonic membrane conductance. This generates a form of shunting inhibition that is capable of influencing cellular and network excitability. Extrasynaptic δ subunit-containing GABA-A receptors are known to generate this form of tonic inhibition in a number of defined brain regions and these are emerging as important clinical drug targets for the treatment of a number of neurological conditions. This thesis examines the functional and pharmacological properties of recombinant and native GABA-A receptors that allow them to function as ambient GABA detectors. Surprisingly, the data presented in this Thesis shows that the behaviour of these extrasynaptic GABA-A receptor populations is dramatically influenced by the steady-state GABA concentration they experience. For example, recombinant α 4 βδ and α 6 βδ receptor populations are shown to exhibit profound levels of desensitization in the presence of low ambient GABA levels that will limit their ability to respond to changes in ambient GABA. We also find that the action of certain sedative/hypnotic drugs on extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors expressed in cerebellar granule neurons is critically dependent upon the concentration of ambient GABA. For example, we show that the intravenous anaesthetic propofol will only enhance tonic inhibition when ambient GABA levels are below 100 nM. Similarly, we show that the GABA-A receptor agonist <b>Gaboxadol</b> is not capable of enhancing tonic inhibition when ambient GABA levels are high. In contrast to the behaviour of drugs like propofol and <b>Gaboxadol,</b> we find that neurosteroid enhancement of tonic inhibition will occur regardless of ambient GABA levels. This issue will be important when considering therapeutic strategies to target tonic inhibition in the treatment of neurological disorders. Furthermore, we show for the first time, that copper ions can potently block extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors, suggesting that copper may provide a means to selectively block tonic inhibition in the brain, and may even represent a novel source of extrasynaptic GABA-A receptor modulation in vivo.

Thus, the present study examines the possible interaction of central canabinoidergic and GABAergic systems on food intake in 3 -h food-deprived (FD 3) neonatal layer-type chicks. The results of this study showed that intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 2 -AG (2 -Arachidonoylglycerol, selective CB 1 receptors agonist, 2 µg) significantly increased food intake and this effect of 2 -AG was attenuated by Picrotoxin (GABAA antagonist, 0. 5 µg) (P 0. 05).

40|$|Idiopathic epilepsies have {{frequently}} {{been linked to}} mutations in voltage-gated channels (channelopathies); recently, mutations in several genes encoding presynaptic proteins {{have been shown to}} cause epilepsy in humans and mice, indicating that epilepsy can also be considered a synaptopathy. However, the functional mechanisms by which presynaptic dysfunctions lead to hyperexcitability and seizures are not well understood. We show that deletion of synapsin II (Syn II), a presynaptic protein contributing to epilepsy predisposition in humans, leads to a loss of tonic inhibition in mouse hippocampal slices due to a dramatic decrease in presynaptic asynchronous GABA release. We also show that the asynchronous GABA release reduces postsynaptic cell firing, and the parallel impairment of asynchronous GABA release and tonic inhibition results in an increased excitability at both single-neuron and network levels. Restoring tonic inhibition with THIP (4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo[5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -ol; <b>gaboxadol),</b> a selective agonist of δ subunit-containing GABAA receptors, fully rescues the SynII(-/-) epileptic phenotype both ex vivo and in vivo.

40|$|Since the cloning of {{the many}} {{subunits}} of the GABAA receptor a plethora of studies were undertaken {{in order to understand}} how chronic ethanol exposure as well as ethanol withdrawal could interfere with their gene expression.

40|$|GABAA receptors (GABARs) are {{the targets}} {{of a wide variety}} of modulatory drugs which enhance {{chloride}} flux through GABAR ion channels. Certain GABAR modulators appear to acutely enhance the function of d subunit-containing GABAR subtypes responsible for tonic forms of inhibition. Here we identify a reinforcing circuit mechanism by which these drugs, in addition to directly enhancing GABAR function, also increase GABA release. Electrophysiological recordings in cerebellar slices from rats homozygous for the ethanol-hypersensitive (a 6100 Q) allele show that modulators and agonists selective for d-containing GABARs such as THDOC, ethanol and THIP (<b>gaboxadol)</b> increased the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in granule cells. Ethanol fails to augment granule cell sIPSC frequency in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists, indicating that circuit mechanisms involving granule cell output contribute to ethanol-enhancement of synaptic inhibition. Additionally, GABAR antagonists decrease ethanol-induced enhancement of Golgi cell firing. Consistent with a role for glutamatergic inputs, THIP-induced increases in Golgi cell firing are abolished by glutamate receptor antagonists. Moreover, THIP enhances the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in Golgi cells. Analyses of knockout mice indicate that d subunit-containing GABARs are required for enhancing GABA release in the presence of ethanol and THIP. The limited expression of the GABAR d subunit protein within the cerebellar cortex suggests that an indirect, circuit mechanism is responsible for stimulating Golgi cell GABA release by drugs selective for extrasynapti...|$|E

THIP was suggested to be a potential hypnotic to treat insomnia, {{and it is}} currently in clinical trial. Here we assessed whether the GABA(A) delta-containing receptors mediate in vivo the effect of THIP on sleep and the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). We performed EEG recordings in a mouse model deficient in the GABA(A) delta-subunit gene (delta(-/-) mice) and in wild-type littermate controls. THIP (4 and 6 mg/kg intraperitoneally) induced an abnormal EEG pattern, resulting in {{dramatic changes in the}} waking and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep EEG spectra in wild-type mice. Indeed, a massive increase in EEG power lasting 2 - 3 h occurred in both the frontal and parietal derivation, especially in frequencies below 6 Hz. All effects were more prominent in the frontal EEG. Furthermore, the highest dose of THIP lengthened REM sleep latency and suppressed REM sleep. In contrast, vigilance states and sleep latencies were not affected in delta(-/-) mice. Moreover, only minor changes were observed in the NREM sleep EEG spectrum after THIP injection in the delta-subunit-deficient mice. The present findings do not indicate a sleep-promoting effect of THIP in mice, which is in accordance with a previous report in this species. Moreover, our results in vivo demonstrate that THIP acts preferentially at GABA(A) receptors containing the delta-subunit...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA), an {{autosomal}} recessive genetic disorder, {{is characterized by}} the selective degeneration of lower motor neurons, leading to muscle atrophy and, in the most severe cases, paralysis and death. Deletions and point mutations cause reduced levels of the widely expressed survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which has been implicated in a range of cellular processes. The mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis are unclear, and there is no effective treatment. Several animal models have been developed to study SMN function including the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, in which a large deletion in the gene homologous to SMN, smn- 1, results in neuromuscular dysfunction and larval lethality. Although useful, this null mutant, smn- 1 (ok 355), is not well suited to drug screening. We report the isolation and characterization of smn- 1 (cb 131), a novel allele encoding a substitution in a highly conserved residue of exon 2, resembling a point mutation found in a patient with type IIIb SMA. The smn- 1 (cb 131) animals display milder yet similar defects when compared with the smn- 1 null mutant. Using an automated phenotyping system, mutants were shown to swim slower than wild-type animals. This phenotype was used to screen a library of 1040 chemical compounds for drugs that ameliorate the defect, highlighting six for subsequent testing. 4 -aminopyridine, <b>gaboxadol</b> hydrochloride and N-acetylneuraminic acid all rescued at least one aspect of smn- 1 phenotypic dysfunction. These findings may assist in accelerating the development of drugs for the treatment of SMA. ...|$|E
40|$|Among {{hypnotic}} {{agents that}} enhance GABA A receptor function, etomidate is unusual {{because it is}} selective for � 2 / � 3 compared with � 1 subunit-containing GABA A receptors. Mice incorporating an etomidate-insensitive � 2 subunit (� 2 N 265 S) revealed that � 2 subunitcontaining receptors mediate the enhancement of slow-wave activity (SWA) by etomidate, are required for the sedative, {{and contribute to the}} hypnotic actions of this anesthetic. Although the anatomical location of the � 2 -containing receptors that mediate these actions is unknown, the thalamus is implicated. WehavecharacterizedGABA Areceptor-mediatedneurotransmissioninthalamicnucleusreticularis(nRT) andventrobasaliscomplex (VB) neurons of wild-type, � 2, and � 2 N 265 S mice. VB but not nRT neurons exhibit a large GABA-mediated tonic conductance that contributes � 80 % of the total GABA A receptor-mediated transmission. Consequently, although etomidate enhances inhibition in both neuronal types, the effect of this anesthetic on the tonic conductance of VB neurons is dominant. The GABA-enhancing actions of etomidate in VB but not nRT neurons are greatly suppressed by the � 2 N 265 S mutation. The hypnotic THIP (<b>Gaboxadol)</b> induces SWA and at low, clinically relevant concentrations (30 nM to 3 �M) increases the tonic conductance of VB neurons, with no effect on VB or nRT miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) or on the holding current of nRT neurons. Zolpidem, which has no effect on SWA, prolongs VB mIPSCs but is ineffective on the phasic and tonic conductance of nRT and VB neurons, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that enhancement of extrasynaptic inhibition in the thalamus may contribute to the distinct sleep EEG profiles of etomidate and THIP compared wit...|$|E
40|$|Extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, often {{identified}} as those containing both α 4 and δ subunits, demonstrate super-sensitivity to GABA and {{are involved in}} tonic inhibitory processes regulating activity within mesolimbocortical circuitry. Rodent studies testing {{the effects of the}} δ-subunit selective agonist <b>Gaboxadol</b> (THIP) on alcohol consumption have produced mixed results. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the role of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors located in the infralimbic cortex (ILC) in the alcohol consumption of male C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) mice. The ILC is of interest due to its demonstrated involvement in stress reactivity. Furthermore, alcohol exposure has been shown to interfere with extinction learning; impairments of which may be related to inflexible behavior (i. e., problematic alcohol consumption). Adult male B 6 mice were bilaterally implanted with guide cannulas aimed at the ILC and were subsequently offered daily limited access to 20 % ethanol or 5 % sucrose for 7 days. Immediately prior to ethanol or sucrose access on day 7, mice were bilaterally injected with 50 or 100 ng THIP (25 or 50 ng per side respectively) or saline vehicle into the ILC. The highest dose of intra-ILC THIP (100 ng/mouse) increased alcohol intake relative to vehicle controls, although control animals consumed relatively little ethanol following infusion. Intra-ILC THIP had no effect on sucrose consumption (p> 0. 05), suggesting that the effect of THIP was selective for ethanol consumption. Together, these findings suggest that THIP may have effectively prevented the decrease in ethanol intake on day 7 induced by the microinjection process, perhaps supporting a suggested role for the ILC in adaptive learning processes and behavioral flexibility...|$|E
40|$|Fragile X {{spectrum}} disorder (FXSD) includes: fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) {{and fragile}} X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), {{as well as}} other medical, psychiatric and neurobehavioral problems associated with the premutation and gray zone alleles. FXS is the most common monogenetic cause of autism (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). The understanding of the neurobiology of FXS has led to many targeted treatment trials in FXS. The first wave of phase II clinical trials in FXS were designed to target the mGluR 5 pathway; however the results did not show significant efficacy and the trials were terminated. The advances in the understanding of the GABA system in FXS have shifted the focus of treatment trials to GABA agonists, and a new wave of promising clinical trials is under way. Ganaxolone and allopregnanolone (GABA agonists) have been studied in individuals with FXSD and are currently in phase II trials. Both allopregnanolone and ganaxolone may be efficacious in treatment of FXS and FXTAS, respectively. Allopregnanolone, ganaxolone, riluzole, <b>gaboxadol,</b> tiagabine, and vigabatrin are potential GABAergic treatments. The lessons learned from the initial trials have not only shifted the targeted system, but also have refined the design of clinical trials. The results of these new trials will likely impact further clinical trials for FXS and other genetic disorders associated with ASD. 90 DD 0596 /DD/NCBDD CDC HHS/United StatesGM 082773 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesHD 036071 /HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 HD 036071 /HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 MH 094681 /MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 MH 094681 /MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States 2016 - 04 - 13 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26365141 PMC 483034...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBehavioral {{sensitization}} to psychostimulants {{is associated}} with changes in dopamine (DA), glutamate, and GABA within the mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal DA systems. Because GABA(A) receptors are highly expressed within these systems, we examined the role of these receptors containing a delta subunit in cocaine behavioral sensitization. Experiment 1 {{examined the effects of}} <b>Gaboxadol</b> (GBX, also known as THIP [4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydro-isoxazolo[5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -ol]), a selective delta-GABA(A) receptor agonist, on the locomotor responses to acute cocaine. GBX at 1. 25 mg/kg produced locomotor depression in female rats alone. We then examined the effects of GBX on the expression of cocaine-induced locomotion and stereotypy in female and male rats treated with 5 days of cocaine (15 mg/kg) followed by cocaine challenge 7 days later. We administered systemic (Experiment 2) or intranucleus accumbens (intra-NAC; Experiment 3) injections of GBX (0, 1. 25, 2. 5, 5, or 10 mg/kg subcutaneously, or 1 mu mol/L or 1 mM intra-NAC, respectively) prior to cocaine challenge (10 mg/kg). In our experiments females were robustly sensitized to cocaine at low dose whereas males did not show such sensitization-limiting comparisons between the 2 sexes. Sensitized females showed a biphasic response to low (1. 25 mg/kg and 1 mu mol/L) and high (10 mg/kg and 1 mM) dose GBX whereas nonsensitized males showed this pattern only following intra-NAC injection. Immunohistochemical analysis of the NAC revealed that females have more delta-containing GABA(A) receptors than do males and that following chronic cocaine injections this difference persisted (Experiment 4). Together, our results support the notion of the key role of extrasynaptic GABA(A) delta-subunit containing receptors in cocaine sensitization...|$|E
40|$|Muscimol {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a universal agonist for all γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA-R) subtypes. However, brain regional distribution of muscimol's high-affinity binding sites greatly differs from those of other binding sites of the GABAA-R. To test whether behavioral effects of muscimol correlated with the density of high-affinity [3 H]muscimol binding, we examined several GABAA-R subunit gene-modified mouse lines: α 1, α 4, or δ-knockouts (KO), α 4 +δ-double KO, and Thy 1. 2 promoter-driven α 6 transgenic mice (Thy 1 α 6). We determined the high-affinity [3 H]muscimol binding in brain sections by quantitative autoradiography and sedative/ataxic effects induced in vivo by muscimol using a constant speed rotarod. α 4 -KO mice had reduced [3 H]muscimol binding in the caudate-putamen, thalamus, and hippocampus, and were less sensitive to the behavioral impairment by muscimol. Similarly, δ-KO mice also had reduced binding to forebrain regions and a lower behavioral sensitivity to muscimol than their wild-type controls. In contrast, α 1 -KO mice had unaltered behavioral sensitivity to muscimol and unaltered [3 H]muscimol binding, even though previous studies have demonstrated dramatically reduced binding to various other GABAA-R sites in these mice. Finally, Thy 1 α 6 mice exhibited increased behavioral sensitivity to muscimol, and to another direct GABA-site agonist <b>gaboxadol,</b> and increased [3 H]muscimol binding in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Thus, the differences in sedative and motor-impairing actions of muscimol in various mouse models correlated {{with the level of}} forebrain high-affinity [3 H]muscimol binding. These data suggest that a small special population of GABAA-Rs, most likely extrasynaptic non-α 1 -containing receptors, strongly contributes to the in vivo pharmacological effects of muscimol...|$|E
40|$|The {{extracellular}} {{concentration of}} the two main neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is low but not negligible which enables a number of tonic actions. The effects of ambient GABA vary in a region-, cell-type and age-dependent manner and can serve as indicators of disease-related alterations. Here we explored the tonic inhibitory actions of GABA in Huntington&# 39;s disease (HD). HD is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene. Whole cell patch clamp recordings from striatal output neurons (SONs) in slices from adult wild type mice and two mouse models of HD (Z_Q 175 _KI homozygotes or R 6 / 2 heterozygotes) revealed an HD-related reduction of the GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic chloride current (ITonic(GABA)) along with signs of reduced GABA(B) receptor-mediated presynaptic depression of synaptic GABA release. About half of ITonic(GABA) depended on tetrodotoxin-sensitive synaptic GABA release, but the remaining current was still lower in HD. Both in WT and HD, ITonic(GABA) was more prominent during the first four hours after preparing the slices, when astrocytes but not neurons exhibited a transient depolarization. All further tests were performed within 1 to 4 h in vitro. Experiments with SNAP 5114, a blocker of the astrocytic GABA transporter GAT- 3, suggest that in WT but not HD GAT- 3 operated in the releasing mode. Application of a transportable substrate for glutamate transporters (D-aspartate 0. 1 - 1 mM) restored the non-synaptic GABA release in slices from HD mice. ITonic(GABA) was also rescued by applying the hyperagonist <b>gaboxadol</b> (0. 33 &# 181;M). The results lead to the hypothesis that lesion-induced astrocyte depolarization facilitates nonsynaptic release of GABA through GAT- 3. However, the capacity of depolarized astrocytes to provide GABA for tonic inhibition is strongly reduced in HD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors {{provide the}} main {{inhibitory}} {{control in the}} brain. Their heterogeneity may {{make it possible to}} precisely target drug effects to selected neuronal populations. In situ hybridization using rat brain sections has revealed a unique expression of GABA A receptor ε and θ subunit transcripts in the locus coeruleus, where they are accompanied at least by α 3, α 2, β 1 and β 3 subunits. Here, we studied the pharmacology of the human α 3 β 1, α 3 β 1 ε, α 3 β 1 θ and α 3 β 1 εθ receptor subtypes expressed in Xenopus oocytes and compared them with the γ 2 subunit-containing receptors. Results The GABA sensitivites and effects of several positive modulators of GABA A receptors were studied in the absence and the presence of EC 25 GABA using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method. We found 100 -fold differences in GABA sensitivity between the receptors, α 3 β 1 ε subtype being the most sensitive and α 3 β 1 γ 2 the least sensitive. Also <b>gaboxadol</b> dose-response curves followed the same sensitivity rank order, with EC 50 values being 72 and 411 μM for α 3 β 1 ε and α 3 β 1 γ 2 subtypes, respectively. In the presence of EC 25 GABA, introduction of the ε subunit to the receptor complex resulted in diminished modulatory effects by etomidate, propofol, pregnanolone and flurazepam, but not by pentobarbital. Furthermore, the α 3 β 1 ε subtype displayed picrotoxin-sensitive spontaneous activity. The θ subunit-containing receptors were efficiently potentiated by the anesthetic etomidate, suggesting that θ subunit could bring the properties of β 2 or β 3 subunits to the receptor complex. Conclusion The ε and θ subunits bring additional features to α 3 β 1 GABA A receptors. These receptor subtypes may constitute as novel drug targets in selected brain regions, e. g., in the brainstem locus coeruleus nuclei. </p...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, often {{identified}} as those containing both α 4 and δ subunits, {{appear to be}} a target for the actions of alcohol (ethanol) at relatively low concentrations, perhaps suppressing the activity of GABAergic interneurons which regulate activity in the mesolimbocortical circuit. Pharmacological studies in rodents using the δ-subunit selective agonist <b>Gaboxadol</b> (THIP) have found both promotional and inhibitory effects on alcohol consumption. The goal of this project was to determine the role of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors located in the infralimbic cortex (ILC) in the binge-like alcohol intake of male C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) mice. The ILC is of interest due to its demonstrated involvement in stress reactivity and alcohol exposure has been shown to interfere with extinction learning; impairments of which may be related to inflexible behavior (i. e. problematic alcohol consumption). Adult male B 6 mice were bilaterally implanted with stainless steel guide cannulae aimed at the ILC and were offered limited access to 20 % ethanol or 5 % sucrose for 6 days. On day 7, mice were bilaterally injected with 50 or 100 ng THIP (25 or 50 ng per side respectively) or saline vehicle into the ILC. It was found that the highest dose of THIP (100 ng/mouse) increased alcohol intake relative to vehicle controls, although control animals consumed relatively little ethanol following infusion. Furthermore, THIP had no effect on sucrose consumption (p > 0. 05), suggesting that the effect of THIP was selective for ethanol consumption. Together, these findings suggest that the mice that consumed ethanol may have been particularly reactive to the microinfusion process relative to animals that consumed sucrose, perhaps because ethanol consumption was not as reinforcing as sucrose consumption. In addition, the observation that THIP effectively prevented the decrease in ethanol intake on day 7 induced by the microinjection process may be related to a role for the ILC in adaptive learning processes, which in turn, promote behavioral flexibility...|$|E
40|$|Striatonigral and striatopallidal {{projecting}} medium spiny neurons (MSNs) express dopamine D 1 (D 1 +) and D 2 receptors (D 2 +), respectively. Both classes receive extensive GABAergic input via {{expression of}} synaptic, perisynaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. The activation patterns of different presynaptic GABAergic neurons produce transient and sustained GABAA receptor-mediated conductance that fulfill distinct physiological roles. We performed single and dual whole cell recordings from striatal neurons in mice expressing fluorescent proteins in interneurons and MSNs. We report specific inhibitory dynamics produced by distinct activation patterns of presynaptic GABAergic neurons as source of synaptic, perisynaptic and extrasynaptic inhibition. Synaptic GABAA receptors in MSNs contain the α 2, γ 2 and a β subunit. In addition, {{there is evidence}} for the developmental increase of the α 1 subunit that contributes to faster inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC). Tonic GABAergic currents in MSNs from adult mice are carried by extrasynaptic receptors containing the α 4 and δ subunit, while in younger mice this current is mediated by receptors that contain the α 5 subunit. Both forms of tonic currents are differentially expressed in D 1 + and D 2 + MSNs. This study extends these findings by relating presynaptic activation with pharmacological analysis of inhibitory conductance in mice where the β 3 subunit is conditionally removed in fluorescently labeled D 2 + MSNs and in mice with global deletion of the δ subunit. Our results show that responses to low doses of <b>gaboxadol</b> (2 μM), a GABAA receptor agonist with preference to δ subunit, are abolished in the δ but not the β 3 subunit knock out mice. This suggests that the β 3 subunit is not {{a component of the}} adult extrasynaptic receptor pool, in contrast to what has been shown for tonic current in young mice. Deletion of the β 3 subunit from D 2 + MSNs however, removed slow spontaneous IPSCs, implicating its role in mediating synaptic inpu...|$|E
