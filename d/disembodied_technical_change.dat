We find that capital accumulation is the main determinant of GDP growth in Australia, Japan and the U.

First, an overview of the relationship between technology and employment is provided, focusing on three key questions: (i) the role of structural change across sectors of the economy; (ii) the contrasting roles of product and process innovations; (iii) the complementary roles played by embodied and <b>disembodied</b> aspects of <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> Second, the broad relationships between changes in value added, employment, investment and technology indicators at the sectoral level are investigated, showing the peculiarity of Italy within the group of the more advanced countries. Employment growth in Italian industry turns out to be inversely related to increases in productivity. Third, firm-level data drawn from the CNR-ISTAT innovation survey are used, showing that innovations have had clear labour-displacing effects and have been accompanied by {{a significant increase in the}} utilisation of fixed capital. The overall negative impact of technology on employment in Italian manufacturing is found to be caused by the dominant role of process innovations and embodied <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> in firms' innovative activities.

40|$|This paper derives {{the optimal}} pace of capital {{accumulation}} {{at the firm}} level and the corresponding investment dynamics {{in the presence of}} an energy-saving technological progress. Energy and capital are complementary. When technical progress is disembodied, the firm invests once at the first period and never invests again. The optimal capital stock is a decreasing function of the energy price. When technical progress is embodied, the optimal scrapping time of capital goods is constant and investment is periodic. The optimal effective capital stock is shown to be lower than the optimal capital stock under <b>disembodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> A striking outcome of the paper is that under embodiment, the optimal effective capital stock is an increasing function of the energy cost, in contrast to the disembodiment case...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates whether capital-skill {{complementarity}} is {{the explanation}} for skill-biased technical change. For {{this to be the}} case, capital-skill complementarity must exist in the first place and, secondly, all technical change must be embodied in nature, i. e. embedded in new capital equipment. To test if these conditions are satisfied, a capital-age adjusted translog production function incorporating both embodied and <b>disembodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> is implemented on a 14 -industry panel for Swedish manufacturing 1985 - 95. The findings cast doubt on the claim that capital-skill complementarity can explain skill-biased technical change. In several industries, the capital-skill complementarity hypothesis is not supported. Moreover, it is found that the demand for skilled labor is affected by both disembodied and embodied technical change.

40|$|Abstract only. This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on economic efficiency, <b>technical</b> <b>change,</b> bioeconomic modeling, and renewable resource economics in general by introducing output-oriented Debreu-Farrell technical inefficiency and technical progress into normative static and dynamic bioeconomic models of a fishery and examines the economic and policy ramifications for the open-access Nash and sole-owner Pareto optimums. We consider output augmenting, exogenous and <b>disembodied</b> <b>technical</b> progress that directly affects the production technology, such as the adoption of electronics and subsequent learning by doing that facilitate the finding of fish. We examine a modified Golden Rule or fundamental equation of renewable resource economics. Introduction of technical inefficiency and technical progress into the static model allows for any number of steady-state equilibrium levels of fishing effort, resource stock, and yield for both the open access and sole owner optimums, each equilibrium conditional upon the state of technology and technical inefficiency. Introducing <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> and <b>technical</b> inefficiency into a dynamic model creates a modified Golden Rule {{in which there is no}} longer a steady-state equilibrium. Instead, the optimal level of the stock declines over time, because the unit profit increases due to technical progress. In contrast, in the absence of technical progress the standard Golden Rule shows that cost savings from a larger resource stock favor a larger stock that then remains stationary.

40|$|The paper criticises {{the concept}} of total factor {{productivity}} {{as a measure of}} technical change and economic performance on two grounds: (i) theoretical, because it shares all the weaknesses of the neoclassical production function from which it is derived; (ii) its relevance in helping to understand the present technological revolution in computer and information technologies, since it concerns only <b>disembodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> The practical conclusion is that total factor productivity is more a measure of "noise" than a genuine indicator of technical progress. In spite of the above drawbacks, total factor productivity is still widely used in empirical work on technical change. This is all the more surprising since the alternative concept ofproductivity of labour not only avoids the above mentioned criticisms but is theoretically superior to its rival concept because it captures the true nature of present technical change...|$|E
40|$|Very Preliminary. Do not quote Several {{authors have}} {{documented}} the low short-run elasticity of energy use to energy price changes.

This paper attempts to fill this gap by merging the estimates of quality change obtained from the price literature on quality change with a version of the conventional sources of growth model which allows for both embodied and <b>disembodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> This resulting estimates suggest that as much as 20 percent of the total factor productivity in growth U.

40|$|Fisheries {{throughout}} the world have long been subject to overfishing and excess capacity, which has generated substantial and increasing concern about biological and economic performance ramifications. These problems in part stem from substantial investment in technical improvements to boats and equipment in fishing fleets. Such technical change exacerbates the extent of excess fishing capacity, as well as low returns to fishing effort and investment due to catch limitations from both regulatory constraints and overfished stocks. However, economists have not yet attempted to quantify the extent or effects of technical change in fisheries. In this paper we use detailed data on innovation patterns for 19 vessels in the Sete trawl fleet of Southern France to evaluate the contributions of embodied and <b>disembodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> to catch rates. We find that embodied technical change enhanced productivity by approximately 1 percent per year between 1985 - 99, but that external (disembodied) events counteracted this by causing a net output decline of about 3 percent a year.

The deceleration has been attributed to many factors, including a {{slowdown in}} the growth of capital intensity and the stock of R&D, changes in the sectoral composition of output, dramatic rises in oil prices, and declines in the capital utilization rate due to sluggish demand. In this article authors provide a framework for decomposing changes in total factor productivity (TFP) in the presence of economies of scale. The traditional growth accounting framework is a special case of our model. By allowing for economies of scale, authors demonstrate formally the positive relationship between growth in productivity and output which is found in the empirical studies by the economists John Kendrick, Nicholas Kaldor, and others.
