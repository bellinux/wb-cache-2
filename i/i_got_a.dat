As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E

25|$|I {{preferred}} {{to open the}} batting or bat in the top order somewhere. But I probably wasn't good enough to bat at No. 3 or No. 4, which is why I was where I was – down at the bottom.

25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while.

25|$|Crews {{was born}} in {{suburban}} Philadelphia in 1933. Both of his parents were avid readers and were tremendously influential in his life, said Crews; “They had both been raised in considerable poverty, and books had been extremely important to them personally, in shaping them. My mother was very literary; my father was very scientific. I feel that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> little something of both sides.” In high school, Crews was co-captain of the tennis team, and for decades he remained an avid skier, hiker, swimmer, and runner. Crews lives in Berkeley with his wife of 57 years, Elizabeth Crews, a photographer who {{was born and raised}} in Berkeley, California. They have two daughters and four grandchildren.|$|E

500|$|Although most Girls' Generation's {{releases}} {{are written}} by songwriters for S.M. Entertainment, some members occasionally participated in songwriting.

500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if I can help it. I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. But every time I went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune".

500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside was that I was published and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> readership, ... downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was still like, 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E
500|$|And so {{the issue}} was brought up at the {{acceptance}} of the spacecraft, a long drawn-out discussion.

[...] We're not going to let them smoke." [...] Well, I then issued orders at that meeting, [...] "Go clean up the spacecraft. [...] Be sure that all the fire rules are obeyed." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Mr.Mr {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Heather Phares from AllMusic labelled the EP [...] "a set of songs that offers something for {{every kind of}} Girls' Generation and expands their musical reach." [...] Phares further praised the EP for helping the group to be an outstanding case of Korean popular music. Writing for Billboard, Jeff Benjamin named the six songs of the EP [...] "strong" [...] and called it a more [...] "impressive effort" [...] compared to the group's 2013 album <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>a</b> Boy. He also deemed the track list [...] "a tight bundle of songs that still see the group dipping and experimenting into new sonic territory, but possibly more focused than ever." [...] Benjamin also wrote an article for Fuse, on which he complimented the album's musical styles as [...] "short, sweet, but strong." [...] On the other hand, Kim Do-heon from online magazine IZM compared the EP to the group's 2011 album The Boys for its [...] "balance of musical competence and appeal to mass popularity", but found the songs to be inadequate. He concluded that the group needed to [...] " [...] a clear direction for the future" [...] after the [...] "mistake" [...] of <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>a</b> Boy, and Mr.Mr was not the answer.|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
