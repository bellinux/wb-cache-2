25|$|Alexander Kazembek's father, Hadji Kasim Kazem-Bey, was a {{prominent}} Azeri Muslim cleric and {{a native of the}} city of Derbent (then part of the Quba Khanate, Qajar Persia, later part of Russia), whose father (Alexander Kazembek's paternal grandfather) Nazir Muhammad khan was paymaster general of the Derbent Khanate. On his way back from a religious pilgrimage to Mecca, Muhammad Qasim Kazim-bey visited Rasht (present-day Gilan province, Iran) and met a woman named Sharafnisa, daughter of the local governor Bagher-khan. The two married and settled in Rasht, where Kazembek was born. In 1811, his father was appointed qadhi in Derbent, and the family moved there. Kazembek completed his studies in Islam and, already fluent in Azeri and Persian, also excelled in Russian, Turkish and Arabic. At the age of 17, he wrote his first book named Topics in Grammar of the Arabic Language (originally in Arabic). His father wanted him to become a Muslim scholar and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him away to Persia and Arabia to master Islamic studies. However, in 1820, Muhammad Qasim Kazim-bey was charged with espionage on behalf of Persia, deprived of his religious title and exiled to Astrakhan along with his wife.|$|E

This came about after Kristian Hellström of the Swedish Olympic Committee wrote to the {{government}}s of Japan and China to ask if they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> teams to the 1912 Olympics. The Japanese government did not want to embarrass itself on an international stage by saying no, so the Ministry of Education was told to look into this. The Ministry logically turned to Kanō, who was a physical educator with recent experience in Europe. Kanō agreed to represent Japan at the International Olympics Committee, and, after talking to the French ambassador to Japan and reading pamphlets sent by the Swedes, developed, in his words, [...] "a fairly good idea of what the Olympic Games were." ...|$|E

[...] "Alright George," [...] MacArthur replied, [...] "but if he doesn't come back, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> his name in to Washington recommending him for a Congressional Medal of Honor."

In his autobiography White Rat his first big league manager, future Baseball Hall of Famer [...] Whitey Herzog stated that he was often forced to leave Clyde in the game much longer than usual because fans {{wanted to see the}} 18-year-old [...] "phenom" [...] pitch. It led to Clyde's arm burning out at an early age, Herzog argued. In a 2003 interview with The New York Times, Herzog criticized Bob Short, stating that [...] "(Short) sure wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> him down without getting some people in the ballpark to see him.

500|$|A third {{variation}} {{was written}} {{during the night}} of 21 February 1818. Schubert and Anselm Hüttenbrenner, a friend and fellow composer, had finished a few bottles of Hungarian wine when Anselm commented that his brother Josef was an aficionado of Schubert's work. Schubert completed a copy of [...] "" [...] that was [...] "somewhat messy". The messiness was partly accounted for by Schubert's drunken state, but also explained by the accompanying note he wrote to Josef: [...] "Just as, in my haste, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> the thing, I rather sleepily took up the ink-well and poured it calmly over it. What a disaster!" [...] The manuscript was held by the Hüttenbrenner family {{for a number of}} years and was photographed in 1870, before being lost. Schubert wrote a further version in 1820 for publication in the Wiener Zeitung, and a final copy in October 1821 for publication in the Neue Ausgabe. The final version has [...] "a five-bar piano prelude" [...] and is presently in the Gertrude Clarke Whittall Foundation Collection of the Library of Congress.|$|E
500|$|The {{tribunal}} (led by Sir John Eldon Bankes, {{a former}} Lord Justice of Appeal) began sitting on 15 May 1928; Hastings, Henry Curtis-Bennett and Walter Frampton represented Savidge, and Norman Birkett represented the police. When called as a witness, Savidge testified {{that she had}} not wanted to go to Scotland Yard and had been persuaded to do so by the presence of a female police officer, Miss Wyles. After they arrived at Scotland Yard, Collins told Wyles that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> Savidge home, and Wyles could leave. After Wyles had left, Collins began interviewing Savidge, threatening that she and Money would [...] "suffer severely" [...] if she did not tell the truth. Savidge said that Collins' manner had become more and more familiar during the interview, and that at several points he and Sergeant Clarke had implied that they wanted her to have sexual intercourse with them. Savidge spent almost six hours in the witness box, and her testimony left Collins looking guilty {{in the eyes of the}} tribunal. Collins, Clarke and Wyles were all interviewed, along with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Archibald Bodkin himself.|$|E
