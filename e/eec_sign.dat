He {{was the first}} Greek Foreign Minister to visit the Soviet Union, in October 1978, and negotiated Greece's accession to the <b>EEC,</b> <b>signing</b> Greece's accession agreement in May 1979. He also worked to restore relations with Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.|$|R
50|$|He became Prime Minister in 1955, {{succeeding}} Mario Scelba. During Segni’s {{government the}} treaties instituting the European Economic Community (<b>EEC)</b> were <b>signed</b> on 25 March 1957, and Italy co-founded the community.|$|R
50|$|At a {{supranational}} level, {{countries have}} adopted a range of treaty and convention obligations to relate the right of individual litigants to invoke the jurisdiction of national courts and to enforce the judgments obtained. For example, the member nations of the <b>EEC</b> <b>signed</b> the Brussels Convention in 1968 and, subject to amendments as new nations joined, it represents the default law for all twenty-seven Member States {{of what is now}} termed the European Union on the relationships between the courts in the different countries. In addition, the Lugano Convention (1988) binds the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, three East African {{countries}} (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) {{that were}} not members of the Associated African and Malagasy States (AAMS), but were instead member states of the Commonwealth of Nations combined to establish the East African Community (EAC). On 26 July 1968 the <b>EEC</b> <b>signed</b> an initial Association Agreement with the EAC. That Agreement did not enter into force {{because it was not}} ratified by all the countries involved. On 24 September 1969 in Arusha, a second Agreement was <b>signed</b> between the <b>EEC</b> and the EAC. That Agreement was signed {{at the same time as}} the Convention of Association between the EEC and the AAMS (Yaoundé II); both the Arusha Agreement and the Yaoundé II Convention entered into force on 1 January 1971 for a period of five years.|$|R

50|$|The TFEU {{originated}} as {{the treaty}} establishing the European Economic Community (the <b>EEC</b> treaty), <b>signed</b> in Rome on 25 March 1957. On 7 February 1992, the Maastricht treaty, {{which led to}} the formation of the European Union, saw the EEC Treaty renamed as the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) and renumbered. The Maastricht reforms also saw the creation of the European Union's three pillar structure, of which the European Community was the major constituent part.|$|R
50|$|On 9 July 1961 Panagiotis Kanellopoulos as Deputy Prime Minister in Konstantinos Karamanlis' {{government}} and German Vice-Chancellor Ludwig Erhard signed the protocols of Greece's Treaty of Association with the European Economic Community (<b>EEC).</b> The <b>signing</b> ceremony in Athens {{was attended by}} top government officials from the six-member group consisting of Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands. The six member group was the early precursor of today's 25 member European Union. Economy Minister Aristidis Protopapadakis and Foreign Minister Evangelos Averoff were also present at the ceremony as well as Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis.|$|R
40|$|In 1975 Israel and the <b>EEC</b> <b>signed</b> a {{preferential}} trade agreement, which included provision for free trade in manufactured goods between the signatories by 1989 at the latest. The present study examines the economic consequences for Israel {{of such a}} free trade area. Although political factors are clearly important in determining the course of EEC-Israel relations, analysis of their economic aspects is facilitated by abstracting from the political issues. Within this framework, the free trade area {{can be seen as}} a case of mutual preferences between a large economically developed bloc and a small semi-industrialized country. During the 1960 s economists and policy-makers, dissatisfied with the results of industrialization by import substitution, began to advocate the export of manufactures according to comparative advantage as a suitable development strategy for the less-developed countries (LDCs). A major obstacle to the success of this strategy was considered to be the tariff barriers existing in the high-income countries, where the largest markets lay, and the UN Conference on Trade and Development expended much energy between 1964 and 1971 in negotiating a system of preferential tariffs to be offered to LDCs. The intention was that eighteen developed countries would participate in the common system, but lack of agreement led to each country or bloc adopting a separate scheme. The individual preference systems which have emerged have come under a great deal of criticism, because they exclude some manufactured goods (usually the ones in which the LDCs have a comparative advantage) and place ceilings on {{preferential trade}} in other goods. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 102 - 109). The accession {{process of}} Turkey into the European Union {{has been a}} long and drawn out process. Ever since Turkey and the <b>EEC</b> <b>signed</b> an agreement, Turkey was lead to believe that it will be granted membership into the European Union. While there are obvious religious and cultural differences, Turkey had made large strides with regards to becoming more in line with the European Union’s ideology and standards. Turkey has suffered from {{the fact that there are}} so-called “brakemen” states, which still have been acting as a hindrance with regards to the smooth flow of the process. These states have objections to Turkish accession due to issues that they claim should be resolved before Turkey is allowed to join the European Union. Furthermore, they note that there are serious economic, geopolitical and cultural aspects that need to be looked at in order for Turkey to be able to fully integrate into the Union. This being said, the European Union has made a public commitment to allow Turkey into the Union based on the founding principles of the Union and the fact that the Union has characterized Turkey as being “European”. If the Union is to hold back on the promises that it has made to Turkey, it runs the risk of losing credibility among the international community. This paper aims to understand the problems and hindrances that have plagued Turkey’s accession and to analyze them within a framework. Given that there has been much research done on the topic, this paper aims to add its own new contribution through its analysis of the various issues affecting accession as well as analysing the structural and intergovernmental problems within the EU that have also impacted its stance towards Turkey. 1 bound copy: xiii, 111 leaves; 31 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
25|$|International {{relations}} are now largely, but not entirely, also {{left to the}} discretion of the home rule government. After leaving the <b>EEC,</b> Greenland <b>signed</b> a special treaty with it, granting it special access to the market as a constituent country of Denmark, which remains a member. Greenland {{is also a member of}} several small organizations along with Iceland, the Faroes, and the Inuit populations of Canada and Russia. It was one of the founders of the environmental Arctic Council in 1996. The US military bases on the island remain a major issue, with some politicians pushing for renegotiation of the 1951 USDenmark treaty by the Home Rule government. The 1999–2003 Commission on Self-Governance even proposed that Greenland should aim at Thule Air Base's removal from American authority and operation under the aegis of the United Nations.|$|R

2500|$|Karamanlis {{as early}} as 1958 pursued an {{aggressive}} policy toward Greek membership in the EEC. He considered Greece's entry into the EEC a personal dream because he saw it as the fulfillment {{of what he called}} [...] "Greece's European Destiny". He personally lobbied European leaders, such as Germany's Konrad Adenauer and France's Charles de Gaulle followed by two years of intense negotiations with Brussels. His intense lobbying bore fruit and on 9 July 1961 his government and the Europeans signed the protocols of Greece's Treaty of Association with the European Economic Community (<b>EEC).</b> The <b>signing</b> ceremony in Athens was attended by top government delegations from the six-member bloc of Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands, a precursor of the European Union. Economy Minister Aristidis Protopapadakis and Foreign Minister Evangelos Averoff were also present. German Vice-Chancellor Ludwig Erhard and Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak, a European Union pioneer and a Karlspreis winner like Karamanlis, were among the European delegates.|$|R
40|$|As {{a member}} of the Western {{security}} community through the OECE and NATO, Turkey became the second country to establish political links with the <b>EEC</b> <b>signing</b> an association treaty in 1963. Five years later its economy was still {{not in a position to}} deal with European competition and doubts about the viability of the association were widespread. Drawing on a wide variety of national (British, French, Italian) and EU archival resources according with the ‘supranational’ approach to European integration history, the article provides an account of how during the 1970 s, under the effect of the international recession and of economic and social problems, the enlargement and deepening of European integration ruined Turkey's position as a privileged partner, in spite of the Protocol signed in 1970 opening the path to the future adhesion. The Nine balked at extending economic privileges and even stepped back from commitments already taken, showing contrasting national positions, that did not allow the Commission to play a leading role. Politics and economics clashed in the EEC-Turkey relationship and the Nine appeared to be increasingly unable to conceptualize the relationship in positive terms: as Turkey appeared to be politically unstable and its economic situation deteriorated, EEC economic resources were not used to assist a politically relevant partner. In the meantime, Greece’s return to democracy and application to join the Community, the launching of the Mediterranean policy due to protect European energy supplies and the attempt of the Community to play a role in the North-South dialogue left Turkey on the side. This article offers a documented account and historical explanation of a crucial evolution in a still opened and much debated EU external issue. It contributes to the understanding of a currently much studied period of EEC history, namely the 1970 s. This article, first drafted as a contribution to a conference on The South-European crisis of the 1970 s held at the University of Padua, is the logical continuation of the essay “Stratégie de développement, option identitaire: la Turquie et l'Europe occidentale, de l'aide multilatérale à l'association à la CEE”, in Marta Petricioli (ed.), Mediterranean Europe, L’Europe méditerranéenne (Peter Lang, 2008) ...|$|R
50|$|The Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at Val Duchesse in 1956 drew up the {{essentials}} of the new treaties. Euratom would foster co-operation in the nuclear field, {{at the time a}} very popular area, and would, along with the EEC, share the Common Assembly and Court of Justice of the ECSC, but not its executives. Euratom would have its own Council and Commission, with fewer powers than the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. On 25 March 1957, the Treaties of Rome (the Euratom Treaty and the <b>EEC</b> Treaty) were <b>signed</b> by the ECSC members and on 1 January 1958 they came into force.|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} {{clinical}} symptoms and brain activity in {{new forms of}} infantile epilepsy, such as malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy (MMPSI) and Markand-Blume-Ohtahara syndrome (MBOS) and to elaborate their differential diagnostic criteria for the timely choice of treatment policy and for the prediction of the disease. Patients and methods. Thirty-eight children aged 1. 5 months to 3 years with MMPSI and MBOS were examined. Their medical history and neurological examination data, electroencephalographic and neuroimaging characteristics, and the efficiency of chosen anticonvulsant therapy were investigated. Results and discussion. The investigators revealed the following characteristics of these forms: the causes of these syndromes were highly diverse and unspecific; the neurological status was characterized {{by a variety of}} symptoms with an obvious delay in psycho-prespeech development concurrent with a high rate of partial focal (in MMPSI) and generalized (in MBOS) status epilepticus; The <b>EEC</b> characteristic <b>sign</b> was MISF and «lafa» patterns in the children with MBOS and continuous migrating partial ictal status epilepticus patterns in those with MMPSI.

40|$|From the Introduction. The Treaty on European Union, {{also known}} as the Treaty of Maastricht or the Maastricht Treaty, created the European Union (EU) from the {{existing}} European Economic Community (<b>EEC.)</b> It was <b>signed</b> by the member states on February 7, 1992, and entered into force on November 1, 1993. 1 Among its many innovations was the creation of European citizenship, which would be granted to any person who was a citizen of an EU member state. Citizenship, however, is intertwined with immigration, which the Treaty also attempted to address. Policy on visas, immigration and asylum was originally placed under Pillar 3 of the EU, which dealt with Justice and Home Affairs. In 1997, however, the Amsterdam Treaty moved these policies from Pillar 3 to Pillar 1, signaling “a shift toward more supranational decision-making in this area,” as opposed to the intergovernmental method of Pillars 2 and 3. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that amount of REM sleep time made up following deprivation {{is related to the}} type of behavior which replaces it, 16 5 s were deprived of REM sleep for the 1 st i night for 2 nights under 2 different instructions: (a) to report whatever mental content was occurring spontane-ously prior to the awakening, (ft) to repeat lists of digits forward and back-ward. On a 3 rd night an equal number of awakenings were made in NREM sleep; i the 5 s reported their own content, the other i repeated digits. REM deprivation content awakenings were followed by less REM time in the 2 nd 4 night than were digit awakenings. These 2 conditions did affect REM time differently when applied during NREM sleep. The amount of REM compensation was negatively related to the amount of content judged to be dreams. In a previous study (Cartwright, Monroe, & Palmer, 1967) it was found that not all subjects responded to a moderate amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep depriva-tion by making up for the loss at the next opportunity for normal sleep. Following three nights of deprivation of this phase of sleep which normally is associated with dreaming, three types of response were observed. Some subjects showed the expected quantitative in-crease in the percentage of total sleep time spent in the REM phase above that estab-lished as their normal rate. Two other types of response to this experimental condition were found which had not been reported previously. The second response pattern in-volved a qualitative disruption of the sleep stage patterns during the two uninterrupted recovery nights. Falling into this pattern was clearly related to the number of awakenings it was necessary to make during the experi-mental nights. Since an awakening was made each time the <b>EEC</b> showed <b>signs</b> that a REM period was about to begin, and since subjects vary greatly on how many attempts they 1 This study was carried out with the support o...|$|R
