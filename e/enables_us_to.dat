In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus <b>enables</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E

Indeed, multisensory integration is central to adaptive behavior because it allows us to perceive a world of coherent perceptual entities. Multisensory integration also deals with how different sensory modalities interact with one another and alter each other's processing.|$|E

25|$|Murphy concludes that,"Just as the Son of God limited {{himself by}} taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine {{action in the}} world to be in accord with {{rational}} laws which God has chosen. This <b>enables</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E
25|$|For example, an {{intriguing}} problem in geobiology {{is the role}} of organisms in the global cycling of methane. Genetics has revealed that the methane monooxygenase gene (pmo) is used for oxidizing methane and is present in all aerobic methane-oxidizers, or methanotrophs. The presence of DNA sequences of the pmo gene in the environment {{can be used as a}} proxy for methanotrophy. A more generalizable tool is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which is found in bacteria and archaea. This gene evolves very slowly over time and is not usually horizontally transferred, and so it is often used to distinguish different taxonomic units of organisms in the environment. In this way, genes are clues to organismal metabolism and identity. Genetics <b>enables</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> ask 'who is there?' and 'what are they doing?' This approach is called metagenomics.|$|E

Citing the power of alternate reality programs and video games, like Minecraft, Ingels' 'worldcraft' is an extension of 'hedonistic sustainability' and further develops ideas established in his first book, Yes Is More. In the video (and essay by the same name in his second book, Hot to Cold: An Odyssey of Architectural Adaptation) Ingels notes: [...] "These fictional worlds empower people with the tools to transform their own environments. This is what architecture ought to be..." [...] "Architecture must become Worldcraft, the craft of making our world, where our knowledge and technology doesn't limit us but rather <b>enables</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> turn surreal dreams into inhabitable space.
