50|$|After the Second World War, an {{asphalt plant}} was {{established}} in Ježa. A factory producing <b>dissolved</b> <b>acetylene</b> {{was established in}} 1967. Ježa annexed the village of Brod in 1952; Ježa itself was annexed by the City of Ljubljana in 1980, ending its existence as an independent settlement.|$|R
40|$|Acetylene {{generated}} from various grades of calcium carbide and obtained from commercial- and purified-grade <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{was shown to}} contain high concentrations of various contaminants. Dependent on the source of acetylene, these included, at maximal values, H 2 (0. 023 %), O 2 (0. 779 %), N 2 (3. 78 %), PH 3 (0. 06 %), CH 4 (0. 073 %), and acetone (1 to 10 %). The concentration of the contaminants in <b>cylinder</b> <b>acetylene</b> was highly dependent {{on the extent of}} cylinder discharge. Several conventional methods used to partially purify <b>cylinder</b> <b>acetylene</b> were compared. A small-scale method for extensively purifying acetylene is described.

50|$|Note: <b>Acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{contain an}} inert packing material, {{which may be}} agamassan, and are filled with a solvent such as acetone or dimethylformamide. The {{acetylene}} is pumped into the cylinder and it dissolves in the solvent. When the cylinder is opened the acetylene comes back out of solution, much like a carbonated beverage bubbles when opened. This is a workaround to acetylene's property to explode when pressurized above 200 kPa or liquified.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{automated}} on 7 January 1959 and the dioptric lens with its revolving machine and vaporised paraffin incandescent burner {{were replaced by}} a new fourth order cylindric refractor lens. Its mantle light source used <b>dissolved</b> <b>acetylene</b> from a battery of cylinders giving a candlepower of 2,600 white light and 500 in the red sector. This appeared to be worse than the old light and mariners using the harbour complained about the new lens.|$|R
2500|$|On an {{oxyacetylene}} torch system {{there will be}} three types of valves, the tank valve, the regulator valve, and the torch valve. There will be a set of these three valves for each gas. The gas in the tanks or cylinders is at high pressure. Oxygen cylinders are generally filled to approximately 2200 psi. The regulator converts the high pressure gas to a low pressure stream suitable for welding. [...] <b>Acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.|$|R

Use of these gases can be very dangerous due to the low temperatures of the products, and high pressures of the gas when released, and hence the organisation is involved in regulation and laws for use of compressed gases. Compressed hydrocarbon gases (liquefied petroleum gas and <b>dissolved</b> <b>acetylene)</b> also have the danger of exploding, due to the high flammability of the gases.|$|R

50|$|At around 8:00 am {{a worker}} was {{changing}} over an <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinder</b> when the tank began to vent and ignited; {{this in turn}} ignited other venting tanks. On arrival of the brigade a 300 m cordon {{was put in place}} which required surrounding houses and the docks to be evacuated. The brigade extinguished the initial fire but then had to cool the cylinders constantly for 24 hours to prevent the cylinders from exploding due to the heat and pressure buildup. In total Cornwall FRS sent 6 pumping appliances, 1 command support unit, 1 operational support unit, 1 welfare vehicle. The incident lasted for 24 hours and required numerous relief crews to attend overnight.|$|R

50|$|The first {{settlement}} of Point Lookout occurred in 1932 when a substantial concrete lighthouse was built. A lighthouse and signal station was proposed in 1825 {{but did not}} eventuate and in 1848 the pilot station was moved from Amity Point to Cape Moreton because the South Passage was considered too dangerous. A hut was built to store <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> at Cylinder Beach, which derived its name from this usage. Shortly after {{the construction of the}} lighthouse Bertie Clayton established a guesthouse above Main Beach. Guests arrived at Amity Point by launch and were collected by him by car and taken back to the guesthouse either along the beach, or at high tide, along a track beside the swamp adjacent to the beach. Clayton's guests were accommodated in tents with timber floors that later evolved into tent-like huts with concrete walls and fibrous cement roofs.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a newly {{developed}} technique - laser calorimetry spectroscopy (LCS), {{which is a}} combination of laser absorption spectroscopy and calorimetry - for the detection of gases dissolved in liquids. The technique involves determination of concentration of a dissolved gas by irradiating the liquid with light of a wavelength where the gas absorbs, and measuring the temperature change caused by the absorbance. Conventionally, detection of dissolved gases with sufficient sensitivity and specificity was done by first extracting the gases from the liquid and then analyzing the gases using techniques such as gas chromatography. Using LCS, {{we have been able to}} detect ppm levels of dissolved gases without extracting them from the liquid. In this paper, we show the detection of <b>dissolved</b> <b>acetylene</b> in transformer oil in the mid infrared (MIR) wavelength (3021 nm) region...|$|R

40|$|We {{report an}} autopsy {{case of a}} male welder in his thirties who {{was found dead in}} an {{exploded}} truck cabin. The roof, windows and doors of the cabin had been blown up to 50 metres away. An oxygen <b>cylinder</b> and an <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinder,</b> both unexploded, were found {{in the back of the}} truck. The deceased was lying on the driver’s seat. His entire body was burnt, carbonised and partially skeletonised. There was a small amount of soot in his oesophagus and stomach and a large volume of bloody fluid in the trachea and bronchi. There was an extensive haem-orrhage in the posterior thoracic wall. No drugs were detected in the blood. Hardly any carbon mon-oxide and combustion-related gases were detected in the blood, therefore he was not considered to have died from the fire. Acetylene was detected in his blood (21. 5 µg/ml in the femoral vein blood) and urine (7. 49 µg/ml), with marked haemorrhaging in his back. We therefore concluded that the victim died because of an acetylene explosion in the cabin and also that this was a suicide...|$|R

50|$|Acetylene is also {{supplied}} differently. Since {{it is so}} {{unstable and}} explosive, this is supplied as a gas dissolved in acetone within a packing mass in a <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Acetylene</b> is also the only other common industrial gas that sublimes at atmospheric pressure.|$|R
40|$|The {{acetylene}} reduction assay for {{the measurement}} of N 2 fixation in a water-saturated paddy soil {{is limited by the}} slow diffusion of acetylene and ethylene. In laboratory incubation tests, vigorous shaking after the assay period is needed to release ethylene into the gas within the assay vials. Shaking prior to the incubation is also effective for <b>dissolving</b> <b>acetylene</b> in the water-saturated soil. However, a water-saturated soil depth of less than 10 mm during incubation is recommended. In field assays, some amounts of ethylene remain in the water-saturated soil phase of the acetylene reduction assay chamber, but stirring the water-saturated soil before sampling reduces the amount of ethylene remaining in soil. Evidence of a downward movement of acetylene and an upward movement of ethylene through rice plants was obtained. Because of the rapid transfer of acetylene to rice plant roots, an in situ acetylene reduction assay covering a rice hill is likely to detect nitrogen fixation in the proximity of roots where acetylene is easily accessible. Acetylene introduction to the water-saturated soil phase prior to assay did not greatly increase the acetylene reduction rate. Carbon dioxide enrichment in the assay chamber did not enhance nitrogen fixation in a paddy including rice and algae during a 1 -day cycle...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the worst}} fires the Stockholm Fire Brigade {{experienced}} since its formation in 1875 was a fire in 1937 in the central dairy at Torsgatan. The fire broke out on February 8, 1937, caused by a welder working in the attic above the fourth floor. He first attempted to extinguish the fire himself, but failed. The fire brigade was alerted and quickly arrived on the site. The men not only had to fight the fire, but also work under difficult conditions, including heavy ice (the temperature was 10 degrees below zero) and a wax layer of 3,500 kg, which began to melt and burn, and hindered the firefighters considerably. Two firefighters were cut off by the fire. One hung outside a window and fell, later dying of his injuries. The other was rescued at the last minute. Some <b>acetylene</b> <b>cylinders</b> exploded, injuring another firefighter. A stairwell threatened to collapse and officers had to withdraw the men. In the end, all of Stockholm's firefighters engaged in fire extinguishing, and all the firefighters were called to duty. In total, there were 70 people on the site, including managers, the fire chief, firefighters, and teachers from officers' school. Only after seven hours was the fire considered to be under control. The damage cost {{over a million dollars}} and Stockholm's milk supply was threatened.|$|R

Decontamination services were not provided in the Arkhangelsk region before the formation of the ARRS. From 2006 to 2011, specialists of the ARRS mitigated adverse effects from 46 damaged methyl bromide cylinders, 1820 chlorine cylinders, 800 liquid chlorine containers, 29 ammonia cylinders, 7.5 tons compressed and ammonia gas from refrigeration equipment, 5 <b>acetylene,</b> 5 hydrogen <b>cylinders,</b> and 5 methane cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Georges Claude {{studied at}} the École supérieure de {{physique}} et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI). He then held several positions. He was an electrical inspector in a cable factory and the laboratory manager in an electric works. He founded and edited a magazine, L'Étincelle Électrique (The Electric Spark); his important friendship with Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval apparently dates from this time. About 1896, Claude learned of the explosion risk for bottled acetylene, which was used at the time for lighting. Acetylene is explosive when stored under pressure. Claude showed that <b>acetylene</b> <b>dissolved</b> well in acetone, equivalent to storing it under 25 atmospheres of pressure, reduced the risk in handling the gas.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 March 1967, {{the worst}} ground {{aviation}} accident of the Vietnam War occurred at Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam when a traffic controller cleared USMC A-6A Intruder, BuNo 152608, of VMA(AW)-242, MAG-11, for takeoff but also cleared USAF C-141A-LM Starlifter, AF serial number 65-9407, of the 62nd Military Airlift Wing, McChord AFB, Washington, {{to cross the}} runway. The A-6's crew saw the Starlifter {{at the last moment}} and veered off of the runway to try to avoid the collision, but despite this, the A-6's port wing sliced through the C-141's nose, which immediately caught fire. The C-141's load of 72 <b>acetylene</b> gas <b>cylinders</b> ignited and caused a tremendous explosion. Only the loadmaster survived, escaping through the rear hatch. The A-6 overturned and skidded down the runway on its back, but both its crewmembers, Capt. Frederick Cone and Capt. Doug Wilson, survived, crawling out of the smashed canopy after the jet came to a halt. Some of the A-6's ordnance load of bombs and rocket packs went off in the ensuing fire. The Military Airlift Command crew killed were Capt. Harold Leland Hale, Capt. Leroy Edward Leonard, Capt. Max Paul Starkel, SSgt. Alanson Garland Bynum, and SSgt. Alfred Funck. This was the first of two C-141s lost during the conflict, and one of only three strategic airlifters written off during the Vietnam War.|$|R
40|$|The Musi River {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} river of twelve big rivers in South Sumatra Province. Water quality of this river affects the water quality in the estuary and {{biological}} health in its surrounding so that it is important to determine the Cu and Pb concentrations. The purposes of this study were to analize distribution of heavy metals (Cu and Pb) and to determine the water quality status in March and September 2014. The water and sediment samples were collected from eight stations along the Musi River from downstream to the estuary. Heavy metal concentration was analized by employing USEPA 30050 B method using AAS Spektra plus variant with air mixure flame – <b>acetylene.</b> <b>Dissolved</b> Cu and Pb concentrations in March were 0, 002 - 0, 006 mg/l and 0, 002 - 0, 003 mg/l, respectively, while in September were 0, 001 - 0, 010 mg/lfor Cu and 0, 001 - 0, 005 mg/lfor Pb. Cu and Pb concentrations in sediment detected in March were 6, 92 - 16, 4 mg/l and 1, 9 - 11, 4 mg/l, respectively, while in September were 2, 3 - 13, 9 mg/l for Cu and 4, 29 - 9, 95 mg/l for Pb. Student test analysis showed that was no significant differences between Pb and Cu concentrations (dissolved and sediment) between March and September. Generally, the concentration of heavy metals Cu and Pb in Musi River estuary were still below specified quality standards...|$|R
40|$|There {{is great}} demand for thin {{functional}} coatings in the semiconductor, optics, electronics, medical, automotive and aerospace industries [1 - 13]. As fabricated components become {{smaller and more}} complex, {{the properties of the}} materials’ surface take on greater importance. Thin coatings {{play a key role in}} tailoring surfaces to give them the desired hardness, wear resistance, chemical inertness, and electrical characteristics. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings possess an array of desirable properties, including outstanding abrasion and wear resistance, chemical inertness, hardness, a low coefficient of friction and exceptionally high dielectric strength [14 - 22]. Diamond-like carbon is considered to be an amorphous material, containing a mixture of sp 2 and sp 3 bonded carbon. Based on the percentage of sp 3 carbon and the hydrogen content, four different types of DLC coatings have been identified: tetrahedral carbon (ta-C), hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) hard, a-C:H soft, and hydrogenated tetrahedral carbon (ta-C:H) [20, 24, 25]. Possessing the highest hardness of 80 GPa, ta-C possesses an sp 3 carbon content of 80 to 88 u%, and no appreciable hydrogen content whereas a-C:H soft possesses a hardness of less than 10 GPa, contains an sp 3 carbon content of 60 % and a hydrogen content between 30 to 50 %. Methods used to deposit DLC coatings include ion beam deposition, cathodic arc spray, pulsed laser ablation, argon ion sputtering, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition [73 - 83]. Researchers contend that several advantages exist when depositing DLC coatings in a low-pressure environment. For example, ion beam processes are widely utilized since the ion bombardment is thought to promote denser sp 3 -bonded carbon networks. Other processes, such as sputtering, are better suited for coating large parts [29, 30, 44]. However, the deposition of DLC in a vacuum system has several disadvantages, including high equipment cost and restrictions on the size and shape of material that may be treated. The deposition of DLC at atmospheric pressure has been demonstrated by several researchers. Izake, et al [53] and Novikov and Dymont [54] have demonstrated an electrochemical process that is carried out with organic compounds such as methanol and <b>acetylene</b> <b>dissolved</b> in ammonia. This process requires that the substrates be immersed in the liquid [53 - 54]. The atmospheric pressure deposition of DLC was also demonstrated by Kulik, et al. utilizing a plasma torch. However, this process requires operating temperatures in excess of 800 oC [55]. In this report, we investigate the deposition of diamond-like carbon films using a low temperature, atmospheric pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. The films were characterized by solid-state carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13 C NMR) and found to have a ratio of sp 2 to sp 3 carbon of 43 to 57 %. The films were also tested for adhesion, coefficient of friction, and dielectric strength...|$|R
