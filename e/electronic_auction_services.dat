40|$|The work {{presented}} here develops a distributed systems architecture and propose an implementation framework for conducting dependable Internet based on-line auctions, {{meeting the requirements}} of scalability and <b>service</b> integrity. Current <b>auction</b> <b>services</b> essentially rely on a central auction server. Given the increasing popularity and usage of <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions,</b> such a centralised approach is fundamentally restrictive with respect to scalability. Further, different national markets have different monetary regulations and may employ different procedures for payment settlements. Catering for local market autonomy means that decentralisation is an essential and practical requirement. With these design goals in mind, the paper develops an approach that permits an <b>auction</b> <b>service</b> to be mapped on to globally distributed auction servers. It then proposes a framework for a fault-tolerant implementation of the architecture. Faulttolerance is achieved through matured technologies: replication management and group paradigm. Keywords and Phrases: Auctions, distributed servers, multicast groups, passive and active replication, reliable multicast, membership service, synchronous and asynchronous networks. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the pervasive impact of advanced multi-access technologies [...] such as Internet, wireless data, Interactive TV, and wired & wireless voice [...] on the processes and stakeholders involved in consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> in The Netherlands. <b>Electronic</b> web-based <b>auctions</b> are a popular mechanism to trade among sellers and buyers. Little {{attention has been}} given to how new access technologies affect or could affect the functioning and outcome of these type of auctions. In this article different exchange processes in <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> are classified and analyzed. The impact on the stakeholders of e-auctions has been examined by using buyer-seller relationship literature. The focus in this article was on five consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions.</b> In these auctions consumers buy and sell all kinds of products by using sales auctions. The investigated auctions are: eBay. nl, Qoop, Ricardo. nl, Start-End, and Wannabid.

40|$|Summary An {{investigation}} of the pervasive impact of multi-access technologies, i. e. the internet, wireless data, wired and wireless voice, and interactive TV, on consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> {{was carried out in}} the Dutch market by some researchers. This article extends the analytic generalizability of their research findings through a replication study in the emerging markets of China. By comparing the empirical research findings, we reveal that there is {{no significant difference in the}} impacts of multi-access technologies on consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> within dissimilar contexts; as long as both the business and the technologies are prevalent. This affirms the argument that the use of more sophisticated multi-access technologies has positive effects on the maturity level of exchange processes and stakeholders interactions in consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions,</b> thereby leading to an increase in the expected success of the <b>auctions.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> Multi-access technologies Maturity level Exchange process Stakeholders Customer perceived value...|$|R

40|$|Recently, an <b>electronic</b> sealed-bid <b>auction</b> using {{cryptography}} techniques {{has been}} proposed.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of electronic markets have been based purely on a single variable (price) as the factor that determines ‘the winner’. Multi-attribute auctions {{are likely to be}} more appropriate for procurement scenarios where factors other than price need to be considered in determining the outcome. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of empirical research on multi-attribute <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions.</b> In particular, there is little empirical evidence of how multi-attribute auctions fit with our theoretical conceptualisation of electronic markets. This paper uses the market design aspects of multi-attribute auctions to explore a multivariable <b>electronic</b> <b>auction,</b> using frameworks from electronic market process design and systematic sourcing. Evidence from the case study illustrates that multi-variable <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> can be used to procure a wider range of operating and manufacturing input that has been considered possible with traditional, price only, auctions. The findings reveal how the use of an <b>electronic</b> <b>auction</b> intermediary creates a middle ground of interaction between spot and systematic sourcing, by automating for the buyer certain general parameters and trade context processes.
