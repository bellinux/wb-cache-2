2500|$|After {{the final}} presidential debate, McCain and {{his running mate}} Sarah Palin {{frequently}} repeated the charge in campaign speeches that [...] "Joe the Plumber" [...] would pay higher taxes under Obama and Biden's plan, although according to tax analysts neither Wurzelbacher nor the company he works for would actually be subject to higher taxes under Obama's tax plan. Obama's [...] "spread the wealth around" [...] quote was later used by the McCain campaign, comparing the Democratic policies to socialism. McCain said, [...] " [...] wants government to take Joe's money and give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else." [...] Obama said in a campaign rally on October 24 that McCain was [...] "not fighting for Joe the Plumber. He's fighting for Joe the Hedge Fund Manager... He likes to talk about Joe the Plumber but he's in cahoots with Joe the CEO." [...] Obama then promoted a plan for middle-class tax cuts and [...] "asked for {{a show of hands}} at the rally in the Richmond Coliseum from those making less than $250,000. Nearly all of the 13,000 people raised their hands." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am come at once,' {{said the}} widow breathlessly, {{as soon as}} they were in the lane, 'for it is so {{exciting}} that I can't keep it. I must tell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody,</b> if only a bird, or a cat, or a garden snail.' ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{here was}} a letter for a poor old man to receive. But, in the dryness of his {{withered}} mind, Aaron got it out of himself. When a man writes a letter to himself, it is a pity to post <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else. Perhaps {{the same is true}} of a book.|$|E
6000|$|MORELL. (very gravely). So {{many that}} you don't know. (More aggressively.) Anyhow, when there's {{anything}} coarse-grained to be done, you {{ring the bell}} and throw <b>it</b> on <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else, eh? That's {{one of the great}} facts in YOUR existence, isn't it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No {{doubt about}} it,' {{returned}} Kit, {{with a serious}} look; 'upon my word, mother, I don't think <b>it</b> was right <b>to</b> trust <b>it</b> <b>to</b> itself. <b>Somebody</b> ought <b>to</b> have gone with it, I'm afraid.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't put <b>it</b> off on <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else, Potts!" [...] {{cried the}} old scout wrathfully. [...] "If you aint got {{backbone}} enough <b>to</b> be honest, <b>it's</b> your own fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{carry it}} along with me," [...] said the Bee-man, [...] "as I go on with my search, and perhaps I may find its mother. If I do not, I shall give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> in that little village yonder. Any thing {{would be better than}} leaving it to be devoured by that horrid dragon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This here money,' said Sam, with {{a little}} hesitation, 'he's anxious to put someveres, vere he knows it'll be safe, and I'm wery anxious too, for if he keeps it, he'll go a-lendin' <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody,</b> or inwestin' {{property}} in horses, or droppin' his pocket-book down an airy, or makin' a Egyptian mummy of his-self in some vay or another.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "DON'T! It {{scares me}} yet, {{to think of}} it. I repented of it the minute it was done; and I was even afraid to tell you lest your face might betray <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody.</b> I didn't sleep any that night, for worrying. But {{after a few days}} I saw that no one was going to suspect me, and after that I got to feeling glad I did it. And I feel glad yet, Mary--glad through and through." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{this time}} the {{apprentice}} went regularly up to the palace, receiving each morning twelve ducats in payment. But after a while, his secret, which he had carefully kept, burnt within him, and he longed to tell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody.</b> His master saw there was something on his mind, and asked what it was. The youth replied {{that he had been}} tormenting himself for some months, and should never feel easy until some one shared his secret.|$|E
60|$|Business {{neglected}} {{is business}} lost; it is true, {{there are some}} businesses which require less attendance than others, and give a man less occasion of application; but, in general, that tradesman who can satisfy himself to be absent from his business, must not expect success; if he is above {{the character of a}} diligent tradesman, he must then be above the business too, and should leave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody,</b> that, having more need of it, will think it worth his while to mind it better.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Harding {{answered}} shortly, [...] "I make none. If you {{had insisted}} on Miss Mowbray's marrying Brand, I might {{have had something to}} say. All I ask is that you give her a free choice; if she uses <b>it</b> <b>to</b> take <b>somebody</b> else, I won't complain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Lord, it's rich!" [...] laughed Huish. [...] "It {{would really}} be a {{scrumptious}} lark if <b>it</b> 'ad 'appened <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else! And {{what are we to}} do next? O, my eye! with this bloomin' schooner, too?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have reached}} that point where I {{must have a}} confidant, or go crazy. Once I could tell things to Beatrix. That was before she got engaged. Now she tells {{everything}} to him. There is no earthly way of preventing her. I've tried them all. So, nowadays, when I get into trouble, I tell it out loud to myself in the glass. It's a relief, you know. But that is no good now. I want to tell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> who can say things back. Will you promise to say things back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{led the way}} up a {{staircase}} to the flat roof, where Dick ran to the parapet. Looking across the town, {{he saw in the}} distance a dim white light and a long smear of smoke that trailed across the glittering sea. He frowned as he watched it, for the ship was English and he felt himself responsible for the safety of all on board her. He had done his best, when {{there was no time to}} pause and think, but perhaps he had blundered. Suppose the Creole boy had lost his note or sent <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> ashore? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our injudicious friend Herrero {{has some}} word for us," [...] he said. [...] "He {{is a man}} who lets his dislikes run away with him, and he is not always wise in his messages." [...] He stopped a moment with a little {{reflective}} smile. [...] "Still, a message is always a difficulty in this part of Africa. If one teaches the messenger what he is to say he may tell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else, and it happens now and then that to write is not advisable. One must choose, however, and I wonder which our friend has done." ...|$|E
60|$|Several {{witnesses}} swore {{they heard}} Judge Driscoll say in his public speech that the twins {{would be able}} to find their lost knife again when they needed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> assassinate <b>somebody</b> with. This was not news, but now <b>it</b> was seen <b>to</b> have been sorrowfully prophetic, and a profound sensation quivered through the hushed courtroom when those dismal words were repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you men, how dreadfully stupid you are sometimes!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Blyth. [...] "Why, Valentine, dear, it's {{the easiest}} {{thing in the world}} to guess what she has had the drawing framed for. <b>To</b> make <b>it</b> a present <b>to</b> <b>somebody,</b> of course! And who does she mean <b>to</b> give <b>it</b> to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'On the contrary, Popsy, when <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else's sister I'm {{much too}} nervous and funky to say {{anything}} of the kind. But you must at least do Gautier the justice to observe that if I had described a circle round you, instead of allowing you to revolve once on your own axis, I shouldn't {{have been able to}} get the gloss on the satin in the sunlight as I do now that you turn the panniers toward the window. That, you must admit, is a very important aesthetic consideration.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a matter}} of some wonder at first how the man got there, until the motion of the steamer turned the side and {{disclosed}} a set of cross poles lashed between two of the uprights, forming a rude sort of ladder. Curiosity, satisfied on this primary point, next asked why he got there. As this was a riddle to me, I propounded it to Yejiro, who only shook his head and propounded <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else; a compliment to the inquiry certainly, if not to my choice of informant. This somebody else told him the man was fishing. Except for the immobility of the figure, I never saw a man look less like it in my life.|$|E
60|$|I {{wish you}} would learn of Everett what he would take, over and above a {{discharge}} for all the trouble we have been at, to take his business out of our hands and give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else. It is impossible to collect money on that or any other claim here now; and although you know I am not a very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience with Mr. Everett's importunity. It seems like he not only writes all the letters he can himself, but gets everybody else in Louisville and vicinity to be constantly writing to us about his claim. I have always said that Mr. Everett is a very clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be obliged; {{but it does seem}} to me he ought to know we are interested to collect his claim, and therefore would do it if we could.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{make fun}} of a fellow," [...] Clive continues, {{laughing}} ruefully. [...] "You see I must talk about <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody.</b> I shall die if I don't. Sometimes, sir, I rise up in my might and I defy her lightning. The sarcastic dodge is the best: I have borrowed that from you Pen, old boy. That puzzles her: that would beat her if I could but go on with it. But there comes a tone of her sweet voice, a look out of those killing grey eyes, and all my frame is in a thrill and a tremble. When she was engaged to Lord Kew I did battle with the confounded passion--and I ran away from it like an honest man, and the gods rewarded me with ease of mind after a while. But now the thing rages worse than ever. Last night, I give you my honour, I heard {{every one of the}} confounded hurs toll, except the last, when I was dreaming of my father, and the chambermaid woke me with a hot water jug." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Godfrey, with a keen decisiveness of tone, in {{contrast}} with his usually careless and unemphatic speech--"there's debts we can't pay like money debts, by paying extra for the years that have slipped by. While I've been putting off and putting off, the trees have been growing--it's too late now. Marner {{was in the right}} in what he said about a man's turning away a blessing from his door: <b>it</b> falls <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else. I wanted to pass for childless once, Nancy--I shall pass for childless now against my wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am obliged, madam, {{to leave}} England suddenly, {{and it is}} {{probable}} that we shall never meet again. I should be happy if I had your prayers! This little jewel enclosed belonged to my mother, the Queen Agrippina. She told me that I was never <b>to</b> part with <b>it,</b> except <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> I loved as much as herself.

6000|$|And {{that is how}} I came to go to Trulyruralania.

A precious lot SHE knew about it! ...|$|R
