5|$|They meet {{an old man}} who angrily {{tells them}} that there are no monsters and sends them to see his son, a {{geneticist}} named Francis Pollidori (John O'Hurley). Dr. Pollidori shows them his experiments studying the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> using the fruit fly Drosophila. This presentation includes images of a fly with legs growing out of its mouth. He tells the agents that the same kind of experiment could, in theory, be performed on humans. Afterward, Mulder tells Scully that he believes that Dr. Pollidori, acting as a modern-day Victor Frankenstein, has created The Great Mutato. Later, Dr. Pollidori's wife Elizabeth (Miriam Smith) is knocked unconscious and is attacked {{in the same manner as}} Shaineh. At the crime scene, Mulder and Scully find a chemical residue from an agricultural agent used to anesthetize animals, which leads them to suspect Dr. Pollidori's father, who is a farmer. Dr. Pollidori comes to his father's house, angrily confronts him, and murders him. Later, Mutato, who lives with Pollidori Sr., finds his dead body and tearfully buries it in a barn.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} how {{developmental}} genes are expressed during embryogenesis has become an important new tool in {{the last twenty years}} for understanding the structure and evolution of morphology. The arthropod head problem has been tackled in three main ways in this regard, first by using genetic segmental markers to probe the obscure region in front of the mouth, especially in insects; second by looking at <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> expression patterns to detect patterns of homology between different arthropods; and third, by studying gene expression in particular features (especially the labrum) to determine its appendiculate or other status. Because all arthropods have the same complement of nine Hox loci, the morphological diversification observed is caused by heterochrony, meaning that the genes are expressed at different times.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> are {{a family}} of homeodomain-containing {{transcription}} factors that determine cellular identity during development. Here we review {{a number of recent}} studies showing that <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> are strongly expressed in ovarian cancer, and that in some cases the expression of specific <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> is sufficient to confer a particular identity and phenotype upon cancer cells. We also review the recent advances in elucidating the different functions of <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> in ovarian cancer. A literature search was performed using the search terms <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> (including specific <b>HOX</b> <b>genes),</b> ovarian cancer and oncogenesis. Articles were accessed through searches performed in ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed and ScienceDirect. Taken together, these studies have shown that <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> {{play a role in the}} oncogenesis of ovarian cancer and function in the inhibition of apoptosis, DNA repair and enhanced cell motility. The function of <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> in ovarian cancer oncogenesis supports their potential role as prognostic and diagnostic markers, and as therapeutic targets in this disease. </p...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> {{are named}} for the {{homeotic}} phenotypes that result when their function is disrupted, wherein one segment develops with the identity of another (e.g. legs where antennae should be). <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> in different phyla have been given different names, {{which has led to}} confusion about nomenclature. The complement of <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> in Drosophila is made up of two clusters, the Antennapedia complex and the Bithorax complex, which together were historically referred to as the HOM-C (for Homeotic Complex). Although historically HOM-C genes have referred to Drosophila homologues, while <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> referred to vertebrate homologues, this distinction is no longer made, and both HOM-C and <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> are called <b>Hox</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It is {{expected}} that genes that are expressed early in development and have a complex expression pattern are under strong purifying selection and thus evolve slowly. <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> fulfill these criteria and thus, should have a low evolutionary rate. However, some observations point to a completely different scenario. <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> are usually highly conserved inside the homeobox, but very variable outside it. Results We have measured the rates of nucleotide divergence and indel fixation of three <b>Hox</b> <b>genes,</b> labial (lab), proboscipedia (pb) and abdominal-A (abd-A), and compared them with those of three genes derived by duplication from Hox 3, bicoid (bcd), zerknüllt (zen) and zerknüllt-related (zen 2), and 15 non- <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> in sets of orthologous sequences of three species of the genus Drosophila. These rates were compared {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> evolve slowly. Our results show that the evolutionary rate of <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> is higher than that of non- <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> when both amino acid differences and indels are taken into account: 43. 39 % of the amino acid sequence is altered in <b>Hox</b> <b>genes,</b> versus 30. 97 % in non- <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> and 64. 73 % in <b>Hox</b> -derived <b>genes.</b> Microsatellites scattered along the coding sequence of <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> explain partially, but not fully, their fast sequence evolution. Conclusion These results show that <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> have a higher evolutionary dynamics than other developmental genes, and emphasize the need to take into account indels in addition to nucleotide substitutions in order to accurately estimate evolutionary rates. </p...|$|R
25|$|Front limbs are nonexistent in {{all known}} snakes. This {{is caused by}} the {{evolution}} of their Hox genes, controlling limb morphogenesis. The axial skeleton of the snakes’ common ancestor, like most other tetrapods, had regional specializations consisting of cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (lower back), sacral (pelvic), and caudal (tail) vertebrae. Early in snake evolution, the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the axial skeleton responsible {{for the development of the}} thorax became dominant. As a result, the vertebrae anterior to the hindlimb buds (when present) all have the same thoracic-like identity (except from the atlas, axis, and 1–3 neck vertebrae). In other words, most of a snake's skeleton is an extremely extended thorax. Ribs are found exclusively on the thoracic vertebrae. Neck, lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are very reduced in number (only 2–10 lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are present), while only a short tail remains of the caudal vertebrae. However, the tail is still long enough to be of important use in many species, and is modified in some aquatic and tree-dwelling species.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Schmidtke {{and colleagues}} showed that isozyme {{complexity}} {{is similar in}} amphioxus and tunicates, contradicting a prediction of Ohno's hypothesis that genome duplication occurred in the common ancestor of amphioxus and vertebrates. However, this analysis did not examine vertebrates, so could say nothing about later duplication events. (Furthermore, much later molecular phylogenetics has shown that vertebrates are {{more closely related to}} tunicates than to amphioxus, thus negating the logic of this analysis.) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene mapping data in humans and mice revealed extensive paralogy regions - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution. Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of Hox genes in amphioxus revealed presence of a single <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> cluster, in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional gene families revealed a common one-to-many rule when amphioxus and vertebrate genes were compared. Taken together, these two lines of evidence suggest that two genome duplications occurred in the ancestry of vertebrates, after it had diverged from the cephalochordate evolutionary lineage.|$|E
2500|$|Mir-2 microRNAs in Drosophila {{specifically}} target three pro-apoptotic genes: , [...] and [...] The {{repression of}} rpr and grim by the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> ABD-B prevents apoptosis in neural cells. On the other hand, computational prediction of microRNA targets show that mir-2 may target neural genes in both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. All this suggests a conserved role of mir-2 in neural development and maintenance. However, further experiments {{are required to}} confirm this association.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} subsets of {{homeotic}} genes. They include {{many of the}} <b>Hox</b> and ParaHox <b>genes</b> that are important for segmentation. <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> are found in bilaterian animals, including Drosophila (in which they were first discovered) and humans. <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> are {{a subset of the}} homeobox <b>genes.</b> The <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> are often preserved across species, so some of the <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> of Drosophila are homologous to those in humans. In general, <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> play a role of regulating expression of genes as well as aiding in development and assignment of specific structures during embryonic growth. This can range from segmentation in Drosophila to central nervous system (CNS) development in vertebrates.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} all animals have such similar <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> {{strongly}} suggests that the last common ancestor of all bilaterians had similar <b>Hox</b> <b>genes.</b> This led to speculation that the evolution of <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> may have {{paved the way for}} the development of complex body forms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> are {{genes in}} humans that {{regulate}} body plan development. Humans have {{four sets of}} <b>Hox</b> <b>genes,</b> numbering 39 genes altogether, all of which aid in the differentiation of cells by location. <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> are activated early {{in the development of}} the embryo, in order to plan the development of the differing structures of the body. They also show colinearity with the body plan, meaning that the order of the <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> is similar to the expression levels of the <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> on the anterior-posterior axis. This colinearity allows for a spatial and temporal activation of genes in order to produce a proper body structure.|$|R
2500|$|There are a {{great many}} {{mutations}} that affect floral morphology, although the analysis of these mutants is a recent development. Supporting evidence {{for the existence of}} these mutations {{comes from the fact that}} a large number affect the identity of floral organs. For example, some organs develop in a location where others should develop. This is called homeotic mutation, which is analogous to <b>HOX</b> <b>gene</b> mutations found in Drosophila. In Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, the two taxa on which models are based, these mutations always affect adjacent verticils. This allows the characterization of three classes of mutation, according to which verticils are affected: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> {{also has}} been shown to play a part in the {{formation}} of the cranial motor nerves. The fate of a rhombomere {{has been shown to}} be affected by differential expression of the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene.</b> With mutations in the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene,</b> the cranial motor nerves formed in different locations than normal or simply did not form altogether. One possibility for this was that the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> was somehow involved in regionalization within the neural tube, and that expression of this particular gene correlated with the amount of migration that occurred. However, no correlation could be found. Many studies showed small amounts of correlation, but there were equal amounts showing a complete lack of correlation. The amount of correlation that occurred was not enough to draw a concrete conclusion from. This, however, could have happened because studies have only drawn data points from a limited window of time. Another possibility for this lack of correlation is that most studies were based on in situ hybridization, which only maps the location of transcripts rather than proteins. A third possibility is that studies focused on rhombomeres as landmarks, and therefore correlated expression domains to these. While studies were unable to show a relationship between closely related neurons from the rhombomeres and <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> expression, the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> is still an important factor when it comes to specification of the neuronal phenotype. The <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> was expressed rostrocaudally in the same sequence that was physically within the chromosome and its transcription was regulated by retinoic acid. The <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> has been identified in all vertebrates, and the number of Hox genes expressed increases as the vertebrate species diverge farther away from the invertebrate species. Certain neuron groups relate to <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> expression. At the r4 level, Hoxb1 is suspected to bestow rhombomere 4 cell identity.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{diseases}} {{that have been}} closely linked to <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> malfunctions, caused by genetic and epigenetic factors such as sequence mutations, overexpression, underexpression, and others. These diseases often involve missing or extra body parts like extra fingers, missing bones, missing auditory organs, limb deformations, etc. Some <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> defects have even been shown to cause early cancers. A full list of which genes cause which diseases {{can be seen in}} the reference [...] "Human <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> disorders" [...] by Quinonez.|$|E
40|$|Human <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> {{consist of}} 39 genes and encode {{transcription}} factors that function as master developmental regulators.

50|$|Cdx {{proteins}} are key regulators of <b>Hox</b> <b>genes.</b> The vertebrate Cdx proteins act upstream of <b>Hox</b> <b>genes.</b> Cdx genes {{integrate the}} posteriorizing signals from retinoic acid and Wnt canonical pathways and relay {{this information to}} Hox promoters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> {{and their}} {{associated}} microRNAs are highly conserved developmental master regulators with tight tissue-specific, spatiotemporal control. These genes {{are known to}} be dysregulated in several cancers and are often controlled by DNA methylation. The regulation of <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> is highly complex and involves reciprocal interactions, mostly inhibitory. Drosophila is known to use the Polycomb and Trithorax Complexes to maintain the expression of <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> after the down-regulation of the pair-rule and gap genes that occurs during larval development. Polycomb-group proteins can silence the <b>HOX</b> <b>genes</b> by modulation of chromatin structure.|$|R
50|$|When gene {{duplication}} occurs {{to produce a}} gene cluster, one or multiple genes may be duplicated at once. In {{the case of the}} <b>Hox</b> <b>gene,</b> a shared ancestral ProtoHox cluster was duplicated, resulting in genetic clusters in the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> as well as the ParaHox gene, an evolutionary sister complex of the <b>Hox</b> <b>gene.</b> It is unknown the exact number of genes contained in the duplicated Protohox cluster; however, models exist suggesting that the duplicated Protohox cluster originally contained four, three, or two genes.|$|E
50|$|The {{homeodomain}} protein motif {{is highly}} conserved across vast evolutionary distances. In addition, homeodomains of individual Hox proteins usually exhibit greater similarity to homeodomains in other species than to proteins encoded by adjacent genes {{within their own}} Hox cluster. These two observations led to the suggestions that <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> clusters evolved from a single <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> via tandem duplication and subsequent divergence and that a prototypic <b>Hox</b> <b>gene</b> cluster containing at least seven different Hox genes was present in the common ancestor of all bilaterian animals.|$|E

The mir-10a gene is located upstream of Hoxb4 and the mir-10b gene is located upstream of Hoxd4.

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{interest}} in analysing the molecular evolution of the Hox cluster using both bioinformatic and experimental approaches. The posterior <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> have been of particular interest to both groups of biologists for a number of reasons: they appear to be associated with the evolution of a number of morphological novelties; the protostomes appear to be have lost a highly-conserved and functionally important amino acid motif (the hexapeptide motif) from their posterior Hox genes; and deuterostome posterior <b>Hox</b> <b>genes</b> seem to be evolving more quickly than all other <b>Hox</b> <b>genes.</b> In this chapter I will discuss the last of these points.
