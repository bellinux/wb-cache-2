40|$|The use of <b>dilute</b> SC- 1 (NH 40 H:H 202 :H 20) {{chemistry}} cleaning {{processes for}} particle removal from silicon surfaces has been investigated. <b>Dilute</b> chemistries {{can be highly}} effective, especially when high- frequency acoustic energy (megasonics) is applied. The high particle removal efficacy of the <b>dilute</b> chemistry processes presumably arises due to increased double layer effects caused by reduced ionic strength. <b>Dilute</b> chemistry SC- I solutions exhibit somewhat reduced efficacy for removal of certain light organics; however, when <b>dilute</b> SC- 1 is used along with other pre-gate cleaning steps (e. g. HF, SC- 2, and piranha), then the overall cleaning sequence is quite effective. In addition to providing robust cleaning processes, <b>dilute</b> chemistries also result in significantly lower chemical and rinse water usage.

40|$|AbstractThree {{proteins}} {{have been}} described in humans and mice as being essential for even distribution, transport, and translocation of pigment granules, with defects in these molecules giving rise to lighter skin/coat color. The <b>dilute</b> phenotype in domestic cats affects both eumelanin and phaeomelanin pigment pathways; for example, black pigmentation combined with <b>dilute</b> appears gray and orange pigments appear cream. The <b>dilute</b> pigmentation segregates as a fully penetrant, autosomal recessive trait. We conducted classical linkage mapping with microsatellites in a large multigeneration pedigree of domestic cats and detected tight linkage for <b>dilute</b> on cat chromosome C 1 (θ= 0. 08, LOD= 10. 81). Fine-mapping identified a genomic region exhibiting conserved synteny to human chromosome 2, which included {{one of the three}} <b>dilute</b> candidate genes, melanophilin (MLPH). Sequence analysis in <b>dilute</b> cats identified a single base pair deletion in exon 2 of MLPH transcripts that introduces a stop codon 11 amino acids downstream, resulting in the truncation of the bulk of the MLPH protein. The occurrence of this homozygous variant in 97 unrelated <b>dilute</b> cats representing 26 cat breeds and random-bred cats, along with 89 unrelated wild-type cats representing 29 breeds and random-bred cats, supports the finding that <b>dilute</b> is caused by this single mutation in MLPH (p< 0. 00001). Single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses in <b>dilute</b> individuals identified a single haplotype in <b>dilute</b> cats, suggesting that a single mutation event in MLPH gave rise to <b>dilute</b> in domestic cats...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} land reclamation (drying, wetting, flushing, and leaching) on the change of soil chemical properties of acid sulphate soils from Kalimantan. Randomized Complete Design (RCD) by two factors treatments with two replications is used in this research. Factor I was soil reactiveness that is define as (a) low reactive= R 1; (b) moderate reactive =R 2; (c) strong reactive= R 3, and (d) very strong reactive= R 4 respectively. Factor II was drying, wetting, and <b>diluting</b> that is define as (1) drying continuously after wetting = W 1, (2) wetting continuously = W 2; (3) drying after weeting and <b>diluting</b> =W 3; and (4) wetting and <b>diluting.</b> The result of experiments show that continuous drying after wetting (W 1) and drying after wetting and <b>diluting</b> (W 3) or continuous weeting (W 2) gave soils pH lower than the weeting and <b>diluting</b> (W 4). Dried on the strong reactive soils (R 4) not decrease soil pH significantly. The continouos drying after wetting (W 1) can increase EC (electrical conductivity) higher than the continous wetting (W 2) and wetting that followed <b>diluting</b> (W 4) or drying after wetting and <b>diluting</b> (W 3). The continouos wetting (W 2) and the continouos drying after wetting (W 1) has given the total soluble acidity of 63, 30 dan 61, 71 cmolc kg- 1 respectively, higher than drying after wetting and <b>diluting</b> (W 3) and wetting thatfollowed <b>diluting</b> (W 4) that given total soluble acidity of 54, 03 and 51, 95 cmolc kg- 1 respectively. The effects of drying, wetting, flushing, and leaching on the total soluble acidity, Soluble Al and soluble H, especially on the strong reactive soils are very significant.

5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy.
