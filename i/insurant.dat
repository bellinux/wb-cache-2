40|$|Effectiveness of {{insurance}} protection is widely discussed in professional publications in Poland and abroad, {{but the question}} has not been definitively settled yet. It seems that insurance indemnification may be treated as natural consequence resulting from the character of services rendered by an insurance company. In this situation effectiveness comes into prominence, but the effectiveness should be measured {{from the point of}} the <b>insurant</b> and not the Insurer, because it is the <b>insurant</b> who learns, in the hard way, of the effectiveness {{of insurance}} protection when there is an insurance case. Both the insurer and the <b>insurant</b> are interested in the accomplishment of insurance protection as the chief objective, but that unanimity becomes problematic when partial goals are to be achieved. Therefore effectiveness of insurance protection should be evaluated by the insurant; measurement of effectiveness done by the insurer is of no use. All attempts of that kind are only a formalized approximation to realities. It seems that effectiveness of insurance protection can be defined as relation between indemnification and the loss provided several conditions that depend upon the insurer and, first of all, upon the <b>insurant</b> have been fulfilled. An indispensable but insufficient condition is payment of damages by the insurer in the right amount and in due time. If these conditions are fulfilled, only potential effectiveness of insurance protection is secured and {{it is up to the}} <b>insurant</b> to make the protection real. Much depends on how and to what extent he will use the indemnification to repair the damage, which is dependent upon his initiative, enterprise and professional qualifications as well as on the availability of the necessary materials and products in the market and the amount of an additional subvention and loan.

40|$|In this paper, {{equilibrium}} of the life/medical {{insurance market}} is analyzed under conditions where insurers demands that an <b>insurant</b> undergo genetic testing, {{on the assumption}} that the Human Genome Project will allow direct insight into the precise manner of operation of individual genes. Also, equilibrium in this instance is studied with attention given to the existence of an asymmetric structure of information between an <b>insurant</b> and insurers, even if the insurers are able to propose a contract based on knowledge of the results of genetic testing. The model described in this paper led to the conclusion that equilibrium can exist in any instance. In this paper, I also show that there exists equilibrium totally opposite to that shown as a result of adverse selection depending on change in the ratio of individuals undergoing genetic testing, and on the basis of such equilibrium I discuss the mechanism which causes "genetic discrimination" which is increasingly being regarded as a potential problem.

40|$|Background: In {{the past}} decades, health-care reforms have been {{implemented}} in several countries. A general aspect of most of these reforms is the shift from a supply-oriented system to a demand- oriented system. In several countries these reforms were based on introducing managed competition. In these systems of managed competition, insurers can selectively contract with health care providers or point out preferred providers. In {{order to make the}} system work, insurers should somehow channel their insured to these providers. In this study, we focused on insurants’ opinions on channelling by health insurers. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 1559 members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel and to 3418 members of the <b>Insurants</b> Panel in 2009. The questionnaire was returned by 1056 members of the Consumer Panel (response 68 %) and by 2223 members of the <b>Insurants</b> Panel (response 65 %). Among other things, opinions were asked on situations where insurers ask <b>insurants</b> to go to another health care provider. A discrete choice experiment was used to find out whether positive financial incentives could be effective in channelling <b>insurants</b> to preferred providers. Results: Results show that it depends on the type of care whether <b>insurants</b> are positive or negative about channelling by their insurer. Furthermore, financial incentives seem to be effective in stimulating <b>insurants</b> to go to preferred providers, only if the general practitioner (GP) does not have a preference for another provider and the distance to a preferred provider is not longer than the distance to the usual provider. Conclusions: This study shows that when there is a personal relationship with the health care provider, namely with a GP or dentist, people are less positive about channelling by health insurers. For drugs they are more positive. Furthermore, the GP {{plays an important role in}} choices patients make. Therefore, it is difficult for insurers to channel their <b>insurants</b> to preferred providers. Positive financial incentives can be effective, but the GP is still most important.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In Germany, {{hypertension}} has a {{prevalence of}} about 20 %. Cardiovascular {{morbidity and mortality}} are closely associated with hypertension. Therefore, antihypertensive medical treatment is of crucial importance. Currently, five groups of drugs for the medical treatment of hypertension are available: diuretics, beta-receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Besides medical considerations {{for the treatment of}} hypertension costs of treatment and other economic aspects become more and more important. Within this article, the antihypertensive treatment of <b>insurants</b> of the statutory health insurance and the private health insurance is compared with regard to the medical treatment and associated costs. METHODS: The analyzed data derive from the general practice morbidity research network CONTENT (CONTinuous morbidity registration Epidemiologic NeTwork). The implementation of this network is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) for a continuous registration of health-care utilization, morbidity, course of disease, and outcome parameters within primary care. RESULTS: Altogether 4, 842 patients from the participating general practitioners were regularly treated with antihypertensive drugs in 2007 and corresponding episodes were documented within electronic medical records. The proportion of <b>insurants</b> of the private health insurance was 7. 6 %. The costs of the antihypertensive medical treatment within the total sample in 2007 constituted 1. 03 million Euros overall and per patient on average 212. 82 Euros. Although the regarded sample of private health <b>insurants</b> was less morbid and the sum of defined daily doses (DDDs) within the observation period was notably lower (582. 6 vs. 703. 1; p < 0. 0001), the annual therapy costs of the private health <b>insurants</b> compared to the statutory health <b>insurants</b> were 35. 2 % higher (280. 29 Euros vs. 207. 29 Euros; p < 0. 0001). Hence, costs per DDD for antihypertensive medical treatment for private health <b>insurants</b> were 63. 2 % higher than for statutory health <b>insurants.</b> This refers to the great proportion of angiotensin II receptor blockers as well as the low proportion of generic drugs prescribed for private health <b>insurants.</b> CONCLUSION: Antihypertensive treatment with original drugs and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers is an expensive option. Based on the actual state of knowledge it must be questioned critically whether this constitutes a superior treatment option concerning the potential for lowering high blood pressure levels and organ protection...|$|R
40|$|Dementias are {{the most}} common {{psychiatric}} diseases in old age. Within {{a short period of time}} they lead into severe cognitive impairment, a loss in competences of daily living and therefore to a growing need of health care. Given the demographic development in Germany it has to be considered as essential to clarify health care provided to dementia patients and verify its accordance with dementia guidelines. This study examines the health care provision for people with dementia, based on routine data of a big German health insurance company. Furthermore, the provided care has been compared to applicable therapy guidelines. Three criteria have been used to identify demented people from a cohort of 74, 000 <b>insurants</b> aged 60 years and older: 1) Antidementive medication, 2) Dementia diagnosis during a hospital stay, 3) Dementia diagnosis for care services allocation. 4, 495 <b>insurants</b> with dementia have been identified via these criteria, which results in a dementia prevalence of 6. 1 % in the sample. Differences to elderly people without dementia are: higher mean age, higher rate of female <b>insurants,</b> higher mortality. The pharmacotherapy for most of the dementia patients consists in ginkgo biloba compounds. Only 11 % of all prescriptions are composed by AChE inhibitors and Memantin. A high percentage of <b>insurants</b> with dementia had only one or two antidementive prescriptions in the three year period examined. Every tenth dementia patient received antidepressive medication during the study period. Antipsychotics were prescribed much more often to <b>insurants</b> with dementia compared to other <b>insurants.</b> Nursing home residents with dementia received the highest amount of psycholeptic substances in the study. Compared to elder people without dementia, nearly twice the number of demented <b>insurants</b> was in need of care. Health care utilization in other sectors, e. g. clinical services, remedies and aids, is also higher in the dementia study group. Study participants with dementia generate total health care costs 1. 5 as much as elderly without dementia. In addition, costs for the dementia group increased within 3 years. The data base used in this study allows highly conservative prevalence conclusions. Health insurance routine data can be used to analyse provided health care in a differentiated way and indicates inappropriate or under-supply. The results of this study could be used to brief family practitioners about evidenced-based treatment and potentially inappropriate psychotropic medication of dementia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{contrast}} to the considerable body of literature concerning the disabilities of the general population, little information exists pertaining to the disabilities of the farm population. Focusing on the disability issue to the <b>insurants</b> in the Farmers' Health Insurance (FHI) program in Taiwan, this paper examines the associations among socio-demographic characteristics, insured factors, {{and the introduction of}} the national health insurance program, as well as the types and payments of disabilities among the <b>insurants.</b> Methods A unique dataset containing 1, 594, 439 <b>insurants</b> in 2008 was used in this research. A logistic regression model was estimated for the likelihood of received disability payments. By focusing on the recipients, a disability payment and a disability type equation were estimated using the ordinary least squares method and a multinomial logistic model, respectively, to investigate the effects of the exogenous factors on their received payments and the likelihood of having different types of disabilities. Results Age and different job categories are significantly associated with the likelihood of receiving disability payments. Compared to those under age 45, the likelihood is higher among recipients aged 85 and above (the odds ratio is 8. 04). Compared to hired workers, the odds ratios for self-employed and spouses of farm operators who were not members of farmers' associations are 0. 97 and 0. 85, respectively. In addition, older <b>insurants</b> {{are more likely to have}} eye problems; few differences in disability types are related to insured job categories. Conclusions Results indicate that older farmers are more likely to receive disability payments, but the likelihood is not much different among <b>insurants</b> of various job categories. Among all of the selected types of disability, a highest likelihood is found for eye disability. In addition, the introduction of the national health insurance program decreases the likelihood of receiving disability payments. The experience in Taiwan can be valuable for other countries that are in an initial stage to implement a universal health insurance program. </p...|$|R

In the medium term, we found cost savings in the outpatient sector, whereas in the long run, no statistically significant effects of screening on either health care cost component could be discerned. In summary, screening participation increases health care costs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{just-in-time}} (JIT) scheduling {{problems which}} minimize the earliness-tardiness penalty {{have been paid}} attention {{for many years and}} have intensive researches since they are applied in practical applications and involve exciting theoretical problems. For the former case, the main motivation comes from measuring the quality in inventory management and production management: an item should be produced only when it is required. In reality, the earliness penalty implies the loss caused by deterioration of goods, storage cost and <b>insurant</b> cost, while the tardiness penalty implies contract penalties, dissatisfaction of customers, loss of sales, loss of goodwill, etc. These scheduling problems can be modelized traditionally by using the mixed 0 - 1 integer linear programming (MILP) which is known as NP-hard problem. In this study, we try to give a better performance for solving one of these JIT scheduling problems. A new approach which reformulates MILP as a DC (difference of convex functions) program via an exact penalty technique is proposed.

Material and Methods: In this study, data was taken from a census in a cross-sectional study in which 263 patients with myocardial infarction cases who admitted to Hajar hospital heart care in 2013 to 2014. Gender, type of stroke, history of diabetes, previous history of hypertension, lipid disorders, history of heart disease, cardiac output fraction, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting and non-fasting blood sugar, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density cholesterol, smoking, type of treatment, the troponin enzymes and <b>insurant</b> type were considered as explanatory variables and occurrence of death and heart block were used as dependent variables. Bivariate logistic regression and neural network model was fitted. Both models were predicted and the accuracy of them were compared. Models were fitted by MATLAB 2013 a and Zelig in R 3. 2. 2. Results: Predictive accuracy of bivariate logistic regression model was 77. 7 % for the training and 78. 48 % for the test data.

40|$|In {{a context}} in which the social {{politics}} tend to become an optimization instrument for adapting the social security system to the market’s forces, and the talk of some analysts about reinventing the European social model, the partnership between the public sector and the private one in the social domain presumes, besides a tight collaboration, a combination of advantages specific to the private sector, more competitive and efficient, with the ones from the public sector, more responsible toward the society regarding the public money spending. The existence of the private health insurances cannot be tied, causally, to a social politics failure, reason for which they don’t intend, usually, to replace the public insurances, but rather, to offer a complementary alternative for them. In such a context, the public-private partnership’s goal regards both increasing the insurant’s satisfaction and increasing his/her access degree to services, and increasing the investments profitability made by the <b>insurant</b> and insurer. We are facing thus a mixed competitive system that combines the peculiarities of the public and private sectors. Interesting is the fact that, although the different meanings for the quality term may generate some problems regarding implementing quality management in the two health insurance sectors, the experts in the area reckon that establishing a good relationship between public buyers and private providers of healthcare can reduce the costs of public health programs. An essential condition for operating efficiently the partnership model is defining correctly the basic medical services packet financed by the public budget. Which doesn’t exclude the possibility of administrating by the private insurers, the sums of money gathered from the employees and employers contributions to the health fund, as a recently initiated project of law intends to do in Romania...|$|E

Occupational {{accidents}} and diseases {{are the most}} serious health problem for employees nowadays. Thousands of people die or disable every year due to occupational accidents. In addition, serious labour force and economic losses happens. Occupational Safety is very important issue to prevent these loses. Occupational {{accidents and}} diseases are more vital especially for countries which {{do not have enough}} hospitals and health workers as doctors and nurses. Everyday, tens of people visit hospitals due to simple or serious occupational accidents and diseases. Most of issues as injury, cancer, herniated disc and other health problems that requires physical terapy caused due to unsafe and unhealthy working conditions. As a matter of fact, many hospitals can not be able to supply enough health service under this patient traffic. As a result of this, quality of treatment and service to the patients decreseas. In addition, countries economy and companies could be under serious economic weight. Aside delays on work schedule, losing of qualified workers is a really economic problem. Also, after an occupational accident, working performance of other workers decreases spontaneously. Geomatics Engineering is very important not only for map production, but also for almost all Engineering works. There are many academic studies on occupational safety for construction, mining and naval architecturing sectors in literature. However, there is no sufficient academic studies found (in Literature search) for Geomatics Engineering which has a critical duty for all these sectors and also which has different types of occupational accidents. Based on this deficiency, occupational accidents, dangers and risks for Geomatics Engineers and their co-workers (survey team) are investigated in this thesis study. The study consists of three chapters. In introduction chapter, in general, the aim and contents of the study are indicated. Terms as employee, employer, deputy employer, <b>insurant,</b> working place, incident, accident, occupational accident, occupational disease, temporaray incapability of working, permanent incapability of working, occupational safety which are about the topic are explained. Then, importance of occupational safety is mentioned. Under the topic of importance of occupational safety, reasons of occupational accidents and costs of occupational accidents is provided. After that, historical process of occupational safety is mentioned. First attempts on occupational safety and developments in this topic both in the world and Turkey are explained. The activities of International Labour Organization (ILO) is also mentioned. Judicial procedure in Turkey is investigated for {{a better understanding of the}} topic. Effectuation dates of Occupational Safety and Health Code (in Turkey) which is published at 20. 06. 2012 are listed. The other laws (Labor Code, Obligations Code, Social Insurances and General Health Code, Turkish Criminal Code) which contain occupational safety matters are also mentioned. Regularities for complying to European Union explained and information about occupational health and safety management systems are given. OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Assesment Series) is introduced. Components of a succesful management system as generel essentials, occupational safety policy, planning, application and running, control and corrective activities, revising of administration are summarized. In the second chapter, definition of risk is given and general risk factors are indicated. These factors are specified as; based on physical work area, based on workers behaviors, based on organizing types of work, based on management systems. Risk assessment in Turkish laws is indicated. Risk management on occupational safety and health is explained. Also, benefits of risk management and risk management process are explained and illustrated on table. Risk management process are explained under 7 stages. These are; “determining of dangers”, “risk analyzing”, “assesment of risks”, “determining of control precautions”, “execution of control precautions”, “monitoring and revision”, “communication and solidatory”. In chapter three, occupational safety in Geomatics Engineering is investigated in two main topics as Field Works and Office Works. On Field Works, it is stated that tehere can be many differnet types of risks and dangers can be faced by survey team. However, there are some risks and dangers which were already faced by survey teams before. To generalize and summarize these, some main risks and dangers as “falling down-sliping-descending”, “stone-rock-land sliping”, “dust infection to eyes”, “nail-thorn pricking”, “electricity-lightning pound”, “explosion and burning”, “botulism”, “animal attacks”, “getting lost”, “sun stroke”, “freezing or burning due to weather conditions”, “radiation”, “cronical joints aches”, “people threats-attacks” are indicated. There are many geomatics engineers who work in engineering projects. Most of these projects are construction projects. To analyze risks and dangers more accurately, these projects are classified as “superstructure works”, “infrastructure works” and “transportation works”. Some statistical data about occupational accidents and deaths in building constructions, channel constructions and highway constructions are showed in tables. Furthermore, mining measurements and hydrographic measurements also investigated as uniqe works in Geomatics Engineering. Mostly observed occupational accidents in superstructure works (buildings, shopping centers, skyscrappers, public buildings, hotels, airports etc.) are shown as “falling down of workers due to the height of structure”, “material falling”, “material spattering (nail etc.) ”. Mechanical construction devices are also stated as another serious risk factor for survey team in these works. Some superstructure projects such as airport projects are worked as skift (7 days 24 hours). In these works, to make measurement under darkness is also indicated as increasing factor of all risks and dangers for survey team. It is indicated that in infrastructure works such as “channel construction”, “power plants (electricity, natural gas) ”, “sewage construction”, the most frequently faced occupational accident is “falling and sliping of edge of excavation area”. “Sliping of stone and earth” is also specified as the other dangereous and often faced risk for survey team. Also some wrong and correct infrastructure works are illustrated with pictures. Transportation works (motorways, bridges, viaducts, underpasses, overpasses, tunnels, railways etc.) are defined as the most exhaustive works for Geomatics Engineers due to long distance of routes and different types of works. In transportation works there are different types of construction teams (earthwork, structures, drainage, paving, finishing) which work in same area simultaneously. As a result of this tempo, many different occupational accidents happens. According to statistics the most observed occupational accident is based on mechanical construction devices. This problem examplified especially for device operators carelessness while working. Because of their concentration, they can forget survey team who makes measurements in same area. As a result of this, many occupational accidents can be faced. Traffic accidents in construction area are also indicated as other most frequently faced accidents in transportation works. Traffic is also stated as the most important risk for survey team who makes “Deformation Measurements (Settlement Readings) ” of structures which requires serious concantration. Spattering of materials as nails also considered among remarkable risks for survey team. In tunnel works, beside ordinary risks for all workers some uniqe risks and accidents also mentioned. Mining measurements are one of the most dangerous works for Geomatics Engineers and survey team. Mining measurements are investigated as “open mines (overground) ” and “closed mines (underground) ”. Working in open mines contains risks and dangers similar to infrastructure works and excavation works. Working in closed mines has risks and dangers similar to tunnel works. The most dangerous accident is stated as earth collapsing in these mines. Psychological factors of working underground without sufficient air and illumination are also indicated as other risks for survey team. Harmful gases and dust density can be assumed as plus risks for both open and closed mines. Occupational safety in hydrographic measurements is investigated in two sub-topics as “bathymetry” and “diving”. Electrical shock and boat accidents are mentioned as risks for bathymetry stage while suffocating is stated as main risk in diving stage due to different reasons. Finally, importance of Ergonomics is emphasized for Office Works and requirements of ergonomic designed working is explained and also illustrated with figures. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

The goal {{of this paper is}} to reveal pure mathematical aspects of insurance processes and to analyze these aspects by pure mathematical methods, including application of the theorem. Its most significant result: when uncertainty increases, then taking the theorem into account may reverse <b>insurant’s</b> and insurer’s decisions to the opposite ones. ...|$|R
40|$|The capital-funded health {{insurance}} system in Germany (the PKV) is afflicted {{with a lack}} of competition because <b>insurants</b> lose their ageing provisions if they switch their insurer. Therefore the transfer of „individual ageing provisions″ has been discussed for many years, but it is mostly regarded as impracticable due to information and incentive problems. In this article a transfer mechanism based consequently on the risk allocation in the PKV is derived. This mechanism can solve the information and incentive problems linked with the transfer of ageing provisions. The result is that the PKV can be extended to a very attractive model to organize {{health insurance}} markets.

40|$|Using {{administrative}} panel data {{of health}} <b>insurants,</b> we estimate {{the effects of}} low birth weight on health service utilization among {{children and young adults}} between birth and 21 years old. To account for time-invariant heterogeneity of mothers, we use sibling fixed- effects estimation. We find that low birth weight strongly increases subsequent health expenditures and that the effect is particularly pronounced {{in the first year of}} life. Starting in compulsory schooling, we observe a shift in expenditures to mental-health problems. Whereas the effects on physical health disappear over time, we provide evidence that mental-health problems prevail until early adulthood. We therefore suggest a screening program tailored to the conditions more likely to be contracted by low-birth-weight children in order to mitigate the negative health consequences...|$|R
40|$|Background—-Stroke and {{dementia}} are {{the major}} causes for long-term care (LTC) dependence in old age. This intervention trial compared a multidomain prevention program for stroke and dementia with usual medical care in reducing the need for LTC. Methods and Results—-The Intervention Project on Cerebrovascular Disease and Dementia in the District of Ebersberg (INVADE) was a general practice–based 8 -year trial in 2 defined catchment areas in Upper Bavaria, Germany. All 11 317 <b>insurants</b> of a statutory health insurance plan who were ≥ 55 {{years of age and}} lived in the intervention district were offered the opportunity to participate in a prevention program; 3908 enrolled. The 13 301 <b>insurants</b> in the reference district received usual medical care. The intervention consisted of the systematic identification and evidence-based treatment of vascular risk factors. The primary clinical end point was incidence of LTC dependence according to external assessment by a special medical service in the framework of the statutory German LTC insurance. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates from the reference district were used to calculate the expected number of cases of LTC dependence under usual medical care. The expected number was compared with the observed number of cases in the intervention district. Analysis was by intention to treat. During the 5 years after completion of the recruitment period, significantly fewer incident cases of LTC dependence arose in the intervention district than expected (χ 2 = 13. 25; P< 0. 001). In women, the incidence was reduced by 10 % (P< 0. 01). In men, the incidence was reduced by 9. 6 % (P< 0. 05). Conclusions—-Our results support the feasibility and effectiveness of a primary care prevention program for stroke and dementia {{to reduce the risk of}} developing LTC dependence...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Data on {{administrative}} prevalence, types {{of treatment and}} disease costs of patients diagnosed with somatoform pain disorder (according to ICD 10) in Germany were not previously available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed health insurance data from 2008 - 2010 of 8. 5  million people of the German statutory health insurance company BARMER GEK {{on administrative}} prevalence of <b>insurants</b> {{with at least one}} billing code F 45. 4 x in 2009 and at least one second billing code F 45. 4 x in the time period 2008 - 2010 stratified by age and gender, different professions being involved in treatment, diagnostics and treatment methods applied. The types and costs of out-patient treatment and of in-patient treatment in case of any discharge with diagnosis of F 45. 4 were analysed.

40|$|Insurance {{offices are}} {{directly}} interested in {{reduction of the}} number and extend of haphazard damages because they have influence on the financial results of insurance business. Therefore insurers apply different technical insurance measures to counteract haphazard damages. The offices carry on also preventive activities connected with certain financial expenditure. As a rule the state puts them under obligation to do so because insurance activities are kept under state control. Imposing obligation of preventive activity on insurance offices the state is positive that insurers who liquidate damages and investigate their causes are particularly predestinated {{to take part in}} effective preventing losses. Another reason for the participation of insurance offices in preventive activity is the conviction that to some extent insurance protection affects unfavourably the preventive attitudes of the <b>insurants</b> and may add to the so called subjective risks. The purpose of insurance prevention is to offset that influence of insurance.

40|$|Many {{models of}} reality are probabilistic. For example, not {{everyone}} orders crisps with their beer, but {{a certain percentage}} does. Inferring such probabilistic knowledge from databases {{is one of the}} major challenges for data mining. Recently Agrawal et al. [1] investigated a class of such problems. In this paper a new class of such problems is investigated, viz., inferring risk-profiles. The proto-typical example of this class is: "what is the probability that a given policy-holder will file a claim with the insurance company in the next year". A risk-profile is then a description of a group of <b>insurants</b> that have the same probability for filing a claim. It is shown in this paper that homogeneous descriptions are the most plausible risk-profiles. Moreover, under modest assumptions it is shown that covers of such homogeneous descriptions are essentially unique. A direct consequence of this result is that it suffices to search for the homogeneous description with the highest ass [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{effectiveness}} of a secondary prevention program for patients suffering from chronic heart failure (CHF) was evaluated. Purpose The program aimed at improving participants’ perceived health and actual physical symptoms. <b>Insurants</b> of a German health insurance company participated in a telephone counseling program with four modules focusing on dietary habits, physical activity, fluid intake, and medication compliance. Method Multilevel {{analyses were conducted to}} analyze changes in health related outcome variables over time in N[*]=[*] 259 participants who completed the program in about 6 months. Results The results showed an improvement of perceived health status, physical symptoms, and somatic impairment. Furthermore, differential change was found when comparing “finishers” compared to “non-finishers” of specific modules indicating specific module effects. Conclusion The results are auspicious and, if sustained, are expected to bring about long-term health benefits for our study’s participants.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationships}} between annual and subannual inequality and mobility {{during the course of}} the year. We apply an exact decomposition framework as outlined in Wodon and Yitzhaki (Econ Bull 4 : 12 ̆ 0138, 2003), and in Yitzhaki and Wodon (Research on Economic Inequality 12 : 1792 ̆ 013199, 2004). Earnings records of pension <b>insurants</b> in Germany serve as the database. The long time horizon of our database allows us to investigate the stability and robustness of the parameters of the decomposition over time. Specifically, we show that the mobility component of the decomposition, as measured by Gini correlation coefficients, changes over the observation period. This makes it difficult to predict the impact of the income accounting period on inequality in a more general context. Thus, it is of paramount importance to use income data from a uniform accounting period in distributional analyses. The final publication is available at www. springerlink. com: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{authors have}} {{reported}} {{about the high}} prevalence rates of self-reported back pain in children. Nevertheless, {{little is known about}} the diagnosis of back disorders - regardless of whether the diagnosis is associated with back pain or not. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence rates and costs of diagnosis of back disorders in childhood and youth. Methods We conducted a secondary data analysis of a large, population based German data set (2, 300, 980 <b>insurants</b> of statutory health insurance funds) which allowed for identification of prevalence rates of diagnoses of back disorders in children (age group 0 - 14 years) and youths (age group 15 - 24 years) using three digit ICD- 10 codes for dorsopathies (M 40 - M 54 : kyphosis and lordosis; scoliosis; spinal osteochondrosis; other deforming dorsopathies; ankylosing spondylitis; other inflammatory spondylopathies; spondylosis; other spondylopathies; spondylopathies in diseases classified elsewhere; cervical disc disorders; other intervertebral disc disorders; other dorsopathies, not elsewhere classified; dorsalgia). Direct treatment costs were calculated based on the real incurred costs for cases with a singular diagnosis of a back disorder. Wherever possible, the results of the random sample were extrapolated to all <b>insurants</b> of statutory health insurance funds (i. e., about 90 % of the German population). Results We found prevalence rates for the diagnosis of back disorders to range between 0. 01 - 12. 5 %. "Scoliosis" (M 41) and "dorsalgia" (M 54) were the most frequent diagnoses in both age groups. Based on these results, it was calculated that in 2002 alone, approximately 1. 4 million children/youths in Germany were diagnosed with "dorsalgia" (M 54), and that the direct costs for back disorders in childhood and youth accounted for at least 100 million Euros. Conclusions Instead of focusing on the individual, and self-reported disorder or disability, this analysis allowed for the detailed evaluation of medical experts' opinion on back disorders in childhood and youth and for a more objective or public health oriented insight in the topic of diagnosis of back pain and other back disorders. However, due to the methodological limitations by using ICD- 10 coding, standardized random validity checks of population based data sets should be mandatory. </p...|$|R

40|$|Late life {{depression}} is common and associated with inadequate recognition and treatment. As of today no evidence based guidelines for detection {{and treatment of}} depressive syndromes in the elderly were published in Germany. Considering the demographic change there are strong indications that the prevalence of late life depression will increase. Therefore, an adequate treatment {{will be a great}} challenge for society in the future. Evidence on health care provision of late life {{depression is}} based upon health insurance data. At first provision of healthcare associated with depressive disorders in the elderly is analyzed. Second a comparative analysis of health care utilization by depressed to non- depressed elderly insured is being accomplished. Health care provision for elderly (60 + years) with depressive disorders of different levels of severity is being analyzed, based on health insurance data of a major German health insurance. Three groups (with mild depressiv symptoms (N= 8. 303); manifest depressive syndromes (N= 4. 021); with severe depressive syndromes (N= 340) were identified among a cohort of 73. 173 <b>insurants</b> over a period of three years. Psychotropic medications were analyzed by age and gender to detect, wether they were consistent with evidenced based treatment guidelines or whether they were potentially inappropriate. The focus is on potentially inappropriate treatment with tricyclica and several SSRIs and guideline compliant treatment with other antidepressants and SSRI. Utiliziation of services among insured with and without depressive syndromes focuses on inpatient services and medication. Two third of the insured were 60 to 69 years of age, one out of ten is of old aged, and two thirds are female. 75 % of all <b>insurants</b> over and above the age of sixty are treated with tricylcica and therefore receive incorrect medication. Obviously, this inadequate medication with amitriptyline and doxepin is still the preferential treatment for late life depression. Women are treated with potentially inadequate medications like amitriptyline and doxepine more often than men. Almost every second depressed participant receive citalopram being the treatment recommended by the guidelines. In this study, old people with depressive disorders generate twice as much total health care costs as elderly without any depressive syndrome. Middle aged people cause particularly high healthcare costs. In general men clearly cause higher total health care costs then women. The results of this study could be used to develop information material for family practicioners about guideline conforming treatment and potentially inappropriate psychotropic medication of late life depression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Diabetic {{patients}} {{may have a}} higher risk of gastric cancer. However, whether they have a higher incidence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication is not known. Furthermore, whether insulin use in patients with type 2 diabetes may be associated with a higher incidence of HP eradication has not been investigated. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study. The reimbursement databases from 1996 to 2005 of 1 million <b>insurants</b> of the National Health Insurance in Taiwan were retrieved. After excluding those aged Results In 2005, there were 10, 051 incident cases receiving HP eradication. HP eradication was significantly increased with age, male sex, diabetes status, insulin use, use of calcium channel blocker, panendoscopic examination, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, nephropathy, ischemic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease. Significant differences were also seen for occupation and living region. Medications including statin, fibrate, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and oral anti-diabetic agents were not associated with HP eradication. The adjusted odds ratios for diabetes, insulin use and use of calcium channel blocker was 1. 133 (1. 074, 1. 195), 1. 414 (1. 228, 1. 629) and 1. 147 (1. 074, 1. 225), respectively. Conclusions Type 2 diabetes and insulin use in the diabetic patients are significantly associated with a higher incidence of HP eradication. Additionally, use of calcium channel blocker also shows a significant association with HP eradication. </p...|$|R

The coalition government in Germany (1998 - 2005) of the social democrats and the greens instituted several healthcare reform measures marking a paradigm shift and thus setting the direction of reform for subsequent governments’ healthcare politics. Agreeing with governmentality studies perspectives on recent transformations of govern-ing western democracies that have been analysed as ambiguously offering new opportuni-ties (= more freedom) and bringing new disciplinary measures (= more force), it can be shown that many measures are geared towards the activation and responsibilisation of <b>insurants.</b> In doing so, they produce {{what we call a}} “healthcare self”. This is characterised by a feeling of personal responsibility for one’s health, knowledge of options to obtain health, a high degree of reflexivity in health issues and willingness to pay for healthcare costs, because they are seen as an investment in one’s own prosperity. This is founded in a moral discourse and an institutional restructuring, which we consider a sign for a basic metamorphosis of the concept of the state into what we call a new state arrangement...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the prevalence and cost of illness of asthma in Germany by retrospectively analysing routine health insurance data. This analysis investigated claims data from all insured persons of six large sickness funds. <b>Insurants</b> with asthma were identified via the International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision) diagnosis and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System Code for regular medication prescriptions. Costs for hospital care, medication and sick benefit were taken from claims data. Costs for rehabilitation, premature death and early retirement were estimated using the human capital approach and data from national statistics. Prevalence of asthma in the German statutory health insurance was 6. 34 %. Total costs for asthma, including direct and indirect costs, were calculated at J 2. 74 billion during 1999. The prevalence of asthma in the German statutory health insurance has previously been estimated to be 4 – 6 %. The results of this large study show the prevalence of asthma in the German social insurance system to be, 6 %. The study also indicates that there is room for substantial savings in the German social insurance system, with indirect costs amounting to 74. 8 % of total costs and payment of sick benefits through the sickness funds amounting to 58. 3 % of indirect costs. These costs may be reduced with better asthma control in patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we use {{feed forward}} neural {{networks}} with the back-propagation algorithm to build decision models for five insurances including life, annuity, health, accident, and investment-oriented insurances. Six features (variables) {{were selected for}} the inputs of the neural networks including age, sex, annual income, educational level, occupation, and risk preference. Three hundred <b>insurants</b> from an insurance company in Taiwan were used as examples for establishing the decision models. Six experiments were conducted in this study. These experiments were mainly categorized into two phases: Phase 1 (Experiments 1 to 3) and Phase 2 (Experiments 4 to 6). In Phase 1, we used the six features as the inputs of the neural networks. In Phase 2, we employed the factor analysis method to select three more important features from the six features. In Phase 1, Experiment 1 used a single neural network to classify the five insurances simultaneously while Experimental 2 utilized five neural networks to classify them independently. Experiments 1 and 2 adopted the purchase records of primary and additional insurances as experimental data. Experiment 3, however, utilized the primary insurance purchase dada only. In Phase 2, we repeated the similar experimental procedure as Phase 1. We also applied statistical methods to test the differences of the classification results between Phases 1 and 2.
