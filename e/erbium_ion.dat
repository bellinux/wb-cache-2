2500|$|Although the {{electronic}} transitions of an isolated ion {{are very well}} defined, broadening of the energy levels occurs when the ions are incorporated into {{the glass of the}} optical fiber and thus the amplification window is also broadened. [...] This broadening is both homogeneous (all ions exhibit the same broadened spectrum) and inhomogeneous (different ions in different glass locations exhibit different spectra). Homogeneous broadening arises from the interactions with phonons of the glass, while inhomogeneous broadening is caused by differences in the glass sites where different ions are hosted. Different sites expose ions to different local electric fields, which shifts the energy levels via the Stark effect. In addition, the Stark effect also removes the degeneracy of energy states having the same total angular momentum (specified by the quantum number J). Thus, for example, the trivalent <b>erbium</b> <b>ion</b> (Er+3) has a ground state with J = 15/2, and in the presence of an electric field splits into J + 1/2 = 8 sublevels with slightly different energies. The first excited state has J = 13/2 and therefore a Stark manifold with 7 sublevels. Transitions from the J = 13/2 excited state to the J= 15/2 ground state are responsible for the gain at 1.5µm wavelength.

40|$|M. Phil. This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} design and experimental realization of an all-optical active Q-switched Erbium-doped fibre ring laser. The aim {{of this research is}} to propose an approach of Q-switching mechanism for a fibre laser. The Q-switch device combines a fibre Bragg grating and a tunable fibre Fabry-Perot filter. The Q-switching principle is based on dynamic spectral overlapping of two filters, namely FBG based filter and tunable F-P filter. When the spectra overlap, the filter system has the maximum transparency, the laser cavity has minimal losses and it can release the stored power {{in the form of the}} giant impulse. A series of experiments are performed to optimize the all-optical active Q-switched Erbium-doped ring laser system in term of output peak power and time duration of laser pulses. Two different Erbium-doped fibres having different <b>Erbium</b> <b>ion</b> concentration are used in this experimental investigation. The first fibre, with an <b>Erbium</b> <b>ion</b> concentration of 2200 ppm and pump absorption of 23. 4 at 980 nm is referred to as “high concentration” and the second with an <b>Erbium</b> <b>ion</b> concentration of 960 ppm and pump absorption of 12. 4 at 980 nm is referred to as “low concentration” To optimize the Q-switched fibre laser system, different parameters were investigated such as the length of the Erbium-doped fibre, the output coupling ratio, the repetition rate of pulses and the concentration of the Erbium Doped Fibres. The achieved output laser pulse characteristics, peak power and time duration, were 580 mW and 13 μs respectively, at 1 kHz of repetition rate. These characteristics were obtained using a length of 3. 5 m “low concentration” Erbium-doped fibre in a ring laser cavity; the output coupling is 90 %, for a pump power of 80 mW.

The effects of emission wavelength, total intracavity loss, <b>erbium</b> <b>ion</b> clustering, output coupling ratio, and active fiber length are investigated. A comprehensive theoretical model based on a two-level laser model with consideration of pair-induced quenching is proposed. To achieve good performance in an EDFRL, especially for a widely tunable bandwidth of over 100 nm and high slope efficiency, numerical results, which are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental results, indicate that minimization of the intracavity loss as well as optimization of the active fiber length and the output coupling ratio are very important.
