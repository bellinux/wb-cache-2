5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E

25|$|Indeed <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> that maqam Rast is a {{very basic}} scale in Arabian music, {{comparable}} to C-Major in western music. For western listeners this tonality – approximately the Dorian scale with quartertone intervals – is anything else but catchy. In Shadd Araban it {{is the use of}} two 1½ intervals, that makes the scale abstractly sounding for western ears.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} scholarly {{discussion of}} sati, whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> or wrong, {{is found in}} the Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century. The earliest known commentary on sati by Medhatithi of Kashmir argues that sati is a form of suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition. Vijnanesvara, of the 12th-century Chalukya court, and the 13th-century Madhvacharya, argue that sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures. They offer a combination of reasons, both in favor and against sati.|$|E

Legally speaking, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> to conclude that the British-Dutch Treaty 1824 and other treaties entered with any other parties by the British or the Dutch without the consent and approval of the Malay Rulers in their respective jurisdiction were invalid.|$|E

Recruits had to be physically fit and meet the traditional minimum height requirement of 6 Roman feet (5ft 10in, 175cm) until 367, when it was reduced to 5 Roman feet and 3 Roman palms (5ft 7in, 167cm). Vegetius hints that in the very late Empire (ca. AD 400) even this [...] height requirement may have been relaxed, for [...] "... if necessity demands, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> to take account {{not so much of}} stature as of strength.

500|$|Etty's {{painting}} {{is not a}} direct illustration of a scene from Comus. Instead, it is inspired by an early passage in which Comus, prior to his meeting with The Lady, muses {{on the notion that}} sin is only problematic if others become aware of it, and thus that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and natural to surrender to base desires while under cover of darkness, arguing that [...] "What hath night to do with sleep? Night hath better sweets to prove, Venus now wakes, and wakens Love". Etty's painting shows the nude Venus, as [...] "Goddess of nocturnal sport", reaching across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty had built his reputation on his renowned ability to paint realistic human figures, Venus in The Dawn of Love is highly stylised, and painted in a deliberate pastiche of the style of Rubens.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall later {{described}} his membership of these openly Neo-Nazi groups as a [...] "youthful indiscretion". He expressed {{the view that}} while he regretted his involvement in them, he was not ashamed of having done so: [...] "though some of my former beliefs were mistaken, I will never acknowledge that there was anything dishonourable about holding them." [...] As leader of the NF he continued to openly approve of Hitler's social and economic program and well as his policies of German territorial expansion. In his 1988 autobiography The Eleventh Hour, he stated that while he thought that [...] "many of [...] intentions were good ones {{and many of his}} achievements admirable", he did not think [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for a British movement belonging to an entirely different phase of history to model itself on the movement of Hitler".|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E

500|$|Philip Tilden, Churchill's architect, {{began work}} on the house in 1922 and the Churchills rented a {{farmhouse}} near Westerham, Churchill frequently visiting the site to observe progress. The two-year building programme, the ever-rising costs, which escalated from the initial estimate of £7,000 to over £18,000, {{and a series of}} construction difficulties, particularly relating to damp, soured relations between architect and client, and by 1924 Churchill and Tilden were barely on speaking terms. Legal arguments, conducted through their respective lawyers, rumbled on until 1927. Clementine's anxieties about the costs, both of building and subsequently living at Chartwell also continued. In September 1923 Churchill wrote to her, [...] "My beloved, I beg you not to worry about money, or to feel insecure. Chartwell is to be our home (and) we must endeavour to live there for many years." [...] Churchill finally moved into the house in April 1924, a letter dated 17 April of that year to Clementine begins, [...] "This is the first letter I have ever written from this place, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> that it should be to you".|$|E
500|$|Scholar Andrea Loewenstein {{published}} the first in-depth review of Bannon's books in 1980, and notes {{that they were}} [...] "exceptionally good pulp" [...] that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness or anger among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published. Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as self-destructive, closeted, paranoid, and alcoholic. Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 {{had a tendency to}} reject that kind of reality in Bannon's stories. [...] "Since much of our past is so bitter, ... pretend away our most recent history". Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself. When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in Odd Girl Out while simultaneously questioning if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> Loewenstein states [...] "one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon, questioning her own right to happiness". Similarly, remarking on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in Women in the Shadows by making her violent, alcoholic and self-destructive, Loewenstein notes, [...] "she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear". Loewenstein remarks Bannon's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they feel are morally wrong, and they are acting out cycles of self-hatred, though what remains at the end is [...] "surprisingly... passionate, tender, and erotic".|$|E
