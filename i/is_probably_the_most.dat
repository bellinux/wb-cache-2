5|$|Hexachloroplatinic acid {{mentioned}} above <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important platinum compound, as {{it serves as}} the precursor for many other platinum compounds. By itself, it has various applications in photography, zinc etchings, indelible ink, plating, mirrors, porcelain coloring, and as a catalyst.|$|E

5|$|AlCl3 <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{commonly}} used Lewis acid and {{also one of}} the most powerful. It finds application in the chemical industry as a catalyst for Friedel–Crafts reactions, both acylations and alkylations. Important products are detergents and ethylbenzene. It also finds use in polymerization and isomerization reactions of hydrocarbons.|$|E

5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which {{have one of}} the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel was {{discovered}} by Harry Brearley in 1912, at the Brown Firth Laboratories in Sheffield. His successor as manager at Brown Firth, Dr William Hatfield, continued Brealey's work. In 1924 he patented '18-8 stainless steel', which to this day <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common alloy of this type.|$|E
5|$|The A center <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common {{defect in}} natural diamonds. It {{consists}} of a neutral nearest-neighbor pair of nitrogen atoms substituting for the carbon atoms. The A center produces UV absorption threshold at ~4 eV (310 nm, i.e. invisible to eye) and thus causes no coloration. Diamond containing nitrogen predominantly in the A form as classed as type IaA.|$|E

5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis is {{becoming}} popular with ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt Coire na h-Urcaire) {{just to the}} North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but {{most if not all}} of the easier gullies on the North Face have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into Coire Leis. No 4 gully <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> skied. Although Tower scoop makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully {{is becoming}} popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{are found}} on every {{continent}} except Antarctica. In {{contrast to the}} damselflies (Zygoptera), which tend to have restricted distributions, some genera and species are found across continents. For example, the blue-eyed darner Rhionaeschna multicolor is found all across North America, and in Central America; emperors Anax are found throughout the Americas from {{as far north as}} Newfoundland to as far south as Bahia Blanca in Argentina, across Europe to central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. The globe skimmer Pantala flavescens <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> widespread dragonfly species in the world; it is cosmopolitan, occurring on all continents in the warmer regions. Most Anisoptera species are tropical, with far fewer species in temperate regions.|$|E

5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{by either}} asexual or sexual means. Parts of the coral may get {{detached}} from the colony by a storm or other means, {{and some of these}} fragments may end up in suitable locations to grow into new colonies which will be genetically identical to the parent colony. This fragmentation <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent method of reproduction. Alternatively, certain pores called ampullae contain polyps that bud off short-lived, jellyfish-like medusae, which separate from the colony. They produce gametes which, after fertilisation, develop into planula larvae. These drift with the currents as part of the zooplankton before settling out and developing into new colonies.|$|E
5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. This <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E

5|$|Treasure Trap, {{formed in}} 1982 at Peckforton Castle, {{was the first}} {{recorded}} LARP game in the UK and influenced the fantasy LARPs that followed there. The first recorded LARP in Australia was run in 1983, using the science fiction Traveller setting. In 1993, White Wolf Publishing released Mind's Eye Theatre, which is still played internationally and <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> commercially successful published LARP. The first German events were in about 1994 (other sources claim 1992 or 1991), with fantasy LARP in particular growing quickly there, so that since 2001, two major German events have been run annually that have between 3000 and 7000 players each and attract players from around Europe.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{her family}} {{connections}} and high-profile militant action, Margaret Mackworth, the 2nd Viscountess Rhondda, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> well-known Welsh suffragette. Her mother Sybil Thomas and Merthyr Ironmaster's wife, Rose Mary Crawshay, were both well connected suffragists whose work is well documented. Millicent Mackenzie {{and to a lesser}} extent Amy Dillwyn are remembered more for connections outside the sphere of women's suffrage, but were both important Welsh activists for the cause. The majority of suffragists either working in Wales or Welsh suffragists who were active outside the country are many but poorly documented. Alice Abadam, a renowned speaker and activist, was the daughter of the High Sherriff of Carmarthenshire. She later became the chairperson of the Federated Council of Suffrage Movements. Rachel Barrett, a science teacher from south Wales, rose to prominence within the WSPU and was chosen by Annie Kenney to assist in running the WSPU national campaign from 1912. She was also assistant editor of The Suffragette.|$|E
5|$|P.acicularis <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{abundant}} {{species of}} the genus. Most specimens have been found {{on the west coast}} of North America as far north as Alaska, but it has been reported most frequently from British Columbia and Washington. The species is found in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has also been reported from the Russian arctic. In general, P.acicularis seems to prefer an oceanic climate without extremely low temperatures, at least in comparison with other {{species of the}} genus. This assumption is supported by the fact that P.acicularis is found more southerly (34 findings in California) than all other species and is less frequently found in northern Alaska where, for example, P.robustus and P.vegae are more common. P.acicularis is rare east of the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
