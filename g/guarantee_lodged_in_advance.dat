The revue provided Jones with a comfortable income, reportedly in excess of $20,000 per year. She led the company with reassurance of a forty-week season that would give her a sustainable income, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>lodging</b> <b>in</b> a well-appointed and stylish Pullman car, and the ability to sing opera and operetta excerpts in the final section of the show. This allowed Jones to be the highest paid African American performer of her time.

For more than two decades, Jones remained the star of the Famous Troubadours, while they graciously toured every season and established their popularity in the principal cities of the United States and Canada. Although their eventual fame and international tours collected many audiences, they began with a “free-for-all” variety production with plenty of “low” comedy, song and dance, and no pretense of a coherent story line.|$|R
