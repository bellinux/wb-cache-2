25|$|Romanov was {{the owner}} of the Lithuanian Premier League {{basketball}} club and Euroleague participant BC Žalgiris since May 2009. He made numerous controversial decisions including firing head coaches one by one, first Ramūnas Butautas, and more famously firing head coach Darius Maskoliūnas in the middle of LKL finals series, players had to draw their own tactic schemes and making substitutions, which resulted in losses to the rivals Lietuvos Rytas in decisive games. He also had famous feud with Lietuvos Rytas owners Jonas Vainauskas and Gedvydas Vainauskas, exchanging letters with insults between them. Žalgiris did win the BBL championship, and had a good showing in the Euroleague, nearly making the Top8 phase. Before 2010–11 season started, Zalgiris have purchased several high profile players and a new head coach. In {{the first half of the}} season Zalgiris was consistent, which led to impressive victories in all tournaments. After a positive start that hadn't been seen for years, Vladimir Romanov once again shocked the entire country by firing head coach Aco Petrovic, who was replaced by Elias Zouros, which resulted in a series of losses and Mirza Begić's decision to leave the team. This time, however, Žalgiris won back the LKL championship, as well as the LKF Cup, beating Lietuvos Rytas each time, as well as defeating VEF Rīga in the BBL finals. During the 2011–12 season, Romanov fired two other Žalgiris coaches – head coach Elias Zouros and his assistant coach. The new coach, Aleksandar Trifunović, former longtime head coach of Lietuvos Rytas, became Romanov's favorite, as even with a series of losses, Romanov chose to let the coach continue his work, resulting in repeats as LKL, BBL and LKF cup champions, once again beating rivals Lietuvos Rytas. Before the 2013 season, Romanov built up a very powerful team, with many fans <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> of a spot in the Euroleague playoffs, as well as hiring new coach Joan Plaza. After an incredible start, with wins in the Euroleague, LKL and VTB tournaments, Romanov admitted to running out of money. Romanov resigned from Zalgiris on 28 February 2013, two weeks after the collapse of Ūkio Bankas. Before leaving, Romanov sold his shares to the team veterans.|$|E

In a September 2008 article, Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson said there was some discussion of a sequel when the film was being made, but that it mostly died with the poor box office. Jackson said he was still interested in a sequel but Shyamalan was non-committal.

500|$|The {{visit of}} West Ham United to Highbury {{produced}} a 1–0 defeat for Arsenal; the winning goal scored by Mike Small {{came in the}} 76th minute. Arsenal's conserved performance was attributed to their upcoming European Cup match, something Graham categorically denied: [...] "I'm not <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> about next Wednesday." [...] Arsenal drew away to Oldham Athletic and then Sheffield Wednesday, extending a winless run of five games in all competitions. The team beat Tottenham on 1 December 1991 to go fourth in the league table, 10 points behind the leaders. Arsenal's aspiration to defend the league title suffered to Nottingham Forest; though the team scored twice {{in the second half}} they were unable to overturn the home side's three-goal lead and collected no points. David Hillier opined that his team [...] "should have done better in the first half – that's when we really lost it." [...] Wright scored all of Arsenal's four goals against Everton, but scored none in the team's Boxing Day defeat by Luton Town. Graham called it Arsenal's worst performance of the season and was critical of his players' attitude. Although the team's concentration and effort improved according to Peter Ball of The Times in their next game – away to Manchester City, Arsenal lost for the second consecutive league match. They ended the calendar year in seventh position, 16 points behind the leaders Manchester United.|$|E

On 28 March 2012 he scored a second-half hat trick within 15 minutes against Chesterfield giving him his thirtieth goal of the season in a 4–1 win for Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. During this impressive third season, Evans drew attention from Championship and Premier League clubs with his contract scheduled to expire in the summer. However, Blades manager Danny Wilson stated that Evans [...] " [...] <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> about leaving Bramall Lane", adding [...] "Of course we don't want to lose Ched."

500|$|In higher organisms (like people), {{these two}} modes of {{perception}} combine into what Whitehead terms [...] "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation {{in a process}} that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. [...] By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. [...] An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. [...] However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, [...] "might not have jumped to the notion of a chair", but instead [...] "might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape." [...] This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> about it. [...] Moreover, animals do the same thing. [...] Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog [...] "would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such." [...] In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions {{on the one hand and}} causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).|$|E

[...] Prior argues that the B-theory cannot make sense of this sentence.
