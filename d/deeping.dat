5|$|The canal then looped {{around the}} {{northern}} edge of Horse Marsh to reach West <b>Deeping,</b> where there was another lock. There are visible remains of this lock, indicating that it had stone piers at both ends to support the gates, with turf sides between them. It then crossed King Street. An enclosure map dating from 1810 shows that the road crossed the canal by a ford, but that there was also a footbridge to allow pedestrians to cross the canal without getting wet. From West <b>Deeping</b> to Market <b>Deeping,</b> the canal was close to the northern bank of the northern river channel. There were two more locks in open countryside, and another at {{the western edge of the}} town, after which the cut rejoined the river. The final two locks were built on the River Welland, Briggins Lock in <b>Deeping</b> St James, and Low Lock to the south-east of the village.|$|E
5|$|Several {{prominent}} {{civil engineer}} considered {{the problems of}} <b>Deeping</b> Fen and the river outfall {{at the end of}} the 1700s. Two reports were produced, one by George Maxwell, and the second by Edward Hare, who had been assisted by William Jessop and John Rennie. They formed the basis for the <b>Deeping</b> Fen Act of 1801. The channel above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains were enlarged through the fen. One of Rennie's recommendations had been to replace the windmills which drove the drainage pumps with a steam pumping station at Pode Hole, but this was not implemented. After reports by Rennie and Thomas Pear in 1815, and by Rennie alone in 1818 and 1820, the provision of steam engines was authorised by an act in 1823. The trustees appointed by the 1801 act continued to manage <b>Deeping</b> Fen until they were replaced in 1939 by the <b>Deeping</b> Fen, Spalding and Pinchbeck Internal Drainage Board, subsequently renamed the Welland & Deepings Internal Drainage Board.|$|E

5|$|The Environment Agency is the {{navigation}} {{authority for the}} river, which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very shallow draught to West <b>Deeping</b> Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head of navigation was Wharf Road in Stamford. The management of the lower river has been intimately tied up with the drainage of <b>Deeping</b> Fen, and the river remains important to the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, for whom it provides the final conduit to the sea for pumped water.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passing}} of the Land Drainage Act 1930, the Welland Catchment Board was created. They had spent £91,537 on the outfall by 1937. Towards the end of the Second World War, E. G. Taverner, the chief {{engineer}} for the drainage board, devised a plan to relieve flooding in Spalding by creating a bypass channel, and building the Greatford Cut to divert the waters of the West Glen river into the Welland upstream of Market <b>Deeping.</b> The scheme cost £723,000, with much of the work being carried out by W. & C. French, and the Coronation Channel around Spalding was opened in September 1953. Fulney lock was constructed {{at the same time to}} exclude the tide from the upper river, as was the Maxey Cut, an embanked channel that bypasses the villages of Market <b>Deeping,</b> <b>Deeping</b> Gate and <b>Deeping</b> St James. During the 1960s and 1970s, several sections of the river above Stamford were made straighter and deeper, to reduce the risk of flooding of agricultural land. To address the habitat and environmental issues causes by such engineering work, the Welland Rivers Trust, a limited company and charitable trust, was set up in 2010. They are seeking to direct regeneration of the river by co-ordinating various organisations, which are known collectively as the Welland Valley Partnership. They published a major document outlining their proposals in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the river in the 1660s, when a new cut with 10 locks was constructed between Stamford and Market <b>Deeping,</b> and two locks were built on the river section below Market <b>Deeping.</b> The canal section was known as the Stamford Canal, and was the longest canal with locks in Britain when it was built. The river provided the final outlet to the sea for land drainage schemes implemented in the seventeenth century, although they were not completely successful until a steam-powered pumping station was built at Pode Hole in 1827. Navigation on the upper river, including the Stamford Canal, had ceased by 1863, but Spalding remained an active port {{until the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge at}} <b>Deeping</b> Gate carries the date 1651, {{and is a}} Grade II* listed stone {{structure}} with three round arches. After the remains of <b>Deeping</b> High lock and <b>Deeping</b> Low lock, there is a junction where the old course, the Maxey Cut, the South Drain and the Folly River, also a drain, meet. The river is officially navigable below this point. Through Crowland and Cowbit {{to the edge of}} Spalding, the river is laid out with washlands, which were historically used as pasture, because the river was allowed to flood the land when tidal levels prevented the water discharging into the sea. The river is bounded on the north and west by a bank, while the New River, a drainage channel to the south and east of it, is bounded by another bank. The land between the channels forms Crowland High Wash, Crowland Fodder Lots and Cowbit Wash. The southern bank is variously named Corporation Bank, Wash Bank and Barrier Bank. These wash lands were designed to be flooded in extremis, although the building of the Coronation flood relief channel has made this purpose obsolete.|$|E

5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of <b>Deeping</b> Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, and so they were not responsible.|$|E

5|$|The River Welland {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} on which improvements, in this case to allow {{navigation}} to Stamford, were authorised by an act of Parliament. The act was granted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in 1571, and the preamble explained how Stamford had prospered {{as a result of the}} river, but also stated that mills built between Stamford and <b>Deeping</b> had resulted in it no longer being navigable, as they had diverted the water. Powers were granted to restore the river using either the old channel or the new one, although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this.

5|$|Just before Stamford, the Great North Road, now {{labelled}} the A1, {{crosses the}} river, and a pumping {{station on the}} north bank at Stamford Meadows has pumped large quantities of water to the Rutland Water reservoir since its construction in 1975. Stamford was the lowest {{point at which the}} river could be forded so the Roman Ermine Street crossed the Welland there. The A16 road crosses the river by a three-arched stone bridge designed by Edward Browning in 1845. Below it, Albert Bridge is made of iron with stone piers, and was erected by Stamford Town Council in July 1881, to replace an earlier bridge which was washed away in a flood. Beyond Stamford, the river passes the site and ruins of the Benedictine St Leonard's Priory. Hudd's Mill marks {{the point at which the}} Stamford Canal left the river. The present mill building dates from 1751 and 1771. The River Gwash, which the canal crossed on the level, joins from the north, and the remains of the canal follow the river on its north bank. Below Uffington, the county border follows the old course of the river, first to the south to Tallington and then to the north, while the main course now flows along the Maxey Cut to Peakirk. The old course consists of two streams, fed by sluices from the Maxey Cut, which meander to The Deepings. The eastern stream supplied power to Lolham and Maxey mills, while the western stream did the same for Tallington Mill, which dates from around 1700, West <b>Deeping</b> mill, and Molecey's mill, which still retains its seventeenth-century undershot waterwheel, modified in the 19th century to Poncelet's improved design, and the only surviving waterwheel of its type in Lincolnshire. At the western edge of Market <b>Deeping</b> the two streams join, and they are also joined by the Greatford Cut, which has carried the diverted waters of the West Glen river since the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The fen was {{inundated}} in 1798, and {{the civil}} engineers William Jessop and John Rennie were asked to assist the local engineers Edward Hare and George Maxwell. There was a clear understanding that the outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered. The first was an outfall at a lower level, which would involve hugh expense in its construction, and the second, favoured by Jessop and Rennie, was the provision of steam pumping engines at Pode Hole. These would pump water from the internal drains of the fen to Vernatt's Drain, and the lower internal water levels would allow the existing wind-powered drainage mills to work efficiently. A report was produced, which {{formed the basis for}} the <b>Deeping</b> Fen Act of 1801. The channel of the Welland above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains which crossed the fen to join Vernatt's Drain at Pode Hole were made deeper. At the time there were no steam engines working in the fens, and Rennie's recommendation of a steam pumping station at Pode Hole was not implemented.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the canal is just {{to the north of}} the river, and a public {{footpath}} follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West <b>Deeping</b> was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that it was probably a movable bridge. The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a water mill dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock. A railway line crossed the tail of the lock, but after the demise of the canal, the line was widened, and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment.|$|E
