40|$|Background: Fluoroquinolones are a {{class of}} {{antibacterial}} agents used for leprosy treatment. Some new fluoroquinolones have been attracting interest due to their remarkable potency that is reportedly better than that of ofloxacin, the fluoroquinolone currently recommended for treatment of leprosy. For example, DC- 159 a, a recently developed 8 -methoxy fluoroquinolone, {{has been found to}} be highly potent against various bacterial species. Nonetheless, the efficacy of DC- 159 a against Mycobacterium leprae is yet to be examined. Methodology/Principal Findings: To gather data that can support highly effective fluoroquinolones as candidates for new remedies for leprosy treatment, we conducted in vitro assays to assess and compare the inhibitory activities of DC- 159 a and two fluoroquinolones that are already known to be more effective against M. leprae than ofloxacin. The fluoroquinolone-inhibited DNA supercoiling assay using recombinant <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrases</b> of wild type and ofloxacin-resistant M. leprae revealed that inhibitory activities of DC- 159 a and sitafloxacin were at most 9. 8 -and 11. 9 -fold higher than moxifloxacin. Also the fluoroquinolone-mediated cleavage assay showed that potencies of those drugs were at most 13. 5 -and 9. 8 -fold higher than moxifloxacin. In addition, these two drugs retained their inhibitory activities even against <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrases</b> of ofloxacin-resistant M. leprae. Conclusions/Significance: The results indicated that DC- 159 a and sitafloxacin are more effective against wild type and mutant M. leprae <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrases</b> than moxifloxacin, suggesting that these antibacterial drugs can be good candidates that may supersede current fluoroquinolone remedies. DC- 159 a in particular is very promising because it is classified in a subgroup of fluoroquinolones that is known to be less likely to cause adverse effects. Our results implied that DC- 159 a is well worth further investigation to ascertain its in vivo effectiveness and clinical safety for humans...|$|R

By comparison of MICs at which 90 % of strains are inhibited, DU- 6859 a had potent activity against bacteria resistant to the control quinolones. The time-killing curves of quinolones showed that the number of viable cells decreased rapidly during 2 to 4 h of incubation, and regrowth was not seen even after 8 h of incubation. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudo-monas aeruginosa resistant to DU- 6859 a were % 4. 0 3 1029 to 1. 9 3 1028.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that local {{denaturation}} {{can be a}} natural consequence of supercoiling, even in environments where base pairing of linear DNA is energetically favored. Any change in the molecular total twist from its unstressed value is partitioned between local denaturation and smooth twisting in both the native and coil regions so as to minimize the total conformational free energy involved.

As these thresholds are surpassed, the number of denatured bases increase smoothly from zero. Existing experimental evidence regarding denaturation in supercoiled DNA is in good agreement with the predictions of this theory.

The expression of this protein thus requires the co-expression of the minor E. coli arginyl tRNA which reads AGG and AGA codons. The A subunit expressed in E. coli was obtained from inclusion bodies after denaturation and renaturation. The B subunit was overexpressed in E. coli and purified in soluble form. When purified B subunit was added to the renatured A subunit, ATP-dependent relaxation and decatenation activities of the hyperthermophilic DNA topoisomerase were reconstituted.
