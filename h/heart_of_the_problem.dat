2500|$|The term may be spelled with {{or without}} a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some {{scholars}} favor the unhyphenated form because, [...] "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" [...] whereas [...] "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that." [...] For example, Emil Fackenheim supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to [...] " [...] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes." [...] Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at Merrimack College; Yehuda Bauer, professor of Holocaust studies at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and James Carroll, historian and novelist.

2500|$|Disputes as {{to whether}} or not to {{classify}} something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings, Duchamp's Fountain, the movies, superlative imitations of banknotes, conceptual art, and video games. Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Rather, [...] "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" [...] are [...] "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" [...] (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst's and Emin's work by arguing [...] "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" [...] they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work. In 1998, Arthur Danto, suggested a thought experiment showing that [...] "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood." ...|$|E

60|$|The plan {{ultimately}} adopted, after {{a severe}} struggle and with momentous consequences, did not first spring from Mr. Gladstone’s brain. The idea of adapting {{the law to}} custom in all its depth and breadth, and extending the rooted notion of tenant-right to its furthest bearings, was necessarily a plant of Irish and not of English growth. Mr. Chichester Fortescue, the Irish chief secretary and an Irishman, first opened a bold expansion of the familiar principle of many tenant-right bills. He had introduced such a bill himself in 1866, and the conservative government had brought in another in 1867. It is believed that he was instigated to adopt the new and bolder line by Sir Edward Sullivan, then the Irish attorney-general. Away from Sullivan, it was observed, he had little to say of value about his plan. In the cabinet Fortescue was not found effective, but he was thoroughly {{at home in the}} subject, and his speeches in public on Irish business had all the cogency of a man speaking his native tongue, and even genius in an acquired language is less telling. What is astonishing is the magic of the rapid and sympathetic penetration with which Mr. Gladstone went to the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> as it was presented to him by his Irish advisers. This was his way. When acts of policy were not of great or immediate concern, he took them as they came; but when they pressed for treatment and determination, then he swooped down upon them with the strength and vision of an eagle.|$|E
