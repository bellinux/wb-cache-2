25|$|The <b>enhanced</b> <b>performance</b> {{may arise}} from a {{decrease}} in solvent permeation across the sealant due to {{the application of the}} polymer gel electrolyte. The polymer gel electrolyte is quasi-solid at room temperature, and becomes a viscous liquid (viscosity: 4.34 mPa·s) at 80°C compared with the traditional liquid electrolyte (viscosity: 0.91 mPa·s). The much improved stabilities of the device under both thermal stress and soaking with light has never before been seen in DSCs, and they match the durability criteria applied to solar cells for outdoor use, which makes these devices viable for practical application.|$|E

It is fitted with 5TDFM, {{two-stroke}} liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons which develops 850hp (634kW), improved running gear, automated movement control system with a steering handlebar control, additional passive protection, built-in explosive reactive armour, countermeasures system, new fire suppression system with over-ride facilities at the commander's station, automatic loader which holds 18 rounds and anti-aircraft machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the turret under a complete armour protection. The anti-aircraft machine gun is installed on the commander's cupola and {{is intended to be}} fired at air and ground targets. The buyer can choose between two main armament options: 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun or 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun. Both of them with use of <b>enhanced</b> <b>performance</b> conventional ammunition and barrel-launched ATGM can defeat modern tanks form distance of 2000–3000 m and up to 5,000 m using the ATGM. The tank can carry at least 30 rounds. The 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds while 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun weighs 2,63 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (50 calibers) and can fire all types of ammunition that meet the requirements of NATO standards and Ukrainian-made ATGM. Both guns have normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. The tank can be armed with either the KT-7.62 or the PKT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and can carry 3,000 rounds for it. The tank can also be armed with either KT-12.7 or NSVT-12.7 heavy machine gun for AA protection and can carry 450 rounds for it. The approximate successful range is 2km during day and 800 m during night. The AA HMG can be elevated between -5 to +70 degrees. The remote control for anti-aircraft machine gun is stabilized in the vertical axis during automatic mode (by using the TKN-5 sight) and is using the PZU-7 sight for semi-automatic mode.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, the U.S. Navy was {{considering}} the widespread adoption of conformal fuel tanks, {{which would allow}} the Super Hornet to carry [...] of additional fuel. Budgetary pressures from the F-35C Lightning II and Pacific region operations were cited as reasons supporting the use of CFTs. Flight testing demonstrated CFTs could slightly reduce drag while expanding the combat range by 260 nautical miles. The prototype CFT weighed 1,500lb, while production CFTs are expected to weigh 870lb. Boeing stated that the CFTs do not add any cruise drag but acknowledged a negative impact imposed on transonic acceleration due to increased wave drag. General Electric's <b>enhanced</b> <b>performance</b> engine (EPE), increasing the F414-GE-400's power output from 22,000lb to 26,400lb of thrust per engine, was suggested as a mitigating measure.

It's based on the Ukrainian T-55AGM and is almost identical {{with the exception of}} the engine, the main armament, Fire Control System with 1G46M gunner sight, PKN-5 Commander sight, and both integrated with the Buran - Catherine Thermal sight, air conditioned system, Deflek Ceramic special alloy steel armor, and Nosh explosive reactive armor. The tank is powered by the new 5TDFMA two-stroke liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons developing 1,050hp and has maximum speed of over 75km/h on the road in forward gear and over 35km/h in the reverse gear. The main armament is the 125mm KBM-1M 48 caliber smoothbore gun capable of firing conventional ammunition with <b>enhanced</b> <b>performance</b> which can destroy modern tanks from a range of up to 3,500 m (APFSDS and HEAT-TANDEM) and barrel-launched [...] which have a penetration of 800mm RHAe after ERA and are capable of destroying modern tanks from a distance up to 5,000 m. The gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds. The gun has a normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. Is not being considered as an option for upgrade by the Peruvian Army.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 June 2013, the U.S. Army {{formally}} cancelled the Individual Carbine competition. [...] The Army said {{none of the}} carbines evaluated during testing met {{the minimum}} scoring requirement needed to continue to {{the next phase of}} the evaluation. [...] Letters were sent to gunmakers involved to inform them that no future contract awards would be made for the soldier evaluation phase. [...] PEO Soldier reported that no competitor demonstrated a significant improvement in weapon reliability to justify buying a new carbine. [...] Weapons tested also had low reliability performance using M855A1 <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Performance</b> Rounds (EPR). [...] Ultimately, the Army decided not to pursue a new carbine because of consideration of operational requirements in the context of available small arms technology, the constrained fiscal environment, and the capability of their current carbines. One reliability requirement that was not reached by the vendors was firing 3,592 mean rounds without malfunctioning. [...] In 1990, the M4 was required to fire 600 mean rounds between stoppages, while the current M4A1 fires 1,691 mean rounds between stoppages using M855A1 ammunition. [...] PEO Soldier said that the new carbine had to be a superior improvement, not a small improvement. [...] The Army has not released how close the competitors came to reaching the mean rounds between stoppages requirement, or how they performed compared to the M4A1. [...] That information is seen as proprietary, and may be up to the manufacturers to release data. [...] Analysis has not yet been done to determine if any exact event cause per vendor led to performance failures.|$|E
2500|$|The Army {{clarified}} {{that it was}} not cancelling the IC competition, {{but that}} it {{was in a position to}} conclude it. [...] Industry participants said the competition was plagued by miscommunication from the Army. [...] Gabriele de Plano, vice president of military marketing and sales for Beretta, said he knew nothing of what the Army was planning just weeks before cancellation. [...] Other companies expressed concern that they had learned the program may be cancelled through media reports rather than being informed directly. [...] Army officials said they were surprised that none of the rifles submitted passed muster and maintained that there was transparency throughout the three-year competition. [...] Brigadier General Paul A. Ostrowski, head of PEO Soldier, said the Army simply did not find the capability it was after with the rifles submitted. [...] None of the weapons met minimum requirements. [...] The competition was a binary pass-or-fail venue, rather than a test-fix-test venue to improve the weapons following test results. [...] Mark Westrom, owner of ArmaLite which designed the original M16 rifle, said the competition was [...] "destined to fail" [...] because the requirements did not represent a significant advance in fighting ability. [...] The Army admitted each entrant offered marginal improvements over the M4 Carbine, but that none would substantially increase a soldier’s battlefield capability. [...] Westrom said the carbines offered incremental improvements, not any that offered a tactically superior advance to justify replacing the entire inventory. [...] There were also complaints about the ammunition used in testing. [...] The competition began while the M855 round was in use. [...] In June 2010, the M855A1 <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Performance</b> Round was fielded, and the competition began using the EPR in August. [...] Army analysis found that the M855A1 may have contributed to lower than expected reliability performance. [...] Even so, the Army insists they made industry aware of the ammo change, giving them time to adjust their designs and arranging for each vendor to fire 10,000 M855A1s at a private range. [...] Westrom said ammunition and caliber conflicts had little to do with it, as neither those factors nor the rifle designs would fundamentally change the battlefield capabilities of a soldier or small unit, while previous weapon transitions advanced combat shooting doctrines and shooting tactics. [...] ArmaLite did not participate in the competition because Westrom determined their designs weren't a revolutionary improvement over the M4 weapon system, and because the published Army requirements [...] "set the bar so low" [...] that the outcome that no one would win a contract was [...] "predetermined." ...|$|E
