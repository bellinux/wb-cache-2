5000|$|The name Hellgate High School was {{not used}} until well after the {{building}} now known as Sentinel High School opened in 1956. Originally, what {{is now known as}} Sentinel was to be the new Missoula County High School replacing what is now known as Hellgate. As Missoula grew, classes were slowly returned to the Hellgate building, the 9th graders, then the 10th graders. In the mid‑1960s, Hellgate and Sentinel were created as separate four‑year high schools, with all the old team names going to Sentinel, and the new team names (pages, squires, and knights) were created with all new traditions. Before Sentinel opened, Missoula County High School was the only public high school in Missoula, with Frenchtown High School the only other public high school in the County.

40|$|Background: Cervix is a {{rare and}} <b>dangerous</b> <b>site</b> for ectopic pregnancy. When the {{placenta}} is implanted lower than internal cervical os, it is called “cervical pregnancy”. Known risk factors for cervical pregnancy are previous cesarean section, cigarette smoking, premature transfer of fertilized ovum before having suitable endometrium and pelvic inflammatory disease. In the past, hysterectomy was the usual treatment. Nowadays, with the newer diagnostic and therapeutic managements, cases of cervical pregnancy treated by fertility sparing methods have been reported. Conservative treatments include using methotrexate and KCl, hyperosmolar glucose, and prostaglandins. Also, surgical methods with fertility sparing have been reported. The {{purpose of this study}} is introducing two cases of cervical pregnancies treated by fertility sparing. Case presentation: The first patient had six weeks pregnancy with live fetus and detectable fetal heart beat. There was six weeks menstrual retard and βhCG titer was 10. 000 UI/ml. Two doses of methotrexate were prescribed and pregnancy terminated successfully. The other patient had eight weeks pregnancy with fetal heart beat. There was eight weeks retardation and βhCG titer was 70379 UI/ml with no gestational sac in sonography in both patients. After prescribing two doses of methotrexate and doing curettage three days after the last dose of methotrexate, pregnancy terminated. The known risk factors for our patients were history of endometrial curettage in one and history of cesarean section in both of them. Conclusion: Conservative method may be considered for the treatment of cervical pregnancy in patients who desire to preserve their fertility. The treatment is associated with high success rates. Methotrexate (MTX) is the most common medicine for resolving ectopic cervical pregnancy, other medications such as KCl, hyperosmolar glucose, RU 486 and prostaglandins have also been used with different success rate.

40|$|Surface wave methods {{consist of}} the {{extraction}} and inversion of the Rayleigh wave phase-velocity dispersion curve {{to recover the}} (usually 1 D) shear-wave velocity profile. In the literature, uncertainty due to data error has not received much attention, but the discussion about uncertainty due to model error is even poorer. Even with an unrealistic noise-free dataset and an exact forward model, an inappropriate parameterization can generate solutions very far from the actual soil structure. In general, the model used for the dispersion curve interpretation is 1 D. Hence, when the velocity distribution is laterally heterogeneous, model errors can have significant consequences on {{the reliability of the}} resulting shear-wave velocity distribution. From a poor velocity reconstruction, an unsatisfactory, and often <b>dangerous</b> <b>site</b> response analysis follows. In fact, shear wave measurements play a relevant role in seismic ground motion amplification estimation. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of processing the seismograms using a multi-offset phase analysis (MOPA), in order to derive soil elastic parameters for weak motion predictions. This technique allows the detection and location of the lateral discontinuities, and a better model parameterization. In fact, once the discontinuities are identified, we can split the profile into several, truly 1 D, parts. The use of the standard 1 D dispersion curve extraction and inversion for each side of the heterogeneity generates velocity profiles that we can put side by side to get correct 2 D reconstructions of the shear-wave distributions. From 2 D velocity reconstruction, we can calculate the site response that may be significantly different from the site response generated from a traditional 1 D analysis of the same seismograms. In this work, we discuss the site responses of two synthetic examples with lateral heterogeneities. We show how misleading a 1 D analysis may be if applied to a truly 2 D velocity distribution, particularly in terms of site response prediction...|$|E

40|$|To migrate successfully, birds need {{to store}} {{adequate}} fat reserves to fuel each {{leg of the}} journey. Migrants acquire their fuel reserves at stopover sites; this often entails exposure to predators. Therefore, the safety attributes of sites may {{be as important as}} the feeding opportunities. Furthermore, site choice might depend on fuel load, with lean birds more willing to accept danger to obtain good feeding. Here, we evaluate the factors underlying stopover-site usage by migrant Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) on a landscape scale. We measured the food and danger attributes of 17 potential stopover sites in the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound region. We used logistic regression models to test whether food, safety, or both were best able to predict usage of these sites by Western Sandpipers. Eight of the 17 sites were used by sandpipers on migration. Generally, sites that were high in food and safety were used, whereas sites that were low in food and safety were not. However, <b>dangerous</b> <b>sites</b> were used if there was ample food abundance, and sites with low food abundance were used if they were safe.

40|$|Session IConrad and Schneider’s now {{classical}} work on {{the historical}} transformation of definitions of deviance from ‘badness’ to ‘sickness’ is relevant for the situation in China today, although with some modifications. The weakly founded medical/psychiatric profession and the strong political/ideological discourse in China leads to a strange combination of medicalization and moralization, even criminalization. The ‘sick’ are often equated with the ‘bad,’ and ‘sickness’ {{is seen as a}} secondary sign of ‘badness. ’ The pan-moralist tradition of ancient China seems to be closely combined with the Communist era’s strong belief in political-ideological correctness, and its strong belief in social engineering. My previous research on crime and deviance in China in the 1980 s and 1990 s seems to be confirmed by today’s discourse, although there are new moral panics and new forms of medical-moralistic definitions of deviance in contemporary China. Still, the categories of deviance are very much socially constructed entities closely related to the moral-political order of present day China. In this paper, I will use three cases to underline my argument. First, the type of deviance I call ‘majority deviance,’ related to the case of the prejudice and dangers associated with the only-child. My second example has to do with what I term the ‘wayward girl’ and the moral panics concerning so-called zaolian – or ‘premature love’ among young girls. The third example is the new panic surrounding ‘internet addiction disorder’ or IAD.

40|$|International audienceForest {{management}} in mountainous regions implies sylvicultural interventions on slopes. But in such forested areas, engines, workers or falling trees can initiate rock falls {{and the site}} can temporarily turn to a potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>site.</b> This presentation deals with a type of fence specifically developed for this context. In particular, this type of fence requires no heavy interventions neither than heavy engines such as for soil-moving or nailing. Moreover, it is a temporary structure, supposed to act {{for the duration of}} the interventions or as long as it is necessary to counterbalance the lack of protection within the growing period of the trees. The fence is composed of a wire mesh, three cables and two rigid rods. This fence is tightened between existing trees. The first real size experiments have been made during summer 2008. It consisted in impacting successively the fence in its centre with rocks of varying mass (from 30 kg to 500 kg) with the aim of evaluating its capacities. For this purpose, a cable was tightened between two trees. This cable allowed conveying a trolley supporting the rock. The rock was dropped just before the impact thanks to a snap shackle. The system allowed reaching a maximal rock velocity before impact of 17 m/s. This velocity was calculated thanks to image analysis obtained with a numerical video camera and a numerical high speed camera. The main continuous measurement made was tension in the upper cable. In addition, an accelerometer was nailed on one of the fence supporting trees. A total of 17 impact experiments were performed on for different fences. The first results showed that (i) angular blocks can cut wires even for low mass rocks, (ii) the wire rupture hardly propagates in the mesh during another impact, (iii) supporting cables can be cut during the impact, (iv) the fence is not perforated by the direct impact even for rocks 500 kg in mass, and (v) a reparation of a perforated mesh consisting in placing a patch is perfectly efficient. In parallel to these experiments, numerical simulations were performed based on the discrete element model developed by Bertrand (2008). It has allowed the estimation of the relevance of some technical options. The results obtained are encouraging and should lead to the development of efficient low energy fences to be used on forested slopes...|$|E
40|$|Many {{problems}} have been identified with the education of Gypsy and Traveller pupils in schools (Bhopal, 2004; Warrington, 2007). Generally these have been articulated by policy makers, educational professionals and academics about Gypsies and Travellers communities; however, {{there is also a}} body of work that details Gypsy and Traveller families’ concerns about their children’s education (Acton, 2004; Dean, 2007). Underachievement and poor attendance issues in particular have caused concern for education policy makers since publication of the Plowden report in 1967 (Plowden, 1967; Bhopal et al, 2000). As a result the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has produced a number of publications aimed at raising the achievement and attainment of Gypsy and Traveller pupils (DfEE, 1999; DfES 2003; 2006). Common concerns for Gypsy and Traveller parents include fears their children will encounter racism and bullying at schools, fears around safety including using public transport, going on school trips or taking part in PE lessons, and engagement with culturally sensitive subjects such as sex education (Bhopal et al, 2000; Clark and Greenfields, 2006). Many Gypsy and Traveller parents also feel their children do not receive the quality of education they are entitled to; sometimes reflecting the failure of schools to deliver a culturally appropriate curriculum and sometimes suggesting schools do not deliver educational provision of the same quality received by non-Gypsy and Traveller children (Bhopal and Myers, 2008). Whilst it is apparent that there has been an increase in the numbers of Gypsy and Traveller children attending schools, {{it is also clear that}} over the last fifty years many Gypsy and Traveller children have not attended school. In most research undertaken about Gypsy and Traveller children’s expectations of education since the 1960 ’s there are accounts of the bullying and racism they have faced (Liegeois, 1987; Reiss, 1975). This has been a consistent cause for families not to send their children to school. To date these issues have not been fully addressed and still reflect much that is commonplace despite continuing efforts to improve practice in schools (DfES, 2003, 2006). Therefore a management of the danger in ways that result in Gypsy and Traveller children feeling that going to school is safe, even if it is understood within a context of the school being a potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>site,</b> is a positive development if the intention is to improve Gypsy and Traveller children’s educational outcomes. The perception of the school environment in this light in many ways reflects the context of Gypsy and Traveller lives and their relations with wider society. Within this context, this paper will explore the most common problem identified by researchers as to the reasons why parents do not want to send their children to school – that of racism. The research will draw upon in-depth interviews conducted in one primary and one secondary school in an inner London borough. Both of the schools were the main receiving schools for the local Gypsy and Traveller population. Close to the schools is a local council run Gypsy and Traveller site which has been in the area for over 50 years. Interviews were conducted with heads, teachers, learning support assistants, parents and pupils. Despite race equality polices being in place in both schools, many of the pupils reported having experienced racism and these experiences not being taken seriously by teachers. One of the respondents indicated, ‘What about us? People don’t think anyone can be racist to us because we’re white. Those black people have their colour to show, what do we have?’ Many of the teachers also revealed overt racist attitudes towards Gypsy and Traveller pupils and indicated that Gypsy and Traveller children used their ethnicity as an ‘excuse’ so that they did not have to conform to school rules. Despite race equality policies being present in both schools, Gypsy and Traveller continued to experience overt racism and many parents felt such racism was not dealt with effectively and not given the same attention as racism experienced by non-white groups. Drawing upon this research, the paper will address the following questions: 1. 	How is white racism defined by Gypsy and Traveller groups? 2. 	How do schools deal with the racism experienced by Gypsy and Traveller groups and how does this in turn affect the educational experience of these groups? 3. 	Do what extent are Gypsies and Travellers ‘othered’ within schools? <br/...|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} understand how the Neva River, the most important artery connecting St. Petersburg {{to the rest of the}} Russian Empire and Europe to the west, affected the political and social life of the imperial capital at the beginning of the nineteenth century. I imagine the river Neva as the lifeblood of an imperial capital, a river city in which I will examine the relation of water to historical actors that experienced it socially, culturally, and environmentally. I argue that the river had a paramount role in shaping life and events in the city even as generations of engineers attempted to convert it into a stately built environment, a watery counterpart to the capitals granite palaces, prospects, squares, and markets while at the same time enabling a capitalist transformation to occur along the banks. There is no question that the river defined Russia???s capital???physically and symbolically. Ever since the founding of Peter the Great???s ???paradise??? on the banks of the Neva in 1703, the foundations of the city, both physical and intellectual, have been anything but solid, as a volatile mix of social groups interacted with the inhospitable natural environment. I propose that the river is a prism through which to examine the intersection of agendas of the Emperors and the new urbanites. The river is a site of struggle between state efforts at technological, social, and cultural control, and a burgeoning city population determined to claim the river as their own through work and leisure as they formed a new urban identity. This interdisciplinary history of the environmental and social spaces on and around the Neva will illuminate the nature of power and the power of nature at work in the city. The environment has wreaked havoc on the city that grew around the islands that form the city???s center. Officials bent on conquering nature and empire with rational and systematic planning combated the river with flood controls, granite embankments, canals and bridges. These contests with nature provided the city with essential features of its image and made it a livable and productive, though <b>dangerous</b> <b>site</b> of commerce and transportation. Upon this precarious physical foundation, the river, frozen in the winter and free-flowing in warm months, gave rise to what I call a ???river culture. ??? Sources show that the different social groups in the city invested experiences within the city with radically different meanings that reveal the fault lines of local identity and imperial power. Thus, various groups of citizens and the state sought to define the city through competing narratives, actions, and technologies that included grandeur, modernity, and doom. My contribution to the historiography of Russian history is to use water as the lens to chart the transformation of St. Petersburg from the model city of the eighteenth century to the to a more cosmopolitan, capitalist city of the nineteenth. As the government sought to maintain its hold on the shape and order of the city, new groups of urban actors, including residents, entrepreneurs and engineers, inserted their specialized experience and knowledge into the public arena to shape the city that had been set out to imperial specifications. These battles were fought again and again in disputes about the meaning, use, and delivery of water in the city. Chapter 1 explores the patterns of river use in the water network of the city, demonstrating the reasons why the river and waterways of the city reveal social, political, and cultural relationships of groups in the capital. Chapter 2, ???The Mountain Came to Us: St. Petersburg and the Flood of 1824 ??? serves as a case study of the November 7, 1824 flood that became seared in the memory of Petersburgers. The chapter considers not only the tumultuous events of that day, but the aftermath in which the government sought to redefine its notions of what Petersburg was and the contested memories that resulted. Chapter 3 examines the interaction between the state and key non-state groups at one particular site, the settlement at Galernaia Harbor near south end of Vasilevskii Island as the government sought to relocate the village after the 1824 flood. Chapter 4 follows a new professional class of engineers that maintained a lived city by engaging the saturation of water, and how they helped the state to define the river. These engineers were agents of the state, yet saw themselves as apart from the state at the same time, as they built the infrastructure that made the city functional and supported imperial claims of grandeur. Chapter 5 is the story of the haphazard, convulsive history of sanitation, piping, and water delivery in the city as professional and private initiative came into conflict with state interests in defining the needs for water and sanitation networks in the city. Public disputes show engineers engaged in a fragile civil society and actively participating in defining what was modern, moral, and clean...|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, it was {{estimated}} that there was a shortage of approximately 3,000 caravan sites for Romani communities in Netherlands. Instances of Romani communities being moved into socially and environmentally disadvantaged areas, for the purported intention of preventing conflicts between nomadic Romani and non-Romani, have been documented. Observers such as Rodrigues and Matelski have determined through interviews that it is extremely common, if not universally occurring, for nomadic Romani in Netherlands to experience vocal opposition when proposing new caravan sites to municipalities, whose residents frequently cite concerns over lowered property values. As a result, many nomadic Romani end up living at isolated, environmentally problematic, and sometimes <b>dangerous</b> <b>sites.</b> In one case, a Romani camp was identified as being located within the blasting zone of an explosives factory, a situation that Rodrigues and Matelski have explicitly identified as [...] "environmental racism." ...|$|R
40|$|Young {{children}} show poor judgement {{when asked}} to select safe places to cross the road and frequently consider <b>dangerous</b> <b>sites</b> to be safe ones. Thus, a sharp bend, the brow of a hill or positions close to parked cars are considered safe places to cross by most children under 9 years of age. This study examined the effectiveness of two practical training programmes in improving the judgements of 5 -year-olds. Children were trained in small groups either in the real road environment or using simulations set up on a table-top model. A series of pre-and post-tests allowed the effectiveness of training to be assessed. Significant improvements relative to controls were found in both groups following training. There were no {{differences between the two}} training methods. Improvements were robust and no deterioration was observed two months after the programme ended. However, the benefits of group training were less marked than in an earlier study in which children were trained individually. The implications for road safety education are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In urban {{search and}} rescue scenarios, typical {{applications}} of robots include autonomous exploration of possibly <b>dangerous</b> <b>sites,</b> and the recognition of victims and other objects of interest. In complex scenarios, relying on only one type of sensor is often misleading, while using complementary sensors frequently helps improving the performance. To that end, we propose a probabilistic world model that leverages information from heterogeneous sensors and integrates semantic attributes. This method of reasoning about complementary information is shown to be advantageous, yielding increased reliability compared to considering all sensors separately. We report results from several experiments with a wheeled USAR robot in a complex indoor scenario. The robot is able to learn an accurate map, and to detect real persons and signs of hazardous materials based on inertial sensing, odometry, a laser range finder, visual detection, and thermal imaging. The results show that combining heterogeneous sensor information increases the detection performance, and that semantic attributes can be successfully integrated into the world model. ...|$|R
