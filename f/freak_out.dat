5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!,</b> combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{original}} repertoire {{consisted of}} {{rhythm and blues}} covers, but after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them to play his own original material, and the name was changed to The Mothers. The musical content of <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> ranges from rhythm and blues, doo-wop and standard blues-influenced rock to orchestral arrangements and avant-garde sound collages. Although the album was initially poorly received in the United States, it was a success in Europe. It gained a cult following in America, where it continued to sell in substantial quantities until it was discontinued in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Zappa's {{interest}} in composing and arranging flourished {{in his last}} high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, arranging and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra. He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting {{the rest of the}} class with juvenile antics. In 1959, he attended Chaffey College but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.|$|E

5|$|Many musicians, {{bands and}} orchestras from diverse genres have been {{influenced}} by Zappa's music. Rock artists like Alice Cooper, Larry LaLonde of Primus, Fee Waybill of the Tubes all cite Zappa's influence, as do progressive, alternative and experimental rock artists like Can, Pere Ubu, Henry Cow, Trey Anastasio of Phish, Jeff Buckley, Faust, John Frusciante, Steven Wilson, and The Aristocrats. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as the Beatles' <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!,</b> Jimi Hendrix, and heavy rock and metal acts like Black Sabbath, Simon Phillips, Mike Portnoy, Warren DeMartini, Steve Vai, Strapping Young Lad, System of a Down, and Clawfinger acknowledge Zappa's inspiration. On the classical music scene, Tomas Ulrich, Meridian Arts Ensemble, Ensemble Ambrosius and the Fireworks Ensemble regularly perform Zappa's compositions and quote his influence. Contemporary jazz musicians and composers Bill Frisell and John Zorn are inspired by Zappa, as is funk legend George Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't <b>freak</b> <b>out...</b> I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

500|$|<b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> by the Mothers of Invention {{has also}} been cited as having {{influenced}} Sgt. Pepper. According to the author Philip Norman, during the Sgt.

500|$|However {{the album}} did develop a major cult {{following}} in the US by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972. [...] At that time many MGM/Verve releases including <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> were prematurely deleted {{in an attempt to}} keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> However, Zappa criticized the Beatles, as he felt they were [...] "only in it for the money".|$|E

500|$|During the {{recording}} of <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!,</b> Zappa moved into a house in Laurel Canyon with friend Pamela Zarubica, who appeared on the album. The house became a meeting (and living) place for many LA musicians and groupies of the time, despite Zappa's disapproval of their illicit drug use. After a short promotional tour following the release of <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!,</b> Zappa met Adelaide Gail Sloatman. He fell in love within [...] "a couple of minutes", and she moved into the house over the summer. They married in 1967, had four children and remained together until Zappa's death.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at TTG Studios {{at the corner}} of Sunset and Highland in Hollywood, California, between March 9 and March 12, 1966. Some songs, such as [...] "Motherly Love" [...] and [...] "I Ain't Got No Heart" [...] had already been recorded before the <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> sessions. These early recordings, said to have been made around 1965, were not officially released until 2004, when they appeared on the posthumous Zappa album Joe's Corsage. An early version of the song [...] "Any Way The Wind Blows", recorded in 1963, appears on another posthumous release, The Lost Episodes. The song was written when Zappa considered divorcing first wife Kay Sherman. In the liner notes for <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!,</b> Zappa wrote, [...] "If I had never gotten divorced, this piece of trivial nonsense would never have been recorded." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> was {{released}} June 27, 1966, with the band's name changed to The Mothers of Invention, a name Zappa chose {{in favor of}} MGM's original suggested name, [...] "The Mothers Auxiliary".

50|$|Big Nose <b>Freaks</b> <b>Out</b> is a {{platform}} {{game for the}} NES, produced by Codemasters and published by Camerica. Like many Codemasters NES titles, the game was also released for the Aladdin Deck Enhancer. The player controls a cave man character who has had all his bones stolen from a prehistoric bank by a dinosaur. Bignose sets off on an adventure through numerous prehistoric settings. Bignose defeats enemies using a club; however, he also has access to a primitive skate board device (stone-boarding), via his invention - the wheel. The game is essentially {{a platform}} game in which the player collects bones and other items, while travelling {{from left to right}} until reaching the goal. Big Nose <b>Freaks</b> <b>Out</b> also had a two player mode, and the addition of numerous secret levels and bonuses. Big Nose <b>Freaks</b> <b>Out</b> has become popular as more people have access to the ROM file through emulation websites.|$|R
500|$|<b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> {{was honored}} with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, ranked at number 243 on Rolling Stone magazine's {{list of the}} [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] in 2003, and {{featured}} in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album was named as one of Classic Rock magazines [...] "50 Albums That Built Prog Rock".|$|E
500|$|Though {{it reached}} No. 130 on the Billboard chart, <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> was neither a major {{commercial}} nor critical success {{when it was}} first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote: ...|$|E

These were juxtaposed with premiere Synclavier pieces. Again, Zappa was {{not satisfied with the}} performances of his orchestral works, regarding them as under-rehearsed, but in the album liner notes he respectfully thanks Boulez's demands for precision. The Synclavier pieces stood in contrast to the orchestral works, as the sounds were electronically generated and not, as became possible shortly thereafter, sampled.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the various}} {{underground}} influences in Yellow Submarine, author Stephen Glynn identifies the segment featuring [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] as {{being among the}} film's [...] "most daring sequences". Led by art director Heinz Edelmann, the animation for the song reflects the influence of psychedelic artists such as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, who in turn were inspired {{by the work of}} the nineteenth-century illustrator Aubrey Beardsley. Referring to London's UFO Club, for which the Hapshash team designed promotional posters, Glynn considers the scene to be a cinematic version of Unlimited <b>Freak</b> <b>Out</b> – [...] "a 'happening' that sought to create a totalising mind-expanding environment involving music, light and people".|$|E
500|$|<b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> is {{the debut}} studio album by the American rock band the Mothers of Invention, {{released}} June 27, 1966, on Verve Records. Often cited {{as one of}} rock music's first concept albums, the album is a satirical expression of frontman Frank Zappa's perception of American pop culture. It {{was also one of}} the earliest double albums in rock music (Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde was originally scheduled to precede it by a week, but its release was delayed until more than a month later), and the first 2-record debut. [...] In the UK the album was originally released as an edited single disc.|$|E

[...] By the time <b>Freak</b> <b>Out!</b> was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25–35,000 of MGM's money. In Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that [...] "Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album." ...|$|E
