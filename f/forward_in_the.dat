5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed <b>forward.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Minichiello {{holds the}} record for the most first grade games (302), having surpassed Luke Ricketson's tally of 301 matches in round 3 of the finals in 2014.

Fitzgibbon also broke the all-time point scoring record for a <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later rounds of 2006. Dave Brown's tally of 45 points (five tries and 15 goals) in a single match against Canterbury in 1935 remains a competition record after more than seven decades. Ivan Cleary scored 284 points in 1998, which at the time was an all-time points scoring record in a season.|$|E

5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story.|$|E
5|$|Led by the Elias-Arnott-Sykora line (The A Line) {{on offense}} and the goaltending of Brodeur (who {{appeared}} in a record 97 games between {{the regular season and}} playoffs), the Devils reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the second-straight year in 2001. They lost the series to the Colorado Avalanche despite leading 3–2. John Madden became the first player in franchise history to win the Frank J. Selke Trophy for top defensive <b>forward.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2001–02 season, they were expected to be contenders once again, and they finished the season as the third-best team in the Atlantic Division, with 95 points.

5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1991–92 season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and {{replaced}} by his assistant Rudy Tomjanovich, a former Houston player himself.

5|$|Muslim {{reaction}} {{ranged from}} those believing in literal creation from the Quran to many educated Muslims who subscribed to {{a version of}} theistic or guided evolution in which the Quran reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval madrasahs taught the ideas of Al-Jahiz, a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection. However, acceptance of evolution remains low in the Muslim world, as prominent figures reject evolution's underpinning philosophy of materialism as unsound to human origins and a denial of Allah. Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western world.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of the final for the 2012 Contest, the chief {{executive}} of SVT, Eva Hamilton, stated to the Swedish media that various venues in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö were being considered for hosting the 2013 Contest.

This proposal was dismissed as unfeasible by SVT, which declared that the contest would be hosted in only one city.|$|E

Rolle was listed as the eighth-best power <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> class of 2005 and 32nd overall recruit by Rivals.com.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson's primary {{offensive}} attribute is his shot. Rather {{than relying}} on stickhandling in the offensive zone, his primary tendency is to direct the puck towards the net, hoping for a rebound. Before becoming an offensive threat later in his career, he established himself first as a defensively responsible <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHL, earning time on the penalty kill and against opposing team's top players. Strong on his skates, he is also noted to play aggressively, as well. As a result, Samuelsson {{is known as a}} versatile, two-way player.|$|E
5|$|The Fianchetto Variation {{has never}} been {{considered}} particularly dangerous for Black to meet, since White's setup does not put Black's position under immediate pressure. However, it also offers Black no obvious target to attack—the fianchettoed bishop covers e4 and d5 and also protects White's king. Since the same bishop no longer covers the a6-f1 diagonal, White typically plays Nf3-d2-c4 to help defend against Black's queenside expansion. After further preparatory moves such as Bf4 and Re1, White {{may be able to}} push <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre with e2-e4-e5. Noted proponents of the Fianchetto Variation have included strong positional players such as Viktor Korchnoi, Gennadi Sosonko and Predrag Nikolić, and after a recommendation by the influential theorist Boris Avrukh in 2010, the line has become more topical.|$|E
50|$|Brad Johnson (born 18 July 1976 in Hoppers Crossing, Victoria) is {{a former}} Australian rules footballer who was the captain of Australian Football League team Western Bulldogs.
