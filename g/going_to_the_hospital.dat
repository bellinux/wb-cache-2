5|$|Shortly thereafter, Frank is shot by Lucas Goodwin, in an {{assassination}} attempt, and {{falls into a}} coma. While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's vice president Donald Blythe through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> in favor of negotiating a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. When Frank recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill {{for the sole purpose}} of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to pick off the potential running mates. In the ensuing open convention, they publicly endorse Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) for the job, while working behind the scenes to undermine her and ensure that Claire wins enough delegates to be nominated. Meanwhile, she reluctantly honors her mother's request to help her die. She and Frank then use the public sympathy from Elizabeth's death to win the nomination; they are now running mates.|$|E

25|$|Midway {{through the}} 1975 F1 season, Penske {{abandoned}} the troublesome PC1 and started using the March 751. Donohue recently {{had arrived in}} Austria for the Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring race track following the successful closed-course speed record attempt at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama {{just a few days}} earlier. During a practice session for the race, Donohue lost control of his March after a tire failed, sending him careening into the catch fencing at the fastest corner on the track, Vöest Hügel Kurve. A track marshal was killed by debris from the accident, but Donohue {{did not appear to be}} injured significantly. It is said that Donohue's head struck either a catch fencing post or the bottom of the wood frame for an advertising billboard located alongside of the racetrack. A headache resulted, however, and worsened. After <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> of Graz the next day, Donohue lapsed into a coma from a cerebral hemorrhage and died. He was survived by his wife and two sons from his first marriage. Donohue is buried at St. Teresa Cemetery in Summit, New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} party around 3 a.m., {{allegedly}} with bruises and blood stained clothes, Jackie called her three best friends, [...] "Andy", [...] "Randall" [...] and [...] "Cindy", for support. In Rolling Stones version, Jackie's friends discouraged her from <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> {{to protect her}} reputation and because Andy and Randall planned to rush fraternities and worried their association with Jackie might hurt their chances if she reported it. Erdely wrote that Randall was no longer friends with Jackie and, [...] "citing his loyalty to his own frat, declined to be interviewed".|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{finds an}} Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes another 'side operation' via a local agency {{operative}} named Skip (Vince Colosimo) {{and that he}} is to conduct an operation without Ferris' knowledge. Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi, who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house. As he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in such a place and manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam (via 'back channels') corroborates the acceptance of killing by those who remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running [...] "side operations" [...] which interfere and (at least) undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam flower market, and kill at least 75 people.|$|E
5000|$|Phi Mu Alpha's {{national}} philanthropy is the Ossian Everett Mills Music Mission. Created in 1998, the Mills Music Mission is {{a modern-day}} revival of a practice originated by the fraternity's founder, Ossian Everett Mills, {{in the late}} 19th century. Mills was organizer of a [...] "Flower Mission" [...] in Boston in which musicians and assistants would go to Boston's hospitals on Christmas and Easter to sing, play music, and give recitations. The activity was referred <b>to</b> as <b>the</b> [...] "Flower Mission" [...] because prior <b>to</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> <b>the</b> participants would collect flowers from churches after the morning services and distribute them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patients they visited. The Mills Music Mission was adopted as Phi Mu Alpha official national philanthropy in 2003. The focus of this project is rare among fraternity philanthropies since, instead of raising funds to support a selected charity, the fraternity uses the unique talents and interests of its members to personally interact with and lift the spirits of those in need.|$|R

2500|$|The film's {{martial arts}} {{sequences}} were choreographed by Sammo Hung, who also {{worked on the}} choreography for the first film. Prior to principal photography, Hung had undergone a major cardiac surgery. When {{he returned to the}} set, his dramatic scenes in the film were filmed first, with his fight sequences being filmed last. Hung performed his own stunts in the film, which led to him receiving several injuries during filming. While filming a scene, Hung was struck in the face by co-star Darren Shahlavi. He insisted on completing the shoot before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> Not wanting his injuries to hinder the production progress, Hung spent five hours trying to complete the scene before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for four stitches. After the completion of filming, Hung expressed that he was dissatisfied with the fight sequences involving his character, presumably due to his heart condition. He also stated that he plans to challenge Yen in a future film: [...] "Although I'm the martial arts choreographer, our moves were all rather regulated, being confined by the script. So, I made a pact with Donnie Yen to have a rematch next year if the opportunity arises." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fox {{revealed}} that [...] "there's some really big, emotional stuff coming up" [...] {{for the couple}} and that herself and Dawson [...] "spent {{the last three weeks}} of filming crying non-stop". She said that the serial [...] "will really explore Darren and Nancy's relationship this year, and I can't wait to see how it all plays out". Nancy soon feels that she may be pregnant, Fox said that if Nancy were pregnant [...] "It would be great to watch them trying to cope with it", adding that the potential scenes would be [...] "hilarious". Nancy discovers she is pregnant and suffers a pregnancy scare. Fox told an Inside Soap reported that if Nancy suffered a miscarriage the couple's relationship may not survive. Her portrayer explained that Nancy begins to suffer stomach pains and blood loss but believes <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> will solve the problem. Fox said that Nancy is in [...] "quite a lot of pain and is really frightened" [...] and she [...] "knows that there's a real possibility she could lose the baby, but that's too awful for her to contemplate". Nancy suffers a miscarriage which Fox said is a [...] "really traumatic time" [...] for both Nancy and Darren. She said that Nancy feels like she has [...] "failed, which is something she doesn't deal with very well". The actress added that the miscarraige will [...] "be a really difficult thing for her to ever get over". Fox {{revealed that}} the scenes took [...] "three or four weeks" [...] to film the [...] "quite intense" [...] material. She felt that the scripts for the scenes were [...] "some of the best scripts I've ever had. The way that it was written just felt really true, and it wasn't hard to conjure up that emotion". Speaking on This Morning, Fox said she was stopped in the street by people who praised the storyline as being true to life which she said was [...] "overwhelming". Dawson felt the storyline was being [...] "very true to life" [...] as the scenes are [...] "what people go through. It's nice that they're holding onto that and it doesn't just end there. It's an ongoing thing like any relationship, so it's just nice to do it justice. The feedback's been great".|$|E
60|$|This {{friendliness}} {{was everything}} to Mr. Quiverful. To him, {{even in his}} poverty, the {{thought that he was}} supplanting a brother clergyman so kind and courteous as Mr. Harding had been very bitter. Under his circumstances it had been impossible for him to refuse the proffered boon; he could not reject the bread that was offered to his children, or refuse to ease the heavy burden that had so long oppressed that poor wife of his; nevertheless, it had been very grievous to him to think that in <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> he might encounter the ill-will of his brethren in the diocese. All this Mr. Harding had fully comprehended. It was for such feelings as these, for the nice comprehension of such motives, that his heart and intellect were peculiarly fitted. In most matters of worldly import the archdeacon set down his father-in-law as little better than a fool. And perhaps he was right. But in some other matters, equally important if they be rightly judged, Mr. Harding, had he been so minded, might with as much propriety have set down his son-in-law for a fool. Few men, however, are constituted as was Mr. Harding. He had that nice appreciation of the feelings of others which belongs of right exclusively to women.|$|E
