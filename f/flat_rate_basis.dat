40|$|Until the {{introduction}} of SEUROP system, price negotiation between pig producers and slaughterhouses was based on two subjective criteria: animal weight and visual inspection {{of the quality of}} pigs. To ensure producers a fair payment, European Union created the possibility of binding the price on two objective factors: carcass weight and carcass composition. This paper describes the pricing mechanism developed by Romania in order to respond to European Union requirements for ensuring a fair payment to pig producers. It raises the attention on the difficulties encountered by the producers in understanding the way the commercial value of a pig carcass is calculated in case the selling price is negotiated on a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>basis</b> or on a lean content basis (per kg of carcass weight or per kg of live weight) ...|$|E

40|$|The Social Security Scheme was {{launched}} in 1990, covering formal sector private employees for non-work related sickness, maternity and invalidity including cash benefits and funeral grants. The scheme is financed by tripartite contributions from government, employers and employees, each of 1. 5 % of payroll (total of 4. 5 %). The scheme decided to pay health care providers, whether public or private, on a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> capitation <b>basis</b> to cover both ambulatory and inpatient care. Registration of the insured with a contractor hospital was a necessary consequence of the chosen capitation payment system. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the operation of the scheme, and to explore the implications of capitation payment and registration for utilisation levels and provider behaviour. A key weakness of the scheme's design is suggested to be the initial decision to give employers not employees the responsibility for choosing the registered hospitals. This was done for administrative reasons, but it contributed to low levels of use of the contractor hospitals. In addition, low levels of use were also probably the result of the potential for cream skimming, cost shifting from inpatient to ambulatory care and under-provision of patient care, though since monitoring mechanisms by the Social Security Office were weak, these effects are difficult to detect conclusively. Mechanisms to improve utilisation levels were gradually introduced, such as employee choice of registered hospitals and the formation of sub-contractor networks to improve access to care. A beneficial effect of the capitation payment system was that the Social Security Fund generated substantial reserves and expenditures on sickness benefits were well stabilised. The paper ends by recommending that future policy amendments should be guided by research and empirical findings and that tougher monitoring and enforcement of quality of care standards are required.

3000|$|We {{find that}} cost cap tariffs {{should never be}} chosen over {{pay-per-use}} or <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> plans if consumers are certain about their preferences and consequently in their demand. In this case, the cost cap tariff is always dominated by either the pay-per-use plan or the <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> However, if consumers have uncertainty in their preferences, the cost cap tariff may generate a higher (expected) consumer surplus than a pay-per-use plan or a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> This holds true even though consumers are charged more at the margin than in a pay-per-use tariff and the maximum possible bill amount is higher under a cost cap compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tariff. This is because the cost cap tariff does not only provide cost insurance in case of high demand (like a <b>flat</b> <b>rate),</b> but also cost flexibility in case of low demand (like a pay-per-use tariff). The main research questions that are addressed are (1) under which conditions are cost cap tariffs potentially chosen (over pay-per-use plans and <b>flat</b> <b>rates)?</b> and (2) what {{is the impact of}} demand uncertainty on tariff choice?

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to give insights into the production, income and environmental effects of the introduction of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> for Dutch agriculture that is lower than the present average direct income payment. For this purpose, a detailed agri-environmental programming model for Dutch agriculture is used. Results of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario are compared to a reference scenario comparing agricultural production in the Netherlands in 2020 in a situation without a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> Results show that total gross margin in Dutch agriculture decreases because of the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> with 7 %. The supply of starch potatoes and cow milk decreases most. Production of seed and consumption potatoes, vegetables and intensive livestock products increases slightly. This is largely due to a shift of farm payments from milk and starch potatoes production to arable crops and vegetable production. It was found that including risk aversion of income volatility amplifies these effects. In the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario total emissions of nutrients from agricultural production to the environment decreases...|$|R

Based on industry survey data, we conduct a simulation of a random number generation method for consumer demand and Internet access hours.

Possibly, consumers in our model prefer a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> to a measured tariff, even though this choice does not minimize their expected billing amount - a behavior in line with ample empirical evidence. We solve for the profit-maximizing two-part tariff, which is a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> if (a) marginal costs are not too high, (b) loss aversion is intense, and (c) there are strong variations in demand. Moreover, we analyze the optimal nonlinear tariff. This tariff has a large flat part when a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> is optimal among the class of two-part tariffs...|$|R
