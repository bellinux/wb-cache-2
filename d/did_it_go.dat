The ad worked brilliantly to reveal, via its framing, an essential but previously hidden truth: the Bush Administration and its active supporters have betrayed {{the trust of the}} troops and the American people." [...] Liberal blogger Arianna Huffington argued that [...] "Was the MoveOn ad blunt? Yes. <b>Did</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> for the ? No doubt. But while the way it chose to make its points can be debated, the accuracy of those points cannot." [...] Anti-war activist and Congressional candidate Cindy Sheehan stated that [...] "I have often been critical of MoveOn.org, basically because I feel, for the most part that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy... The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and I applaud MoveOn for moving a little closer to the true 'anti-war' movement and encourage them to come with us farther." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back in Black was {{released}} on 25 July 1980, {{less than half a}} year after Scott's death. AC/DC were nervous about the future, with Angus saying they were a [...] "bit jittery" [...] during recording. However, the album proved to ease the band's worries, as it became their best selling, most popular and critically respected album. Not only <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> to no. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, its success meant AC/DC were the first band since The Beatles to have four albums in the British Top 100 simultaneously, as Highway to Hell, If You Want Blood You've Got It, and Let There Be Rock all re-entered the charts right after Back in Black {{was released}}. In the US, the single [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long"/"Have a Drink on Me" [...] became AC/DC's first Top 40 hit in the country, peaking at no. 35. The title track, along with [...] "Hells Bells", [...] "Shoot to Thrill", [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long", and [...] "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution" [...] all became fan favorites and staples of the band's live performances. The other songs on Back in Black were largely ignored after the mid-1980s although [...] "What Do You Do for Money Honey" [...] was revived during the 2001 tour. The 2015 tour brought back [...] "Have a Drink on Me" [...] and [...] "Given the Dog a Bone".|$|E

60|$|All {{that was}} left of the noblesse in Picardy had flocked that day to the Chateau de Bellecour, and the company there {{assembled}} numbered perhaps some thirty gallants and some twenty ladies. A banquet there had been, which in the main was a gloomy function, for the King's death was too recent a matter to be utterly lost sight of. Later, however, as the generous supply of wine did its work and so far thawed the ice of apprehension that bound their souls as to dispose them to enjoy, at least, the present hour in forgetfulness, there was a better humour in the air. This developed, and so far indeed <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> that in the evening a Pavane was suggested, and, the musicians being found, it was held in the great salon of the Chateau.|$|E

60|$|Like {{a prudent}} father, therefore, he {{determined}} to nip this passion in the bud, and forbade the youngster the house, though sorely <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> against his fatherly heart, and many a silent tear did it cause {{in the bright}} eye of his daughter. She showed herself, however, a pattern of filial piety and obedience. She never pouted and sulked; she never flew {{in the face of}} parental authority; she never fell into a passion, or fell into hysterics, as many romantic novel-read young ladies would do. Not she, indeed! She was none such heroical rebellious trumpery, I warrant ye. On the contrary, she acquiesced like an obedient daughter; shut the street-door in her lover's face, and if ever she did grant him an interview, it was either out of the kitchen window, or over the garden fence.|$|E

6000|$|... (1.) Man, {{when the}} Lord Jesus takes him in hand {{to make him}} partaker of the benefit, is found an enemy to his redeemer; nor doth all the {{intelligence}} {{that he has had}} of the grace and love of Christ to such, mollify him at all, to wit, before the day of God's power comes (Rom 4:5, 5:7-10). And this is a strange thing. Had man, though he could not have come to Christ, been willing that Christ should have come to him, it had been something; it would have shewn that he had taken his grace to heart, and considered of it: yea, and {{that he was willing to}} be a sharer in it. But verily here is no such thing; man, though he has free will, yet is willing by no means to be saved God's way, to wit, by Jesus Christ, before (as was said before) the day of God's power comes upon him.

Indeed, he remembered {{he had told her}} that she looked like the Tragic Muse. Could it be that the look was the look of a woman maddened by insult and jealousy, who was meditating some fearful crime? /How did that gun go off?/ He did not see it, and he thanked heaven that he did not, for we are not always so anxious to bring our fellow creatures to justice as we might be, especially when they happen to be young and lovely women. How <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> off? She understood guns; he could see that from the way she handled it. Was it likely that it exploded of itself, or owing to an accidental touch of the trigger? It was possible, but not likely. Still, such things have been known to happen, and {{it would be very difficult}} to prove that it had not happened in this case. If it should be attempted murder it was very cleverly managed, because nobody could prove that it was not accidental. But could it be that this soft, beautiful, baby-faced woman had on the spur of the moment taken advantage of his loaded gun to wreak her jealousy and her wrongs upon her faithless lover? Well, the face is no mirror of the quality of the soul within, and it was possible. Further than that it did not seem to him to be his business to inquire.|$|E

So you see you were spared, Macumazahn, and afterwards you helped to pour out a curse upon Dingaan without becoming a ghost, which is the reason why Panda likes you so well to-day, Panda, the enemy of Dingaan, his brother.

60|$|The weirdness of visions lies {{in their}} sudden appearance, in their {{vividness}} while present, {{and in their}} sudden departure. An incident in the Zoological Gardens {{struck me as a}} helpful simile. I happened to walk to the seal-pond at a moment when a sheen rested on the unbroken surface of the water. After waiting a while I became suddenly aware of the head of a seal, black, conspicuous, [12] and motionless, just as though it had always been there, at a spot on which my eye had rested a moment previously and seen nothing. Again, after a while my eye wandered, and on its returning to the spot the seal was gone. The water had closed in silence over its head without leaving a ripple, and the sheen {{on the surface of the}} pond was as unbroken as when I first reached it. Where did the seal come from, and whither <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>go?</b> This could easily have been answered if the glare had not obstructed the view of the movements of the animal under water. As it was, a solitary link in a continuous chain of actions stood isolated from all the rest. So it is with the visions; a single stage in a series of mental processes emerges into the domain of consciousness. All that precedes and follows lies outside of it, and its character can only be inferred. We see in a general way that a condition of the presentation of visions lies in the over-sensitiveness of certain tracks or domains of brain action and the under-sensitiveness of others, certain stages in a mental process being represented very vividly in consciousness while the other stages are unfelt; also that individualism is changed to dividualism.|$|E
