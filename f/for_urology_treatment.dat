5000|$|Professor Tipu Sultan from Bahria University {{has argued}} that while the {{government}} has focused on improving hospital quality {{in the hope of}} attracting medical tourists, [...] "terrorism in Pakistan is scaring away potential health customers." [...] He adds that Pakistan could offer services to foreigners in orthopedic, optometric, ENT, heart, and <b>urology</b> <b>treatments</b> at cheap rates besides offering facilities in endoscopies, X-rays, MRI, CT scan, cardiology, and arthroscopy. Commenting on patients from the United States of Pakistani origin who come to Pakistan instead of going to neighboring India to receive treatment, Sultan has said that treatment in Pakistan for them tends to be much cheaper than in India [...] "because of the downward slide of the rupee in terms of the dollar." [...] He has also said that while there are good national hospitals, they have not shown enough interest in medical tourism.|$|R

Of the PROMs use reported, 35 % were in mental health, 15 % <b>for</b> <b>urology</b> and 10 % were for sleep apnoea; however, 15 % of tools GPs reported using were not PROMs. The most cited reasons for using PROMs were as an aid to clinical management (66 %) and as a screening or diagnostic tool (61 %). Time constraints and compulsory completion were reported as the biggest barriers to engaging with PROMs in clinical practice. GPs would prefer to use PROMs that are well integrated with their clinical systems.|$|R
