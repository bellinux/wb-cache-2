40|$|Chicken {{eggs are}} {{commonly}} incubated for 17 to 18 d in setters, {{after which they}} are transferred to the hatchery for the last 3 to 4 d of incubation. Whereas eggs are positioned vertically with the air cell up during the first incubation phase, they are placed horizontally for the hatching phase. It is unknown whether <b>egg</b> <b>position</b> in the last phase of incubation is of importance to the hatching process and chick quality. An experiment was conducted to investigate effects of <b>egg</b> <b>position</b> in the last 4 d of incubation on the hatching process and chick quality. The experiment consisted of 2 identical trials, where 300 fertile eggs per trial were transferred to a hatching cabinet at embryo day 17. Eggs were placed in 1 of 3 positions: with the air cell up (ACU), with the air cell down, or horizontally (HOR). Starting at embryo day 18, the following data were collected for each egg at 3 -h intervals: time of internal pipping (IP), external pipping (EP), hatching, and position of EP. Approximately 6 h after hatch, BW, chick length, and chick quality based on the Pasgar score, were determined for each chick. In addition, residual yolk weight and yolk-free body mass were determined in every fourth chick that hatched. Time of IP was not affected by <b>egg</b> <b>position,</b> but EP occurred 5 h later in ACU eggs, and thus, the IP-EP interval was increased by 3 to 4 h in this group compared with the other egg positions. Hatching occurred 1 to 2 h earlier in HOR eggs than in the other 2 positions. Body weight, yolk weight, and yolk-free body mass were not affected by <b>egg</b> <b>position.</b> Chick length was 1 to 2 mm shorter and the Pasgar score was slightly lower in air cell-down eggs compared with ACU and HOR eggs, mainly caused by {{a high incidence of}} poor navel quality, red hocks, and red beaks. Hatchability was not affected by <b>egg</b> <b>position.</b> We concluded that <b>egg</b> <b>position</b> in the last phase of incubation affects the duration of the hatching process, and has small effects on chick quality...|$|E
40|$|Mutualism often {{involves}} reciprocal exploitation due to individual selection for increased benefits {{even at the}} expense of the partner. Therefore, stability and outcomes of such interactions crucially depend on cost limitation mechanisms. In the plant, pollinator /seed predator interaction between Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae) and Hadena bicruris (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), moths generate pollination benefits as adults but impose seed predation costs as larvae. We examined whether floral morphology limits over-exploitation by constraining oviposition site. Oviposition site varies naturally inside vs. outside the corolla tube, but neither its determinants nor its effect on the interaction have been investigated. In a common garden with plants originating from eight populations, corolla tube length predicted oviposition site, but not egg presence or pollination efficiency, suggesting that long corolla tubes constrain the moth to lay eggs on petals. <b>Egg</b> <b>position</b> was also predicted by the combined effect of corolla tube and moth ovipositor lengths, with shorter ovipositor than corolla tube resulting in higher probability for eggs outside. <b>Egg</b> <b>position</b> on a given plant was repeatable over different exposure nights. When <b>egg</b> <b>position</b> was experimentally manipulated, eggs placed on the petal resulted in significantly fewer successful fruit attacks compared with eggs placed inside the corolla tube, suggesting differences in egg/larval mortality. <b>Egg</b> <b>position</b> also differently affected larval mass, fruit mass and fruit development. Our results indicate that constraining oviposition site through a long corolla tube reduces seed predation costs suffered by the plant without negatively affecting pollination efficiency and, hence may act to limit over-exploitation. However, the net effects of corolla tube depth variation on this interaction may fluctuate with extrinsic factors affecting egg mortality, and with patterns of gene flow affecting trait matching between the interacting species. The intermediate fitness costs incurred by both plant and insect associated with the different egg positions may reduce selective pressures for this interaction to evolve towards antagonism, favouring instead a mutualistic outcome. While a role for oviposition site variation in cost limitation is a novel finding in this system, it may apply more generally also to other mutualisms involving pollinating seed predators...|$|E

Average of 822 eggs (274 eggs in each line) was 14. 19, 12. 02 and 10. 2 in HW, C and LW, respectively, all at 13 weeks of age. Based on eggs positions during incubation were divided into two experimental groups (137 eggs in each group in each line: vertical position with small end up, vertical position with small end down with turning). The eggs incubated in vertical and small end down had the higher hatchability (59. 2 %), while those incubated in vertical position with small end up presented the lower hatchability (8. 5 %). <b>Egg</b> <b>position</b> influenced water loss during incubation.

At fortnightly intervals, 3 unfouled and 3 biofouled egg strands were sampled from 6 to 23 distinct egg masses (Neggs = 2649). Highly significant variation was noted between sample dates {{in the frequency of}} unfertilised eggs, developmental abnormalities and egg mortalities. Unfertilised eggs were only found during late October and early November and represented a mean 2. 12 plus or minus 1. 25 % SE and 0. 58 plus or minus 0. 58 % SE eggs per strand respectively. Frequency of abnormality varied significantly between sample dates and ranged from 8. 35 plus or minus 1. 86 % SE eggs per strand in late November to 0. 92 plus or minus 0. 41 % SE in late December. Abnormalities were arbitrarily categorised as defects in external yolk sac morphology, reduced embryonic size, mantle deformities, eye deformities and arm deformities. Defects in external yolk sac morphology were found throughout the spawning season and accounted for 46. 3 % of all abnormalities. Incidence of mortality varied significantly between sample dates and ranged from 1. 40 plus or minus 0. 68 % SE per strand in late October to 11. 61 plus or minus 3. 23 % SE in early January.

The ultramicroscopic changes in the infundibulum and magnum were compared with control hens which had eggs at different positions in the oviduct. The ciliated and granular cells of the surface epithelia and secretory epithelial cells of the tubular glands were the target cells of IBV. No pathological changes were recorded during 2 – 8 days post-infection (p. i.). Patchy loss of cilia occurred at 10 – 14 days p. i. Between 16 and 24 days p. i., there was no cilia loss and lymphoid nodules were observed in the muscularis layer of the infundibulum and magnum of some hens from both infected groups. Virus particles were detected mostly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi complex between 10 and 12 days p. i. Cytopathology was noticed in various cell organelles between the 10 th and 14 th days p. i. There {{was an increase in}} RER deposits in infected cells, irrespective of <b>egg</b> <b>position</b> in the oviduct. The magnum was more affected than the infundibulum. Cellular changes were more severe in the infundibulum and magnum of T-infected hens as compared to N 1 / 88 -infected hens.

IBV can cause pathology in parts of the fully functional oviduct which may persist up to the 30 th day p. i. However, both the challenge strains of IBV can cause a small number of hens to cease production.

Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah dengan membuat alat uji untuk mengubah posisi telur, selanjutnya menguji panjang lintasan rol pengarah, jarak sumbu rol pengarah dan grade telur terhadap perubahan posisi telur. Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk membuktikan pengaruh panjang lintasan dan jarak sumbu rol pengarah serta grade telur terhadap perubahan posisi telur untuk mencapai posisi sejajar dengan rol pengarah. Hasil pengujian menunjukkan bahwa panjang lintasan dan jarak sumbu rol pengarah memiliki pengaruh yang sangat signifikan terhadap perubahan posisi telur, sedangkan grade telur memiliki pengaruh signifikan terhadap perubahan posisi telur. Jarak sumbu rol semakin lebar dan ukuran telur semakin kecil akan mendapatkan hasil yang semakin baik, hal ini ditunjukkan dengan perubahan posisi telur sejajar rol pengarah semakin cepat tercapai.

40|$|The olive (Olea europaea L.), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cultivated tree in Italy and all around the eastern Mediterranean Basin. This species is characterized by a germplasm that includes a huge number of varieties, spread in different areas. Among the molecular markers available to study genetic variability in olive, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) are among the most interesting for varietal identification, because they are codominant, informative and reproducible. In most of the collections varietal identification hasn’t been completed and really few agronomic feature have been methodically estimated. Cases of synonymy and homonimy are still very common, often because of mistakes in name transcription of a particular variety (Rao et al., 2009). Nevertheless at present for the olive we have available some methods, whose complementary use allow us a correct identification of cultivated vegetal material. Among several molecular markers used in olive, the microsatellits (SSR) are considered the markers by excellence, thanks to their codominant nature and to their discriminant capability and their being reproducible different labs. The main aim of the present thesis was to evaluate the genetic variability of olive varieties cultivated in Southern Italy using SSR markers. Twenty-six olive cultivars from Campania and twenty-one of nearby areas were analysed at six SSR loci. Campania is a region characterised by a morphologically diverse varieties able of producing selected and typical oils. The SSR loci were chosen from the literature for their high discriminating power and for their capability of supplying a high number of alleles. All SSR primer couples provided a clear amplification profile and turned out to be polymorphic in the population analysed. The two loci with the highest discriminating power were the DCA 3 and the DCA 16, in accordance with what had been reported in literature (Alba et al., 2009). High values of genetic diversity (He) and of discriminating power (D) were found in most of the SSR loci used, pointing out a high polymorphism among the olive cultivars analysed. A total of 81 different alleles were found, and both the mean heterozygosity and the discriminating power were on average high. All the cultivars had a unique profile, with the exception of the ‘Uova di Pavone’ and ‘Sant’ Agostino’ cultivars. These genotypes should be further analysed to define if they are a case of possible synonymy. The genetic relations among the examined varieties were studied through hierarchical analysis by UPGMA algorithm. The dendrogram indicated that most of the accessions from Campania are genetically different from those from neighbouring areas. The possible usefulness of the identified SSR profiles in the agro-food chain was also investigated. The DNA isolated from leaves, fruits or mono-varietal olive oils of three cultivars (‘Frantoio’, ‘Pisciottana’ and ‘Leccino’) was isolated and analysed with the six SSR primer pairs. The result indicated that SSR profile are conserved in the olive-food chain and therefore, SSR profiling is a valid tool for olive oil chain genetic traceability. However, some issues such as the sensitivity of the method and its ability of identifying varieties in complex mixtures, still need to be further investigated. The results of the genetic fingerprint of the here analysed cultivars underlined the richness and the possible specific nature of the olive from Campania. The SSRs’ profiles gave us valuable information that can be use to protect both the genetic material and mono-varietal oils. Furthermore, the data confirmed the genetic richness of regional germplasm, implying the necessity of measures to protect neglected traditional varieties. Our results pointed out that it’s possibile to identify DNA from two olive cultivars in a 1 : 1 DNA mixture, while it’s not possibile when DNA of each cultivar, which makes the blend, has a proportion lower than 50 %, as demonstrated from previous literature (Breton et al., 2004). Although we should still check any problems connected with sensitivity and efficacy of method that is used for identification of varietal composition even in more complex oil blends, we can however state that DNA markers through PCR technology are a valid tool for assuring genetic traceability in any stage of the olive oil chain, their correspondence to DOP and IGP labels, and at last finished product quality, guaranteeing farmers, producers and consumers and even preventing them from any frauds. Thanks to increasing attention to the protection biodiversity, several olive germplasm ex-situ collections were developed to safeguard and to promote the use of genetic resources in farming. Management, evaluation and use of wide germplasm collections can be inefficient, mainly because the high number of genotypes present in collection and the unfeasibility of analysing with sufficient details all the accessions conserved. The establishment of a core set is a valid help for assessing, characterizing, and using a germplasm collections. Using SSR molecular markers data already available, five different core subset were built and evaluated using three different algorithms. This analysis was carried out on the World Olive Germplasm Bank (WOGB) of Cordoba. Among the six different strategies used for construction of five core subsets, only the sampling strategy based on Core Hunter algorithm, which simultaneously maximizes two genetic measures (the average modified Rogerss' distance and Nei's index) allowed to get the highest values of genetic parameters considered. This is in agreement with what literature reported (Thachuk et al., 2009). 133 and 151 genotypes were necessary to capture 99 % of 236 alleles of the whole initial collection. A basic requirement for the use and preservation of olive germplasm is not only a careful genetic characterization, but also an accurate evaluation of plants sanitary conditions. It is essential to have a qualified nursery propagation equipment, in conformity with sanitary regulations that impose the genetic correspondence to a defined genotype as well as lack of those diseases, caused by pathogens and viruses, in young olive plants. For this reason, 174 WOGB accessions were analysed by molecular techniques to screen for the presence of 40 pathogens and 3 viruses. The olive fly Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) is the key pest of cultivated olive in the Mediterranean Basin. Infestation caused by the olive fruit fly caused direct and indirect damages. The direct damages are caused by active infestation, which consists in the destruction of the pulp fiction and as consequence, premature fruit drop. Furthermore, the fly also causes an alteration of olive oil’s qualitative parameters. The indirect damages are due to fungal and bacterial infestations, which start at the <b>egg</b> <b>position</b> and spread with the larval feeding tunnels. The control of olive fruit fly is essentially pursued by pesticide treatments, which are costly and have negative impact on the environment or human health. Alternative control methods are mass trapping, barrier films, combined treatments as mass trapping and application of kaolin clay or biological control. However such methods are not always effective as desired The availability of olive cultivars with low susceptibility to the fly could represent an important tool in strategies of integrated management of the B. oleae. It is known that morphological, physical, and chemical parameters, in addition to environmental conditions, are involved in the level of susceptibility of olive cultivars to fruit fly attacks. For example, some low susceptible olive cultivars have higher quantities of oleuropeine or cianidine compounds (Iannotta et al., 1999). It was proposed that the degree of cultivars susceptibility to fly infestation depends on the ability of the β-glucosidase enzyme to cleave oleuropeine and/or on the availability of oleuropeine to undergo the cleavage (Iannotta et al., 2007). On the contrary no information is available on the defence genes active against B oleae and on the molecular response of olive fruits to the fly infestation. It is known, that the molecular interaction between plants and herbivores originates both up and down regulation of a large number of genes encoding proteins involved in defense mechanisms and signaling, secondary metabolism, abiotic stress and photosynthesis, beside many genes with unknown functions. (Hermsmeier et al., 2001). Therefore, the study of the variation of the transcripts abundance occurring in infested olive fruit tissue, will provide novel information on olive sequences responding to B. oleae infestation and on their involvement in defence. In this frame an useful experimental approach, is the SSH (Suppression Subtractive Hybridization) technique. We used this strategy in order to isolate differentially expressed olive sequences occurring in infested tissue. In addition, we monitored the expression of up-regulated genes in different olive cultivars. For characterization of differential expressed genes in reaction to the fruit fly, a subtractive library was constructed through Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) method. The library was constructed subtracting mRNAs from un-attacked fruits of cultivar ‘Moraiolo’ from mRNAs isolated from with larval feeding tunnel. Among the 590 clones of the library, 219 were sequenced, having an insert size longer than 200 bp. In order to assign a putative function to the different transcripts, similarity analysis was carried out with tblastx algorithm. Approximately 70 % of transcripts showed a significant similarity with coding sequences of different plant species (e-value < 0. 001) mainly Vitis vinifera; among them 113 sequences had similarity with transcripts coding for known protein and 106 with transcripts coding for unknown protein. Only 48 % of the ESTs were classified into functional category (Biological process, Molecular Function, Cellular component) most likely as consequence of the very little information available on olive genome. The molecular functions of EST sequences, underline the complexity of olive molecular response to the fruit fly. The differential expression validation of the most interesting transcripts was performed by Real time PCR. Eight transcripts putatively involved in defence mechanisms, turned out to be overexpressed in olive fruits infested through larval feeding tunnel. Four transcripts showed a weak overexpression level, with RQ values variable from 1, 29 to 2, 28. Nevertheless differences in expression turned out to be statistically significant, when t-student test was performed. The transcripts most overexpressed in drupes with larval feeding tunnel, with RQ from 2, 3 to 8, 7, were similar to those coding a protein related to pathogenesis (Oe-PR 27), to a lipoxygenase (Oe-LOX) and to a chitinase (Oe-Chitinase). We thought to evaluate the relative expression of the latter transcripts also in a different olive variety (‘Leccino’) and at two different stages (drupes with sign of oviposition stings and drupes with larval feeding tunnel). The overexpression of the three transcripts in the two attack biological stages was confirmed. Finally, in order to get the complete transcripts sequence RACE-PCR experiments were conducted. Two full lenght cDNA (Oe-Chitinase and Oe-PR 27) were recovered by the 3 ’ and 5 ’ RACE-PCR. The amino acid sequences coded by these two genes was of 229 aa and 268 aa respectively. Our data demonstrated that the molecular response of olives drupes to B. oleae infestation is complex and involves numerous molecular functions. As expected, this molecular response implicates alterations of primary and secondary metabolism. We identified three genes that are up-regulated in infested olive fruits. Homologues of the identified sequences are involved in the molecular response of plant to biotic stress in different species. It will be interesting to verify if the expression profiles of the EST sequences generated in this study are associated to different level of susceptibility of olive cultivars to B. Oleae...|$|E
40|$|Using {{light and}} {{scanning}} electron microscopy, a sensory field consisting of 15 - 20 campaniform sensillae is {{described on the}} base of the stylus of the endophytic ovipositor of Odonata. It is hypothesised that two symmetric styli equipped with this number of sensillae can function as a mechanosensory organ responsible for control of precise <b>egg</b> <b>positioning</b> in plant stems during oviposition. In laboratory experiments with females of damselflies Lestes sponsa and Lestes barbarus (Lestidae), it was demonstrated that the distance between laid eggs is not dependent on the presence of styli. Removal of styli from both sides did not influence a shift of oviposition to one side. Females with one removed stylus shifted the clutch line in the opposite direction toward the removed stylus. Additionally, removal of styli influenced <b>positions</b> of single <b>eggs</b> in egg sets, and disturbed the capacity for complex oviposition. Thus., both morphological and experimental data support the hypothesis that styli participate in the control of egg line and egg patterning in the clutch. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|While {{understanding}} {{heat exchange}} between incubating adults and their eggs {{is central to}} the study of avian incubation energetics, current theory based on thermal measurements from dummy eggs reveals little about the mechanisms of this heat exchange or behavioural implications for the incubating bird. For example, we know little about how birds distribute their eggs based on temperature differences among <b>egg</b> <b>positions</b> within the nest cup. We studied the great tit Parus major, a species with a large clutch size, to investigate surface cooling rates of individual eggs within the nest cup across a range of ambient temperatures in a field situation. Using state-of-the-art portable infrared imaging and digital photography we tested for associations between egg surface temperature (and rate of cooling) and a combination of egg specific (mass, shape, laying order, position within clutch) and incubation specific (clutch size, ambient temperature, day of incubation) variables. Egg surface temperature and cooling rates were related to the <b>position</b> of the <b>eggs</b> within the nest cup, with outer eggs being initially colder and cooling quicker than central eggs. Between foraging bouts, females moved outer eggs significantly more than centrally <b>positioned</b> <b>eggs.</b> Our results demonstrate that females are capable of responding to individual egg temperature by moving eggs around the nest cup, and that the energy cost to the female may increase as incubation proceeds. In addition, our results showing that smaller clutches experience lower initial incubation temperatures and cool quicker than larger clutches warrant further attention for optimal clutch size theory and studies of energetic constraints during incubation. Finally, researchers using dummy eggs to record egg temperature have ignored important elements of contact-incubation, namely the complexity of how eggs cool and how females respond to these changes.

5000|$|A popular Easter {{tradition}} {{in some parts}} of the world is the decoration of hard-boiled eggs (usually by dyeing, but often by spray-painting). Adults often hide the eggs for children to find, an activity known as an Easter egg hunt. A similar tradition of egg painting exists in areas of the world influenced by the culture of Persia. Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year tradition (called Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and sets them together in a bowl. The tradition of a dancing egg is held during the feast of Corpus Christi in Barcelona and other Catalan cities since the 16th century. It consists of an emptied <b>egg,</b> <b>positioned</b> over the water jet from a fountain, which starts turning without falling. Although a food item, eggs are sometimes thrown at houses, cars, or people. This act, known commonly as [...] "egging" [...] in the various English-speaking countries, is a minor form of vandalism and, therefore, usually a criminal offense and is capable of damaging property (egg whites can degrade certain types of vehicle paint) as well as causing serious eye injury. On Halloween, for example, trick or treaters have been known to throw eggs (and sometimes flour) at property or people from whom they received nothing. Eggs are also often thrown in protests, as they are inexpensive and nonlethal, yet very messy when broken.|$|R
40|$|To date, {{there are}} {{numerous}} transport simulation studies demonstrating {{the relevance of the}} hydrodynamics for the advection, dispersion and recruitment of early stages of marine organisms. However, the lack of data has conditioned the use of realistic locations for the model setup and configuration in transport studies. This work (I) demonstrates the key role played by the use of the realistic initial <b>position</b> of the <b>eggs</b> of small pelagic fishes in the analysis of late-larval recruitment in coastal nursery areas and (II) provides a general solution for deriving future <b>egg</b> <b>positions</b> and abundances from adult biomass obtained from acoustic surveys and available fecundity data. Using European anchovy in the NW Mediterranean as a case study, we first analyzed the impact of the initial location, timing, egg buoyancy and diel vertical migration of larvae on the potential late-larval recruitment to coastal areas. The results suggested that prior knowledge of the initial spawning grounds may substantially affect the estimates of potential recruitment. We then integrated biological and acoustics-derived data (the biomass and size structure, sex ratio, a weight-batch fecundity model, mean weight, number of fish and mean spawning) to build a predictive model for interannual egg production. This model was satisfactorily contrasted with field data for two years obtained with the Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM). We discuss our results {{in the context of the}} fluctuations of European anchovy egg abundance from 2003 through 2010 in the NW Mediterranean and in terms of th...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of 2 {{strains of}} infectious bronchitis virus (T and N 1 / 88 strains) was {{studied in the}} eggshell-forming regions of the oviduct of commercial laying hens. There were no external shell deformities, except for paler shells. There was no decline in egg production in either of the infected groups. One hen from the N 1 / 88 -infected group and 2 hens from the T-infected group were out of lay. The light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopic changes in infected shell-forming regions of the oviduct were compared with the control oviducts at different <b>egg</b> <b>positions.</b> The ultrastructural finding revealed that the extent of cytopathology in the isthmus was greater than in the tubular shell gland and shell gland pouch. The T strain of infectious bronchitis virus was more pathogenic compared with the N 1 / 88 strain. Severe cytopathology was recorded in the shell-forming region of hens that were out of production, and virus particles were observed in hens that had stopped laying. Virus particles were recorded in the dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex of the isthmus, tubular shell gland, and shell gland pouch of all 3 hens that had stopped laying. Although a decrease in egg production and deterioration in eggshell quality were not observed in this trial, cessation of egg production in {{a small number of}} hens could be due to severe cytopathology in the eggshell-forming regions of the oviduct.

40|$|The ultrastructural changes {{occurring}} in the fully functional oviduct of Isa Brown laying hens were studied during various stages of the laying cycle. Hens were killed at different <b>positions</b> of the <b>egg</b> in the oviduct. The oviduct was lined by ciliated and non-ciliated cells (also referred to as granular cells). The granular cells in the infundibulum contributed to secretion during egg formation, whereas ciliated cells showed little evidence of secretion. Ultrastructural changes were recorded in the granular and glandular cells of the distal infundibulum. In the magnum, the surface ultrastructure revealed glandular openings associated with the ciliated and granular cells. Cyclic changes were recorded in the glandular cells of the magnum. With respect to the three observed types of glands, the structure of gland type A and C cells varied at different <b>egg</b> <b>positions</b> in the oviduct, whereas type B cells represented {{a different type of}} gland cell containing amorphous secretory granules. The surface epithelium of the isthmus was also lined by mitochondrial cells. Two types of glandular cell (types 1 and 2) were recorded in the isthmus during the laying cycle. Intracisternal granules were found in type 2 cells of the isthmus. A predominance of glycogen particles occurred in the tubular shell gland. The granular cells in the shell gland contain many vacuoles. During egg formation, these vacuoles regressed following the formation of extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum; the reverse also occurred. The disintegrated material found in the vacuoles may have been derived from the disintegrating granules. K. K. Chousalkar and J. R. Robert...|$|R
40|$|The Greater Ani (Crotophaga major) is a neotropical cuckoo {{in which}} several females lay {{eggs in a}} single nest. Group members {{synchronize}} egg laying and compete for reproduction by ejecting early-laid eggs from the communal nest. Eggs are large (∼ 17 % of female body mass) and vary greatly in size. I assessed the effects of egg size, hatching asynchrony, and position in the laying order on the survival and growth of nestlings {{to test the hypothesis}} that females invest more resources in eggs that are likely to give rise to surviving offspring. The <b>egg's</b> <b>position</b> in the female's laying sequence {{was a significant predictor of}} egg mass, with first-laid eggs and last-laid eggs consistently smaller than those in the middle of the clutch. Females that initiated laying in the communal nest almost always lost their first-laid eggs, and these females also exhibited the most extreme variation in egg mass. Nestlings from last-laid eggs were more likely to hatch asynchronously and starve before fledging, and the mass of last-laid eggs decreased as the degree of hatching asynchrony increased. Ejection and starvation probabilities were not affected by egg mass; therefore, low survivorship of first-laid and last-laid eggs was due solely to their position in the laying order, not to their smaller size. These data suggest that individual females allocate more resources to eggs that are likely to survive to fledging and that reproductive competition among communally breeding females explains much of the variation in egg size in this species.

50|$|Female five-lined skinks {{demonstrate}} {{high levels}} of parental care which reduces egg mortality. Females exhibit several brooding positions of variant contact levels with the body placed beside, over, through, or in a coil around the <b>eggs.</b> Brooding <b>position</b> varies according to soil moisture. Maternal body contact increases at lower moisture levels potentially reducing transpirational loss of the eggs. In communal nests, females may alternate foraging and guarding of the nests, leaving eggs protected at all times. Females may also urinate in the nests and turn eggs to maintain humidity. In addition, females transfer heat from basking through body contact. Any eggs displaced from the nest are retrieved by head or snout rolling, and rotten eggs are eaten.|$|R
