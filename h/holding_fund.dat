Version: FinalIn 2010, the Managing Authority (MA) in Malta launched the first Financial Engineering Instrument (FEI) under Cohesion policy, taking the form of a loan guarantee scheme entitled the JEREMIE First Loss Portfolio Guarantee Product. This addresses a “financing gap” in Malta wherein enterprises, particularly micro and small, face difficulties in obtaining the necessary financing from banks due to their above-average credit risk and lack of collateral. The JEREMIE scheme utilises funds under Operational Programme (OP) I, Priority Axis (PA) 1 entitled “Enhancing Knowledge and Innovation”, and comprises a <b>holding</b> <b>fund</b> of EUR 10 million to be managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF). The current banking structure in Malta makes such forms of FEIs particularly successful. The JEREMIE scheme is currently the only FEI financed through ERDF in Malta. Although this is true, FEIs, financed through local funds, are not new to the Maltese economy. Unlike loan guarantee schemes, however, not all FEIs have proven to be suitable to the local economy. Venture Capital (VC) funds, for instance, are not economically viable for small ventures that are not engaged in cutting edge innovation. The local authorities realize that although FEIs may effectively generate growth potential for SMEs, non-refundable assistance is still necessary given Malta’s economic structure. Prior to EU accession, non-refundable assistance mainly took the form of tax credits which have been highly successful in retaining investment in Malta as well as attracting new investors to operate locally. Upon EU membership, through improved Community funding opportunities, Malta was better able to diversify its portfolio of assistance to industry and began to offer other forms of nonrefundable assistance, mainly grants. These may be more useful in helping businesses that need imminent and short-term assistance, such as start-ups and micro businesses. Since this type of assistance was lacking prior to EU accession, the authorities have focussed more of their resources on non-refundable assistance in the current programming period under OP IN/...|$|E
