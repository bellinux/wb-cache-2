5|$|One of the Green's {{earliest}} uses was as {{a pasture}} for cattle belonging to {{the residents of the}} town. Dartmouth students resented this use, and in the early 19th century herded all the cattle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of Dartmouth Hall as a protest. The fence constructed during the 1836 renovations was in part a response to this action, and was meant to keep animals out.|$|E

5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse. According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{once again}} {{attempts}} to administer a potential cure to the infected {{woman in his}} laboratory, but the next night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute {{in the back of}} the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont. They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the first}} {{vehicles}} reached the Presidential Palace, the leading column was ambushed and {{came under heavy fire}} from Chechen small arms and rockets, directed from <b>the</b> roofs and <b>basements</b> along <b>the</b> street. The Chechen ambush would typically funnel the Russian armored columns into [...] "killing fields", {{and then the}} RPG gunners would knock out the first and last vehicles in the line, thereby trapping the rest of both battalions in the middle. Almost useless in urban combat, Russian tanks were unable to elevate their tank barrels high enough to engage the top floors of many buildings, or low enough to fire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements.</b>|$|R

5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel {{and a number of other}} prisoners. As the Tripod selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out the pins. The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the other prisoners, making it out alive.|$|E
5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> Stewie {{follows the}} bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E

Hundreds of Polish soldiers were murdered. The rest were beaten and abused. Many civilians were killed or wounded. German troops broke into houses, robbed them, set on fire, and tossed hand grenades <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> filled with scared civilians. Kazimierz Szczerbatko estimated, based on the testimony of the eyewitnesses, that the Germans killed around 500 soldiers and 100 civilians.|$|R

2500|$|Tunnels {{from the}} theater stage trap ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> of two nearby hotels. [...] The tunnels had low {{ceilings}} and were sealed during new {{construction in the}} early 1980s. [...] The tunnels extended south <b>into</b> <b>the</b> San Juan Hotel, where Mr. Beacham happened to have had an office, and then east under Orange Avenue <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Angebilt Hotel. [...] Historians reason {{that the purpose of}} the tunnels may have been either for vaudeville performers to enter the theater from their hotels without being mobbed by crowds, or the tunnels could have been used for the storage and transportation of alcoholic beverages during prohibition as has been discovered at some of the other theaters in the Central Florida area.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> water flooded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> {{of several}} Loop office {{buildings}} and retail stores and an underground shopping district. The city quickly evacuated the Loop and financial district in fear that electrical wires could short out. Electrical power and natural gas went down or were shut off as a precaution {{in much of the}} area. Trading at both the Chicago Board of Trade Building and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ended in mid-morning, having a global effect, as water seeped into their basements. At its height, some buildings had 40 ft of water in their lower levels. However, at the street level there was no water to be seen, as it was all underground.|$|R
