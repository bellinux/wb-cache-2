40|$|Increased safety can {{be carried}} out at the expense the <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>vehicles</b> of {{automatic}} braking systems, that monitor the traffic situation and the actions of the driver. In this paper considered {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} automatic braking systems, were analyzed modern tracking tools that are used in automatic braking systems. Based on the statistical data on accidents, are set the main dangers, that the automatic braking system will be reduced. In order to ensure the accuracy of information conducted research for determination of optimal combination of different sensors that provide an adequate perception of road conditions. The tracking system should be equipped with a combination of sensors, which in the case of detection of an obstacle or dangers of signal is transmitted to the information processing system and decision making. Information from the monitoring system should include data for the identification of the object, its condition, the speed. ...|$|R
2500|$|Vehicles {{produced}} for the German government order were produced in metallic grey with white roofs. The electrical <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> these <b>vehicles</b> {{was a special}} order and kept [...] "luxury" [...] fittings and fixtures to a bare minimum. Four FFR equipped vehicles were produced to facilitate the VHF radios in service at that time with the German government and police authorities. Following the change-over to the Mercedes contract, the federal German government sold their Td5 fleet.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to explain the mechanism of injection of carbamide and its <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> a <b>vehicle.</b> The {{first part of this}} work deals with the reduction of pollutants in the exhaust gases and with the emissions standards which limit the level of pollutants in the exhaust gases. The second part consists of an overview of tractor brands available at Czech market and their classification based on the type of system they use on their new models to reduce the pollutants in the exhaust gases...|$|R
50|$|Tests are {{performed}} {{at a range}} of 5 m, using factory ammunition that has been weighed prior to firing {{to ensure that it}} meets the required norms. The bullet is fired electronically through a military quality barrel with the projectile then passing through a chronograph beam to ensure that it meets the requirements of the ballistic testing standards. The armor-testing samples are maintained at an ambient temperature for 24 hours prior to testing. Samples are removed from each mill lot of armor plate prior to <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> a <b>vehicle</b> and are tested in accordance with the established norms. Upon satisfactory testing, a Certificate of Quality is issued for each sheet.|$|R

50|$|Beginning around 1980, {{there are}} {{nominally}} strict cost-benefit ratio requirements for every safety device, system, or design feature NHTSA mandates for <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>vehicles.</b> That is, the device, system, or design feature {{may not be}} made mandatory unless it will save more money (in property damage, health care, etc.) than it costs, or must cost {{no more than a}} specified amount of money per life saved. Such requirements may be subject to manipulation of estimated costs and estimated benefits to justify or reject almost any standard; FMVSS #208 effectively mandates the installation of frontal airbags in all new vehicles in the United States, for it is written such that no other technology can meet the stipulated requirements. It has been argued that even using conservative cost figures and optimistic benefit figures, airbags' cost-benefit ratio so extreme that it may fall outside of the cost-benefit requirements for mandatory safety devices. These same cost-benefit requirements have been used as the basis for lighting-related lags in American regulations; for example, virtually {{every country in the world}} has since at least the early 1970s required rear turn signals to emit amber light so they can immediately be discerned from adjacent red brake lamps. U.S. regulations still permit rear turn signals to emit red light on grounds of cost-effectiveness despite NHTSA research showing amber rear turn signals instead of red ones give a larger crash-avoidance benefit than the 3rd brake light.|$|R
40|$|Trough antennas are a {{potential}} aperture for installed applications {{due to the}} cavity backing that naturally lends itself to flush-mount <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> a carrying <b>vehicle.</b> Trough antennas radiate via an aperture field and as with all aperture antennas, the radiation characteristics of the antenna are governed by {{the distribution of the}} aperture field, both in terms of magnitude and phase spatial variation. The antenna presented herein is inspired by the half-width microstrip leaky-wave radiator aiming to provide a good near end-fire radiation pattern. The finite element boundary integral (FE-BI) method is used to predict the performance of the cavity backed antenna. In this paper, some details about the FE-BI implementation are presented as well as the initial antenna design...|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of flexible anti-tank missiles, which were capable of <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> almost any <b>vehicle</b> in the 1960s, {{the concept of the}} tank destroyer has morphed into light vehicles with missiles. With the weight of main battle tanks growing to the forty to seventy-tonne range, airborne forces were unable to deploy reasonable anti-tank forces. The result was a number of attempts to make a light vehicle, including the conventional ASU-85, the recoilless rifle-armed Ontos, and missile-armed Hornet Malkara armored car and Sheridan light assault vehicle. The latest entry into that category is the 2S25 Sprut-SD, armed with a current-issue 125 mm tank gun that is also capable of launching missiles like the 9M119 Svir.|$|R
40|$|Pyramid-shaped polymer {{solar cells}} {{fabricated}} on flexible substrates were investigated. Effective light trapping {{can be realized}} due to light reflection in all 360 degrees directions, and 100 % space utilization is achieved when assembled into arrays. The power conversion efficiency is enhanced by 200 % ([60] PCBM as the acceptor) and 260 % ([70] PCBM as the acceptor) with a dihedral angle of 30 degrees between the {{opposite sides of the}} pyramid compared with a planar device, and a high V-oc of 3. 5 V in series connection is obtained. Considering the material utilization, an angle of 90 degrees for pyramid-shaped polymer solar cells is proposed. Pyramid-shaped polymer solar cells are particularly suitable for <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> roof of <b>vehicles</b> and houses, which have limited surface area...|$|R
40|$|Future space {{missions}} {{will have}} larger telescopes {{in order to}} look deeper into space while improvising on spatial resolution. The primary mirrors for these telescopes will be so large that using a monolithic mirror will be nearly impossible because of the difficulties associated with its fabrication, transportation, and <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> a launch <b>vehicle.</b> The feasibility of launching these huge mirrors is limited because of their small launch fairing diameter. The aerodynamic shape of the fairing requires a small diameter, but {{the height of the}} launch vehicle, which is available for designers to utilize, is larger than the fairing diameter. This paper presents the development of an axial deployment mechanism based on the screw jack principle. The mechanism was designed and developed, and a prototype was constructed in order to demonstrate a lab model...|$|R
50|$|In {{an unusual}} move, in 1986 Euromissile offered a single-round ground-launched system for HOT missile called ATLAS (Affut de Tir Leger Au Sol - which {{approximately}} translates as light ground-firing mount) for <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> smaller unarmored <b>vehicles,</b> like the Jeep or Land Rover. The object was to field an antitank weapon that long-range patrols {{could use to}} engage heavy armor beyond {{the range of the}} tank's main cannon. The ATLAS is similar to the TOW mounted on various four-wheel-drive light vehicles. But unlike the TOW light vehicle mount, there is a shield to protect the gunner against the HOT's booster and sustainer motors, which are both burning as they exit the container. The vehicle mounting the ATLAS is expected to carry a mix of both HOT missiles with antitank warheads and the HOT with the multi-purpose warhead.|$|R
40|$|An {{electro-optical}} flight deflection {{measurement system}} {{was developed for}} NASA for use on the highly maneuverable aircraft technology (HiMAT) remotely piloted research vehicle (RPRV) to provide a means of evaluating {{the performance of the}} HiMAT's aeroelastically tailored composite wing and canard. A description of the flight deflection measurement system is presented from a user's viewpoint and includes the general method of operation, system capabilities and limitations, method of <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> the HiMAT <b>vehicle,</b> and calibration of targets. Also included is a general description of the HiMAT RPRV and its design goals. Preliminary flight deflection and bending moment data were obtained at Mach 0. 8 and were extrapolated to the Mach 0. 9 maneuver design condition for comparison to NASTRAN predictions and ground loads test results. The preliminary flight test results tended to agree with the results obtained from the static ground loads tests, that is, that the NASTRAN model overpredicted the streamwise twist of the composite outer wing panel...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) {{chartered}} the NASA Engineering Safety Center (NESC) {{to demonstrate}} an alternate launch abort concept as risk mitigation for the Orion project's baseline "tower" design. On July 8, 2009, a full scale, passive aerodynamically stabilized Max Launch Abort System (MLAS) pad abort demonstrator was successfully launched from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility. Aerodynamic close-outs {{were required to}} cover openings on the MLAS fairing to prevent aerodynamic flow-through and to maintain the MLAS OML surface shape. Two-ply duct tape covers were designed to meet these needs. The duct tape used was a high strength fiber reinforced duct tape with a rubberized adhesive that demonstrated 4. 6 lb/in adhesion strength to the unpainted fiberglass fairing. Adhesion strength was observed to increase {{as a function of}} time. The covers were analyzed and experimentally tested to demonstrate their ability to maintain integrity under anticipated vehicle ascent pressure loads and to not impede firing of the drogue chute mortars. Testing included vacuum testing and a mortar fire test. Tape covers were layed-up on thin Teflon sheets to facilitate <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> Custom cut foam insulation board was used to fill mortar hole and separation joint cavities and provide support to the applied tape covers. Flight test results showed that the tape covers remained adhered during flight...|$|R
5000|$|One study {{conducted}} in the mid-1980s of twelve urban areas around the world concluded that residents of Mexico City had {{the highest levels of}} cadmium in their blood. [...] The concentration of pollutants was impacting surrounding ecosystems, as well as residents in the area These impacts included birth defects and high levels of gastrointestinal disease. [...] Also in the 1980s, the Mexican government implemented various anti-pollution policies in Mexico City. These policies included vehicle emission inspections, introducing unleaded gasoline, and the <b>installation</b> of converters <b>on</b> <b>vehicles</b> to help reduce pollution created by buses and trucks. [...] Another study in Mexico determined that five million tons of contaminants were released into the atmosphere each year; ten times more than in the previous decade. Vehicles and industrial plants were found to be the main contributors of contaminants into the atmosphere. [...] As well, fecal matter becomes airborne in Mexico during the winter months, resulting in residents being diagnosed with a variety of respiratory illnesses.|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal, Transport: Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers [© Thomas Telford]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] of vehicle emissions with an on-board emissions measurement system can provide {{a better understanding of how}} these emissions contribute to air pollution. This paper discusses the design and development by Imperial College London and industrial collaborators of a vehicle performance and emissions monitoring system, including its <b>installation</b> both <b>on</b> test <b>vehicles</b> allowing an interface with the engine management system and those that do not. Results from preliminary field trials and chassis dynamometer testing of the diesel test vehicle are presented. Good correlation between the monitoring system and reference measurements is observed, with differences in aggregate measurements of between 8 % and 18 % over a standard test cycle. The remote download and synthesis of navigation, performance and emissions data from an in-use vehicle was successfully achieved. This project has shown that it is possible to produce a system suitable for deployment for simultaneous studies over a wide area. However, the non-standard nature of engine management system interfaces for much of the European vehicle fleet presents a significant barrier to implementation. It is therefore recommended that European legislation be enforced to ensure standard interfaces <b>on</b> all new <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Hyper Pak was a parts package made {{available}} from 1960 through 1962 at Chrysler Corporation dealer parts counters. The parts were {{made available}} {{to comply with the}} regulations of sanctioning bodies for racing events in which Valiants had been entered by factory-backed teams: All parts used had to be [...] "stock" [...] parts, the definition of which meant that they were available through normal factory parts channels. The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept a Carter AFB 4-barrel carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large-diameter exhaust Y-pipe to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276°-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a manual choke control, a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine's compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for <b>installation</b> only <b>on</b> <b>vehicles</b> equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a high idle speed was required to prevent engine stall-out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving rough idling and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. But, in competition events, it proved unbeatable. Eight factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition; the Valiants came in first through eighth. After a similar performance the following year, the race was dropped. A high-fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by noted Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s; subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment for inline six-cylinder engines.|$|R
40|$|Transport for South Hampshire, a joint board {{responsible}} for transport {{planning for a}} conurbation of over one million people, successfully bid for the UK's Better Bus Area Fund. This will result in investments of £ 7. 4 million over the period 2012 to 2014, of which £ 4. 5 million will come from central government. Investments will include <b>installation</b> of Wi-Fi <b>on</b> <b>vehicles,</b> Near Field Communication (NFC) tags and Next Stop Displays and Announcement systems, along with marketing initiatives, the development of mobile apps and the refurbishment of buses. These investments will be complemented by other initiatives in the conurbation, not least some £ 27 million of investments from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund over the period 2012 to 2015, including the development of key interchange points and bus corridors. This paper will outline the methodology that has been developed to monitor and evaluate these investments and will detail the baseline surveys that have been undertaken, the anticipated impacts on attitudes to and usage of bus services {{and the results of}} the initial implementation of the investment programme. The extent to which such investments can revitalise bus services in an area where there has been a long run historic decline will be assessed...|$|R
