500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Haunted" [...] was {{directed}} by Swedish film and music video director Jonas Åkerlund and styled by Dagmarette Yen and B. Åkerlend. It was shot using four cameras and {{in a period of}} two days. On November 15, 2013, Popjustice reported that one of the actors who was featured in the video, J-Hustle, shared a picture on his Twitter account while being on a five-day set for the filming. He added that a song with [...] "a slow vibe" [...] was played in the background during the shooting and that its potential name was [...] "Ghost Haunted". Beyoncé first discussed about the video with Åkerlend during a concert she had in Stockholm in 2013. Having invited him for the performance, the singer played several songs for the director afterwards and the pair went on to exchange several ideas about its concept. During an interview with Vulture, Åkerlend talked about the process, [...] "It was not like a solid plan of 'This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we should do.' It was a pretty long process. And she was traveling and touring, so we had time to bounce ideas back and forth, figure out what the best vision was. And meanwhile, she was shooting all these other videos and I wasn't really involved in what those other ideas were." [...] He noted that several ideas of the video which were initially conceived were similar with [...] "other videos that people were working on". Beyoncé conceived some of the initial ideas behind the looks and the scenarios for many of the rooms which were eventually shot. He also explained that the video contained many sexually explicit scenes and ideas when initially shot. However, he felt that the team managed to balance between the singer's look, her performance and a strong idea along with several other things. Åkerlund further noted that its concept remained largely unchanged as none of the big ideas were excluded. Beyoncé's look remained largely the same as the director pictured it before the filming of the video had started.|$|E
2500|$|Before marrying Rita Wilson, Hanks {{converted}} to the Greek Orthodox Church, {{the religion of}} Wilson and her family. Hanks said, [...] "I must say that when I go to church—and I do go to church—I ponder the mystery. I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and 'why bad things happen to good people,' and 'why good things happen to bad people'... The mystery <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is, almost, the grand unifying theory of all mankind." ...|$|E
5000|$|How should <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> I'll <b>be,</b> <b>I</b> who don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> <b>Be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{of being}} so many things! ...|$|R

2500|$|Van Gogh's {{thoughts}} returned {{several times}} to the painting by Eugène Delacroix of Torquato Tasso in the madhouse. [...] After a visit with Paul Gauguin to Montpellier to see Alfred Bruyas's collection in the Musée Fabre, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, asking {{if he could find}} a copy of the lithograph after the painting. [...] Three and a half months earlier, he had been thinking of the painting {{as an example of the}} sort of portraits he wanted to paint: [...] "But it would be more in harmony with what Eugène Delacroix attempted and brought off in his Tasso in Prison, and many other pictures, representing a real man. Ah! portraiture, portraiture with the thought, the soul of the model in it, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> must come." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{ends with}} an {{epilogue}} depicting Rama's last journey, the Mahaprasthana, {{as he walks}} into the river with fire {{in his hand and}} becomes one with Sita, the all-pervading nature. When asked whether Rama was really committing suicide, Aravindan replied, [...] "Yes... in all probability. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> However, his death in Sarayu river is not like any other kind of death. It was a Mahaprasthanam – an event of supreme self-sacrifice and purification, leaving everything behind. Everyone dear to him had gone. He had parted from Lakshmana. He was troubled by many guilt feelings – the murder of Shambuka, the unfairness meted out to Sita... Towards the end of the film, this mood prevails – Rama walks into the Sarayu river with the sacrificial fire, bearing everything, including his loneliness, calling out for Sita ... and disappears into the depths of the waters, carrying the sacrificial fire with him into the river is not in Ramayana – it is an interpretation. Somehow the part I liked most in the film is this end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, but a [...] "spirit full of glee" [...] <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{the most}} {{delightful}} {{thing in the}} world,' said Elizabeth, 'and so do you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to forgive," [...] he insisted. [...] "You asked for an {{explanation}} to which you had a right. I have tried {{to give it to}} you. Indeed, Julia, you need have no fear. Whatever I decide in life will <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> best for our cause." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If you <b>be,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you, some sweet dream, [...] I would but ask you {{to fulfil}} yourself: [...] But if you be that Ida whom I knew, [...] I ask you nothing: only, if a dream, [...] Sweet dream, be perfect. I shall die tonight. [...] Stoop down and seem to kiss me ere I die.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She rose involuntarily. [...] "You make me {{ashamed to}} think that you're so much mistaken about me! I know how we all {{influence}} each other--I know I always try to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people expect me to be--I can't <b>be</b> myself--I know <b>what</b> you mean; but you--you must be yourself, and not let--" [...] She stopped in her wandering speech, in strange agitation, and he rose too.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} what {{happened}} because the facts came out in court and are known to everyone. What I think about it <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and I've no call to tell that." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> But I am only a girl, {{the first}} that has {{examined}} this matter, and {{it may turn out}} that in my ignorance and inexperience I have not got it right.|$|E
6000|$|But what do I mean by that? That {{ought to}} depend on what Moses meant by it. Moses meant what God meant, and unless I mean the same thing I must mean {{something}} wrong. And this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it does mean: ...|$|E
6000|$|DOOLITTLE. Musical instrument, Governor. A few pictures, {{a trifle}} of jewelry, and a bird-cage. She said she didn't want no clothes. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to <b>think</b> from that, Governor? I ask {{you as a}} parent <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to <b>think?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a rough {{school for}} you, Lee Virginia, and I should dislike seeing you settle {{down to it}} for life: but it can't hurt you if you <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you <b>are.</b> Nothing can soil or mar the mind that wills for good. I want Mrs. Redfield to know you; I'm sure her advice will be helpful. I hope you'll come up and see us {{if you decide to}} settle in Sulphur--or if you don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, lad, {{we shall}} leave them both behind presently; {{but if they}} <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> we <b>are</b> likely to hear more of them, later on. They {{would not be so}} far {{offshore}} as this, unless they were on the lookout for Indiamen, which of course keep much farther out than ships bound up the Mediterranean; and, having once spotted us, they will follow us like hounds on a deer's trail. However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they are likely to find that they have caught a tartar, when they come up to us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{like this}} poor Mrs. Renfrew--that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Dropsy! There is no {{swelling}} yet--it is inward. I should say {{she ought to}} take drying medicines, shouldn't you?--or a dry hot-air bath. Many things might be tried, of a drying nature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, go on, go on," [...] he said, [...] "don't mind me. I don't wish to interfere. Only, {{if you go}} on {{telling him}} in your kind of French, he never will find out where we want to go to. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{know the}} man. He is an Englishman, {{and if he}} had any idea what that {{document}} contained, our chances of buying it would be small indeed. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> will happen. Mademoiselle will try to obtain it, and try in vain. Then Bellamy will tell him the truth, and he will part with it willingly. In the meantime, I believe that it is in his possession.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we may {{throw them}} from us, though," [...] said Bucklaw, [...] "and that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>think</b> of doing {{one of these}} days--that is, when old Lady Girnington dies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith!" [...] said Rowland, {{although}} his acquaintance with Mr. Wilding was slight and recent. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think.</b> He {{does not look}} like a man familiar with fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, dear, {{you must}} {{forgive me if}} I persist. I have thought much about it, and I'm sure you will not oppose me when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> to <b>be</b> my duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{broke out}} with strong indignation: [...] "This {{is simply an}} outrage. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it! You have dogged, and dogged, and dogged me, all the days of my life, invisible. That was misery enough, now {{to have such a}} looking thing as you tagging after me like another shadow all the rest of my day is an {{intolerable}} prospect. You have my opinion my lord, make the most of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Pierre. We {{will start}} at once, but we must not let the countess know {{what we are going}} for. I will get the chief of the council, openly, to charge me with a mission to the south; while telling them, privately, where I am really going, and with what object. I am known to most of them, and I doubt not they will fall in with my plans.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, Pigeonswing," [...] {{he said to}} the Chippewa, whom he had {{followed}} to the spring--"I hope, Pigeonswing, that no offence has been taken by the chiefs on account of what I told them yesterday, concerning their being Jews. It <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and it is an honor to belong to God's chosen people, and in no sense a disgrace. I hope no offence has been taken on account of my telling the chief they are Jews." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, that <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of,' said Eleanor. 'It {{is to see}} our own Margaret, and to see {{and hear}} the {{minstrel}} knights, instead of the rude savages here, scarce one of whom knows what knighthood means!' ...|$|R
6000|$|He went {{straight}} {{home and at}} once wrote to the girl. The letter was a simple love-letter, and as such need not be given here. In what sweetest language he could find he assured her that even though he should never be allowed to see her or to hear from her, that still he should cling to her. And then he added this passage: [...] "If your love for me <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it to <b>be,</b> no one can {{have a right to}} keep us apart. Pray be sure that I shall not change. If you change let me know it;--but I shall as soon expect the heavens to fall." ...|$|R
5000|$|So commented {{during an}} {{interview}} with Alina l'Ami in 2009: [...] "So far I play aggressively. I would like to play a solid game with a solid opening. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> my style is close to Vishy Anand. Of course we have different level."His playing style has evolved {{in recent years to}} become more precise and risk-free, relying on taking advantage of opponent's mistakes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still," [...] she said, [...] "if Jimmy <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> him, he {{will not}} ask it of you. I {{want him to go}} back six years to the time he came home--from Portland, wasn't it, Jimmy?--and stayed a few weeks with us. Was there any shadow upon us then, though your father was getting old? I want you to {{remember}} him as he was when you went away, a simple, kindly, abstemious, and fearless man. It surely can't be very hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{his father}} was on worse terms with Mountjoy when he told the lie. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Augustus thinks. But his father told no lie at that time, and cannot now go back to falsehood. My belief is {{that if he were}} {{confident}} that such is the fact he would not surrender a shilling to pay these men their moneys. He may stop a lawsuit, which is like enough, though they could only lose it. And if Mountjoy should {{turn out to be the}} heir, which is impossible, he will be able to turn round and say that by his efforts he had saved so much of the property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Dinah; {{they will}} keep the secret to themselves. Now against eight or ten of them, I am sure that I could hold this place, but some of them, when they found they could not get in, would go back again and might lead a strong party here, or might keep watch higher up, and starve us out. And even if the whites beat them {{out of all the}} plantations, they would not know where to look for us, and would have too much on their hands to scatter all over the hills. If we are to join them it must be by going down." ...|$|E
5000|$|The artworks Keane created {{while living}} {{in the shadow of}} her husband tended to depict sad-looking {{children}} in dark settings. After she left Walter, moved to Hawaii and, after years of following astrology, palmistry, handwriting analysis and transcendental meditation, became a Jehovah's Witness, her work took on a happier, brighter style. [...] "The eyes I draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings. Eyes are windows of the soul", Keane explains. Many galleries now advertise her artworks as having [...] "tears of joy" [...] or [...] "tears of happiness". She described her subjects thus: [...] "These are the paintings of children in paradise. They <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the world <b>is</b> going to look like when God's will is done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> myself, my lord," [...] he continued, simpering; [...] "but then," [...] he added, with a condoling and patronizing air, [...] "how {{should they}} know any better? England is but an island, after all; {{and the whole}} world cannot be born and educated on the same bit of earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because I {{am quite}} sure that the {{consideration}} {{you want to show}} him would be no kindness. The pain of having his affection thrown over' (he spoke with a spasm in the throat) 'would be greater than you would like to inflict, if you were forced by truth to own you did not care for him; and if he <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> the carrying away security of your feeling for him will be gladness enough. And as for the looks, I have a better opinion of yours than to think they won't wear! Any way, dearest, {{it seems to me that}} you have won the heart of a good man, and that if you like him, it is your duty to give him the comfort of knowing it without thinking about to-morrows.' ...|$|R
