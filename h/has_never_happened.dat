5|$|On June 30, 2014, Ramirez {{made his}} Orioles {{debut in the}} ninth inning against the Texas Rangers, {{relieving}} Ubaldo Jiménez after pitching 8 innings only allowing 1 run pass. This was not a save opportunity since the Orioles were winning 7-1 in Baltimore. He allowed one walk and had two strikeouts. He helped Jimenez get his first win at Camden Yards of the 2014 Major League Baseball season. Ramírez had never met the Orioles manager Buck Showalter before his debut with the Orioles which <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> to Buck in his Career. He was designated for assignment on July 6, 2014.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Ethiopian {{sentiment}} {{is on the}} rise with hundreds protesting against their presence in the capital. Another development is the appearance of masked men which <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before and may signal the beginnings of an Iraq-style insurgency.|$|E
25|$|The {{championship}} {{of every}} division in English football is determined solely by the standings in the league. However, a championship play-off {{would be held}} if the top two teams were tied for points, goal difference and goals scored in both their overall league record; to date, this <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> A play-off would also be scheduled if two teams are tied as above for a position affecting promotion, relegation, or European qualification.|$|E

25|$|It {{takes place}} during the Harkonnen attack on Arrakis {{during the course of}} the {{original}} Dune by Frank Herbert. It depicts a group of Atreides soldiers trapped in a cave in the Shield Wall outside Arrakeen. One of the soldiers, a master story teller, recounts tales of Caladan, the sea-covered ancestral homeworld of House Atreides. A group of Fremen warriors find the soldiers shortly after, and discover that the soldiers have all magically drowned — a fate that <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> previously on the desert planet of Arrakis.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} {{acquired}} {{by the city of}} Freiburg in 1968, and merged into VAG in 1982. In 1987, the line closed for modernisation. The original cabins were replaced by 37 smaller cabins that did not require a conductor, thus significantly reducing the number of staff needed to operate the line. During periods of high demand, up to 30 cabins can operate at once, giving a total passenger throughput of more than 500 per hour. Several proposals have been made to complete the originally intended extension of tram route 2 to connect with the Schauinslandbahn, but this <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> and through passengers still use a connecting bus.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} memoirs in early 1898 {{and wrote a}} will on 13 June 1898. The will {{requests}} that busts {{of him and his}} wife be installed at the Congregational Church in Parramatta, but this <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> The first twelve chapters of his auto-biography have been lost, but the remaining chapters are held at the National Library in Canberra. Forsaith died on 29 November 1898 in Parramatta. He is buried at Rookwood Cemetery, sharing a grave with his wife, who died on 29 January 1900. Their daughter had died before them in 1894, and her husband Thomas Morell MacDonald was one of the executors of Thomas Forsaith's will.|$|E

25|$|According to this argument, {{the fact}} the Electoral College {{is made up of}} real people instead of mere numbers allows for human {{judgment}} and flexibility to make a decision, if it happens that a candidate dies or becomes legally disabled {{around the time of the}} election. Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public. According to this view, electors could act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot choices become fixed in state ballots until mid-December when the electors formally cast their ballots. In the election of 1872, losing Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley died during this time interval, which resulted in disarray for the Democratic Party, who also supported Greeley, but the Greeley electors were able to split their votes for different alternate candidates. A situation in which the winning candidate died <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> In the election of 1912, Vice President Sherman died shortly before the election when it was too late for states to remove his name from their ballots; accordingly, Sherman was listed posthumously, but the eight electoral votes that Sherman would have received were cast instead for Nicholas Murray Butler.|$|E

Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) youth-oriented AM radio station [...] was limited to Sydney during the 1970s, with poor reception in some areas.

500|$|On March 7, 2011, it was {{reported}} that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|Members {{are elected}} to the {{legislature}} during general elections or by-elections. Barring special legislation occasioned by a war or an emergency (which <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> in Alberta's history, although it has federally), general elections must be called by the lieutenant governor, at the Premier's advice, no later than {{five years after the}} previous election, but the premier may ask (and almost always has asked) for dissolution of the legislative assembly and a subsequent election earlier than that. Under Alberta's fixed-election legislation of 2011, a general election is to be held on a day (by custom, a Monday) between March 1 and May 31 in the 4th calendar year following the most recent general election, but the premier can bindingly advise the lieutenant governor to call an election earlier than the fixed date.|$|E
2500|$|Elio Di Rupo, the {{president}} of the PS, sharply criticized the duration of the negotiations. [...] "Three months on from the election, they're not even sitting around the negotiation table. This <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before". He continued, [...] "If we would have participated in the talks, negotiations would never have been derailed". Di Rupo also called the talks a [...] "guerilla war" [...] rather than negotiations.|$|E

On four occasions, the Hoosiers have competed for the NCAA crown as a team (1988, 1989, 1990, 2002).

At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 councillors representing all districts and thematic areas {{to serve on the}} Municipal Council of the Budget.

2500|$|Each {{party has}} {{the choice of}} {{selecting}} a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal Det Radikale Venstre did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing {{a majority of the}} seats in the Folketing, is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> in more modern history that any party has held a majority on its own.) ...|$|E

Mr. Nakanishi apologised to affected workers on behalf of the company, and in press interview requested the central and Haryana state governments to help stop further violence by legislating decisive rules to restore corporate confidence amid emergence of this new 'militant workforce' in Indian factories. He announced, [...] "we are going to de-recognise Maruti Suzuki Workers’ Union and dismiss all workers named in connection with the incident. We will not compromise at all in such instances of barbaric, unprovoked violence." [...] He also announced Maruti plans to continue manufacturing in Manesar, that Gujarat was an expansion opportunity and not an alternative to Manesar.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Morton: some Alberta Alliance members {{believed}} that Randy Thorsteinson should have waited {{until after the}} Progressive Conservative Party chooses a successor to Ralph Klein, so that Ted Morton could have run for leader of the Alliance {{if he did not}} win the leadership of the PC party. Randy Thorsteinson felt that the Alberta Alliance should never be a fall-back position for anyone. He has stated [...] "The Alberta Alliance is the home of principled conservatives. Those that truly believe in reforming the Alberta Government realize that trying to change the Progressive Conservatives from within is a lost cause. It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> and never will. We must ensure that principled conservatives have a home led by people of character and integrity not opportunists. I chose to step down early to allow the new Leader as much time as possible to prepare for the next election and to make leadership aspirants choose between the Progressive Conservative or the Alberta Alliance leadership races. You will be able to determine their commitment to principle by the leadership race they choose to enter".|$|E
