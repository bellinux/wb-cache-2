500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back."

500|$|The first single, [...] "Heroin", was {{accompanied}} {{with the most}} music videos, {{with a total of}} five for several different remixed versions of the cover.

Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to Howard Deutch. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. [...] "We did it all on camcorder and we sort of wanted to say {{you can make your own}} videos, and you don't always have to do <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> MTV way."

500|$|Gernsback's {{declared}} {{goals for}} Amazing were {{to educate and}} to entertain.

[...] They supply knowledge that we might not otherwise obtain – and they supply <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> palatable form. [...] For {{the best of these}} modern writers of scientifiction have the knack of imparting knowledge and even inspiration without once making us aware that we are being taught". It was difficult for Gernsback to find high-quality new material that was both entertaining and met his declared goal of providing scientific information, and the early issues of Amazing contained a high proportion of reprints. [...] He discovered that his readers preferred the fantastical romances of Burroughs and Merritt to the more scientific stories of Verne and Wells, and perhaps in response published Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool" [...] in the May 1927 issue of Amazing. [...] The story was completely unscientific; Gernsback's introduction to the story claimed that Merritt was introducing a new science, but Ashley comments that Gernsback was simply [...] "looking for an excuse for including such fantastic fiction in the magazine when it did not fit in with his basic creed".|$|E
500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's {{no question in my mind}} of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E

[...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that [...] "like most Girls Aloud singles, a few listens are required to get our heads around it." [...] Copsey criticized the distorted vocals and the fact that [...] "there probably won't be a full album of new tracks to accompany it," [...] but admitted that [...] "it sounds modern enough for today's charts without compromising their signature sound" [...] and praised its [...] "massive chorus." [...] Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media thought that the track [...] "is a game approximation of the Girls Aloud of seven years ago," [...] while BBC Music reviewer Ian Wade concluded that, [...] "as its title suggests, Something New is just that, a fanfare-like call to arms announcing the group’s return." ...|$|E

[...] On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, [...] "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [...] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [...] I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it." [...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was [...] "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone [...] "further back into [...] past” while having [...] "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [...] family."

500|$|The {{episode is}} notable for {{featuring}} the first actual kiss between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The series had featured other brushes with kisses {{between the two}} leads: in the fourth season episode [...] "Small Potatoes", a shapeshifter, disguised as Mulder, nearly kissed Scully; in the 1998 film, the two's [...] "lips brushed slightly before Scully got stung by a virus-carrying bee"; and in the sixth season entry [...] "Triangle", Mulder kissed a Scully-lookalike from the 1930s in a reverie of his. John Shiban developed {{the idea for a}} Mulder–Scully kiss, which was described by series creator Chris Carter as a [...] "present for the fans." [...] Shiban noted that the episode's kiss felt like [...] "the logical culmination of their relationship. They had been heading toward the kiss for years". Gillian Anderson later explained that, [...] "David [...] and I knew the kiss was coming. [...] I felt the editors of that episode milked <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective way." [...] In order to create the atmosphere of the scene, specialized camera angles were used and everything was slowed down to make the scene last longer. The Millennium Ball scene was digitally created on a computer because the episode was filmed in October, two months before the event was scheduled to take place. Special effects producer Bill Millar was tasked with digitally adding the number [...] "2000" [...] into archival footage of Dick Clark's 1999 New Years Eve show.

[...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality.
