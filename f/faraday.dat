5|$|The backstory of {{the game}} is {{described}} in the fourth case, Turnabout Reminiscence. Ten years prior to the game's present, the secretariat of the Cohdopian Embassy was accused of murdering Cece Yew, a witness to a smuggling ring's connection to the embassy. Prosecutor Byrne <b>Faraday</b> and detective Tyrell Badd attempted to convict the secretariat, but he went free after key evidence was stolen. Feeling that the justice system was powerless to those who stand above the law, <b>Faraday,</b> Badd, and Yew's sister Calisto, started stealing corporate files detailing illegal or unethical activities and exposed them to the media, under the name Yatagarasu. Three years later, another murder occurred at the embassy. During the trial, in which <b>Faraday</b> was the prosecutor, the suspect, Mack Rell, claimed that he had been told by <b>Faraday</b> to commit the murder, and said that <b>Faraday</b> was the Yatagarasu. A recess was held to replace <b>Faraday</b> with another prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth; before court was reconvened, both Rell and <b>Faraday</b> were found dead. Edgeworth discovered that Calisto had murdered <b>Faraday</b> with help from Rell, then killed Rell and made it look like <b>Faraday</b> and Rell had killed each other. When confronted, Calisto says that she is Yatagarasu, not mentioning her two partners, and that she is part of the smuggling ring. Faraday's daughter Kay is comforted over Faraday's death by Edgeworth, Badd, and detective Gumshoe; she believes her father to be the true Yatagarasu, and vows to catch the fake.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Faraday</b> filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited <b>Faraday</b> Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the <b>Faraday</b> effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E

5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, <b>Faraday</b> has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), <b>Faraday</b> approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. <b>Faraday</b> then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, <b>Faraday</b> meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let <b>Faraday</b> live out the rest of his afterlife, since <b>Faraday</b> was never allowed to live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael <b>Faraday.</b> The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because <b>Faraday</b> was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.|$|E
