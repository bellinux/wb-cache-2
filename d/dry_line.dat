5|$|The {{next day}} a <b>dry</b> <b>line,</b> which {{separates}} the drier {{air from the}} more moist and humid air, formed ahead of the cold front across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles and tracked eastward. The high humidity levels with dew points in the 70s°F (low 20s°C), temperatures that in many areas were near 80°F (27°C), strong wind shear {{and the presence of}} the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> helped develop the instability to produce severe thunderstorms across the Midwest and Southern Plains on October 17.|$|E
5|$|The Bridge Creek–Moore tornado {{was part}} of a much larger outbreak, which {{produced}} 71 tornadoes across five states throughout the Central Plains on May 3 alone, along with an additional 25 that touched down a day later in some of the areas affected by the previous day's activity (some of which were spawned supercells that developed on the evening of May 3), stretching eastward to the Mississippi River Valley. On the morning of May 3, in its Day 1 Convective Outlook for the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a slight risk for severe weather, as a <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> that stretched from western Kansas into western Texas approached a warm, humid air-mass over the Central Plains; the conditions ahead of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> and a connecting trough positioned over northeastern Colorado appeared to favor the development of thunderstorms later that day that would contain large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and isolated tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} storms was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center for February28 across parts of the central Plains. The first tornadoes developed {{early in the evening}} of February28 in Kansas as the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> pushed eastward and was lifted by the cold front. In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and Missouri, of which 11 were weak. However, one of the tornadoes was an EF4, the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since September22, 2006. No one was injured that evening. Farther south, expected activity in Oklahoma and Arkansas did not take place as the atmospheric cap held up.|$|E

5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} low-pressure area developed west of Wichita Falls {{at the intersection}} of a <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> extended southward across Central Texas and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the low-pressure system now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E
5|$|As Vettel {{maintained}} his lead, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Kovalainen {{had been caught}} speeding in the pit lane, {{for which he was}} served with a ten-second stop-and-go penalty that was taken on lap thirty-nine. Alonso set a new fastest lap and closed the gap to 1.2 seconds behind Vettel at the start of lap thirty-seven. Further back, Sutil overtook Heidfeld for twelfth on the following lap. Sutil tried to pass Kobayashi on lap thirty-eight at turn three but out-braked himself, allowing Kobayashi to retake the position. He passed the Kobayashi because of his higher straight line speed, but Sutil braked later and slid off the track, rejoining in fourteenth. One lap later, Alonso was told by his team to drive less aggressively through turns seven and eight in an effort to preserve tyre life because he was spinning his tyres under acceleration. At the conclusion of lap thirty-nine, all of the drivers had made pit stops. Vettel was leading Alonso, who was followed by Hamilton, Massa, Schumacher, Barrichello, Petrov, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Liuzzi, Kobayashi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Sutil, Button, Senna, Kovalainen and Yamamoto. A <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> began to emerge on lap forty-one as Petrov lost control of the rear-end of his car between turns seventeen and eighteen; he slid sideways into the tyre barrier at the pit lane entry.|$|E

5|$|The United States has {{the most}} tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than {{estimated}} in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts. This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing {{the formation of a}} low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> when the flow aloft is strong, while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley. This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone. Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cluster}} of {{thunderstorms}} was tracking through Missouri, {{a new line of}} thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, demarcating a <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> boundary. Although linear storm systems tend to indicate strong wind events and not tornadoes, these storms tracked eastward into southwestern Missouri and eventually produced several tornadoes. A long-tracked EF3 developed from one of these supercells and struck Cincinnati, Arkansas. At 13:31UTC on December31, a tornado watch was issued for much of Missouri and portions of Arkansas and Illinois. Most of the tornadoes during the outbreak stemmed from this line of storms as they moved through Missouri and Illinois throughout the day. At around noon, a new cluster of disorganized showers formed over eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Although these storms were initially weak, they gradually intensified into supercells as the day went on. Additional supercells quickly developed over Louisiana and eventually spread in coverage over Mississippi, resulting in the development of several tornadoes. Reaching their peak strength over Mississippi, the storms gradually lost their intensity as they tracked eastward late on December31 and into January1, 2011. By the morning hours of January1, severe activity had become restricted to the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama; the last tornado watch issued in association with the 2010New Year's Eve tornado outbreak was issued for those regions at 15:56UTC that day.|$|E

40|$|Summary There {{have been}} recent reports of {{interstitial}} condensation forming {{on the back}} of vapour checks of <b>dry</b> <b>lined</b> solid walls. This usually occurred within south facing walls during hot weather.

Similar condensation has been reproduced in experimental walls under natural weather conditions with a variety of insulants including highly permeable mineral fibre. In these tests it was found that condensation deposited over a period of a few hours can take several days to re-evapora te. Summer condensation within <b>dry</b> <b>lined</b> solid walls J. R.

25|$|On June 6, {{there were}} two {{distinct}} threats forecast. The central Plains were expected to see a large tornado outbreak potentially, particularly in Nebraska and the Dakotas close to the <b>dry</b> <b>line,</b> should the cap have broken in {{the atmosphere in the}} afternoon hours. In the evening and overnight hours, a major derecho with destructive winds and some scattered tornadoes were possible farther east, particularly in the eastern Dakotas, western Minnesota and western Iowa. However, that basically busted as little severe weather happened as the cap held up in most areas. Only five tornadoes and scattered wind reports took place.|$|E
25|$|Friday's {{afternoon}} qualification {{session was}} {{divided into two groups}} that lasted 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and AM were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All cars were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each and the starting order was determined by the competitor's fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. Light rain fell before qualifying started causing teams to use intermediate tyres on their cars until a <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> emerged on the track and vehicles were equipped with dry-compound tyres. Rain later returned to the track which prevented anyone from improving on their fastest lap times. The session was marked by a battle between Audi and Porsche.|$|E
500|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> {{may occur}} {{anywhere}} on earth in regions intermediate between desert areas and warm seas.

500|$|A similar {{phenomenon}} to {{a weather}} front is the <b>dry</b> <b>line,</b> {{which is the}} boundary between air masses with significant moisture differences. [...] When the westerlies increase {{on the north side}} of surface highs, areas of lowered pressure will form downwind of north–south oriented mountain chains, leading to the formation of a lee trough. [...] Near the surface during daylight hours, warm moist air is denser than dry air of greater temperature, and thus the warm moist air wedges under the drier air like a cold front. [...] At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the dry air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front. [...] A weaker form of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> seen more commonly is the lee trough, which displays weaker differences in moisture. [...] When moisture pools along the boundary during the warm season, it can be the focus of diurnal thunderstorms.|$|E
500|$|The {{thunderstorm}} {{that eventually}} produced the F5 tornado formed around 3:30p.m. CDT over Tillman County. Despite {{the lack of}} overall lift prevalent in the region, the storm formed out of a contrail-like horizontal area of convective clouds that developed during peak surface heating over southwestern Oklahoma, located well ahead of the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> still positioned farther to the west, which provided enhanced lift and speed shear necessary to develop the supercell. Tracking northeast, the storm strengthened and entered Comanche County shortly after 4:00p.m. CDT; there, hail up to [...] in diameter fell.|$|E
500|$|During {{daylight}} hours, drier {{air from}} aloft drifts {{down to the}} surface, causing an apparent movement of the dryline eastward. At night, the boundary reverts to the west {{as there is no}} longer any solar heating to help mix the lower atmosphere.

500|$|Initially, {{computer}} models {{indicated that the}} day's storms would primarily feature strong winds and hail with a minimal risk for tornadoes, with severe weather occurring mainly north of the stalled front in Oklahoma. However, conditions improved further than expected, leading the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Fort Worth, Texas to intensify its verbiage in its public forecasting products as the day progressed, in addition to highlighting areas around the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex as potential risk areas for tornadoes. Thunderstorms began to develop in earnest along the <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> as the afternoon progressed, beginning with initial storm development northeast of Abilene. The strong southwesterly winds aloft from the curved subtropical jet over the region helped to ventilate the storms, allowing for their persistence and intensity. The SPC issued its first of two tornado watches for the event at 2:53p.m. CST (20:53 UTC) for portions of southern Oklahoma and North-Central Texas. The most favorable environment for tornadoes was initially over the Red River but shifted southward to include the Dallas-Fort Worth area in the evening hours. As storms continued to develop along a line paralleling Interstate 35, some storms congealed into a mesoscale convective system {{in the vicinity of}} the Metroplex; this cluster of storms produced both F3tornadoes in Fort Worth and Arlington. The complex of storms eventually evolved into a transient bow echo that continued to track eastward into Louisiana. [...] Elsewhere, supercells continued to propagate eastward across North and South-Central Texas along the <b>dry</b> <b>line,</b> slowly weakening after sunset.|$|E
500|$|Downslope winds off the Rocky Mountains can aid {{in forming}} the <b>dry</b> <b>line.</b> [...] Major drought episodes in the midwestern United States are {{associated}} with an amplification of the upper tropospheric subtropical (or monsoon) ridge across the West and Plains, along with a weakening of {{the western edge of}} the [...] "Bermuda high". [...] During the summer, a southerly low-level jet draws moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Additional moisture comes from more local sources, especially transpiring vegetation. Maximum precipitation generally occurs in late spring and early summer, with minimum precipitation in winter. [...] During La Niña events, the storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers.|$|E
500|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>line</b> is the {{boundary}} between dry and moist air masses east of mountain ranges with similar orientation to the Rockies, depicted {{at the leading edge}} of the dew point, or moisture, gradient. Near the surface, warm moist air that is denser than warmer, dryer air wedges under the drier air in a manner similar to that of a cold front wedging under warmer air. When the warm moist air wedged under the drier mass heats up, it becomes less dense and rises and sometimes forms thunderstorms. [...] At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the cooler, drier air and {{the boundary}} slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front.|$|E
