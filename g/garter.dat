5|$|Each June, on <b>Garter</b> Day, {{the members}} of the Order, wearing their habits and <b>garter</b> insignia, meet at Windsor Castle.

This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order, wearing the ceremonial habits and <b>garter</b> insignia, and also by their wives. The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.|$|E

5|$|Central to Edward III's {{policy was}} {{reliance}} on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects. Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility, allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign. The young king reversed this trend when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new earls on the same day. At the same time, Edward expanded {{the ranks of the}} peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of duke for close relatives of the king. Furthermore, Edward bolstered the sense of community within this group by the creation of the Order of the <b>Garter,</b> probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the Round Table of King Arthur never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the <b>garter.</b> Edward's wartime experiences during the Crécy campaign (1346–7) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the Round Table project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Crécy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward III, especially {{at the time of the}} institution of the <b>Garter.</b> There are no formal references to King Arthur and the Round Table in the surviving early fifteenth-century copies of the Statutes of the <b>Garter,</b> but the <b>Garter</b> Feast of 1358 did involve a round table game. Thus there was some overlap between the projected Round Table fellowship and the actualized Order of the <b>Garter.</b> Polydore Vergil tells of how the young Joan of Kent, Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her <b>garter</b> at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd by tying the <b>garter</b> around his own knee with the words honi soit qui mal y pense – shame on him who thinks ill of it.|$|E

2500|$|According to jazz {{historian}} Al Rose, {{the popular}} {{image of an}} early 20th-century saloon pianist being flashily dressed with arm <b>garters</b> {{was inspired by the}} way Tony Jackson used to dress while performing. [...] Sleeve <b>garters</b> are still worn not only by pianists who play ragtime and other turn of the 20th century American music, but also by Dixieland banjo players and many other types of musicians who perform music of that general period. Because sleeve <b>garters</b> are {{very much a part of}} the costume of contemporary barbershop music performance, an activity for which unimpeded manual dexterity does not play a vital role, the association between sleeve <b>garters</b> and the contemporary performance of turn of the 20th century music may have more to do with evoking the fashion of the era than with utility or a tradition begun at some later time.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Garter</b> is worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions {{around the}} left calf by knights {{and around the}} left arm by ladies, and is depicted on several insignia. The <b>Garter</b> is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working <b>garter</b> where the end slips through the buckle and then is tucked in a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the buckled and tucked end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.|$|E
