5|$|Meanwhile, {{during the}} time when Chris and Stewie {{were lost in the}} woods, Chris {{promises}} to ask out Ellen, a school classmate with Down syndrome. After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number. During the date, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly falls apart. Chris admits that he had bought into a stereotype of people with Down syndrome being different, and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, <b>in</b> <b>asking</b> her out on a date, as he had promised to do.|$|E

5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter <b>in</b> <b>asking</b> voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|The Rangers {{were armed}} with {{assorted}} Thompson submachine guns, BARs, M1 Garand rifles, pistols, grenades, knives, and extra ammunition, {{as well as}} a few bazookas. Fourcombat photographers from a unit of the 832nd Signal Service Battalion volunteered to accompany the Scouts and Rangers to record the rescue after Mucci suggested the idea of documenting the raid. Each photographer was armed with a pistol. Despite Geneva Convention restrictions on armed medical personnel, surgeon Captain Jimmy Fisher and his medics each carried pistols and carbines. To maintain a link between the raiding group and Army Command, a radio outpost was established outside of Guimba. The force had tworadios, but their use was only approved <b>in</b> <b>asking</b> for aircraft support if they ran into large Japanese forces or if there were last-minute changes to the raid (as well as calling off friendly fire by American aircraft).|$|E

25|$|Confession of sins is made {{directly}} to God and not through man (except <b>in</b> <b>asking</b> for forgiveness {{from the victim}} of the sin). It is taught that sins are to be kept to oneself to seek individual forgiveness from God. God forgives those who seek his forgiveness and commit to themselves not to repeat the sin, although some sins in which another person is victimized are not forgiven unless that person forgives you, so they should also be asked for forgiveness.|$|E

He was the third and {{youngest}} son of Thomas Chicheley, who appears in 1368 in still extant town records of Higham Ferrers, as a suitor in the mayor's court, and in 1381–1382, and again in 1384–1385, was mayor: in fact, for a dozen years he and Henry Barton, schoolmaster of Higham Ferrers grammar school, and one Richard Brabazon, filled the mayoralty in turns.|$|E
25|$|Leahy joined ten House of Representative members <b>in</b> <b>asking</b> the State Department to {{investigate}} suspected {{human rights violations}} by Egyptian and Israeli security forces, in particular citing claims of extrajudicial killings which may trigger the Leahy Law, a law that can cause the suspension of all American military aid to countries guilty of such abuses. While Leahy has signed resolutions in support of Israel's right to self-defense, {{he has also been}} critical of human rights violations in the region, especially after the 2008 Operation Cast Lead. In 2011, Leahy initially promoted a bill to cut the military aid to three elite IDF units, after reports of human rights violations during the Gaza flotilla raid and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.|$|E
25|$|During Lois' adolescence, {{she won a}} youth contest run by the Daily Planet, {{with the}} prize being a trip to Metropolis {{to spend a week}} working as a cub {{reporter}} for the newspaper.

Lois found Clark dull and became more interested <b>in</b> <b>asking</b> him for information about Superboy after learning Clark came from Smallville. During the week in Metropolis, Lois made a bet with Clark to see who would get the most scoops, {{which turned out to be}} Lois, as Clark was forced to constantly go into action as Superboy. Lois met Superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories. At the end of the week, Clark paid off Lois' bet (an ice cream sundae), and the two returned to their respective hometowns.|$|E

25|$|By 1916, Grand Duke Andrei joined {{other members}} of his family in {{political}} intrigues against the Empress {{who was in charge of}} the government in Saint Petersburg while Nicholas II was away at Russia's war military headquarters. In December 1916, the Assassination of Rasputin, in which Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Prince Felix Yusupov took part, divided the Romanov family further. Grand Duke Andrei joined many of his relatives <b>in</b> <b>asking</b> for clemency for the culprits. As Andrei's ambitious mother intrigued against Empress Alexandra, Nicholas II ordered the Grand Duchess to leave Saint Petersburg for a time. After a short personal interview with Nicholas II, on 16 January 1917, Grand Duke Andrei left for Kislovodsk, a spa resort town in the Caucasus. He arrived there on January 21. His mother followed him a month later, claiming health reasons. Andrei Vladimirovich and his mother were in Kislovodsk when Nicholas II was forced to abdicate at the outbreak of the February revolution.|$|E
25|$|Foch, {{claiming}} that the Germans were showing signs of demoralisation, demanded (10 August) that Haig push on and capture the Somme crossings. Haig {{would have preferred to}} have First Army attack at Aubers and Third Army towards Bapaume, and after initially agreeing with Foch’s demand, changed his mind after consulting Currie and Lambert (GOC 32nd Division). Edmonds later claimed that Rawlinson was “almost insubordinate” <b>in</b> <b>asking</b> Haig whether he or “Marechal Foch” was in command, but this may not be an exact recollection as there is no record of the two men meeting that day. Haig told Byng (11 August) to be ready to attack with Third Army towards Bapaume and permitted Rawlinson to order a pause. Foch visited Haig’s command train that evening and concurred with the decision. Haig's initial orders to Rawlinson, to be ready to attack again after a short halt, have been criticised but Sheffield suggests that Haig had to defer to Foch this time, to clear the way for Byng’s attack. Haig then cancelled Fourth Army’s attack on Currie’s advice (based on aerial reconnaissance) that it would be “a desperate enterprise” for the BEF to overreach itself and engage new German troops with tired Allied ones who had outrun much of their artillery cover, and he switched to a new line of offensive. Haig wrote that on 15 August he “spoke to Foch quite straightly, and let him understand that I was responsible for the handling of the British forces”. Foch {{had little choice but to}} agree, and interfered little with Haig’s decisions thereafter, but removed First French Army from Haig’s command.|$|E

500|$|Competition, for Russell, is a {{word that}} may have many uses. Although most often meant to refer to {{competition}} between companies, it may also be used to speak of competition between states, between ideologues, between classes, rivals, trusts, workers, etc. On this topic, Russell ultimately wishes to answer two questions: [...] "First, in what kinds of cases is competition technically wasteful? Secondly, in what cases is it desirable on non-technical grounds?" [...] (Russell 1938:176). <b>In</b> <b>asking</b> these questions, he has two concerns directly in mind: economic competition, and the competition of propaganda.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{concerns}} were expressed by other O.T.O. members. The O.T.O.'s US head, Karl Germer, labeled her [...] "an ordeal {{sent by the}} gods".
