40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of tax {{incentives}} on R&D activities in Taiwanese manufacturing firms. Specifically, we assess the potential R&D-enhancing effect on recipients of R&D tax credits compared with their non-recipient counterparts. Moreover, the potential difference in the R&D-enhancing effect between high-tech and non-high-tech firms is also examined. Utilizing a firm-level panel dataset during 2001 and 2005, empirical results obtained by propensity score matching show that recipients of R&D tax credits appear on average to have 93. 53 % higher R&D expenditures and a 14. 47 % higher growth rate for R&D expenditures than non-recipients with similar characteristics. The R&D-enhancing effect of R&D tax credits is {{not found to be}} particularly relevant to high-tech or non-high-tech firms. We further employ a generalized method of moment (GMM) of the panel fixed model to control for the endogeneity of R&D tax credits and firm heterogeneity in determining R&D expenditure. Various estimates based on the entire sample and high-tech-firms are quite similar and there is a significantly R&D-enhancing effect of R&D tax credits. This result suggests that the R&D preferential policy has induced more R&D <b>expenditure</b> <b>by</b> <b>firms</b> in Taiwan. While the existence of the R&D-enhancing effect brought on by tax incentives is intuitive, the estimates can provide insightful implications for the R&D tax policy...|$|E

40|$|The new {{evidence}} collected by WIFO through the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) shows that Austria's {{performance in the}} area of innovation is significantly better than could be suggested based on current statistics and the views brought forth in economic and technology policy debates. When it comes to the introduction of process and product innovations, Austrian firms are among the most innovative within Europe. Austria lags only slightly behind the European average of expenditures for innovation (3. 5 percent of revenue in Austria versus 3. 8 percent in Europe), mainly because Austrian firms are rather risk averse and are implementing small scale but numerous innovative projects. However, when relying on an output indicator in order to measure Austria's innovative strength, Austrian firms are up to par with Europe: 31 percent of the generated revenues stem from new and improved products, which corresponds to the European average. Only in Germany do firms manage to generate more revenue with their new or improved products (43 percent). The Community Innovation Survey (CIS) was also used as a framework to determine the level, and to make projections, of R&D expenditures for the year 1996. The results indicate that here too, expenditures increased significantly relative to the last available statistics in 1993.

We investigate how much of innovation investment is being limited by financial obstacles. There is a large literature documenting the effects of financial constraints on R&D <b>expenditures</b> <b>by</b> <b>firms</b> in OECD countries (Himmelberg and Petersen, 1994; Mulkay et al, 2001; Bond et al., 2006; see Hall (2002) and Hall and Lerner (2009), for a review). Yet the evidence {{on the relationship between}} innovation and access to finance is lacking for developing countries, and notably for Latin American firms. The information available from innovation surveys points to lack of financing as one of the major barrier for innovation in Latin American firms (Navarro et al, 2010; Anllo and Suarez, 2009). Financial restrictions for innovation are an important constraint for firms to catch up and develop technological and economic advantages, and more generally, they are an important handicap for countries to improve economic development (IADB, 2010). This investigation therefore contributes to the literature in several dimensions. We provide first evidence on lack of innovation investment that is due to financial restrictions for three countries in Latin America. In addition, given that these surveys include most of industries and firms size, we explore heterogeneities across these two dimensions. It has been repeatedly argued that financial constraints are particularly more accentuated for small and medium size firms (SMEs) which are less able to provide collaterals against their loans. Further, as shown by Gorodnichenko and Schnitzer (2010), financial restrictions are more onerous for services than for manufacturing. It is less easy for firms in services to provide warranties to borrowers as their economic advantages rely more on intangible assets such as loyalty of customers and customer base) and as a result, they often face higher costs of external finance than the rest of industries...|$|R

Second, it uses use an index of relative compliance costs that accounts for states' different industrial compositions. Third, it uses a panel of annual measures of relative regulatory stringency from 1977 to 1994.

The total environmental capital expenditure of 8. 7 billion <b>by</b> our sample <b>firms</b> during 1989 - 2000 supports the focus on this industry.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is motivated}} by the recent increase in formation of product standards in many high technology markets. These markets are characterized by {{a high degree of}} technological uncertainty and high levels of R&D <b>expenditures</b> <b>by</b> incumbent <b>firms.</b> In this dissertation we examine how how rapid technological change in the environment affects firms incentive to standardize. We also examine how product standards affect R&D investment levels and how firms' competence in different types of innovation affects their preferences for compatibility. We developed a game theoretical model in which firms make both compatibility and R&D investment decisions. We first studied how rapid technological change in high technology markets affects firms' incentive to standardize. We find that the inherent technological uncertainty in high technology environments promotes the formation of standards. This result is in contrast to the popular view that in technologically uncertain environments standards {{are less likely to be}} formed. Our results suggest that incumbent firms can use standards to protect themselves from the threat of displacement by exogenously developed superior technology. In other words, incumbent firms can use compatibility as a competitive tool to deter entry. We also find that compatibility generally leads to higher investments in minor R&D. In contrast, compatibility decreases investment in breakthrough R&D. This result suggests that standards affect the nature of R&D competition. Before products are standardized, firms are more likely to invest in developing new breakthrough technologies. In contrast, when products become standardized innovation efforts will be focused on developing minor improvements for the present technology. We also examined how firms' R&D competence will affect their preferences for compatibility. Our results show that firms which are more efficient at developing at minor product improvements have a stronger preference for compatibility than firms which are less efficient in minor R&D. In contract, firms which are efficient in developing breakthrough technologies find standardization a less attractive option...|$|R

40|$|R&D {{tax credits}} {{have become a}} popular policy tool for {{encouraging}} research and development (R&D) spending by business, with many countries offering subsidies of this form. The divergence between private and social rates of return to R&D <b>expenditure</b> <b>by</b> private <b>firms</b> provides {{one of the main}} justifications for government subsidies to R&D. 2 In order to achieve the optimal level of R&D investment, government policy aims to bring private incentives in line with the social rate of return. An R&D tax credit does this by reducing the cost to the firm of doing R&D. Recent empirical evidence suggests that R&D tax credits are an effective instrument in stimulating additional R&D. However, in order to be desirable, a policy needs to be cost-effective and implementable. This Briefing Note reviews some of the major issues in the design and implementation of R&D tax credits. In Section 2, we briefly discuss the existing tax treatment of R&D in the UK. In particular, we outline the new Research and Development Allowance - which is an allowance for expenditure on plant, machinery and buildings for use in scientific research and which is available to firms of all sizes - and the tax credit for R&D that is available to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We then discuss, in Section 3, some of the main design features of tax credits that have been implemented in other countries. The discussion mainly concerns {{the question of how to}} target new or incremental R&D so as to keep down the total exchequer cost. We discuss problems that arise in defining incremental R&D and how these can be tackled. In Section 4, we provide estimates of the amount of new R&D and the exchequer cost that would be likely to result from implementing different designs of R&D tax credit in the UK. Section 5 concludes. Some technical details are dealt with in the Appendix. ...|$|R
