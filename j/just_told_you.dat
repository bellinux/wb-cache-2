6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} I {{did not know}} your brother has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> me--that <b>you</b> are to be wed before Christmas. He has ordered me to write your epithalamium." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. My dear Arthur, what a {{piece of}} good luck meeting you on the doorstep! Your servant had <b>just</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> were not at home. How extraordinary! ...|$|R
6000|$|... “But hang it all, my dear fellow,” said Blenkinthrope impatiently, “haven’t I <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{that nothing}} of a {{remarkable}} nature ever happens to me?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And has he only <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of it?' said Milly, who, having really {{heard of}} worse conduct, {{even in her}} {{innocent}} life, avoided a direct answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible! You {{forget what}} I have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> My father was {{suffering}} {{at that time}} under the illness which afterward caused his death. He was quite unfit to interfere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't laugh, sir! There's {{nothing to}} be amused at in what <b>you</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> me. <b>You</b> didn't go into his room last night? Oh, what made you do that!" ...|$|R
30|$|Carol: I {{pretty much}} <b>just</b> <b>told</b> them, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> tell me, {{you have to}} be able to prove it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Eh? What? Can't love you? What do {{you know}} about it? It's my affair, isn't it? You dare say that to a man who has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you!</b> You must be mad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can draw}} no other conclusion," [...] said Julian, [...] "unless the English doctor's idea {{is the right}} one. After hearing what I have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> he thinks the woman herself is Mercy Merrick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Making {{acquaintance}} with me? I have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that I was walking behind her. She {{could not have}} known of the existence of such a person as myself until I spoke to her first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--you won't find 'em. I {{knows nothing}} about 'em, in course, except <b>just</b> what I'm <b>told.</b> <b>You</b> know my line of life, Mr. 'Oward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. You see, Norman, it is <b>just</b> as I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> All civilised {{people are}} just alike when they get into a drawing-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mr. Crow <b>just</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> were dead; that he {{had seen}} Mr. Man {{carrying}} you home by the tail,' I said as soon as I could gather my wits and much to my surprise Bobby said, as if it was something that happened to him regularly: ...|$|R
60|$|MISS HOWARD. Another thing. You mustn't say {{anything}} to her of what Miss Gilpin <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about her being sent away to the State Farm in a few days. Eileen isn't to know till the very last minute. It would only disturb her.|$|E
6000|$|... "What I {{told you}} when I {{first came in}} this evening was quite true," [...] said her husband, slowly. [...] "And what I’ve <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> is as true as what that lying old fortune-teller told you. You can please {{yourself}} what you believe." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm afraid," [...] said The Oskaloosa Kid. [...] "Let's {{leave this}} frightful place. It's <b>just</b> as I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> it was; <b>just</b> as I always heard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, Jack!' she cried. 'I {{have heard}} such a fearsome rumour--what doth it mean? He {{who told me}} is my best friend. He must be deceived! But who deceived him, and why? Jack, I was <b>just</b> <b>told</b> that <b>you</b> had a wife living when you married me, and have her still!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{the thing}} done <b>just</b> as I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> The stuff {{was in a}} bit of white paper. When he went forward he threw the paper overboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well!--I've <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{everything}} because I {{like to be}} on the square. I {{wish you}} knew Kate O'Hara. I'm sure you would not wonder that a fellow should love her. I had rather you didn't tell my aunt what I have told you; but if you choose to do so, I can't help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I come now," [...] Inspector Jacks said slowly, [...] "to {{the object}} of my call upon Your Highness. Following upon what I have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> certain other {{information}} has come into my possession to this effect--that not only was this murderer a Japanese, but we have evidence which {{seems to suggest that}} he was attached in some way to your household." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lady Lannoy wants, if it {{will not}} disturb you, to ask how you are. Ordinarily I should not let anyone see you. But she is not only your hostess, but, as I have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> it was her ride to the headland, where she burned the house to give you light, which was the {{beginning}} of your rescue. Still if you think it better not [...] . !' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, father; the {{agreement}} is <b>just</b> as I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> If it turns out well they get their wages {{and the right to}} use our shaft to get at their claims." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I repeat,' {{said his}} son firmly, 'that I love her. You have {{interposed}} to part us, and have, {{to the extent}} I have <b>just</b> now <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of, succeeded. May I induce you, sir, in time, to think more favourably of our attachment, or is it your intention and your fixed design to hold us asunder if you can?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Holding up the Deed] Look! He's <b>just</b> gone! I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> it {{was only}} {{necessary}} to use the threat. He caved in and signed this; we are sworn to say nothing. We've beaten him.|$|R
6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Wait a little, Mr. Vanstone; I {{have not}} done with my {{instructions}} yet. You understand what I have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you?</b> Very good. We may get on from to-day to to-morrow. Go out to-morrow with Mrs. Lecount at your usual time. I will meet you on the Parade, and bow to you. Instead of returning my bow, look the other way. In plain English, cut me! That is easy enough to do, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, big ships always tows small craft, your honour," [...] {{returned}} Galleygo, simpering. [...] "Howsever, I {{never comes}} without an errand, as every body knows. You see, Sir Jarvy,--you see, Admiral Blue, that our signal-officer is ashore, {{with a report}} for us; and meeting me in the hall, {{he made it to}} me first like, that I might bring it up to you a'terwards. His news is that the French county is gone to sea, as I has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> gentlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he said to}} the ostler, [...] "can't you put me up {{to another}} good thing, <b>just</b> as <b>you</b> <b>told</b> that gentleman <b>you</b> were {{speaking}} to me about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Children," [...] cried Allen, as if {{they were}} vipers. [...] "That's <b>just</b> what I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> mother. If you will persist in {{throwing}} open the park, we shall not have a pheasant on the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hasn't it though, really? That's so {{good of you}} again! Now {{the truth}} is--but it's pretty nearly <b>just</b> what I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that day after dinner, when you agreed, you know, to what we had done." ...|$|R
