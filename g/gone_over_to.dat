5|$|Humphrey (VI) de Bohun {{was part}} of a line of Anglo-Norman aristocrats going back to the Norman Conquest, most of whom carried the same name. His {{grandfather}} was Humphrey (IV) de Bohun, who {{had been part of the}} baronial opposition of Simon de Montfort, but later <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the royal side. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, but was restored to favour after the royalist victory at the Battle of Evesham the next year. Humphrey (IV)'s son, Humphrey (V) de Bohun, remained loyal to the baronial side throughout the Barons' War, and was captured at Evesham on 4 August 1265. In October that year Humphrey (V) died in captivity at Beeston Castle in Cheshire from injuries he had sustained in the battle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Van der Byl {{was willing to}} endorse the Smith government's {{negotiations}} with moderate black nationalist leaders and rejected attempts by international missions to broker an agreement. He served in the short-lived government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement. After the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, Van der Byl remained in politics and close to Ian Smith; he loudly attacked former RF colleagues who had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> support Robert Mugabe. He retired to South Africa after the Mugabe government abolished the parliament seats reserved for whites in 1987, and died in 1999 {{at the age of}} 76.|$|E
5|$|The FPÖ fared {{much better}} than the BZÖ in polls {{following}} the 2005 split, with the first tests in regional elections in Styria and Burgenland. On 23 April 2005 Heinz-Christian Strache was elected as new chairman of the FPÖ, taking over from interim leader Hilmar Kabas. As most of the party's office-seeking elite had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the BZÖ, the FPÖ was again free from responsibility. Under Strache the party's ideology grew more radical, and it returned to its primary goal of vote-maximising. The FPÖ did reasonably well in October's Vienna election, in which Strache was the leading candidate and ran a campaign directed strongly against immigration. It took a 14.9% share, while the BZÖ won just 1.2%.|$|E

5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage a situation that, {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopeless—indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers would certainly have <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point for the Arab fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Oxford, {{commanding}} {{the right wing}} of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's 'Streaming star' banner as the king's 'Sunne in splendour,' and thus believe that the Earl had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> York. Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a cognizance, and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.|$|E
5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Bizye heard of Thomas's fate, they surrendered Anastasius, who suffered the same fate as Thomas. In Panium and Heraclea, Thomas's men held out until an earthquake struck in February 824. The tremor severely damaged the wall of Panium, and the city surrendered. The damage at Heraclea was less severe, but after Michael landed troops at its seaward side, it too was forced to surrender. In Asia Minor, Thomas's loyalists mostly submitted peacefully, but in the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, resistance lingered until suppressed by strategos John Echimos. In the Thracesian theme, Thomas's soldiers turned to brigandage. The most serious opposition was offered in central Asia Minor by two officers, who had possibly served Thomas as strategoi: Choireus, with his base at Kaballa northwest of Iconium, and Gazarenos Koloneiates, based at Saniana, southeast of Ancyra. From their strongholds, they spurned Michael's offer of a pardon and the high title of magistros and raided the provinces that had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him. Soon, however, Michael's agents persuaded {{the inhabitants}} of the two forts to shut their gates against the officers. Choireus and Koloneiates then tried to seek refuge in Arab territory but were attacked en route by loyalist troops, captured, and crucified.|$|E

25|$|The 1850s {{and early}} 1860s saw {{continued}} development. The Māori tribes took up European agricultural methods and crops, primarily wheat, pigs and peaches, which were traded with Auckland. There were still {{only a few}} Westerners living in the district, fewer still of whom were British by birth. Among these foreigners were Dr Albert Agassiz (1840–1910), distant cousin of the famous Swiss/American scientist Louis Agassiz, and Carl Völkner, a German missionary who had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Anglican Church.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly {{powerful}} {{from the}} 12th century, the territory's autonomous urban communes {{were instrumental in}} defeating a French attempt at annexation (1300–1302), finally defeating the French in the Battle of the Golden Spurs (11 July 1302), near Kortrijk. Two years later, the uprising was defeated and Flanders remained part of the French Crown. Flemish prosperity waned in the following century, however, owing to widespread European population decline following the Black Death of 1348, the disruption of trade during the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), and increased English cloth production. Flemish weavers had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Worstead and North Walsham in Norfolk in the 12th century and established the woolen industry.|$|E
25|$|Matilda was {{supported}} by her uncle King David of Scotland, {{and he did not}} accept Stephen's succession peacefully. Thus Eustace was placed in the front line of a new war, and when David invaded northern England Eustace's castle of Alnwick was among those captured by David in the first two months of the year (though it was returned in March). Stephen relieved Eustace of control of Bamburgh Castle when he returned from his punitive invasion of Lothian early in 1138. It has been claimed that Eustace must have <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> David's side by the end of 1137, when David invaded northern England. There is no proof however that Eustace had switched allegiance at this point.|$|E

25|$|After his lieutenants {{were badly}} {{defeated}} at the Battle of Lincoln on 20 May 1217, Prince Louis raised his siege of Dover Castle and retired to London. Signalling {{his willingness to}} negotiate {{an end to the}} struggle, he agreed to meet at Brentford with adherents of the boy-king Henry III of England. The victor of Lincoln, William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Louis came close to an agreement. However, in order to pardon the bishops who had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Louis' cause, Pope Honorius III's acquiescence was required. Since this was not possible without a long journey to Rome, the negotiations broke down. Louis received the news that reinforcements and supplies would soon arrive from France. Encouraged, he resolved to fight on.|$|E
25|$|Operation Torch was the American and British {{invasion}} of French North Africa, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, started on 8 November 1942, with landings in Morocco and Algeria. The long-term {{goal was to}} clear German and Italian forces from North Africa, enhance naval control of the Mediterranean, and prepare for an {{invasion of}} Italy in 1943. The Vichy forces initially resisted, killing 479 Allied forces and wounding 720. Vichy Admiral Darlan initiated cooperation with the Allies. The Allies recognized Darlan's self-nomination as High Commissioner of France (head of civil government) for North and West Africa. He ordered Vichy forces there to cease resisting and cooperate with the Allies, and they did so. By the time the Tunisia Campaign was fought, the French forces in North Africa had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Allied side, joining the Free French Forces.|$|E
25|$|Reynaud and de Portes {{left the}} Hotel Splendid, Bordeaux, driving {{southeast}} {{ahead of the}} advancing German armies, intending to stop at Reynaud's holiday home at Grès, Hérault, (other sources state Sainte-Maxime) before fleeing to North Africa. On 28 June, with Reynaud at the wheel, their Renault Juvaquatre car inexplicably left the road and hit a plane tree at La Peyrade, between Frontignan and Sète; de Portes was all but decapitated, while Reynaud escaped with relatively minor head injuries. Hospitalized at Montpellier, Reynaud was arrested on his discharge on Pétain's orders and imprisoned at Fort du Portalet. Pétain decided against having Reynaud charged during the Riom Trial of 1942, but surrendered him to the Germans instead, who removed him firstly to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, thence Itter Castle near Wörgl, Austria, where he remained with other high-profile French prisoners until liberated by Allied troops on 7 May 1945. Major Josef Gangl, a Wehrmacht officer who had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the anti-Nazi Austrian resistance, {{was killed by a}} sniper's bullet while trying to move Reynaud out of harm's way during the Battle for Castle Itter on May 5, 1945.|$|E

500|$|Parliamentary seats {{reserved}} for whites were abolished in 1987. Van der Byl made his last speech in Parliament on 10 September, {{in which he}} praised Robert Mugabe for the [...] "absolute courtesy" [...] he had shown since independence. He noted {{that he was the}} last surviving member of the 1965 government remaining in Parliament, and declared he hoped [...] "I would have been cherished [...]. as a sort of national monument, and not flung into the political wilderness". His speech loudly denounced the former Republican Front and Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe members who had <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the government, describing them as [...] "dreadful souls screaming in agony". The government minister Dr Edson Zvobgo responded with a poorly written poem referring to the number of rebels killed fighting troops under Van der Byl's command.|$|E
500|$|Lowell was an abolitionist, but his {{opinions}} wavered concerning African-Americans. He advocated suffrage for blacks, yet {{he noted that}} their ability to vote could be troublesome. Even so, he wrote, [...] "We believe the white race, by their intellectual and traditional superiority, will retain sufficient ascendancy to prevent any serious mischief from the new order of things." [...] Freed slaves, he wrote, were [...] "dirty, lazy & lying". Even before his marriage to abolitionist Maria White, Lowell wrote: [...] "The abolitionists {{are the only ones}} with whom I sympathize of the present extant parties." [...] After his marriage, Lowell at first did not share his wife's enthusiasm for the cause, but he was eventually pulled in. The couple often gave money to fugitive slaves, even when their own financial situation was not strong, especially if they were asked to free a spouse or child. Even so, he did not always fully agree with the followers of the movement. The majority of these people, he said, [...] "treat ideas as ignorant persons do cherries. They think them unwholesome unless they are swallowed, stones and all." [...] Lowell depicted Southerners very unfavorably in his second collection of The Biglow Papers but, by 1865, admitted that Southerners were [...] "guilty only of weakness" [...] and, by 1868, said that he sympathized with Southerners and their viewpoint on slavery. Enemies and friends of Lowell alike questioned his vacillating interest in the question of slavery. Abolitionist Samuel Joseph May accused him of trying to quit the movement because of his association with Harvard and the Boston Brahmin culture: [...] "Having got into the smooth, dignified, self-complacent, and change-hating society of the college and its Boston circles, Lowell has <b>gone</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the world, and to 'respectability'." ...|$|E

This was in contravention of the Constitution of Medina, of which the tribe led by Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf was a signatory, which prohibited them from [...] "extending any support" [...] to the tribes of Mecca, namely Quraish.
