5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
30|$|Modeling of {{physical}} activity was assessed with eight questions that asked the participants to indicate whether they observed people in their social environment or the media engaging in or discussing physical activity/exercise. Participants {{were asked to respond}} “yes” or “no” to the following questions: “Today, the following happened: (1) I noticed people like me exercising; (2) A <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> member offered to exercise with me; (3) I read or heard news stories about people exercising; (4) I was aware that a member of my family exercised today; (5) A <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> member exercised with me; (6) A <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> member talked to me about their exercise program; (7) A <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> member shared their experience about how to stay with an exercise program; and (8) I noticed people walking in my neighborhood.” The total number of “yes” responses was added to obtain a total score with a possible range from 0 to 8. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) for our survey was r =  0.75.|$|R

5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

25|$|The kiss on {{the lips}} can be {{performed}} between two <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>family.</b> This move aims to express the affection that you have for a friend. Unlike kissing for love, a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The {{kiss on the}} lips is a practice {{that can be found}} in the time of Patriarchs (Bible). In Ancient Greece, the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank. In the Middle Ages, the kiss of peace was recommended by the Catholic Church. The kiss on the lips was also common among knights. The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.|$|E
25|$|The rivers {{provide the}} most obvious means of {{transporting}} goods and people. A 700-kilometre boat journey from Basankusu to the capital, Kinshasa, can take several weeks. Major barge operators are Transports Fluvial et Commerce de l'Equateur (TFCE) and Office National des Transports (ONATRA). Passengers often travel in cramped conditions, in some cases travelling atop the logs being pushed along the river by the barges. They are victim to high prices for food and other essentials along the way. The frequent breakdown of these river boats puts passengers in a precarious position regarding daily sustenance; a delay of several days can oblige passengers to sell all their belongings {{so that they can}} buy a meal. The poor communication within the country, generally, means that passengers cannot be helped by <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{conventions}} {{for professional}} artists working in private {{are much less}} defined, especially as the models are often <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>family.</b> However, artists who regularly hire strangers tend to observe art school standards {{in order to make}} models feel more comfortable, and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This may be something as simple as not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model feel that they are collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.|$|E
25|$|When visiting <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> {{and staying}} with them, all foreign {{visitors}} {{are required to}} register with the Aliens Department of the local MUP {{in the place of}} the intended stay, within twenty-four hours of entering the country. At the Department, they will fill in a form (a sort of a landing card) made of two parts (both parts should be filled in). The form is processed by the officer in charge and a stamped segment is returned to the applicant. Visitors should always have this certificate on them during the entire stay in the country together with their passport or (for certain nationals) ID card. Foreigners who, at the time of registering with the police, know the date of their departure from Serbia, should mention it to the officer processing their registration in order to avoid additional visit to the same police department for de-registration. The registration is free of charge. At passport control at the port of exit, the certificate is collected by the immigration officer. Failing to complete the registration may result in fines.|$|E

25|$|From 8 to 12 August, {{as many as}} 10,000 {{residents}} fled to Yunnan {{province in}} neighbouring China, becoming refugees. The total number of refugees fleeing in the entire month may {{be as high as}} 30,000, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and later the Yunnan provincial government. Yunnan's police chief later reported that the number of refugees in Yunnan reached 37,000, including Burmese refugees as well as Kokang. Yunnan government officials stated they have established seven locations (particularly near the city of Nansan, where most of the refugees arrived) to house and treat the refugees; some locals, however, claimed that not all the refugees were being housed, or were being housed in unfinished buildings and tents. According to one refugee, about 13,000 of the refugees were housed in the tents, and 10,000–20,000 more stayed with <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> in the area. By 31 August, some refugees (as many as 4,000, according to local officials, or 2,800 according to the junta government) had started returning to Kokang; by mid-September, Chinese officials said over 9,000 refugeees had returned and Myanmar officials said over 13,000; many refugees, however, were still afraid to go back.|$|E

500|$|The {{monument}} where [...] "visitors can simultaneously straddle {{the territory}} of four states" [...] is maintained as a tourist attraction by the Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation Department. Unlike many other attractions based on what are primarily political boundaries, such as the Berlin Wall, Four Corners Monument {{is an example of}} a political boundary that is a tourist destination in its own right. The monument consists of a granite disk embedded with a smaller bronze disk around the point, surrounded by smaller, appropriately located state seals and flags representing both the states and tribal nations of the area. Circling the point, starting from north, the disk reads with two words in each state [...] "Here meet in freedom under God four states". Around the monument, local Navajo and Ute artisans sell souvenirs and food. An admission fee is required to view and photograph the monument. The monument is a popular tourist attraction despite its remote and isolated location. As early as 1908, people traveled long distances to take pictures of family and friends at the monument in Twister-like poses, sitting on the disk, in a circle of <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> around the disk, or for couples to kiss directly over the disk.|$|E
