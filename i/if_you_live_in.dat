25|$|Most mammals such as calves, sheep, goats, foals, pigs, cats, cavies, rats, {{mice and}} humans can be infested by the Australian Paralysis Tick. Fatalities {{resulting}} from a single engorged adult female tick are mostly reported in the young animals of the larger species and all ages and sizes of the pet species (dogs and cats). Larvae and nymphs can also produce toxic reactions in the host. Fifty larvae or five nymphs can kill a 40g rat, larger numbers of either can induce paralysis in dogs and cats. They can be quite easy to find on short-haired animals, but very difficult to find on long-haired animals like Persian cats. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a tick-prone area, and your pets are allowed outdoors, {{it is suggested that}} you physically check your pets daily for ticks. Unfortunately they are often not discovered until the tick is large enough to be felt. By this time the tick has subjected the animal to a large amount of toxins. One adult female can kill four susceptible rats during engorgement. Although it is not typical, an engorging adult female apparently can re-attach several times to different dogs.|$|E

[...] "The chief {{variable}} to choosing between a kestrel and a merlin {{may be your}} hawking land. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> open country, or have access at least to good pasture for cattle, a merlin can excel there. If you plan to hunt mostly in town or suburb, and especially {{if you plan to}} hawk from a car, I’d recommend the kestrel. [...] The consideration coming in at close second is your intended quarry. To snipe, dove, quail and open-country sparrows, merlins are best suited. For most blackbirds (Icteridea), either falcon can prove effective. Starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels; but in the open are best prey for merlins. [...] The same holds true for house sparrows, with this exception: sparrows in thick cover are better quarry for kestrels. This is the slip for which I feel the American kestrel is perfect." ...|$|E

Radebaugh came to Tacoma from San Francisco in 1880 and was one of Tacoma’s best promoters from the very start. He was the father of the Daily Ledger, Tacoma’s first daily newspaper. In 1889 Randolph put together the street car line, named the Tacoma and Fern Hill Railway for the area it served. Later within the same year, that line was extended into Midland and on towards Puyallup. The name was changed to Tacoma Puyallup Railway. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Tacoma or on the hill, the line was generally referred to as the Puyallup Hill Line. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Puyallup it was affectionately called the Grapevine Line.
