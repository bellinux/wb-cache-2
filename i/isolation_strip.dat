5000|$|Girls in the United States enter a Juvenile Justice System {{that was}} {{initially}} formed {{in a manner}} intended to cater to predominately male offenders. Assessment tools used by most institutions were designed for this use. Additionally, research has estimated that between 67-90% of youth in juvenile detention facilities {{have at least one}} mental health diagnosis, and that PTSD rates among youth in these facilities may be as much as 10-15 times higher than in the general population. However, as of 2007, less than 2% of juvenile justice residential facilities in the U.S. were accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care for facility medical and mental health care. Research indicates a lack of programming for girls has been an ongoing issue for several decades. A review of delinquency prevention programs across the country found 433 identified programs out of the number 2% were designed for girls. [...] The mismatch between the system's design and the unique needs and experiences of girls has been identified as particularly problematic given the prevalence of sexual abuse and trauma history among systems-involved girls. National surveys conducted by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention have found insufficient health and trauma-related services for girls in residential detention centers. For example, only 18% of juvenile justice facilities provided pregnancy testing upon entry to the facility. For girls who have experienced trauma, status quo procedures within detention facilities, such as shackling, <b>isolation,</b> <b>strip</b> searches, and lack of access to comprehensive health and hygiene statuses can re-trigger trauma experiences and responses.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrecision {{machines}} like electron-positron-colliders and b-factories {{demand for}} low material budget and high position resolution {{when it comes}} to particle tracking. A low material budget can be achieved by using thin double-sided silicon detectors (DSSDs) and lightweight construction. Since thin sensors give low signals, one has to be very careful to achieve high charge collection efficiency, which requires an appropriate sensor design. In this paper we present a detailed investigation of different p-stop patterns used for <b>strip</b> <b>isolation</b> on the n-side of double-sided microstrip sensors with n-type bulk. We designed test sensors featuring the common p-stop, the atoll p-stop and a combined p-stop pattern, and for every pattern four different geometric layouts were considered. These sensors were tested at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) in a 120 GeV/c hadron beam. Then they were irradiated to 700 kGy with a 60 Co source and subsequently tested in the same beam as before. One geometric layout of the atoll p-stop pattern turned out to perform best, both before and after irradiation. The conclusions of these tests will be applied to the design of DSSDs for the Belle II experiment at KEK (Tsukuba, Japan) ...|$|R

Each wafer contains 10 microstrip sensors with different geometries, several diodes and test structures. The <b>isolation</b> in the <b>strip</b> detectors produced on p-type material has been achieved {{by means of a}} uniform p-spray implantation, with doping of 3 x 10 (12) cm(- 2) (low-dose p-spray) and 5 x 10 (12) cm(- 2) (high-dose p-spray). The samples have undergone irradiations with 26 MeV protons and reactor neutrons up to similar to 10 (16) cm(- 2) 1 MeV equivalent neutrons (n(eq) /cm(2)), and have been completely characterized before and after irradiation in terms of leakage current, depletion voltage and breakdown voltage. The current damage parameter alpha has been determined for all substrates. MCz diodes show less pronounced dependence of effective doping concentration N-eff on the fluence when compared to standard FZ silicon, giving results comparable to diffusion oxygenated FZ devices for all irradiation sources. The observed increase of Neff with fluence can be interpreted in EPI material as a net donor introduction process, overcompensating the usual acceptor introduction process. This effect is stronger for 26 MeV proton irradiation than for neutron irradiation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Dividing the {{detector}} crystal into discrete pixels enables making an imaging detector, {{in which the}} charge collected by each pixel can be read separately. Even if {{the detector}} is not meant for imaging, patterns on the crystal surface {{may be used as}} guard structures that control and limit the flow of charges in the crystal. This has been exceedingly hard for the detector crystals having thick diffused layers. The paper reports a patterning method of the thick diffused junctions on CdTe. The patterning method of In-diffused pn-junction on CdTe chip is demonstrated by using a diamond blade. The patterning is done by removing material from the pn-junction side of the chip, so that the trenches penetrate the diffused layer. As the trenches extend deeper into the bulk than the junction, the regions separated by the trench are electrically isolated. Electrical characterization results are reported for the strips separated by trenches with various depths.

Problems with the <b>isolation</b> of epidermal <b>strips</b> and the small size of A. thaliana guard cells were often prohibiting. In the present study these difficulties were overcome and guard cells were impaled with double-barreled microelectrodes. Membrane-potential record were often stable for over half an hour and voltage-clamp measurements could be conducted. The guard cells were found to exhibit two slates. The majority of the guard cells had depolarized membrane potentials. which were largely dependent on external K+ concentrations. Other cells displayed spontaneous transitions to a more hyperpolarized state, at which the free-running membrane potential (E-m) was not sensitive to the external K+ concentration. Two outward-rectifying conductances were identified in cells in the depolarized state. A slow outward-rectifying channel (s-ORC) had properties resembling the K+-selective ORC of Vicia faba guard cells (Blatt, 1988, J Membr Biol 102 : 235 - 246). The activation and inactivation times and the activation potential, all depended on the reversal potential (E-rev) of the s-ORC conductance. The s-ORC was blocked by Ba 2 + (K- 1 / 2 = 0. 3 - 1. 3 mM) and verapamil (K- 1 / 2 = 15 - 20 mu M). A second rapid outward-rectifying conductance (r-ORC) activated instantaneously upon stepping the voltage to positive values and was stimulated by Ba 2 +. Inward-rectifying channels (IRC) were only observed in cells in the hyperpolarized stale. The activation time and activation potential of this channel were not sensitive to the external K+ concentration. The slow activation of the IRC (t(1 / 2) approximate to 0. 5 s) and its negative activation potential (V-threshold = - 155 mV) resemble the values found for the KAT 1 channel expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bertl ct al., 1995, Free Natl Acad Sci USA 92 : 2701 - 2705).

These detectors and their {{applications in the}} upgrades of the LHC experiments are discussed. 3 D detectors with a double-sided geometry have been fabricated as very short strip detectors with similar inter-column spacing as proposed for the ATLAS pixel detector and LHCb vertex locator upgrades. The detectors have been irradiated up to a fluence of 2 × 1016 cm- 2 1 MeV equivalent neutrons, which is twice the expected dose of the inner pixel layer of the ATLAS detector and of the upgraded LHCb vertex locator for LHC high luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC) operation. Electrical measurements show a lateral depletion voltage of only 4 V for the device before irradiation which increases to 200 V after an irradiation to a fluence of 1 × 1016 cm- 2 1 MeV equivalent neutrons. The <b>strip</b> <b>isolation</b> of the p-type detectors was robust to the maximum fluence. Charge collection studies have been performed with analogue readout with 25 ns shaping time, as required for LHC experiments. The response of the detectors to high energy electrons from a 90 Sr source and a collimated pulsed laser light source are shown and compared with planar devices. The 3 D detector, operated at no more than 350 V, is shown to have superior charge collection characteristics to planar devices for all the fluence range expected at HL-LHC even when compared to planar devices operating at 1000 V. When operated at a bias voltage of 350 V the 3 D detector collects 2. 8 times more charge than a p-type planar device operated at 1000 V after a fluence of 1016 cm- 2 1 MeV equivalent neutrons.

40|$|Detectors {{based on}} silicon {{have been proven}} to be {{efficient}} for particle tracking in high energy physics collider experiments. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Tracker at CERN in Geneva has a silicon detector surface of about 200 m^ 2. The increasing demand on more collected data for new physics studies requires an upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider to higher luminosity which is foreseen for 2023. The increase of particles per time and area also introduces a harsh environment for the silicon sensors which should withstand an integrated luminosity of about L = 3000 fb^- 1. Several R&D studies have been undertaken to face the high luminosity challenge and n-in-p detectors {{have been found to}} be more radiation hard than p-in-n. However, n-in-p detectors necessarily need an isolation layer of the n+ strips due to an accumula- tion layer of electrons caused by positive charge in the SiO_ 2 at the sensor surface. An additional implantation of acceptors like boron between the n+ strips cuts the conducting electron layer and ensures reliabe <b>strip</b> <b>isolation.</b> Though the implantation dose as well as the implant energy have to be carefully calculated as they directly affect the breakdown behavior and inter-strip resolution of the sensors. Experimentally, the inter-strip resistance and charge collection efficiency as well as the cluster charge formation are a direct indicator whether the isolation layer is sufficient or not. Furthermore T-CAD simulation studies have been carried out in order to reproduce the measure- ments and to predict the performance of sensors before and after irradiation with protons, neutrons and a mixture of both. Simulations also allow detailed studies of the formation of electric fields in the sensor which predict the sensor performance. Experimentally obtained CCE and misidentified hits in n-in-p devices with p-stop isolation pattern can be explained after analysis of the electric fields in dependence on the p-stop geometry and doping concentrations.

40|$|In this thesis, {{different}} {{physical and}} electrical aspects of silicon microstrip sensors and low-mass multi-line readout cables have been investigated. These silicon microstrip sensors and readout cables {{will be used}} in the Silicon Tracking System (STS) of the fixed-target heavy-ion Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment which is under development at the upcoming Facility for Antiproton and ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany. The highly segmented low-mass tracking system is a central CBM detector system to resolve the high tracking densities of charged particles originating from beam-target interactions. Considering the low material budget requirement the double-sided silicon microstrip detectors have been used in several planar tracking stations. The readout electronics is planned to be installed at the periphery of the tracking stations along with the cooling system. Low-mass multi-line readout cables shall bridge the distance between the microstrip sensors and the readout electronics. The CBM running operational scenario suggests that some parts of the tracking stations are expected to be exposed to a total integrated particle fluence of the order of 1 e 14 neq/cm 2. After 1 e 14 neq/cm 2 the damaged modules in the tracking stations will be replaced. Thus radiation hard sensor is an important requirement for the sensors. Moreover, to cope with the high reaction rates, free-streaming (triggerless) readout electronics with online event reconstruction must be used which require high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio (i. e., high signal efficiency, low noise contributions). Therefore, reduction in noise is a major goal of the sensor and cable development. For better insight into the different aspects of the silicon microstrip sensors and multi-line readout cables, the simulation study has been performed using SYNOPSYS TCAD tools. 3 D models of the silicon microstrip sensors and the readout cables were implemented which is motivated by the stereoscopic construction of the silicon microstrip sensors. For the evaluation of the performance of the silicon microstrip sensors in the harsh radiation environment during experimental operation, a radiation damage model has been included. It reproduces the behavior of the irradiated CBM prototype sensors. In addition to the static characteristics, the interstrip parameters relevant to understand <b>strip</b> <b>isolation</b> and cross-talk issues have been extracted. The transient simulations have been performed to estimate the charge collection performance of the irradiated sensors. The signal transmission in the readout cables has been evaluated with the finite element simulation tool RAPHAEL. Based on the performance of the front-end electronics used for early prototyping in the CBM experiment, capacitive and resistive noise contributions from the silicon microstrip sensors and multi-line readout cables have been extracted. To validate the aforementioned simulations, numerous tests have been performed both on the multi-line readout cables and silicon microstrip sensors. Characterizations of multi-line readout cables and silicon microstrip sensors in laboratory conditions have been found to agree reasonably well with the simulations. Considering the expected radiation environment the behavior of silicon microstrip sensors have been studied especially in terms of noise and charge collection efficiency. Source-scan of the silicon microstrip sensors using 241 Am is presented. In order to test a first system of detector stations including the data acquisition system, slow control and online monitoring software and for track reconstruction, in-beam tests have been performed at the COSY synchrotron of the Research Center Juelich, Germany. Further, different design parameters have been suggested to improve the sensor and readout cable design {{on the basis of the}} simulations and the measurements. Many of these parameters have been implemented in the new prototypes under production. These new prototypes will be tested in-beam by the end of 2013...|$|R
