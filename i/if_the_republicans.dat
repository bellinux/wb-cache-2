The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E

25|$|The National Republican Congressional Committee {{targeted}} Barr's {{race against}} Chandler {{as part of}} their strategy to gain control of the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, and Ohio Congressman John Boehner– who stood to become Speaker of the House <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> gained a majority– visited the state to campaign on Barr's behalf. Substantial amounts of money from political groups outside the state aided both candidates and spawned a number of negative campaign ads. Chandler started the barrage in August with ads alluding to Barr's arrest in Florida for using a fake ID and seeking to tie him to the wrongdoing of the Fletcher administration. Barr countered with ads criticizing Chandler's support of cap-and-trade legislation– an unpopular vote in coal-dependent Kentucky– and his vote in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which Barr characterized as a waste of taxpayer money that did little to stimulate an economic recovery.|$|E

500|$|Kemp {{was partly}} at fault for not {{achieving}} either of his primary goals {{because he did}} not get {{along with the rest of}} the Cabinet. At one point, Kemp told James Baker, White House Chief of Staff, that Bush's best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion. Before the 1992 Republican National Convention, Kemp and six prominent Republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging Bush to revise his economic policy. Contemporaneously, conservative Republicans in office and in the media such as William F. Buckley Jr. and George Will felt Dan Quayle should be ousted in favor of Kemp. This followed Kemp's reference to parts of the President's economic policy as [...] "gimmicks" [...] after the 1992 State of the Union Address. Kemp was respected within the party for opposing Bush, and towards the end of Bush's administration insiders recognized his value. In late 1991, 81 of the 166 Republican Congressmen signed a letter co-authored by Curt Weldon and Dan Burton requesting that Bush cede some domestic authority to Kemp as a [...] "domestic policy czar." [...] The letter, highlighting Kemp's [...] "energy, enthusiasm and national clout", insulted Bush. Kemp was a bit of a surprise to stay in the [...] for the duration of his presidency, and he was described as one of the few Bush Administration members who would take tough stands.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 1943, realizing the war was lost, Papen began {{attending}} secret meetings with the agents of the OSS in Istanbul. The meetings were held in Istanbul as Papen was afraid to meet in Ankara because the SD officer Ludwig Carl Moyzisch had orders from Heinrich Himmler to monitor Papen, which the ambassador knew about. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer described Papen as [...] "… a loner, an outsider, a man of tremendous personal ambition and great vanity". Papen exaggerated his power in Germany to the OSS, and asked for American support to make him dictator of a post-Hitler Germany, as Papen wanted a right-wing regime that would avoid the [...] "excesses" [...] of the Nazis. Moyzisch had been monitoring Papen, and was aware of Papen meeting the OSS, but Himmler was seeking a separate peace with the Western Allies to allow Germany to focus on defeating the Soviet Union, and ordered Moyzisch to allow the meetings to go ahead. On 5 October 1943, Papen met with the American OSS agent and journalist Theodore Morde of Reader's Digest, to tell him that he wanted American support to overthrow Hitler and make himself the new dictator of Germany, saying the terms of peace would be that Germany would remain the dominant power in Europe and suggested under his leadership that Germany and the United States would become allies against the Soviet Union. President Franklin Roosevelt rejected this offer when he heard of it, saying he was very doubtful that Papen had the sort of power that he claimed to have to overthrow Hitler, and told the OSS to stop talking to Papen. At the same time, Papen hedged his bets, telling Hitler that he had information from his American contacts to the effect that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> won the 1944 election, then the United States would make peace with Germany in order to focus on defeating Japan, thereby allowing Germany to defeat Britain and the Soviet Union, and therefore German foreign policy should aim at ensuring President Roosevelt lost the 1944 election. Papen claimed to Hitler that he was talking to the OSS with the intention of making contact with the Republicans to ensure Roosevelt's defeat in the 1944 election.|$|E

On the same ticket that was to elect a Representative to the State Legislature was the candidate for Sheriff of Monroe County.

60|$|In 1861, {{the great}} storm burst over the States. In the {{preceding}} November, Abraham Lincoln {{had been elected}} President. Lincoln was himself, like Garfield, a self-made man, who had risen from the very same pioneer labourer class;--a wood-cutter and rail-splitter in the backwoods of Illinois, {{he had become a}} common boatman on the Mississippi, and had there improved his mind by reading eagerly in all his spare moments. With one of those rapid rises so commonly made by self-taught lads in America, he had pushed his way into the Illinois legislature {{by the time he was}} twenty-five, and qualified himself to practise as a barrister at Springfield. His shrewd original talents had raised him with wonderful quickness into the front ranks of his own party; and when the question between the North and South rose into the region of practical politics, Lincoln was selected by the republicans (the antislavery group) as their candidate for the Presidency of the United States. This selection was a very significant one in several ways; Lincoln was a very strong opponent of slavery, and his candidature showed the southern slave-owners that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were successful in the contest, a vigorous move against the slave-holding oligarchy would at once be made. But it was also significant in the fact that Lincoln was a western man; it was a sign that the farmers and grangers of the agricultural west were beginning to wake up politically and throw themselves into the full current of American State affairs. On both these grounds, Lincoln's nomination must have been deeply interesting to Garfield, whose own life had been so closely similar, and who was destined, twenty years later, to follow him to the same goal.|$|E
