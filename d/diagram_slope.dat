Let c(K) denote the crossing number of K. Theorem 1 (Ichihara-Mizushima [8]) If K is a Montesinos knot, then d(K) ≤ 2 c(K), with equality if K is alternating and Montesinos. This theorem was proved for the case of two-bridge knots in [10]. A spanning surface for a knot K is a surface Σ embedded in S 3 such that ∂Σ = K. Let X denote the knot exterior, this is the closure of S 3 (K). The slope of a spanning surface Σ is {{the slope of the}} surface Σ ∩X on ∂X. Let S(K) be the subset of B(K) that consists of boundary slopes that are realised by spanning surfaces. Let dS(K) be the diameter of S(K). Note that S(K) ⊂ 2 Z, whereas B(K) ⊂ Q ∪ ∞. Theorem 2 (Curtis-Taylor [3]) If K is an alternating knot, then dS(K) = 2 c(K). It is the purpose of this note to provide a counterexample to Theorem 2. The proof given in [3, page 1350] contains a mistake, where a result of Adams and Kindred [1] has been incorrectly stated.

Crack growth rate measurements were performed using center crack tension (CCT) specimens. The weldments with and without incomplete joint penetration (UP) were fatigue tested under constant amplitude axial loading for stress ratios of R = 0 and - 1. For the same applied stress amplitude, {{it was found that}} the fatigue life of weldments under R = - 1 is significant longer than under R = 0 due crack closure effects. The fatigue life of the weldments containing IJP was almost entirely devoted to crack gowth, while crack nucleation (and early growth) was found to be much more important for the butt weldments without IJP. It was found that the fatigue strength of the 5 mm weldments without IJP was not greater than that of t he 25 mm weldments without IJP as would have been expected for smaller size weldments. Estimates of angular distortions and calculations of induced bending stresses suggest that the performance of the 5 mm weldments is more affected by the bending stresses induced by weld distortions.

One {{of the proposed}} controls is a model-based feed-forward control using a characteristic diagram, called a Thrust-cornering characteristic diagram. It consists of various characteristic curves of wheel forces for varied wheel slip conditions. An appropriate steering maneuver for slope traversal can be found using the <b>diagram</b> with <b>slope</b> traversal criteria. The other control is a sensor-based feedback control. A key approach to this feedback control is to compensate for three types of slip, namely, the vehicle sideslip and longitudinal/lateral slips of a wheel. The feedback control cal-culates both steering and driving maneuvers that can compensate for these slips and also allow the rover to successfully traverse a sandy slope. The per-formances of these two control {{approaches are}} confirmed in slope traversal experiments using a four-wheeled rover test bed.

40|$|An {{examination}} {{is made of}} some {{properties of}} the diagrams of complex equilibria constructed by plotting the inverse of the absolute temperature as abscissa and the logarithm of the equilibrium oxygen pressures of all the transformations which can occur in the system as ordinate. At all points in these <b>diagrams</b> the <b>slope</b> of the tangents of the isobars are {{a measure of the}} quotient Q/n, where Q is the heat content change of the sum of all the reactions simultaneously possible, and n the number of g. mol. oxygen needed by the system for these reactions. At the points where these tangents are horizontal, the total heat content of the reaction is zero: the quantities of substances taking part in the various reactions are such that the sum of the heat evolved by the exothermic reactions is equal to that absorbed by the endothermic reactions. At the points where these tangents are vertical, the sum of the reactions occurs without the exchange of oxygen with the surroundings of the system: the quantities of substances taking part in the various reactions are such that the quantity of oxygen liberated by the reduction reactions is equal to that combining in the oxidation reactions; it is particularly at these points where the tangents are vertical that the heterogeneous systems of practical interest are represented. The variance of the physico-chemical systems whose equilibrium characteristics are represented in these diagrams can readily be deduced from a rapid examination of them. A few examples are given from the systems: zinc-oxygen, carbon-oxygen and zinccarbon-oxygen. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{sequentially}} linear saw-tooth continuum model which {{captures the}} nonlinear response via {{a series of}} linear steps is presented. In the model, the softening stress-strain curve with negative slope {{is replaced by a}} saw-tooth <b>diagram</b> of positive <b>slopes,</b> while the incremental-iterative procedure is replaced by a scaled sequentially linear procedure. Mesh-size objectivity is achieved by adjusting both the peaks and the ultimate strain of the saw-tooth diagram {{to the size of the}} finite elements, keeping the fracture energy invariant. First, considering large-scale dog-bone specimens in direct tension, it will be demonstrated that the model is capable of automatically providing the snap-back response. Furthermore, the bifurcation problem is circumvented as the scaling process triggers the lowest non-symmetric equilibrium path. Secondly, the model is extended from an isotropic to an orthotropic format, taking into account the direction of cracking and the anisotropy of the induced damage. In this way, the model can compare with classical fixed smeared crack models. This improvement allows for studying reinforced concrete structures, in which compressive struts develop parallel to the crack direction...|$|R
30|$|The <b>slope</b> <b>diagram</b> for the {{nonlinear}} magnetic fluctuation {{does not}} exhibit a clear {{organization in the}} beta-tilde domain, {{at least in the}} data set we used. Agreement with the quasi-static balance is poor except for the low-beta values. Various reasons are possible to explain the different result from the expected curve from the quasi-static balance. For example, not waves but shocklets are being formed in the foreshock and the correlation sense remains positive irrespective of the value of beta, or the notion of the quasi-static balance needs to be extended to include kinetic or other effects such as temperature gradients or Landau damping. Magnetosonic-type low-frequency waves in the foreshock region are typically observed or recognized as 30 -s waves, 1 -Hz waves, shocklets, and SLAMS (short large-amplitude magnetic structures) (Greenstadt et al. 1995). It is considered that the initially transverse 30 -s waves with upstream propagation in the plasma frame become compressive under a refraction process. The compressive fluctuation results into steepening and low frequency steepened magnetosonic whistler modes can be formed (the so-called shocklets).|$|R
