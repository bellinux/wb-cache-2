40|$|A {{total of}} 90 {{dyestuff}} {{workers who were}} engaged {{in the production of}} aromatic amines during the post-war period after the 2 nd world war have been examined since 1967 by exfoliative cytologic examination. Those identified as class- 3 or over by this first screening test were then submitted to a second screening which consisted of periodic cystoscopic examination and 1 or 2 <b>intravenous</b> <b>pyelographies</b> per year. This system of mass screening has been used for the past 20 years, and we have discovered 23 cases of bladder tumor, a case of asynchronous bilateral ureteral tumor and a case of ureteral tumor. Out of the 13 cases, bladder tumors were discovered in 6 cases within 3 months after a positive exfoliative cytology result and in 5 cases within 1 year. The presence of a tumor was confirmed in 85 % of those patients within 1 year and in all of them in about 3 years. Periodic examinations have revealed all the tumors when they were about 5 mm in size and in stage 0 through A, demonstrating the usefulness of systematic examination. Treatment included intravesical instillation of anticancer agents, mostly mitomycin C, for 7 cases transurethral resection (TUR) for 8 cases and partial cystectomy was performed in one case. One patient with an asynchronous bilateral ureteral tumor was treated first by right total nephro-ureterectomy with cuff resection of bladder, and later by ureter excision and nephrostomy. This patient died of ileus in the 7 th year of treatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Dilation of {{urinary tract}} occurs without the {{presence}} of obstruction. Diagnostic methods that depend on renal function may elicit mistaken diagnosis. Whitaker (1973) proposed the evaluation of urinary tract pressure submitted to constant flow. Other investigators proposed perfusion of renal pelvis under controlled pressure, making the method more physiological and reproducible. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the results of the anterograde pressure measurement (APM) of the urinary tract of children with persistent hydronephrosis after surgery suspected to present persistent obstruction. Materials and Methods: Along 12 years, 26 renal units with persistent hydronephrosis after surgery (12 PUJ and 14 VUJ) were submitted to evaluation of the renal tract pressure in order to decide the form of treatment. Previous radionuclide scans with DTPA, <b>intravenous</b> <b>pyelographies</b> and ultrasounds were considered undetermined in relation to obstruction in 10 occasions and obstructive in 16. APM was performed under radioscopy through renal pelvis puncture or previous stoma. Saline with methylene blue + iodine contrast was infused under constant pressure of 40 cm H 2 O to fill the urinary system. The ureteral opening pressure was measured following the opening of the system and stabilization of the water column. Results: Among the 10 cases with undetermined previous diagnosis, APM was considered non-obstructive in two and those were treated clinically and eight were considered obstructive and were submitted to surgery. Among the 16 cases previously classified as obstructive, nine confirmed obstruction and were submitted to surgery. Seven cases were considered non-obstructive, and were treated clinically, with stable DMSA and hydronephrosis. Conclusions: APM avoided unnecessary surgery in one third of the cases and was important to treatment decision in 100 %.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the involvement of the upper urinary tract (UUT) in patients with multiple sclerosis and its relationship with other neurological and urological features of the disease. One hundred sixteen patients underwent complete neurological and urological assessments, urodynamic investigation, and morphofunctional study of the urinary tract by ultrasonography, voiding cistourethrography, and/or <b>intravenous</b> excretory <b>pyelography.</b> The most remarkable relationships were observed among disease duration, pyramidal system score, amplitude of uninhibited detrusor contractions and the presence of bladder morphological abnormalities (P = 0. 03, 0. 0008, and 0. 018, respectively) and the relationship between pyramidal system score or the presence of bladder pathology and UUT abnormalities (P = 0. 03 and 0. 0006, respectively).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} issues in Urology is the differential diagnosis of hematuria. Before proceeding to more complicated investigations, the urinary dipstick result should be confirmed with a microscopic examination of the urinary sediment. Hematuria of nephrologic origin is frequently associated with casts in the urine and almost always associated with significant proteinuria; it is secondary to either glomerular, tubulointerstitial, renovascular or systemic disorders. Common causes of hematuria of urologic origin, suggested by the absence of significant proteinuria, include urothelial tumors, renal parenchymal tumours, urinary stones, urinary tract infections, prostatic tumours and trauma of the urinary tract. The mainstays of evaluation are urinary cytology, cystoscopy, <b>intravenous</b> urography, retrograde <b>pyelography</b> and ureteroscopy, ultrasonography and CT. Conclusion: Hematuria of any degree should never be ignored and, in adults, should be regarded as a symptom of urologic malignancy until proved otherwise and demands immediate urologic examination...|$|R

He underwent a diagnostic evaluation (cystourethroscopy, proctoscopy, retrograde <b>pyelography,</b> <b>intravenous</b> urography, voiding cystourethrography) that revealed a fistula comprising the membranous urethra, the rectum, the perineum and the scrotum. He was treated with Metronidazole (20 mg/kg/day/ 12 mo). At 1 year no signs of intestinal disease and urinary sepsis were noted. The external orifice and the perineal fistulous network were closed, and the drainage from the rectum and the urethra had improved. No side effects limited use of the drug.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{morbidity}} and {{success rate of}} percutaneous treatment of the postoperative ureteric strictures in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1994 and December 2003, 12 children were treated by antegrade percutaneous balloon dilation for postoperative ureteric strictures. Stenosis occurred at the pelviureteric junction in 5 cases and ureterovesical junction in 7 cases. The 10 boys and 2 girls were between 3 months and 14 years old (mean, 5 years +/- 4. 7 years). General anesthesia was used in 10 cases for nephrostomy catheter placement. Five ureteral stents were used additionally for nephrostomy drainage with a 6 -F catheter. Both nephrostomy and ureteric stents were in place for 28. 5 +/- 12 days, then removed after control antegrade pyelography. RESULTS: Dilation was technically successful in 9 of our patients. Two peroperative complications occurred. Postoperative results were evaluated by ultrasonography, <b>intravenous</b> urography, antegrade <b>pyelography,</b> and {{diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid}} renography that confirmed no obstacle in all 5 cases of pelviureteric stricture with a follow-up of 4 +/- 2. 9 years and in 4 cases of ureterovesical junction with a follow-up of 4. 7 +/- 2. 8 years. Three unsuccessful results were reported: in 2 cases, the guide wire could not be advanced over the stenotic ureterovesical junction and in 1 case an early restenosis occurred that eventually required surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although the main treatment of the postoperative ureteral strictures is surgical, the percutaneous antegrade balloon dilation seems to be an alternative to surgery with a low morbidity rate and short hospitalization period...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present data}} from 18 cases of {{ureteral}} endometriosis. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Department of gynecology {{at a university}} hospital. PATIENT(S) : Four hundred and five patients with severe dysmenorrhea or deep dyspareunia due to a rectovaginal endometriotic (adenomyotic) nodule. INTERVENTION(S) : Patients were prospectively evaluated using <b>intravenous</b> <b>pyelography.</b> All patients underwent laparoscopic surgery to remove rectovaginal adenomyosis and ureterolysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Presurgical and postsurgical evaluation and histologic analysis. RESULT(S) : Preoperative <b>intravenous</b> <b>pyelography</b> revealed ureteral stenosis with ureterohydronephrosis in 18 patients (4. 4 %). A significantly higher prevalence (11. 2 %) was observed in nodules > or = 3 cm in diameter. Five women (20 %) had complete ureteral stenosis. Kidney scintigraphy revealed damaged kidney parenchymal function, which ranged from 18 % to 42 %. Laparoscopic ureterolysis was done in 16 women; 2 women underwent ureteral resection and uretero-ureterostomy. A significant postoperative decrease in ureterohydronephrosis was noted in all patients; however, renal function improved only slightly. CONCLUSION(S) : Ureteral endometriosis was found in 4. 4 % of patients with rectovaginal endometriotic (adenomyotic) nodules. Ureterolysis and removal of associated adenomyotic lesions was sufficient therapy in most patients; two required resection of the ureteral stenotic segment. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>pyelography</b> should be performed in all women with rectovaginal nodules > or = 3 cm to prevent nonreversible loss of renal function...|$|E
40|$|Drip {{infusion}} pyelography {{was performed}} with 100 ml of a 64. 9 per cent methylglucamine iodamide solution diluted {{with the same}} volume of a 5 per cent glucose solution in 96 cases in which visualization by routine <b>intravenous</b> <b>pyelography</b> was unsatisfactory or entirely absent, and its diagnostic contribution and safety were studied. By this technique better urograms were obtained than those by routine <b>intravenous</b> <b>pyelography.</b> Fine urograms could be obtained even in cases with ureteral obstruction, in post-operative cases of uretero-vesical anastomosis or in cases of children. This was quite helpful because retrograde pyelography was impossible {{in any of these}} cases. Diagnostic urograms were obtained in about 50 per cent of the cases with unilateral renal disease in which visualization was unsatisfactory or absent by routine <b>intravenous</b> <b>pyelography,</b> and in 43 per cent of the cases with renal impairment with BUN less than 40 mg/dl. In these cases, therefore, retrograde pyelography was omitted. Regarding safety, there were no severe side effects and the influence on pulse, blood pressure, BUN, serum electrolytes and renal function was slight. Particularly it was relatively safe in the cases with renal insufficiency. It can be concluded, accordingly, that drip infusion pyelography with 100 ml of a 64. 9 per cent iodamide solution is safe and it can be regarded as an excellent technique of urography...|$|E
