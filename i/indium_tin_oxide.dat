5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of <b>indium</b> <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. <b>Indium</b> <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> and indium phosphide harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E
25|$|Indium's uses can {{be divided}} into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the {{production}} is used for coatings, usually combined as <b>indium</b> <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications. Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. <b>Indium</b> <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), field emission displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, windshield glass and cathode ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.|$|E
30|$|Conventional {{flexible}} fiber-type dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (F-DSSCs) based on polymer/ITO (<b>indium</b> <b>tin</b> <b>oxides)</b> usually suffer from several problems such as cost inefficiency, stringent temperature restriction, and light-reception-angle limitation. Recent advances in fiber- and mesh-type DSSCs that can be woven {{into a variety of}} shapes and forms provide a potential solution to above problems [1 – 3]. TiO 2 electrodes can be fabricated by depositing a layer of disordered TiO 2 particles on flexible substrates or fibers. However, this method can lead to twisted carrier-transfer channels that thereafter lower the efficiencies. This disadvantage can be presumably overcome by employing a fiber-like anode with a hierarchical crystalline TiO 2 nanostructure, which may reduce the grain boundaries and defects, and thus leads to more efficient carrier-transfer channels.|$|R
40|$|Microstructures {{of nickel}} {{surfaces}} electrodeposited on <b>indium</b> <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> coated glasses are investigated using atomic force microscopy. The fractal dimension D and Hurst exponent H of the nickel surface images are determined from a frequency analysis method proposed by Aguilar et al. [J. Microsc. 172 (1993) 233] and from Hurst rescaled range analysis. The two methods {{are found to}} give the same value of the fractal dimension D similar to 2. 0. The roughness exponent a and growth exponent beta that characterize scaling behaviors of the surface growth in electrodeposition are calculated using the height-difference correlation function and interface width in Fourier space.

500|$|In 1924, indium {{was found}} to have a valued {{property}} of stabilizing non-ferrous metals, and that became the first significant use for the element. The first large-scale application for indium was coating bearings in high-performance aircraft engines during World War II, to protect against damage and corrosion; this is no longer a major use of the element. [...] New uses were found in fusible alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, tiny beads of indium were used for the emitters and collectors of PNP alloy-junction transistors. In the middle and late 1980s, the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and <b>indium</b> <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> thin films for liquid-crystal displays (LCD) aroused much interest.

40|$|Light {{trapping}} {{plays an}} important role to achieve high short circuit current density (Jsc) and high efficiency for amorphous/crystalline Si heterojunction solar cells. Si heterojunction uses hydrogenated amorphous Si for emitter and back contact. This structure of solar cell posses highest open circuit voltage of 0. 747 V at one sun for c-Si based solar cells. It also suggests that over 25 % record-high efficiency is possible with further improvement of Jsc. Light trapping has two important tasks. The first one is to reduce the surface reflectance of light to zero for the solar spectrum that Si has a response. The second one is to increase the effective absorption length to capture all the photon.

The antireflective results were explained by the coherence theory. And the antireflective effects were induced by the ITO and ZnO films. The calculated thicknesses of the ZnO films agreed well with the experimental results. The theoretical calculated band gap from the average diameter of ZnO nanoparticles was also well consistent with the experimental ones obtained from the optical transmission spectra. This result was promising for applications in organic solar cells. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{incorporation}} of oxygen atoms in oxide films grown by pulsed laser deposition {{depends upon the}} oxygen pressure and laser power density. By carefully controlling these two parameters {{it is possible to}} control the oxygen deficiency in the samples, and thus to change their physical properties from insulating and transparent to absorbing and conducting. By using X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and resistivity measurements, we show that depending upon the oxide materials oxygen deficiency in the films can induce either the growth of stable sub-oxide phases or the formation of nanocomposite films by phase separation. The first case corresponds to oxides with a mixed valency cation like Ti, which leads to the formation of stable, crystalline and highly conductive TiOx sub-oxide phases. The second case is well described by the <b>indium</b> <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> (ITO) in which a large oxygen deficiency leads to metallic clusters embedded into a stoichiometric matrix, i. e. nanocomposite films.

In this work, an ultrasonic spray-coating method was employed to deposit TiO 2 nanoparticles on polymer substrates for the fabrication of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Pre-synthesized TiO 2 nanoparticles were first dispersed in ethanol to prepare the precursor solutions with different concentrations (0. 5 mg/mL, 1. 0 mg/mL, 2. 0 mg/mL) and then sprayed onto the conductive substrates to produce compact TiO 2 films with different thicknesses (from 30 nm to 150 nm).
