40|$|This review aims {{to assess}} the {{efficacy}} and safety of voluntary fortification as an option to address the occurrence of inadequate micronutrient intakes in population subgroups in Europe. Although legislation is harmonised across the European Union, fortification practices and patterns of consumption of <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> vary considerably between countries. While the proportion of children consuming <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> is greater than adults, the proportion of dietary energy obtained from <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> is generally low (< 10 % in Ireland, where <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> are widely consumed). There are a few systematic studies on the overall nutritional impact of voluntary fortification, but there are several studies {{on the impact of}} fortified ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. The available evidence indicates that voluntary fortification can reduce the risk of sub-optimal intakes of a range of micronutrients at a population level and can also improve status for selected micronutrients (e. g. folate, vitamin D and riboflavin) in children and adults. Although concerns have been raised regarding the potential of food fortification to lead to unacceptably high micronutrient intakes, particularly for those consuming higher amounts of <b>fortified</b> <b>foods,</b> data from national surveys on total micronutrient intakes (including <b>fortified</b> <b>foods)</b> in Europe show that small proportions of the population, particularly children, may exceed the upper intake level (UL) for some micronutrients. The risk of adverse effects occurring in these individuals exceeding the UL by modest amounts is low. In conclusion, voluntary fortification practices have been shown to improve intake and status of key micronutrients in European Union population groups and do not contribute appreciably to risk of adverse effects...|$|R

The supply of <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> increased between 1997 – 9 and 2008 – 10, resulting in a higher proportion of adults consuming <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> (from 67 to 82 %) and a greater contribution to mean daily energy intake (from 4 · 6 to 8 · 4 %).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to quantify the contribution of fortification (defined here as adding nutrients beyond traditional enrichment standards) to dietary nutrient intakes in the United States. A list of <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> was developed that was relevant {{at the time of}} the analyses, and prefortification (naturally occurring) nutrients in the <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> were determined from industry-supplied data. Using dietary data from the 1989 – 1991 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII), intakes of nine nutrients were determined both as reported in the CSFII (i. e., postfortification) and also by using prefortification nutrient levels for the identified <b>fortified</b> <b>foods.</b> We report data for the total population age $ 1 y based on respondents (n 5 11, 710) with 3 d of dietary data, as well as select age/gender subgroups. All data were weighted. Fortification substantially increased the intakes of all nutrients examined except calcium, in all age/gender groups but especially in children. In numerous cases, fortification was responsible for boosting median or 25 th percentile intakes from below to above the RDA. The breakfast cereal category was responsible for nearly all the intake of nutrients from <b>fortified</b> <b>foods,</b> except vitamin C for which juice-type beverages made as great or a greater contribution. These data from 1989 to 1991 serve as a useful baseline with which to compare contributions of fortification as the practice expands. The large contri-bution of fortification even in 1989 – 1991 suggests that continued monitoring of fortification practices, using methods such as those presented here, is important. J.

40|$|Background: Recent European Union {{regulation}} requires {{setting of}} {{maximum amount of}} micronutrients in dietary supplements or foods {{taking into account the}} tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) established by scientific risk assessment and population reference intakes. Objective: To collect and evaluate recently available data on intakes of selected vitamins and minerals from conventional foods, <b>food</b> supplements and <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> in adults and children. Intake of calcium, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, zinc, folic acid, niacin and total vitamin A/retinol, B 6, D and E was derived from nationally representative surveys in Denmark, Germany, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. Intake of high consumers, defined as the 95 th percentile of each nutrient, was compared to the UL. Results: For most nutrients, adults and children generally consume considerably less than the UL with exceptions being retinol, zinc, iodine, copper and magnesium. The major contributor to intakes for all nutrients and in all countries is from foods in the base diet. The patterns of food supplements and voluntary fortification vary widely among countries with food supplements being responsible for the largest differences in total intakes. In the present study, for those countries with data on <b>fortified</b> <b>foods,</b> <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> do not significantly contribute to higher intakes for any nutrient. Total nutrient intake expressed as percentage of the UL is generally higher in children than in adults. Conclusion: The risk of excessive intakes is relatively low for the majority of nutrients with a few exceptions. Children are the most vulnerable group as {{they are more likely to}} exhibit high intakes relative to the UL. There is a need to develop improved methods for estimating intakes of micronutrients from <b>fortified</b> <b>foods</b> and food supplements in future dietary surveys...|$|R
