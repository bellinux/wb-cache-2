5|$|Evidence {{does not}} support the use of {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), antipsychotics, or <b>gabapentin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs <b>gabapentin</b> and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and <b>gabapentin</b> have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gabapentin</b> can relieve {{most of the}} {{discomfort}} of benzodiazepine withdrawal; including anxiety, insomnia, irritability, tremor and muscle spasms. However, <b>gabapentin</b> may give rise to its own withdrawal syndrome upon discontinuation if taken continuously for long periods.|$|E
25|$|Neurontin (<b>gabapentin)</b> for neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|The anti-convulsant drugs <b>gabapentin</b> and {{pregabalin}} {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} pain. <b>Gabapentin</b> may be of significant benefit for pain relief in about 35% of people with fibromyalgia. It is not possible to predict who will benefit, and a short trial may be recommended to test the effectiveness of this type of medication. Approximately 6/10 people who take <b>gabapentin</b> to treat pain related to fibromyalgia experience unpleasant side effects such as dizziness, abnormal walking, or swelling from fluid accumulation. Pregabalin demonstrates a substantial benefit in about 9% of people. Pregabalin reduced time off work by 0.2 days per week.|$|E
25|$|Pregabalin is 6 {{times more}} potent than <b>gabapentin</b> in binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{spasmolytic}} agents include: methocarbamol, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, <b>gabapentin,</b> metaxalone, and orphenadrine.|$|E
25|$|Pregabalin is 2 to 4 {{times more}} potent as an {{analgesic}} than <b>gabapentin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seizures often {{accompany}} this disease. Most seizure medications exacerbate this condition. Treatment can be problematic: barbiturates especially must be avoided. Some benzodiazepines {{are safe}} and, {{when used in}} conjunction with newer anti-seizure medications such as <b>gabapentin,</b> offer a possible regimen for seizure control. <b>Gabapentin</b> has the additional feature of aiding in the treatment of some kinds of neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|Neither <b>gabapentin</b> nor {{pregabalin}} {{have been}} found to be useful for pain following a knee replacement.|$|E
25|$|Other topical agents such as amitriptyline, <b>gabapentin,</b> Citrullus colocynthis extract, nifedipine, and {{pentoxifylline}} {{are also}} under investigation.|$|E
25|$|When {{studied in}} non-humans {{pregabalin}} {{appears to be}} 3 to 10 times more potent as an anticonvulsant than <b>gabapentin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Certain {{anticonvulsant}} {{drugs such}} as <b>gabapentin</b> are effective in social anxiety disorder and may be a possible treatment alternative to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{has been}} shown {{clinically}} to reduce the clearance of mirtazapine, imipramine, timolol, nebivolol, sparteine, loratadine, nortriptyline, <b>gabapentin,</b> and desipramine in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gabapentin</b> or {{clonidine}} {{may help}} {{but does not}} {{work as well as}} hormone therapy. Clonidine may be associated with constipation and sleeping problems.|$|E
25|$|Gabapentinoids, such as <b>gabapentin</b> and pregabalin, are {{selective}} blockers of α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels. They {{are used}} primarily to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|Pain {{treatment}} with long-acting opioids, such as morphine, is often indicated, and, {{in cases where}} seizure or neuropathy is present, <b>Gabapentin</b> is known to improve outcome.|$|E
25|$|Favored {{treatments}} are certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressant and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), anticonvulsants (pregabalin and <b>gabapentin),</b> and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics {{are recognized as}} useful agents but are not recommended as first line treatments.|$|E
25|$|Access to Wyeth {{internal}} documents {{has revealed}} marketing strategies {{used to promote}} Neurontin for off-label use. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <b>gabapentin</b> (Neurontin, Pfizer) only for treatment of seizures. Warner–Lambert, which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used activities not usually associated with sales promotion, including continuing medical education and research, sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote <b>gabapentin.</b> Within 5 years the drug was being widely used for the off-label treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner–Lambert admitted to charges that it violated FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses, and paid $430million to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges. A recent Cochrane review concluded that <b>gabapentin</b> is ineffective in migraine prophylaxis. The American Academy of Neurology rates it as having unproven efficacy, while the Canadian Headache Society and the European Federation of Neurological Societies rate its use as being supported by moderate and low-quality evidence, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Pregabalin {{is useful}} when added to other {{treatments}}, when those other treatments are not controlling partial epilepsy. Its use alone is less effective {{than some other}} seizure medications. It is unclear how it compares to <b>gabapentin</b> for this use.|$|E
25|$|Very limited {{evidence}} indicates that topiramate or pregabalin {{may be useful in}} the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Limited evidence supports the use of <b>gabapentin</b> or carbamazepine for the treatment of mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal as the sole treatment or as combination therapy with other medications; however, <b>gabapentin</b> {{does not appear to be}} effective for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal and is therefore not recommended for use in this setting. A 2010 Cochrane review similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not supported. Paraldehyde combined with chloral hydrate showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to life-threatening side effects and carbamazepine may have advantages for certain symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 40 {{percent of}} menopausal women {{experience}} sleep disruption, {{often in the}} form of difficulty with sleep initiation and frequent nighttime awakenings. There is a study, first to show sustained benefits in sleep quality from <b>gabapentin,</b> which Rochester researchers already have demonstrated alleviates hot flashes.|$|E
25|$|Adjuvant analgesics, {{also called}} {{atypical}} analgesics, include nefopam, orphenadrine, pregabalin, <b>gabapentin,</b> cyclobenzaprine, hyoscine (scopolamine), {{and other drugs}} possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, {{as well as many}} other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.|$|E
25|$|Anti-convulsants reduce {{neuronal}} hyperexcitability, effectively targeting Dejerine–Roussy syndrome. <b>Gabapentin</b> and pregabalin are {{the most}} common anti-convulsants. They have significant efficacy in treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain. Treatments last 4–12 hours and in general are well tolerated, and the occurrence of adverse events does not differ significantly across patients. Commonly reported side-effects are dizziness, decreased intellectual performance, somnolence, and nausea.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{accepted}} treatments include: physiotherapy, steroids either orally or injected locally, splinting, {{and surgical}} {{release of the}} transverse carpal ligament. Limited evidence suggests that <b>gabapentin</b> is no more effective than placebo for CTS treatment. There is insufficient evidence for therapeutic ultrasound, yoga, acupuncture, low level laser therapy, vitamin B6, and exercise. Change in activity may include avoiding activities that worsen symptoms.|$|E
25|$|One {{clinical}} study has demonstrated {{the efficacy of}} IV lidocaine or oral mexilitine, though {{it should be noted}} that differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied. Another trial has shown promise for misoprostol, while other have shown that <b>gabapentin,</b> venlafaxine and oral magnesium may also be effective, but no further testing was carried out as newer research superseded this combination.|$|E
25|$|Painful dysesthesias {{caused by}} {{alcoholic}} polyneuropathy {{can be treated}} by using <b>gabapentin</b> or amitriptyline in combination with over-the-counter pain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or carbamazepine may help stabbing pains and have central and peripheral anticholinergic and sedative effects. These agents have central effects on pain transmission and block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Primidone is not {{the only}} {{anticonvulsant}} used for essential tremor; the others include topiramate (Topamax) and <b>gabapentin</b> (Neurontin). Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), atenolol, sotalol, nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botilinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|Being {{physically}} active can decrease {{the risk of}} developing CTS. Symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. Taking NSAIDs or <b>gabapentin</b> {{does not appear to be}} useful. Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non surgical options. Further splinting after surgery is not needed. Evidence does not support magnet therapy.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{myoclonus}} {{can occur}} in healthy individuals and is most commonly caused by nothing other than arbitrary muscle contractions. Myoclonus may develop in response to infection, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, stress, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, as {{a side effect of}} certain drugs (such as tramadol, quinolones, benzodiazepine, <b>gabapentin,</b> sertraline, lamotrigine), or other disorders.|$|E
25|$|The European Federation of Neurological Societies {{recommends}} pregabalin as a {{first line}} agent {{for the treatment of}} pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain. A minority obtain substantial benefit, and a larger number obtain moderate benefit. Other first line agents, including <b>gabapentin</b> and tricyclic antidepressants, are given equal weight as first line agents, and unlike pregabalin, are available as less expensive generics.|$|E
25|$|Pregabalin is not {{recommended}} for certain other types of neuropathic pain such as trigeminal neuralgia and its use in cancer-associated neuropathic pain is controversial. There is no evidence for its use {{in the prevention of}} migraines and <b>gabapentin</b> has been found not to be useful. It has been examined for the prevention of post-surgical chronic pain, but its utility for this purpose is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Parke-Davis {{developed}} pregabalin as {{a successor}} to <b>gabapentin</b> and was brought to market by Pfizer after the company acquired Warner-Lambert. There is to be no generic version available in the United States until 2018. A generic version is available in Canada and the United Kingdom. In the US it costs about 300-400 USD per month. Pregabalin is a Schedule V controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA).|$|E
25|$|Given the benign {{nature of}} the {{condition}} and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child {{and his or her}} family, antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is the most frequently used first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, <b>gabapentin,</b> levetiracetam and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can almost certainly be discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.|$|E
25|$|Medicines are {{commonly}} prescribed {{for the treatment}} of sciatica, but evidence for pain medication is poor. Specifically, low-quality evidence indicates that NSAIDs do not appear to improve immediate pain and all NSAIDs appear about equivalent. Evidence is also lacking in use of opioids and muscle relaxants by usual means. In those with sciatica due to piriformis syndrome, botulinum toxin injections may improve pain and or function. There is little evidence for steroids, either epidural or by pill. Low-quality evidence supports the use of <b>gabapentin</b> for acute pain relief in those with chronic sciatica.|$|E
