5|$|The P-7 variant's {{history is}} unclear. The P-8 {{was said to}} have been similar to the H-5 fitted with <b>dual</b> <b>controls.</b> The P-9 was {{produced}} as an export variant for the Hungarian Air Force. Due to the lack of DB 601E engines, the series was terminated in summer 1940.|$|E

40|$|Autonomous agents {{engaged in}} a {{continuous}} interaction with an incompletely known environment face the problem of <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> [Fel'dbaum 1965]. Simply stated, actions are necessary not only for studying the environment, but also for making progress on the task. In other words, actions must bear a "dual" character: They must be investigators to some degree, but also directors to some degree. Because the number of variables involved in {{the solution of the}} <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> problem increases with the number of decision stages, the exact solution of the <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> problem is computationally intractable except for a few special cases. This paper provides an overview of <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> theory and proposes a heuristic approach towards obtaining a near-optimal <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> method that can be implemented. The proposed algorithm selects control actions taking into account the information contained in past observations as well as the possible information that future observations may reveal. In short, t [...] ...|$|R

The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with <b>dual</b> <b>controls.</b> The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically {{from the back}} seat, but otherwise the student manages the controls until the student is deemed to have the skill and the airmanship necessary to fly solo.

40|$|A {{vibration}} retest of {{a spacecraft}} flight instrument, the Mars Observer Camera (MOC), was conducted using extremal <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> to automatically limit the shaker force and notch the shaker acceleration at resonances. This {{was the first}} application of extremal <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> with flight hardware at JPL. The retest was successful in that the environment was representative of flight plus some margin, the instrument survived without any structural or performance degradation, and the force limiting worked very well. The test set-up, force limiting procedure, and test results are described herein. It is concluded that <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> should be utilized {{when there is a}} concern about overtesting in hard-base-drive tests and the instrumentation for force measurement and control is available. Recommendations for improving the implementation of <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> are provided {{as a result of this}} first experience...|$|R
