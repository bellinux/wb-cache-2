50|$|A device {{can be used}} {{to prevent}} this problem. It works by {{sounding}} an audible alert (voice) when the <b>door</b> <b>operator,</b> whether trained or not, is about to open the door in the armed position. It works as an independent system, requiring no action other than arming the door as per normal standard operating procedures. When the door is placed in the armed position, the device is armed. It can be installed as a stand-alone unit or integrated into the aircraft systems and powered from aircraft power.|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{construction}} buildings {{contain more}} advanced technologies than before. The development of newer and stricter regulations {{to the construction}} industry makes the door environment more and more complex. In large construction projects the door environment is held up as a major challenge to get to in a good way. It turned out after a discussion with one project manager and a site manager at NCC, that the door environment is difficult to get right in major construction projects and it often causes many error reports in to the aftermarket after that the final inspection is completed. Interviews have been done with key figures in the building process at NCC and Akademiska hus. A study on a university building for around 3500 students and with 300 workplaces was made. There {{were a lot of}} data with fault reports to the go trough to find fault report from doors and be analyzed and statistic. The results from the data collection showed that many fault messages on the doors in was caused by the <b>door</b> <b>operator.</b> And from the interviews the content was clear that the coordination has to be good to have a functioning and a good door environment. One part that can contribute to a better door environment is to plan space for possible <b>door</b> <b>operator</b> over the door. Another part is that the construction documents which production workers are working with, is {{to find a way to}} always have the latest documents in hand...|$|E

40|$|Wine {{tourism is}} {{experiencing}} significant development in both {{new and old}} European wine regions. In {{the case of the}} Canary Islands, wine has been produced and traded for centuries but {{little is known about the}} current state or potential for wine tourism on the islands, despite the fact that millions of tourists, including many potential wine tourists, visit the islands each year. In this exploratory study, the perspectives of winery owners and managers on wine tourism are examined via in-depth face-to-face interviews among 23 small winery operators to reveal that the scope for exploiting wine tourism on the islands has been recognized and that some wineries are either already involved in wine tourism, includ-ing as part of a wine trail, or plan to be more involved in the future. It was also discovered, that there were a number of issues that challenge the development of their wine and wine tourism industry, includ-ing competition from non-Canary Island wines and anti-drink-drive laws that are inhibit passers by to consume wine at the cellar <b>door.</b> <b>Operators</b> stressed the need to find a balance between mass tourism and the niche produce of wine. Moreover, the findings identify avenues for future research on wine tourism development in the Canary Islands...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} establishment of new wineries, cellar doors are now marketing in an energetic manner to attract wine tourists; as a result, cellar door managers are increasingly concerned with factors {{leading to the}} differentiation of their cellar doors and visitors’ post-visit behaviours. However, {{despite the fact that}} the cellar door experience is logically of great importance from both the wine tourism and wine marketing perspectives, little is known about the detailed relationships between the different aspects of a visitor’s cellar door experience and how these aspects interact to affect a visitor’s post-visit behavioural intentions. This study features an exploration of the effects of winery cellar door inputs on visitors’ monetary and experiential value perceptions, overall satisfaction and behavioural intentions. The results of this study provide preliminary evidence that a memorable cellar door experience encompasses not only the selection of the core wine product but also other components, including the appreciation of the cellar door environment and the face-to-face interaction with the front-line employees that facilitate the visit. Further, the application of Partial Least Squares path modelling indicates that cellar door visitors are oriented towards the experiential aspects of the visit itself as much as pragmatic considerations in purchasing wine. The insights are, therefore, directed towards the creation of a total cellar door experience. The research shows that cellar <b>door</b> <b>operators</b> cannot solely rely on good-quality wine to maintain their business. Their marketing differentiation strategy needs to shift from a goods-based offering to including the creation of hedonic and utilitarian experiential value on a consistent basis, to maintain visitor satisfaction and enhance customer loyalty.

50|$|The {{de-icing}} bogies carried ice-cutters, {{which were}} held {{against the current}} rail by a compressed air cylinder. Each had a rotating head with ridged steel rollers, {{to break up the}} ice. Sleet brushes with metal prongs were mounted either side of the cutter, so that the rail was swept before and after cutting, whichever way the locomotive was moving. Anti-freeze was applied to the rail by spray nozzles, supplied from a tank mounted in the central section, and accessible through a sliding <b>door.</b> Two <b>operators</b> were required, one to drive and the other to operate valves, so that when the current rail changed sides, the application of anti-freeze followed. In 1955, the process was upgraded, and the detection of the current rail was made automatic. When there was no rail, the sprays shut down, as they also did when the locomotive stopped.|$|R
50|$|In response, the FAA, {{in charge}} of {{actually}} implementing these recommendations, agreed with McDonnell Douglas that the additional venting {{would be difficult to}} install. Instead, they proceeded with the modification of the locking system, and additionally added a small clear window set {{into the bottom of the}} cargo <b>door</b> that allowed <b>operators</b> to directly inspect whether or not the latches were in place. Combined with the upgrades to the wiring that had already been on the books, this should prevent a repeat of the accident.|$|R
50|$|The Blue Line's Type I LRVs are {{numbered}} sequentially from 101 through 127. The Flexity Swift vehicle is an articulated design with three car-body sections, {{referred to as}} the A, B and C sections. The markings on the ends of LRVs indicate the vehicle number and section. For example, car 114 is marked 114A on one end and 114B on the other end. Vehicle numbers are also displayed (excluding the section letter) {{on the sides of the}} C section, on the <b>doors</b> of the <b>operator</b> cabs and on the roof of the vehicle. Both ends of the vehicle have operator cabs, allowing trains of any length to be operated normally in either direction without the need to turn the train around. The pantograph is located on the B section of the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|While the {{definition}} of a fractional integral may be codified by Riemann and Liouville, an agreed-upon fractional derivative has eluded discovery for many years. This is likely a result of integral definitions including numerous constants of integration in their results. An elimination of constants of integration opens the <b>door</b> to an <b>operator</b> that reconciles all known fractional derivatives and shows surprising results in areas unobserved before, including the appearance of the Riemann Zeta Function and fractional Laplace and Fourier Transforms. A new class of functions, known as Zero Functions and closely related to the Dirac Delta Function, are necessary for one to perform elementary operations of functions without using constants. The operator also allows for a generalization of the Volterra integral equation, and provides a method of solving for Riemann's "complimentary" function introduced during his research on fractional derivatives...|$|R
5000|$|The {{trains are}} {{also able to}} be {{operated}} exclusively by computers, {{becoming one of the}} earliest installations of Standard Elektrik Lorenz's [...] "SelTrac IS" [...] system (now owned and delivered by Thales Rail Signalling Solutions), doing away with the need for a human operator. However, due to opposition from the transit workers' union and public perception, operators were retained; the union has firmly opposed driverless trains. (Other systems took full advantage of the automated operation and Vancouver's SkyTrain has been automated since 1985 with no mishaps.) The Scarborough line trains have only one operator, unlike most of the other TTC subway lines, which carry both a guard at the rear, who operates the train's <b>doors,</b> and an <b>operator,</b> who drives the train from the front. (The Sheppard line, however, has used a single operator only since October 2016.) In practice, the Scarborough line trains drive themselves; the operator monitors their operations and controls the doors. One feature, which was not implemented at the time of Scarborough line's opening, is the automated next stop announcement system, which was introduced in January 2008 (which means operators are no longer required to call out stops manually) and uses the voice-over of Susan Bigioni, a TTC employee, identical to those used on the T1-series and older trains.|$|R
40|$|A {{platform}} {{has been}} developed for two or more vehicles {{with one or more}} residing within the other (a marsupial pair). This configuration consists of a large, versatile robot that is carrying a smaller, more specialized autonomous operating robot(s) and/or mobile repeaters for extended transmission. The larger vehicle, which is equipped with a ramp and/or a robotic arm, is used to operate over a more challenging topography than the smaller one(s) that may have a more limited inspection area to traverse. The intended use of this concept is to facilitate the insertion of a small video camera and sensor platform into a difficult entry area. In a terrestrial application, this may be a bus or a subway car with narrow aisles or steep stairs. The first field-tested configuration is a tracked vehicle bearing a rigid ramp of fixed length and width. A smaller six-wheeled vehicle approximately 10 in. (25 cm) wide by 12 in. (30 cm) long resides {{at the end of the}} ramp within the larger vehicle. The ramp extends from the larger vehicle and is tipped up into the air. Using video feedback from a camera atop the larger robot, the operator at a remote location can steer the larger vehicle to the bus door. Once positioned at the <b>door,</b> the <b>operator</b> can switch video feedback to a camera at the end of the ramp to facilitate the mating of the end of the ramp to the top landing at the upper terminus of the steps. The ramp can be lowered by remote control until its end is in contact with the top landing. At the same time, the end of the ramp bearing the smaller vehicle is raised to minimize the angle of the slope the smaller vehicle has to climb, and further gives the operator a better view of the entry to the bus from the smaller vehicle. Control is passed over to the smaller vehicle and, using video feedback from the camera, it is driven up the ramp, turned oblique into the bus, and then sent down the aisle for surveillance. The demonstrated vehicle was used to scale the steps leading to the interior of a bus whose landing is 44 in. (. 1. 1 m) from the road surface. This vehicle can position the end of its ramp to a surface over 50 in. (. 1. 3 m) above ground level and can drive over rail heights exceeding 6 in. (. 15 cm). Thus configured, this vehicle can conceivably deliver the smaller robot to the end platform of New York City subway cars from between the rails. This innovation is scalable to other formulations for size, mobility, and surveillance functions. Conceivably the larger vehicle can be configured to traverse unstable rubble and debris to transport a smaller search and rescue vehicle as close as possible to the scene of a disaster such as a collapsed building. The smaller vehicle, tethered or otherwise, and capable of penetrating and traversing within the confined spaces in the collapsed structure, can transport imaging and other sensors to look for victims or other targets...|$|R
