5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include graphite, {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. Graphite <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of stolen diamonds presents {{a set of}} difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a beach or river - alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than {{those that have been}} mined.

The bird's black wingtips are visible while {{it is in the}} air and once it gathers speed, its flight <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> graceful and it often ascends to great heights.

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E

5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table. The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in aqueous solution. Before nobelium's discovery, {{it was predicted that}} it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> stable than the +3 state in aqueous solution {{and it is difficult to}} keep nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E
