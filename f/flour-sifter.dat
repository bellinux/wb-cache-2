2500|$|The {{earliest}} hand-operated cranks {{appeared in}} China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD), as Han era glazed-earthenware tomb models portray, {{and was used}} thereafter in China for silk-reeling and hemp-spinning, for the agricultural winnowing fan, in the water-powered <b>flour-sifter,</b> for hydraulic-powered metallurgic bellows, and in the well windlass. [...] However, {{the potential of the}} crank of converting circular motion into reciprocal one never seems to have been fully realized in China, and the crank was typically absent from such machines until the turn of the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|Edwin L. Wayman {{acquired}} {{ownership of}} patents on tools {{for use in}} enameling unpatented bathtubs, toilets, sinks, and similar unpatented products. Three patents covered automatic [...] "dredging" [...] tools. The automatic dredger is a device somewhat like a kitchen <b>flour-sifter</b> that sprinkles enameling power (ground glass) on red-hot (1200 °F to 1500 °F) iron fixtures. It is more efficient than dredging by hand, in that it uses less powder, spreads the powder more evenly, is faster, and requires less labor. [...] "While it is conceded that merchantable ware can be made without its use, still the advantages of using it are so great that as a commercial proposition the ware cannot be made without it." ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{severely}} retarded {{young adults}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 21 years participated in a prevocational training program, and worked regularly on six different tasks during the scheduled six-hour day. The study attempted to assess each subject's preferences for the six tasks: collating, stuffing, sorting, pulley assembly, <b>flour-sifter</b> assembly, and circuit-board stuffing. In Phase I, the procedure consisted of randomly pairing each task with all other tasks in a two-choice situation that required the subjects to select one task from each pair combination to work for a seven-minute period. The selection procedure consisted of presenting two representative task objects on a tray and requesting the subject to pick up one object and place it on the work table. The object selected represented the task worked for that period. The 15 possible pair combinations were presented randomly every two days for a period of 34 days to determine the preferences. During the validation phase (Phase II), each subject's least- and most-preferred tasks were paired separately with moderately-preferred tasks. As expected, these manipulations confirmed the baseline data, as choices for the moderately-preferred tasks decreased when consistently paired with the preferred tasks and increased when consistently paired with the least-preferred tasks...|$|E
