5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): Finnish {{tactical}} number Ps163–33, in <b>drivable</b> condition.|$|E
5|$|Some {{portions}} of I-70 over the Pavant Range and Wasatch Plateau were opened to traffic before the portion over the San Rafael Swell. These portions were temporarily signed as State Route4. The portion over the San Rafael Swell opened to traffic in 1970, finally making the Utah portion of I-70 a <b>drivable</b> route.|$|E
5|$|T-26 mod. 1939 in the Kubinka Tank Museum, Moscow Oblast (Russia): this {{tank with}} pressed turret front {{armoured}} plate is in <b>drivable</b> condition (the GAZ-41 engine from the BRDM-2 {{was installed in}} 2005). The tank has combat damage taken during the Great Patriotic War (many marks from armour-piercing bullets and a welded hole {{on the right side}} of the turret from a 50mm shell).|$|E
5|$|The game {{introduces}} the Batmobile as a <b>drivable</b> vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be {{summoned to the}} player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, summoned to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.|$|E
5|$|Up Your Arsenal is {{the first}} in the series to offer online {{multiplayer}} as well as single-player. The service was terminated in June 2012, however the PlayStation 3 HD version features the online mode. Multiplayer features three different modes of play available on all of the maps and has a selection of the weapons from the single-player game. As well as the multiplayer mode, it has many other differences compared to its predecessors such as higher quality graphics, larger worlds, and <b>drivable</b> vehicles. The voice cast from the previous game return as their respective characters, and new actors were hired to voice the new characters.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{designs for}} the {{standard}} Batmobile include ones based on the 1960s TV series; a prototype version; 1970s Batman-themed; Robin-themed; Riddler-themed; and Rocksteady-themed. All-new, <b>drivable</b> Batmobiles include: the 1989 film, Tumbler, 1960s TV series, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and the original Arkham Asylum Batmobiles. These Batmobiles do not feature a tank mode and can only {{be used in the}} main game after all tanks have been eliminated or on specific Batmobile challenge maps. In terms of design, the 1989 film and 1960 TV series ones are longer and narrower with better handling than the standard Arkham Knight Batmobile. Racetracks for the Batmobile include two based on Batman and Batman Returns; two based on The Dark Knight; two based on the 1960s TV series; and two WayneTech tracks.|$|E
25|$|Distances listed {{are based}} on {{entering}} Illinois via the Veterans Memorial Bridge and following an alignment through Plainfield, using the last known non-freeway route where <b>drivable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, {{an extra}} level {{is based on}} the 1966 Batman TV series, along with {{characters}} including: 1966 Batman, 1966 Robin; 1966 Batgirl, 1966 Joker, 1966 Catwoman, 1966 Riddler, and 1966 Penguin. Also, Adam West is a playable character. The 1966 Batmobile is also included as a <b>drivable</b> vehicle. The end credits sequence remakes the Batclimb window cameos.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 in the United States and Canada, and 1975 in {{the rest}} of the world, the 1500 engine was used to make the Spitfire 1500. Although in this final {{incarnation}} the engine was rather rougher and more prone to failure than the earlier units, torque was greatly increased by increasing the cylinder stroke to , which made it much more <b>drivable</b> in traffic.|$|E
25|$|The zoo is {{bisected}} by {{a public}} bridleway, Flag Lane. For many years, a single bridge (now called Elephants' Bridge), <b>drivable</b> by zoo vehicles and powered wheelchairs, near the elephant exhibit was the only crossing place within the grounds. A second crossing, passable by pedestrians and mobility scooters, called Bats' Bridge, opened in April 2008 near the Twilight Zone, has improved the ability of visitors to circulate.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a <b>drivable,</b> {{detailed}} virtual recreation of the 1967 Ferrari 312 {{appeared as}} one of the leading cars in Grand Prix Legends (GPL), a PC-based simulation of the 1967 F1 championship. The 1966 version was part of a free 66 Mod for GPL, which was introduced in 2007. It included further refined driving physics. In 2017, the 1967 version {{will be part of the}} Ferrari 70th Anniversary Celebration Pack for Assetto Corsa.|$|E
25|$|There is a well-kept <b>drivable</b> {{inspection}} road {{maintained by}} Irrigation and Flood Control Department of Delhi {{on one of}} the drains embankment throughout its entire length of several kilometres running through rural Delhi from Dhansa regulators at the southwest border of Delhi with the state of Haryana to where the drain crosses under the outer ring road at Keshopur bus depot near the Najafgarh road between the housing colonies of Vikaspuri and Tilak Nagar in New Delhi.|$|E
25|$|The game {{features}} melee attacks, and {{the motion}} sensing {{feature of the}} SIXAXIS controller is used {{for a number of}} things including shaking off enemies that grab onto the player, shaking off tags and flames in multiplayer, and quickly bringing up a map or leaderboard in a multiplayer match. The player also has access to turrets and a <b>drivable</b> jeep with a gun turret on certain levels. The game was also on Sony's list of titles to receive an online update to support the vibration feature of the DualShock 3 controller for Japan, North America, and Europe.|$|E
25|$|A {{tow truck}} is a vehicle used to {{transport}} motor vehicles to another location, generally a repair garage, or to recover vehicles which {{are no longer}} on a <b>drivable</b> surface. Vehicles are often towed {{in the case of}} breakdowns or collisions, or may be impounded for legal reasons. The tow truck was invented in 1916 by Ernest Holmes, Sr., of Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was a garage worker who was inspired to create the invention after he was forced to pull a car out of a creek using blocks, ropes, and six men. An improved design led him to manufacture wreckers.|$|E
25|$|Messerschmitt, and {{subsequently}} FMR, made factory-converted Service Cars to {{order for the}} automobile service industry. Similar in concept to the Harley-Davidson Servi-Car and the Indian Dispatch Tow, the Service Car had a detachable tow bar and clamp, a revised front suspension to accommodate the tow bar when in use, and a storage system inside the car to accommodate the tow bar when not in use. The service technician would drive the Service Car to the customer's car and, if the customer's car was <b>drivable,</b> attach the tow bar {{to the front of}} the Service Car, clamp the other end of the tow bar to the bumper of the customer's car, and drive the customer's car to the garage. When the service was complete, he would drive the car back to the customer while towing the Service Car, detach the Service Car from the customer's car, and drive back to the garage. Approximately 12 were built; only one is known to exist at present.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 2 {{has only one}} purely water-based vehicle, the rigid-inflatable boat; however, the BTR-90, the MEC APC, can travel in water {{as well as the}} LAV-25 and the WZ 551, the USMC and PLA equivalents, respectively. The developers tried to design the game so that every vehicle would be weak to another type of vehicle, intending to create a situation similar to a game of rock-paper-scissors. For example, mobile anti-air was intended to effectively destroy helicopters, but are vulnerable against opposing tanks. Included within this relationship are stationary defenses such as light machine guns and anti-aircraft/TOW emplacements. The availability and number of certain vehicles are dependent on the map and its size as well as control points captured. Also, more vehicles become available to be used on the maps of expansion/booster packs. (see Maps). The USS Essex is the only naval ship featured in BF2, featuring two spawn points and aircraft spawn points, and is not <b>drivable</b> or destroyable, except for its Phalanx turrets.|$|E

500|$|While the Lincoln Highway has {{not been}} an {{official}} route for [...] years, it is still a source of pride in the communities and regions through which it passed. [...] Nearly 85percent of the original Lincoln Highway is still <b>drivable,</b> although much is gravel. [...] Most of what is <b>drivable</b> is either along US30 or within [...] [...] The Lincoln Highway bridge in Tama was built in 1915. [...] It was restored in the 1980s after local officials feared losing the then-deteriorating bridge. [...] Preston's Service Station, a landmark of Belle Plaine, has become a Lincoln Highway museum. [...] Monuments were built along the route to honor not only Abraham Lincoln, but to honor Iowans who were influential for planning its route.|$|E
500|$|Halo 3 {{introduces}} [...] "support weapons", {{which are}} cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains {{a new class}} of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game's vehicular component has been expanded with new <b>drivable</b> and AI-only vehicles.|$|E
500|$|More than [...] {{of roads}} {{make up the}} state's major highway skeleton, {{including}} state-operated highways, ten turnpikes or major toll roads, and the longest <b>drivable</b> stretch of Route 66 in the nation. In 2008, Interstate 44 in Oklahoma City was Oklahoma's busiest highway, with a daily traffic volume of 123,300 cars. In 2010, the state had the nation's third highest number of bridges classified as structurally deficient, with nearly 5,212 bridges in disrepair, including 235 National Highway System Bridges.|$|E
500|$|Starting with Crazy Taxi 2, the {{gameplay}} {{included the}} ability {{to pick up a}} party of passengers, each having a different destination. The number of passengers in the car multiplies the tip bonuses earned from stunt driving, while the total fare can only be earned once the last passenger is dropped off in time. Additionally, Crazy Taxi 2 introduced a new stunt move called the [...] "Crazy Hop" [...] that allowed the player to make the taxi jump to clear some obstacles or reach higher <b>drivable</b> surfaces.|$|E
500|$|The {{biggest problem}} of the morning though {{occurred}} shortly before {{the completion of the}} 17th hour, when the race-leading No. 2 Audi of Rinaldo Capello lost a left rear wheel at high speed at the Indianapolis corner. Unable to control the car he went straight on into a tire barrier. Although Capello attempted to get the car back to the pits, it was too badly damaged to be <b>drivable.</b> Television footage had recorded the No. 2 Audi being dropped off its airjacks before the left rear wheel was attached on the prior pit stop, but Audi claimed that this was likely not the cause of the wheel coming off at speed.|$|E
500|$|On August 26, 2011, at PAX Prime it was {{announced}} that Turn 10 would include the UNSC Warthog from Microsoft Studios' Halo series in Forza Motorsport 4s Autovista mode. The model of Warthog used in Forza Motorsport 4 is identical to the version in the then-upcoming Halo 4, although the vehicle is not <b>drivable.</b> Turn 10 has cited the vehicle's exaggerated four wheel steering system, fictional futuristic technology and excessive height as reasons for its exclusion, stating [...] "One, it's got some technology that's built into Halo {{that would have been a}} big investment for us to then build into the game only to support one vehicle. [...] Technically we don't support that because no real world cars in our game do." ...|$|E
500|$|Halo gained {{positive}} reviews; on Metacritic, {{it currently}} holds an aggregated score of 97 out of 100, based on reviews from 68 professional critics. Ste Curran's review for Edge praised {{the game as}} [...] "the most important launch game for any console, ever" [...] and commented, [...] "GoldenEye was the standard for multiplayer console combat. It has been surpassed." [...] GameSpot claimed that [...] "Halos single-player game is worth picking up an Xbox for alone," [...] concluding, [...] "Not only is this easily {{the best of the}} Xbox launch games, but it's easily one of the best shooters ever, on any platform." [...] IGN remarked similarly, calling Halo a [...] "can't miss, no-brainer, sure thing, five star, triple A game." [...] AllGame editor Jonathan Licata praised Bungie for doing [...] "a remarkable job with Halo, taking many successful elements from previous standouts in the genre to make one very playable game". Among the specific aspects that reviewers praised were the balance of weapons, the role of <b>drivable</b> vehicles, and the artificial intelligence of enemies.|$|E
500|$|There {{are over}} 70 campgrounds in Boise National Forest {{and groups of}} more {{developed}} recreation facilities at the Trinity Mountains, Warm Lake, and Deadwood and Sage Hen reservoirs. As in most national forests, {{the majority of the}} land in Boise National Forest is open to dispersed camping (outside of developed campgrounds). One of the forest's fire lookouts, Deadwood Lookout, is now available as a cabin for the public to rent, among other sites. Bicycles are allowed on forest roads and on more than [...] of multiple-use trails, whereas over [...] of trails are open to motorized recreation. The Danskin Mountains Off-Highway Vehicle Trail System contains [...] of motorcycle and ATV trails on [...] of land that is generally open from April through November. The forest's Trinity Mountain Recreation Area includes the highest <b>drivable</b> (4-wheel drive recommended) road in Idaho, which ascends to the Trinity Mountain Lookout at an elevation of over [...] In 2013 revenues from recreation and special use fees amounted to $454,635, while expenses totaled the difference is allocated to the following season's startup costs.|$|E
500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was <b>drivable,</b> and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over the course}} of seven days in Baltimore. The scene in which Pembleton and Felton try to find the correct police car in a large garage was filmed in a rundown early 20th-century ballroom. The scene {{features}} dozens of white unmarked Cavaliers. Shortly before [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] was filmed, the Baltimore Police Department stopped using Cavaliers as their regular brand of police car, and agreed to sell their collection of leftover Cavaliers to the Homicide show for $1. Although the cars were used as props in the episode, only two of the cars were actually <b>drivable.</b> The scenes set in the medical examiner's office were filmed in the actual Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. The actors, particularly Jon Polito, hated performing in the morgue because they found the atmosphere unsettling. Ned Beatty said of filming there, [...] "The one thing you can't get on camera is, oh boy, it smells." [...] The identification pictures of suspects that Munch looks through were all pictures of photos of members of the Homicide crew. One of the final scenes in the episode, featuring Polito, Johnson and Belzer speaking in an alley at night, was conceived, written and shot in one night simply because it was raining outside, and the Homicide crew wanted {{to take advantage of the}} location during a rainy night.|$|E
500|$|The {{usage of}} the safety car came under {{criticism}} from figures within the sport. Fernando Alonso disagreed with the decision to start under the safety car as he felt it prevented him from attacking Vettel, while Sauber technical director James Key thought his team was put at a disadvantage when Kobayashi could not defend against the quicker cars after the fifth safety car period. Martin Brundle, who competed in Formula One for twelve years, stated [...] "the fact that the drivers came in almost immediately for intermediate tyres tells me that, {{on the face of}} it, the safety car was out too long", and felt that the safety car [...] "should be a last resort, not a default option." [...] However, he recognised that FIA race director Charlie Whiting had to consider the driver's visibility, and inexperience using the Pirelli wet-weather tyres led to caution. Jarno Trulli however agreed with the FIA's decisions, in particular the length of the red flag delay: [...] "It was right to wait that long; track conditions had to improve {{in order to make the}} cars <b>drivable</b> again. They did everything right." [...] De la Rosa and di Resta also agreed with the decision to halt the race, and Whiting stating that [...] "when it rained it was quite clear we needed to stop the race." [...] Whiting went on to say that the opinions of the drivers were taken into account on the decision to halt the race, although he also considered the possibility of a suspension benefiting those drivers.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors {{placed an}} order for 30 {{operational}} cars. The AMX/3 body mold was sent to Italian GT maker Giotto Bizzarrini, whose Turin facility hand made <b>drivable</b> mid-engined, steel bodied cars. Built on a [...] wheelbase, the Bizzarrini prototypes used the AMC [...] V8 and an Italian OTO Melara four-speed transaxle. The AMC/3 {{is considered one of}} Bizzarrini's car-masterpieces.|$|E
2500|$|South Beach, {{with its}} crowded nature and night life, {{is a very}} popular walking area, as parking is limited and expensive. It is also known for its upscale Lincoln Road walking mall. Once <b>drivable,</b> Lincoln Road has been {{converted}} into a strict pedestrian road. Also popular for walking in South Beach are the Ocean Drive art deco historic district and Española Way. Additionally, much of the oceanfront along the east coast features pedestrian and bicycle only beach walks, which are often lit and lined with shops and restaurants. In 2014 it was proposed that Ocean Drive should be closed to automobile traffic to become another pedestrian road. The recently renovated [...] Hollywood Beach Broadwalk in Hollywood was once named one of America's best boardwalks by Travel + Leisure magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Porsche also {{developed}} the car's aerodynamics, which {{were designed to}} increase stability, as was the automatic ride-height adjustment that became available on the road car (961 race cars had fixed suspensions). Its [...] "zero lift" [...] aerodynamics were {{a big part of}} keeping it <b>drivable.</b> The 959 also featured Porsche-Steuer Kupplung (PSK) which was at the time the most advanced all-wheel-drive system in a production car. Capable of dynamically changing the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a [...] "super" [...] street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of available power to the rear wheels, helping {{make the most of the}} rear-traction bias that occurs at such times. It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as transmitted power to the front axle. [...] The magnesium alloy wheels were unique, being hollow inside to form a sealed chamber contiguous with the tire and equipped with a built-in tire pressure monitoring system.|$|E
60|$|I {{took down}} this {{dwelling}} the same morning, drawing the nails, and removed {{it to the}} pond-side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on the grass there to bleach and warp back again in the sun. One early thrush gave me a note or two as I drove along the woodland path. I was informed treacherously by a young Patrick that neighbor Seeley, an Irishman, in the intervals of the carting, transferred the still tolerable, straight, and <b>drivable</b> nails, staples, and spikes to his pocket, and then stood when I came back {{to pass the time}} of day, and look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation; there being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent spectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the removal of the gods of Troy.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Ryves's {{little boy}} {{was in the}} garden as Peter Baron issued from the house, and his mother {{appeared}} to have come out for a moment, bareheaded, {{to see that he}} was doing no harm. She was discussing with him the responsibility that he might incur by passing a piece of string round one of the iron palings and pretending he was in command of a [...] "geegee"; but it happened that {{at the sight of the}} other lodger the child was seized with a finer perception of the <b>drivable.</b> He rushed at Baron with a flourish of the bridle, shouting, [...] "Ou geegee!" [...] in a manner productive of some refined embarrassment to his mother. Baron met his advance by mounting him on a shoulder and feigning to prance an instant, so that by the time this performance was over--it took but a few seconds--the young man felt introduced to Mrs. Ryves. Her smile struck him as charming, and such an impression shortens many steps. She said, [...] "Oh, thank you--you mustn't let him worry you"; and then as, having put down the child and raised his hat, he was turning away, she added: [...] "It's very good of you not to complain of my piano." ...|$|E
50|$|BNSF Dash 9 #4723 is {{featured}} as a <b>drivable</b> locomotive in Microsoft Train Simulator {{and the actual}} Dash 9 has stickers on its cab noting this, and Dash 9's are also featured as <b>drivable</b> locomotives in RailWorks 3 and Trainz Simulator.|$|E
