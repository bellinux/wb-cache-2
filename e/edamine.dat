Bacteriol. 84 : 742 – 746. 1962. —A simple medium is {{suggested}} which markedly enhances the in vitro {{conversion of the}} dimorphic fungus Coccidioides immitis. The principal component of this medium is <b>Edamine,</b> an enzymatic digest of lactalbumin. The arthrospore-spherule conversion was accomplished {{in as little as}} 12 hr when this medium was used. Maturation of the spherules with subsequent release of endospores was completed within 72 hr. The value of various supplements to the basal <b>Edamine</b> medium was investigated...|$|E
40|$|Brooks, Lula D. (Arizona State University, Tempe) and William T. Northey. Studies on Coccidioides immitis. II. Physiological {{studies on}} in vitro spherulation. J. Bacteriol. 85 : 12 – 15. 1963. —Studies on the amino acids assayed in <b>Edamine</b> {{revealed}} that the amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, {{in addition to the}} amino acid derivatives dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), epinephrine, tyramine monohydrochloride (tyramine HCl), and pyrocatechol {{play an important role in}} the Coccidioides immitis conversion process. In the presence of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, DOPA, pyrocatechol, dextrose, and biotin, conversion as well as maturation was demonstrated. However, in epinephrine and tyramine HCl combinations, conversion occurred without maturation of the spherules. The availability of increased amounts of melanin precursors is suggested as a possible explanation for the increased susceptibility of the dark-skinned races to disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Conversion and maturation were also noted when lactic and fumaric acids served as carbon sources. The conversion of a limited number of arthrospores to spherules and their subsequent maturation in the presence of only phenol and biotin suggest the possibility that the key to the C. immitis conversion process lies in the availability of certain ring structures...|$|E
