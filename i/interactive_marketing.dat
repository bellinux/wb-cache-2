25|$|Web 2.0 {{is used by}} companies, {{non-profit}} {{organizations and}} governments for <b>interactive</b> <b>marketing.</b> A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, customer service enhancement, product or service improvement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis—Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content— to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. Another marketing Web 2.0 lure {{is to make sure}} consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing. Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing. Saturating media hubs—like The New York Times, PC Magazine and Business Week— with links to popular new Web sites and services, is critical to achieving the threshold for mass adoption of those services. User web content can be used to gauge consumer satisfaction. In a recent article for Bank Technology News, Shane Kite describes how Citigroup's Global Transaction Services unit monitors social media outlets to address customer issues and improve products. According to Google Timeline, the term Web 2.0 was discussed and indexed most frequently in 2005, 2007 and 2008. Its average use is continuously declining by 2–4% per quarter since April 2008.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) in the electricity supply industry has driven generation companies (GENCOs) to put {{efforts to reduce}} their produced emissions. Under a multimarket environment, a GENCO generates electricity subject to physical, fuel and environmental constraints. Separate and evolving research efforts are currently shaping electricity market, fuel market and carbon market without paying adequate attentions to how each market affects the others, though the markets have overlapping goals {{with respect to the}} global economic and environmental benefits. Under this background, this paper investigates the impacts of carbon policies on a GENCO's decision making under multimarket environment. A dynamic decision making model is proposed to deal with the multimarket trading problem for a GENCO during each trading period. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed to solve the multi-period optimization problem for each time interval. Comparisons between different scenarios demonstrate the economic and environmental influences of different policies on a GENCO. With the proposed model, a GENCO can make a rational tradeoff between profit making and emission reduction under the three <b>interactive</b> <b>markets</b> environment. Policies defining the three <b>interactive</b> <b>markets</b> can accurately reflect the intended goals such as reducing emissions, promoting renewable and keeping electricity cost at a reasonable level.

We also propose basic interaction mechanisms and show in simulations that these already reproduce certain particular features of prices in real stock markets. ...|$|R
