40|$|This paper proposes an X Window System {{protocol}} compression scheme called Fast Higher Bandwidth X (FHBX). Previous X protocol compression schemes {{were either}} much slower (Higher Bandwidth X) or much less effective (Xremote). By using an application specific predictive hashing technique, FHBX {{is able to}} deliver three times the compression performance of Xremote, while running ten {{times as fast as}} HBX. The family of structured compression techniques illustrated by FHBX is applicable to other structured protocols, and should enable a host of interactive applications on low bandwidth wireless devices and telephone links. 1 Introduction This research is targeted at the vast numbers of networks which are, and which will continue to be, too slow. These networks include normal telephone <b>connections,</b> wireless <b>connections,</b> <b>internet</b> <b>connections,</b> and <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections.</b> If the current rate of increase in CPU performance holds, unloaded 10 Mbit/sec Ethernet connections will be candidates for softwar [...] ...|$|R

Created using Red Hat Linux, Smoothwall GPL originally had two simple functions: control the modem to dial and hang up, and to route TCP/IP packets from the LAN to the <b>Internet</b> <b>connection,</b> and back again. The LAN was hidden from the public network by NAT, applied using ipchains.|$|R

But still the quality of speed is not that up to the mark. There were 84,000 fixed broadband subscriptions in 2010.|$|R

For comparison I chose ADSL connection, connection trough cable TV and wireless connection. In comparison I used next methods: lexicographical method, ORESTE, WSA, TOPSIS and ELECTRE III. For <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> is the best to use connection trough cable TV, second is ADSL connection and the worst is wireless connection.

40|$|The {{increase}} of smartphone ability is rapidly increasing the power consumption. Many {{methods have been}} proposed to reduce smartphone power consumption. Most of these methods use the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> control based {{on the availability of}} the battery power level regardless of when and where a waste of energy occurs. This paper proposes a new approach to control the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> based on idle time using user behavior pattern analysis. User behavior patterns are used to predict idle time duration. <b>Internet</b> <b>connection</b> control performed during idle time. During idle time <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> periodically switched on and off by a certain time interval. This method effectively reduces a waste of energy. Control of the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> does not interfere the user because it is implemented on idle time.
