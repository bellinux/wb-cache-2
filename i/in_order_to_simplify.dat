25|$|It is {{difficult}} to solve this many-body problem explicitly in either classical or quantum mechanics. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> the task, two important approximations are usually imposed. First, the sum is only performed over neighboring atoms. Although the electric forces in real solids extend to infinity, this approximation is still valid because the fields produced by distant atoms are effectively screened. Secondly, the potentials V are treated as harmonic potentials. This is permissible {{as long as the}} atoms remain close to their equilibrium positions. Formally, this is accomplished by Taylor expanding V about its equilibrium value to quadratic order, giving V proportional to the displacement x2 and the elastic force simply proportional to x. The error in ignoring higher order terms remains small if x remains close to the equilibrium position.|$|E
25|$|Production of the T-34-85 {{began in}} February 1944, first using the 85 mm S-53 gun {{and then in}} mid-1944 the 85 mm ZiS-S-53 (the ZiS-S-53 was a {{modified}} S-53 designed by the Grabin Design Bureau <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> the gun and reduce its price; the ballistics of both were the same). The improved T-34-85 became the standard Soviet medium tank, with an uninterrupted production run {{until the end of}} the war. A T-34-85 initially cost about 30 percent more to produce than a Model 1943, at 164,000 rubles; by 1945 this had been reduced to 142,000 rubles. During the course of the World War II, the cost of a T-34 tank was reduced by almost half, from 270,000 rubles in 1941, while in the meantime its top speed remained about the same, and its main gun's armour penetration and turret frontal armour thickness both nearly doubled.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{optimize}} the surface crack parameter of the lumbar spine using probabilistic and finite-element analysis.

Most of the vertebra fracture is caused by compressive loading due to the high-energy impact or lifting heavy goods. In addition, unilateral pedicle crack is close related to the compressive loading on the posterior region. However, this biological structure involved too many uncertainties in terms of mechanical properties, loading and geometry. Therefore, probabilistic analysis was performed to cater the problem that unsolved by deterministic analysis. Probabilistic and optimization techniques were used to measure the correlation between input parameters of the bone failure based on the yield stress and fracture toughness consideration. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis will emphasize and validate the crucial parameters that should be stress and focus on the failure criteria...|$|R
25|$|The Southern Cross {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{distinctive}} constellations visible in the Southern Hemisphere, and has been used to represent Australia since the early days of British settlement. Ivor Evans, one of the flag's designers, intended the Southern Cross to also refer to the four moral virtues ascribed to the four main stars by Dante: justice, prudence, temperance and fortitude. The number of points on the stars of the Southern Cross on the modern Australian flag differs from the original competition-winning design, in which they ranged between five and nine points each, representing their relative brightness in the night sky. The stars are named after the first five letters of the Greek alphabet, in decreasing order of brightness in the sky. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> manufacture, the British Admiralty standardised the four larger outer stars at seven points each, leaving the smaller, more central star with five points.

500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a double-acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared [...] "a new era {{in the history of the}} steam engine." ...|$|E
500|$|Smart's Hymns are {{modelled}} after {{a tradition}} exemplified by Robert Nelson. They are steeped in Anglican tradition and also emphasise English patriotism and England's divine favour. The Hymns, according to Guest, [...] " [...] a delight in creation {{that is largely}} absent {{from the work of}} other hymn-writers of the century, unless they are paraphrasing the words of David." [...] To Hawes, the Hymns exemplify an evangelical spirit that separates Smart from the traditional Anglican church. Although he wrote his second set of hymns, Hymns for the Amusement of Children, for a younger audience, Smart cares more about emphasising the need for children to be moral instead of [...] "innocent". These works have been seem as possibly too complicated for [...] "amusement" [...] because they employee ambiguities and complicated theological concepts. In essence, the Hymns for the Amusement of Children is intended to teach children the specific virtues that make up {{the subject matter of the}} work. Like the Hymns for the Amusement of Children, Smart's The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ were designed to teach morals.

500|$|The austere {{settings}} {{in the game}} came about because testers {{spent too much time}} trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film The Island as reference. While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include it. They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the game, though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic [...] "Lab Rat", that ties Portal and Portal 2s story together. According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by James Bond lasers, which was partially applied to the turrets, Portal Kombat where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a countdown timer near the end; Swift noted, [...] "Time pressure makes people think something is a lot more complicated than it really is", and Wolpaw admitted, [...] "It was really cheap to make [...] " [...] <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> the dialogue during the battle.|$|E

This would require production facilities, and by June 1942 the project had reached the stage where their construction could be contemplated. On 25 June, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer recommended that the different manufacturing facilities be built at the same site <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> security and construction. Such a site would require a substantial tract of land to accommodate both the facilities and housing for the thousands of workers.

While security and safety concerns suggested a remote site, it still needed to be near sources of labor, and accessible by road and rail transportation. A mild climate that allowed construction to proceed throughout the year was desirable. Terrain separated by ridges would reduce the impact of accidental explosions, but they could not be so steep as to complicate construction. The substratum needed to be firm enough to provide good foundations, but not so rocky that it would hinder excavation work. It was estimated that the proposed plants would need access to 150,000 kW of electrical power and [...] of water per minute. A War Department policy held that, as a rule, munitions facilities should not be located west of the Sierra or Cascade Ranges, east of the Appalachian Mountains, or within [...] of the Canadian or Mexican borders.|$|E
