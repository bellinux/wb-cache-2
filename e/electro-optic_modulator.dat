50|$|In {{a typical}} optical link, data is first {{transferred}} from the electrical to the optical domain using an <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator</b> or a directly-modulated laser. An <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator</b> can vary the intensity and/or the phase of the optical carrier. In silicon photonics, a common technique to achieve modulation is to vary the density of free charge carriers. Variations of electron and hole densities change the real and the imaginary part of the refractive index of silicon as described by the empirical equations of Soref and Bennett. Modulators can consist of both forward-biased PIN diodes, which generally generate large phase-shifts but suffer of lower speeds, {{as well as of}} reverse-biased PN junctions. A prototype optical interconnect with microring modulators integrated with germanium detectors has been demonstrated.Non-resonant modulators, such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers, have typical dimensions in the millimeter range and are usually used in telecom or datacom applications. Resonant devices, such as ring-resonators, can have dimensions of few tens of micrometers only, occupying therefore much smaller areas.In 2013 researchers demonstrated a resonant depletion modulator that can be fabricated using standard Silicon-on-Insulator Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (SOI CMOS) manufacturing processes.

50|$|For {{continuous}} operation, a {{train of}} supercontinuum pulses is used. The chirped pulses {{arriving at the}} <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator</b> should be wide enough (in time) such that {{the trailing edge of}} one pulse overlaps {{the leading edge of the}} next pulse. For segmentation, optical filters separate the signal into multiple wavelength channels at the output of the second dispersive medium. For each channel, a separate photodetector and backend electronic ADC is used. Finally the output of these ADCs are passed on to the DSP which generates the desired digital output.|$|E
50|$|Compared with <b>Electro-optic</b> <b>modulator</b> (EOM), EAM {{can operate}} with much lower {{voltages}} (a few volts instead of ten volts or more). They can be operated {{at very high}} speed; a modulation bandwidth of tens of gigahertz can be achieved, which makes these devices useful for optical fiber communication. A convenient feature is that an EAM can be integrated with distributed feedback laser diode on a single chip to form a data transmitter {{in the form of}} a photonic integrated circuit. Compared with direct modulation of the laser diode, a higher bandwidth and reduced chirp can be obtained.|$|E
50|$|Active {{mode-locking}} {{is normally}} achieved by modulating the loss (or gain) {{of the laser}} cavity at a repetition rate equivalent to the cavity frequency, or a harmonic thereof. In practice, the modulator can be acousto-optic or <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator,</b> Mach-Zehnder integrated-optic modulators, or a semiconductor electro-absorption modulator (EAM). The principle of active mode-locking with a sinusoidal modulation. In this situation, optical pulses will form {{in such a way}} as to minimize the loss from the modulator. The peak of the pulse would automatically adjust in phase to be at the point of minimum loss from the modulator. Because of the slow variation of sinusoidal modulation, it is not very straightforward for generating ultrashort optical pulses (< 1ps) using this method.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION High-speed fiber {{transmission}} {{systems are}} now moving towards the 40 Gbps goal; {{at the same}} time, new narrowband RF-on-fiber approaches are being investigated with centerband frequencies in the microwave and mm-wave range. In such sys- tems, the analog and/or digital RF modulation of the optical sig- nal plays a crucial role. At present, external modulation through <b>electro-optic</b> or electro-absorption <b>modulators</b> (EAM) {{seems to be the}} most effective solution in terms of modulation bandwidth and other system requirements. Although EAMs are appealing in terms of device size, cost and integration, <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulators</b> still are considered superior, e. g. from the standpoint of chirping. The present paper will therefore focus on the modelling of electro-optical (e. g. lithium niobate) amplitude modu- lators.

50|$|Fluorescence lifetimes can be {{determined}} in the frequency domain by a phase-modulation method. The method uses a light source that is pulsed or modulated at high frequency (up to 500 MHz) such as an LED, diode laser or a continuous wave source combined with an <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator</b> or an acousto-optic modulator. The fluorescence is (a.) demodulated and (b.) phase shifted; both quantities {{are related to the}} characteristic decay times of the fluorophore. Also, y-components to the excitation and fluorescence sine waves will be modulated, and lifetime can {{be determined}} from the modulation ratio of these y-components. Hence, 2 values for the lifetime {{can be determined}} from the phase-modulation method. The lifetimes are determined through a fitting procedures of these experimental parameters. An advantage of PMT-based or camera-based frequency domain FLIM is its fast lifetime image acquisition making it suitable for applications such as live cell research.|$|E
50|$|Spectra {{cannot be}} {{acquired}} quickly {{due to the}} monochromatic laser source which is used. Having said this, some groups {{are now beginning to}} develop the use of broadband LED or supercontinuum sources for CRDS, the light of which can then be dispersed by a grating onto a CCD, or Fourier transformed spectrometer (mainly in broadband analogues of CRDS). Perhaps more importantly, the development of ICOS based techniques have now been demonstrated over the range from the near UV to the mid-infrared. In addition, the frequency-agile rapid scanning (FARS) CRDS technique has been developed to overcome the mechanical or thermal frequency tuning which typically limits CRDS acquisition rates. The FARS method utilizes an <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator</b> to step a probe laser side band to successive cavity modes, eliminating tuning time between data points and allowing for acquisition rates about 2 orders of magnitude faster than traditional thermal tuning.|$|E
50|$|The {{output of}} the laser is split into pump and probe beams by a {{half-wave}} plate followed by a polarizing beam splitter leading to a cross-polarized pump and probe. The pump beam is modulated {{on the order of}} a few megahertz by an acousto-optic or <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator</b> and focused onto the sample with a lens. The probe is directed into an optical delay line. The probe beam is then focused with a lens onto the same spot on the sample as the probe. Both pump and probe have a spot size on the order of 10-50 μm. The reflected probe light is input to a high bandwidth photodetector. The output is fed into a lock-in amplifier whose reference signal has the same frequency used to modulate the pump. The voltage output from the lock-in will be proportional to ΔR. Recording this signal as the optical delay line is changed provides a measurement of ΔR as a function of optical probe-pulse time delay.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{conventional}} analog optical link, dispersion causes {{the upper and}} lower modulation sidebands, foptical ± felectrical, to slip in relative phase. At certain frequencies, their beats with the optical carrier interfere destructively, creating nulls in the frequency response of the system. For practical systems the first null is at tens of GHz, which is sufficient for handling most electrical signals of interest. Although it may seem that the dispersion penalty places a fundamental limit on the impulse response (or the bandwidth) of the time-stretch system, it can be eliminated. The dispersion penalty vanishes with single-sideband modulation. Alternatively, one can use the modulator’s secondary (inverse) output port to eliminate the dispersion penalty, {{in much the same way}} as two antennas can eliminate spatial nulls in wireless communication (hence the two antennas on top of a WiFi access point). This configuration is termed phase-diversity. [...] Combining the complementary outputs using a maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm results in a transfer function with a flat response in the frequency domain. Thus, the impulse response (bandwidth) of a time-stretch system is limited only by the bandwidth of the <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator,</b> which is about 120 GHz—a value that is adequate for capturing most electrical waveforms of interest.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} active {{mode-locking}} technique places a standing wave <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulator</b> into the laser cavity. When driven with an electrical signal, this produces a sinusoidal amplitude modulation {{of the light}} in the cavity. Considering this in the frequency domain, if a mode has optical frequency ν, and is amplitude-modulated at a frequency f, the resulting signal has sidebands at optical frequencies ν &minus; f and ν + f. If the modulator is driven at the same frequency as the cavity-mode spacing Δν, then these sidebands correspond to the two cavity modes adjacent to the original mode. Since the sidebands are driven in-phase, the central mode and the adjacent modes will be phase-locked together. Further operation of the modulator on the sidebands produces phase-locking of the ν &minus; 2f and ν + 2f modes, and so on until all modes in the gain bandwidth are locked. As said above, typical lasers are multi-mode and not seeded by a root mode. So multiple modes need to work out which phase to use. In a passive cavity with this locking applied {{there is no way to}} dump the entropy given by the original independent phases. This locking is better described as a coupling, leading to a complicated behavior and not clean pulses. The coupling is only dissipative because of the dissipative nature of the amplitude modulation. Otherwise, the phase modulation would not work.|$|E

40|$|Ferroelectric {{crystals}} such as Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) exhibit piezo-electric, pyro-electric and electro-optic coefficients {{that are}} several factors higher than non-ferroelectric crystals. When considering optical {{applications such as}} high-speed <b>electro-optic</b> <b>modulators</b> {{it is vital to}} have a deposition technique that can grow thin films with high quality on the desired substrate. Epitaxial growth is not always a necessity and preferentially oriented polycrystalline films are often sufficient. In our work we demonstrate that we are able to deposit different types of preferentially oriented thin ferroelectric films on any substrate which can withstand the annealing temperature of the thin films of 500 to 600 °C, including silicon, glass, silicon nitride, etc. The key factor in this deposition is the use of an intermediate layer which acts both as seed and buffer layer. It is found that lanthanide based intermediate layers as thin as 10 nm result in high quality films with strong remnant polarization and low dielectric losses. Measurements of the electro-optic coefficients of these films are performed using ellipsometry.
