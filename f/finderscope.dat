50|$|A 6×30 <b>finderscope</b> is {{typically}} considered the minimum useful size for a magnifying <b>finderscope</b> on an amateur telescope, and an 8×50 or larger <b>finderscope</b> is preferred for more accurate aiming.|$|E

5|$|These sights {{are also}} used on astronomical {{telescope}}s as <b>finderscopes,</b> to help aim the telescope at the desired object. There are many commercial models, {{the first of which}} was the Telrad, invented by amateur astronomer Steve Kufeld in the late 1970s. Others are now available from companies such as Apogee, Celestron, Photon, Rigel, and Televue.|$|R
50|$|Balance Issues: Designs {{that have}} the {{telescope}} tube fixed in relationship to its altitude bearings can be put out of balance by the addition or subtraction of equipment such as cameras, <b>finderscopes</b> or even unusually heavy eyepieces. Most Dobsonian telescopes have enough friction in the bearings to resist a moderate amount of imbalance; however, this friction can also {{make it difficult to}} position the telescope accurately.|$|R
50|$|Finderscopes {{usually come}} with a {{designation}} of the form A×B, where A is the magnification and B is the aperture of the finderscope's objective lens in millimeters; for example, a 6×30 <b>finderscope</b> means a <b>finderscope</b> with a 30 mm objective and a magnification of 6×. This designation {{is in the same}} format used by most binoculars.|$|E

50|$|Centaurus A {{is located}} {{approximately}} 4° north of Omega Centauri (a globular cluster visible {{with the naked}} eye). Because the galaxy has a high surface brightness and relatively large angular size, it is an ideal target for amateur astronomy observations. The bright central bulge and dark dust lane are visible even in <b>finderscopes</b> and large binoculars, and additional structure {{may be seen in}} larger telescopes. Centaurus A is {{visible to the naked eye}} under exceptionally good conditions.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>finderscope</b> is an {{aiming device}} used in astronomy, {{typically}} a small auxiliary telescope {{mounted on the}} main astronomical telescope along the same line of sight. The <b>finderscope</b> usually has a smaller magnification than the main telescope, providing a much larger field of view, useful for manually aiming (also called [...] "slewing") a telescope and locating a desired astronomical object. Some finderscopes have crosshairs to aid in accurately pointing the telescope system at a target.|$|E

50|$|Finderscopes contain {{mechanisms}} to properly align {{them with the}} main telescope's line of sight. Accomplishing this alignment varies based {{on the design of}} the <b>finderscope</b> and its mount: usually on amateur telescopes it is done by three or six adjustment screws.|$|E
50|$|To {{accomplish}} this automatically an autoguider is usually attached {{to either a}} guidescope or <b>finderscope,</b> which is a smaller telescope oriented {{in the same direction}} as the main telescope, or an off-axis guider, which uses a prism to divert some of the light originally headed towards the eyepiece.|$|E
50|$|The {{fiber optic}} {{connection}} to the archive computer was discontinued in January 2007 {{in favor of the}} internet connection through the building because of degrading transmission boxes. The insufficient lock mechanism of the dome side doors in open position was changed the same month. The OS on the telescope control computer was upgraded from win-98 to XP in February. However, the computer could not be replaced due to an essential ISA control card. As a result of the encoder automatic calibration failure, a small <b>finderscope</b> was installed in May so that the telescope now can easily be calibrated without the automatic procedure. The <b>finderscope</b> replaced a red point sight. A Coronado P.S.T. was mounted on the main telescope in the summer of 2007, piggy backing on the main telescope's tracking system.|$|E
50|$|A {{telescopic}} sight is an optical telescope equipped with {{some form of}} graphic image pattern reticle mounted in an optically appropriate position in the optical system to give an accurate aiming point. Telescopic sights are used {{on a wide range}} of devices including guns, surveying equipment, and even as sights on larger telescopes (called a <b>finderscope).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Star hopping is {{a method}} often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech {{equipment}} such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope. It {{involves the use of}} maps (or memory) to locate known landmark stars, and [...] "hopping" [...] between them, often {{with the aid of a}} <b>finderscope.</b> Because of its simplicity, star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked-eye stars.|$|E
50|$|Star hopping uses {{bright stars}} {{as a guide to}} finding fainter objects. A {{knowledge}} of the relative positions of bright stars and target objects is essential. After planning the star hop {{with the aid of a}} star chart, the observer first locates one or more bright stars in a <b>finderscope,</b> reflex sight, or, at a low magnification, with the instrument to be used for observation. The instrument is then moved by one or more increments, possibly using a reticle to identify specific angular distances, to follow identified patterns of stars in the sky, until the target object is reached.|$|E
5000|$|In {{development}} since 1946, the Questar 3-1/2” {{has been}} the company's most notable product. Braymer’s basic concept for the telescope was one of portability, compactness, and ease of use. He used a catadioptric Maksutov design, named after its inventor Dmitry Maksutov, for the optical tube assembly. Braymer used a modified Cassegrain design that added an aluminized spot to the Maksutov corrector plate, creating a compact folded light path (this design is sometimes called a [...] "Spot-Maksutov"). Braymer designed a built-in “Control Box” that allowed the user, looking through the main eyepiece, to switch between the main telescope and a coaxial <b>finderscope</b> via moving a diagonal {{out of the way}} with a flick of a knob. This also allowed a camera or other device to access the focal plane through a hole {{on the back of the}} Control Box. A knob for focus and another to switch in and out a magnification-doubling Barlow lens rounded out the controls. The cast-aluminum double-fork arm mount was designed with a built-in clock drive and became equatorial by adding the collapsible legs included. It also included a star chart engraved in white on a blue aluminum sleeve (this doubles as a dewcap), around the barrel which contained a moon map.|$|E
