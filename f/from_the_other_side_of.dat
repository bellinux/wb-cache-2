5|$|Altgens was {{featured}} in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He initially reported hearing two shots, but thought someone had been setting off fireworks. For a November 25 story, Altgens wrote {{that he did not}} know the origin of the gunshots until later, but he believed they came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Elm Street, opposite the presidential limousine from where he was standing.|$|E
5|$|Although the ZNDH was {{now able}} to mount a {{credible}} threat against the insurgents, by then a new menace was arriving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Adriatic. On 30 June 1943, the first Allied reconnaissance flights were reported, followed by the first USAAF bombers, when 61 B-24 Liberators of IX Bomber Command overflew the NDH on a deep penetration raid on the Austrian city of Wiener Neustadt on 13 August. The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland {{at the end of}} 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters – aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{immediately}} sent a boat {{to pick up}} {{the three}} men <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> South Georgia while he set to work to organise the rescue of the Elephant Island men. His first three attempts were foiled by sea ice, which blocked the approaches to the island. He appealed to the Chilean government, which offered the use of Yelcho, a small seagoing tug from its navy. Yelcho, commanded by Captain Luis Pardo, and the British whaler SS Southern Sky reached Elephant Island on 30 August 1916, at which point the men had been isolated there for four and a half months, and Shackleton quickly evacuated all 22 men. The Yelcho took the crew first to Punta Arenas and after some days to Valparaiso in Chile where crowds warmly welcomed them back to civilisation.|$|E

5|$|The first Japanese {{mainstream}} {{film with}} nudity was Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh, (1964), and Takechi {{made the first}} big-budget, mainstream pink film, Daydream(白日夢), the same year. Like Women... Oh, Women!, Daydream was produced independently but Shochiku studios distributed the film. This time, the studio gave Takechi's film a major publicity campaign. Based on a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, the film was a black comedy involving a series of sex scenes imagined by an artist under anesthesia in a dentist's office. After being drugged, the artist watches helplessly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a window as the dentist tortures and performs a series of sexual acts on a female patient.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} {{destroyed a}} colonial administration ruled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the world, and dismantled {{with it the}} raja, {{seen by many as}} obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population’s poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI was {{composed}} by Naoshi Mizuta along with regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu and Kumi Tanioka. The Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack, a compilation of {{almost all of the}} music in the game, was released by DigiCube in 2002, and subsequently re-released by Square Enix in 2004. Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart Original Soundtrack was released by DigiCube in 2003 after the release of the Rise of the Zilart expansion for Final Fantasy XI, and re-released by Square Enix in 2004. Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia Original Soundtrack was produced by Square Enix in 2004 after the release of the Chains of Promathia expansion, and in 2005 Square Enix published Music <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> Vana'diel, a collection of arranged tracks from the game performed by The Star Onions, a group composed of Square Enix composers including Naoshi Mizuta, Kumi Tanioka and Hidenori Iwasaki.

5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E
25|$|According to Iraq's deputy {{interior}} minister, Adnan al-Assadi, Syrian rebels {{took control}} of all border crossings (though not all border outposts) between Iraq and Syria. 22 border guards, including their commander, were reportedly captured at one post and executed while Iraqi border troops watched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the border.|$|E

They occupied relevant ecclesiastical and political positions which provoked a strong backlash during the last years of the reign of King Alfonso VI.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the original fortress was probably ordered by King Canute I, although this is not totally certain. He reigned 1167–1195 and had fortresses built on the Swedish east coast as defence against enemies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Baltic Sea. During the 13th to 15th centuries, additions and changes were made. For example, new towers were built, and a new and thicker wall was constructed. The fortress was damaged {{on a number of}} occasions during these centuries, including in 1361, when King Valdemar IV (Atterdag) of Denmark attacked Borgholm.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic fraternities always faced reproaches to {{endanger the}} {{academic}} liberty with their Catholic faith, because as avowing Catholics {{they would be}} Ultramontanists, following orders <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the mountain, which means from the Vatican {{on the other side}} of the Alps. Therefore they were declared enemies of the Empire. During the Kulturkampf (1872–1887) the few fraternities of the CV could not ply a significant part. During the academic Kulturkampf of 1903–1908 the situation had changed. Now the Catholic fraternities were a main target of the attacks of nationalistic and liberal fraternities.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{regarded}} as Belgae, {{a type of}} Gaul, Julius Caesar says that the Condrusi, Eburones, Caeraesi, Paemani, and Segni were called by the collective name of Germani and had settled there some generations ago having come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Rhine. The Eburones are therefore amongst the so-called Germani cisrhenani 'Germans {{on this side of}} the Rhine', i.e. Germanic peoples who lived south and west of the Rhine and may have been distinct from the Belgae. It is clear that the Belgic tribes of Gaul were culturally influenced by both Gaulish and Germanic neighbours, but the details, for example which languages they spoke, remains uncertain.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a {{football}} field at Russell's Meadow since the 1930s, though the pavilion moved (c. 1950s) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Ashbrook to its present location near Lutwyche Road. There is a community project on-going to raise funds and then build a new pavilion at Russell's Meadow. In 2011 funding was secured from Sport England to improve the five existing football pitches and create two new training pitches, on both Russell's Meadow and neighbouring Robinson's Field. Russell's Meadow {{is also home to}} a separate football club for under-16s – the Church Stretton Magpies — and to Sunday league football. The home colours of both the Town and Magpies teams is black and white.|$|E

25|$|As railroads grew in popularity, {{the canal}} company {{recognized}} the importance of replacing the canal with a railroad. The first step of this was the Jefferson Railroad, a line from Carbondale north towards New York, chartered in 1864, built by the Erie Railroad in 1869 and opened in 1872. This was a branch of the Erie, running south from the main line at Lanesboro to Carbondale. Also built as part of this line was a continuation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the D's gravity railroad at Honesdale southeast to the Erie's Pennsylvania Coal Company railroad at Hawley. The Jefferson Railroad (and through it the Erie) obtained trackage rights over the D between its two sections, and the D obtained trackage rights to Lanesboro.|$|E
25|$|Meri's travel book of {{his journey}} to the {{northeast}} passage, Virmaliste Väraval (At the Gate of the Northern Lights) (1974), won him huge success in the Soviet Union. It was translated into Finnish in 1977 in the Soviet Writers series, which also introduced to Finnish readers works by the Estonian writers Mats Traat, Lilli Promet, and Ülo Tuulik. In the book Meri combined the present with a perspective into history, and used material from such explorers as Cook, Forster, Wrangel, Dahl, Sauer, Middendorff, Cochran, and others. When he sees a mountain rising against the stormy sky of the Bering Strait, he realizes that Vitus Bering and James Cook had looked at the same mountain, but <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the strait.|$|E
25|$|The ground barely {{changed from}} then until the mid-1980s.

There was a shed for players located where the main {{pavilion}} now stands. There was a hill on the outer (where the hill now is) that could accommodate two rows of vehicles, the small scoreboard stood on the outer close to where the electronic scoreboard is now, and the time clock sat about halfway up a training light tower. The police booth sat, until very recently, in the north-east corner of the oval. A concrete cricket pitch served for local junior teams until the 1956/57 season, when it was replaced by a turf wicket.|$|E
