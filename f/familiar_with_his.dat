5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked that these men, whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E

DMX was booked on charges of driving under suspension, having an uninsured vehicle, and not having a {{licensed}} vehicle. He was subsequently released after spending three hours in jail.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Dick Cavett on The Dick Cavett Show, actor and director Orson Welles revealed, nonchalantly, {{that he was the}} great-grandson of Gideon Welles, and had known a dinner party hostess Cornelia Gray Lunt from the American Civil War era <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> great-grandfather Gideon. This relation has, however, become a debunked myth, and this false tale possibly originated from that particular appearance on Cavett's show.|$|E

25|$|All Pullen's future {{recordings}} {{under his}} own name were for Blue Note. On 16 December 1988 {{he went into the}} studio with Gary Peacock (bass) and Tony Williams (drums) to make his first trio album New Beginnings, which astonished even those <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> work and became widely {{regarded as one of the}} finest trio albums ever recorded. He followed this in 1990 with another trio album, Random Thoughts, in somewhat lighter mood, this time with James Genus (bass) and Lewis Nash (drums).|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of Götterdämmerung proceeded without much difficulty, as Wagner was now thoroughly <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> musical material and his enlarged orchestra. There {{was a brief}} interruption over Christmas, but the work was resumed early {{in the new year}} (on 9 January 1870). The second complete draft – the orchestral draft – was begun just two days later and Wagner worked on both drafts together. It was not until 5 February 1871 that the completion of Siegfried allowed him the time to concentrate on Götterdämmerung.|$|E
25|$|Not long {{content with}} life in London, Fraser {{soon began to}} quit the mercantile counter {{as often as he}} could to watch the gardeners at work. He befriended William Forsyth who at that time had charge of the Apothecaries' Garden; through that {{acquaintance}} he would have become <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> predecessor Mark Catesby's travels, as some of Catesby's specimens from his travels were housed at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and Catesby's writings and engravings on the flora of the Americas were also published by the time Fraser moved to London.|$|E

25|$|In December 1960, as the Kennedy Administration took shape, Melby {{tried to}} have his {{security}} clearance restored, encouraged by the appointment of Dean Rusk, who was <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> State Department work, as the new Secretary of State. His longtime friend Averell Harriman was becoming ambassador-at-large. Robert F. Kennedy blocked their efforts. Appeals to State Department officials responsible for administrative matters failed, as did the advocacy of Pennsylvania Senator Joseph S. Clark, Jr. on Melby's behalf. HUAC maintained a list of persons it considered ineligible for government employment that overrode State Department views. Melby dropped these efforts in 1966, {{when he moved to}} Canada.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the second}} longest play in the canon after Hamlet and is the longest of the First Folio, whose version of Hamlet is shorter than its Quarto counterpart. The play is often abridged; for example, certain {{peripheral}} characters are removed entirely. In such instances, extra lines are often invented or added from elsewhere in the sequence to establish the nature of characters' relationships. A further reason for abridgment is that Shakespeare assumed that his audiences would be <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Henry VI plays and frequently made indirect references to events in them, such as Richard's murder of HenryVI or the defeat of Henry's queen, Margaret.|$|E

There {{he met his}} future wife, Jeanne Hoban – {{a member of the}} Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) whom he {{converted}} to Trotskyism – and Stan Newens, who was later to become a Labour & Co-op MP. They joined the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), in which they were associated with the group around Tony Cliff, the so-called 'State-Caps' after their characterisation of the USSR as 'State-Capitalist'. The group later became the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Through the group he got to know Max Shachtman,becoming <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> theory of 'bureaucratic revolution'. He was also familiar with Jock Haston and Ted Grant. Within the RCP he went by the Pseudonym 'Anil Kumaran'.|$|E

We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
25|$|Herb Stempel was a {{contestant}} on Twenty One who was {{coached by}} the show's producer Dan Enright. While Stempel {{was in the}} midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but Twenty One did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner Albert Freedman were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were looking for in Charles Van Doren. Van Doren was an English teacher at Columbia University when a friend suggested he try out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough. Enright, who produced both Tic-Tac-Dough and Twenty One, saw Van Doren's tryout and was <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> prestigious family background that included multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would be the perfect contestant to be the new face of Twenty One.|$|E
25|$|Owen's {{previous}} team beat Oklahoma {{twice in}} 1903 and 1904, so the Sooners were <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> ability. Owen's {{first two years}} at Oklahoma were spent between Norman and Arkansas City as Oklahoma {{did not have a}} big enough budget to keep him there all year. The early years of Owen's tenure were tough because of budget issues. Due to a low travel budget, his teams would regularly have to play as many as three games in one trek. For instance, in 1905, his squad played three teams in three Kansas cities in five days and again in 1909 when they played three games in Missouri and Texas in six days. In Owen's first year, 1905, he gave Oklahoma its first victory over rival Texas, defeating them 2–0. Owen's first dominant team came in 1908 when they went 8–1–1, losing only to the powerful Kansas team. His 1908 team used hand-offs directly to large runners as the forward pass was just becoming common. His 1911 team, on the other hand, had several small and fast players that the quarterback would pass directly to. That team went 8–0. Owen had two more undefeated seasons in 1915 and 1918. 1920 was also Oklahoma's first season in the stronger Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association. In the new conference, they went 6–0–1 tying only Kansas State. Owen retired after the 1926 season. During Owen's 22-year career at Oklahoma, he went 122–54–16, a 67.7%winning percentage. In 1951, he became the first person from Oklahoma to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in its inaugural year.|$|E

500|$|Moser's work on ectomycorrhiza, {{though perhaps}} unknown to many {{researchers}} <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> taxonomic work, was notable {{due to its}} focus on the fungal partners in the relationship. He engaged in {{a large amount of}} research on woodland in the transitional zone between subalpine and alpine habitats. His published results included the description of new taxa. In 1960, Singer referred to Moser as [...] "one of the pioneers of mycorrhiza research, both basic and applied".|$|E
500|$|Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns {{was always}} deeply {{aware of the}} great masters of the past. In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic DCParker wrote, [...] "That Saint-Saëns knows Rameau... Bach and Handel, Haydn and Mozart, must be {{manifest}} to all who are <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> writings.

500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> play No Trams to Lime Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, [...] "Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might've heard us speak, so I thought he {{did a very good}} script." [...] Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like [...] "a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room"; the character of Paul's grandfather refers to this in the dialogue. Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and studio work having become punishing.|$|E
500|$|Besides winning two of {{the most}} prestigious {{literary}} prizes in France (Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française and Prix Goncourt), Les Bienveillantes was generally very favourably reviewed in the French literary press. Le Figaro proclaimed Littell [...] "man of the year". The editor of the Nouvel Observateurs literary section called it [...] "a great book" [...] and the weekly Le Point stated that the novel has [...] "exploded onto the dreary plain of the literary autumn like a meteor." [...] Even though French filmmaker and professor Claude Lanzmann had mixed feelings about the book, he said: [...] "I am <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> subject, and above all I was astounded by the absolute accuracy of the novel. Everything is correct." [...] French historian Pierre Nora called it [...] "an extraordinary literary and historical phenomenon." [...] The book has been compared to War and Peace for its similar scope and ambition.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Takemitsu, {{accompanied}} by Iannis Xenakis, Betsy Jolas, and others, heard Balinese gamelan music in Bali. The experience influenced the composer on a largely philosophical and theological level. For those accompanying Takemitsu on the expedition (most {{of whom were}} French musicians), who [...] "... could not keep their composure as I did before this music: it was too foreign {{for them to be}} able to assess the resulting discrepancies with their logic", the experience was without precedent. For Takemitsu, however, by now quite <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> own native musical tradition, there was a relationship between [...] "the sounds of the gamelan, the tone of the kapachi, the unique scales and rhythms by which they are formed, and Japanese traditional music which had shaped such a large part of my sensitivity". In his solo piano work For Away (written for Roger Woodward in 1973), a single, complex line is distributed between the pianist's hands, which reflects the interlocking patterns between the metallophones of a gamelan orchestra.|$|E
50|$|The name Soviet {{was derived}} from Ruggiero's fondness for old Russian filmmakers such as Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Vertov who he became <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> in <b>his</b> film studies.
