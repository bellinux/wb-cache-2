5|$|Japan Airlines {{began the}} 1990s with flights to {{evacuate}} Japanese citizens from <b>Iraq</b> <b>before</b> {{the start of}} the Gulf War. In October 1990, Japan Air Charter was established, and, in September 1996, an agreement with The Walt Disney Company made Japan Airlines the official airline of Tokyo Disneyland. JAL Express was established in April 1997, with Boeing 737 aircraft. In the 1990s the airline encountered further economic difficulties stemming from recessions in the United States and United Kingdom, plus a domestic downturn. Following years of profit since 1986 the airline began to post operating losses in 1992. Cost-cutting, including the formation of the low-cost JAL Express domestic subsidiary and the transfer of tourist operations to JALways (the successor to Japan Air Charter), helped return the airline to profitability in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{headquarters}} {{itself has}} not seen a deployment, even though all subordinate units have been deployed for several support missions. The 96th CA Battalion deployed units {{in support of the}} Iraq War in mid-2007. The brigade also had troops deployed in support of special operations units in Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan. The brigade suffered several casualties in Iraq, including two soldiers killed by improvised explosive devices. One of these soldiers, a Major, prompted the State of California to fly its flags at half staff. It also suffered several casualties which were rehabilitated through the new Wounded Warrior Project. The 98th Civil Affairs Battalion also had soldiers deployed to <b>Iraq</b> <b>before</b> its activation in 2008. Soldiers of this battalion also saw deployments to Africa as well as other areas in support of the Global War on Terrorism.|$|E
5|$|In 706 or a {{few years}} later he was {{appointed}} as governor of Basra under the governor of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, and remained in the post until al-Hajjaj's replacement by Yazid ibn al-Muhallab in 715. Yazid in turn named al-Jarrah as his deputy for <b>Iraq,</b> <b>before</b> he himself left for Khurasan, and in 717, Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) appointed al-Jarraj as Yazid's successor in the governorship of Khurasan and Sistan. Al-Jarrah remained in Khurasan until March/April 719, when he was dismissed after 17 months in office due to complaints of his mistreatment of the native converts to Islam (mawali), who, despite their conversion, were still obliged to pay the poll-tax (jizya). He was replaced by his deputy, Abd al-Rahman ibn Nu'aym al-Ghamidi. The most notable event of his tenure {{was the beginning of the}} covert missionary activity (da'wah) by the agents of the Abbasids in Khurasan. After his return to Iraq, in 720, he seems to have fought alongside Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik in the suppression of the rebellion of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab.|$|E

5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern <b>Iraq</b> <b>before</b> the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E

25|$|Mesopotamia {{was a low}} {{priority}} area for the Ottomans, {{and they did not}} expect any major action in the region. Regiments of the XII and XIII Corps were maintained at low levels in peacetime. Lieutenant Colonel Süleyman Askerî Bey became the commander. He redeployed portions of the 38th Division at the mouth of Shatt-al-Arab. The rest of the defensive force was stationed at Basra. The Ottoman General Staff did not even possess a proper map of Mesopotamia. They tried to draw a map with the help of people who had worked in <b>Iraq</b> <b>before</b> the war, although this attempt failed. Enver Pasha bought two German maps scaled 1/1,500,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the 1930s saw Fogarty return to Great Britain, {{initially}} as the adjutant and qualified flying instructor on No. 601 (County of London) Squadron and then a short time later carrying out the same roles on No. 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron, which he was instrumental in establishing with the assistance of a warrant officer and 19 airmen. In 1935, he took up his first command appointment as the Officer Commanding No. 84 Squadron back in <b>Iraq</b> <b>before</b> returning to Great Britain in 1937 to serve on the air staff of the recently formed Bomber Command. The following year he was appointed Officer Commanding No. 37 (Bomber) Squadron at Feltwell in Norfolk.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{ordnance}} dropped on Iraqi positions by Coalition aircraft in 2001 and 2002 {{was less than}} in 1999 and 2000 which was during the Clinton administration.

However, information obtained by the UK Liberal Democrats showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq {{in the second half of}} 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6tons in September – before Congress' 11 October authorization of the invasion.|$|E

25|$|The 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers {{were one}} of the first two Indian cavalry regiments {{nominated}} for mechanisation. One squadron was equipped with the Vickers Medium Mark I tank and two squadrons with armoured cars. They were deployed on frontier duties but in April 1941, left for Iraq with the 10th Indian Division. They saw action against the Vichy French in Syria and also served in Persia and <b>Iraq</b> <b>before</b> joining the British Eighth Army in North Africa. In October 1942, they moved back to Persia and then to India. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the regiment moved to Java in the Dutch East Indies in support of the 5th and 23rd Indian Divisions, who were engaged in suppressing a revolt by the Indonesians. In August 1946 the regiment returned to Secunderabad and on Partition of India in August 1947, the 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers were allotted to the Pakistan Army.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Anatolia, {{where the}} Pontic and Anti-Taurus {{mountain}} ranges converge, is rugged country with higher elevations, a more severe climate, and greater precipitation than are {{found on the}} Anatolian Plateau. The {{western part of the}} Eastern Anatolia Region is known as the Anti-Taurus, where the average elevation of mountain peaks exceed 3,000 meters; while {{the eastern part of the}} region was historically known as the Armenian Highland and includes Mount Ararat, the highest point in Turkey at 5,137 meters. Many of the East Anatolian peaks apparently are recently extinct volcanoes, to judge from extensive green lava flows. Turkey's largest lake, Lake Van, is situated in the mountains at an elevation of 1,546 meters. The headwaters of three major rivers arise in the Anti-Taurus: the east-flowing Aras, which pours into the Caspian Sea; the south-flowing Euphrates; and the south-flowing Tigris, which eventually joins the Euphrates in <b>Iraq</b> <b>before</b> emptying into the Persian Gulf. Several small streams that empty into the Black Sea or landlocked Lake Van also originate in these mountains.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted {{as a method of}} bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar {{for the first time in}} the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and <b>Iraq</b> <b>before</b> these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.|$|E
