5|$|By 1799, the {{original}} house at Luscombe had been demolished, and work began {{on a new}} house for Hoare in 1800. The house was designed by John Nash, who was a pioneer for the Gothic Revival style. In his early drawings for the house, Repton suggested two sketches to Hoare; one of a more standard house, {{and the other with}} the more natural design which would settle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> The latter was chosen and the final design of the house was based upon Downton Castle, but with an asymmetrical plan to experience the panoramic views around the house. It was Nash's first attempt at a Gothic castle design and he would subsequently create several further houses in the same style.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E

25|$|These new fashions made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} life of the servant. From the 1760s Palladianism was slowly superseded by Neoclassicism. A defining feature of the Neoclassical house was the absence of the first floor piano nobile. This was in part due to the picturesque values then coming into vogue. During this—the era of Humphrey Repton's idyllic landscapes—it became desirable to step from any of the main rooms directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> It was also desirable for all four sides of a house to enjoy this luxury.|$|E
25|$|During the 1770s and 1780s Gainsborough {{developed}} {{a type of}} portrait in which he integrated the sitter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> A splendid {{example of this is}} his portrait of Frances Browne, Mrs John Douglas (1746-1811) which can be seen at Waddesdon Manor. The sitter has withdrawn to a secluded and overgrown corner of a garden to read a letter, her pose recalling the traditional representation of Melancholy. Gainsborough emphasised the relationship between Mrs Douglas and her environment by painting the clouds behind her and the drapery billowing across her lap with similar silvery mauves and fluid brushstrokes. This portrait was included in his first private exhibition at Schomberg House in 1784.|$|E
500|$|The Swimming Hole {{represented}} {{the full range}} of Eakins' techniques and academic principles. He used life study, photography, wax studies, and landscape sketches to produce a work that manifested his interest in the human form. Lloyd Goodrich (1897–1987) believed the work was [...] "Eakins' most masterful use of the nude", with the solidly conceived figures perfectly integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape,</b> an image of subtle tonal construction and one of the artist's [...] "richest pieces of painting". Another biographer, William Innes Homer (b.1929), was more reserved and described the poses of the figures as rigidly academic. Homer found inconsistencies in paint quality and atmospheric effect, and wrote that the painting was unsuccessful in reconciling antique and naturalistic ideals. For him, [...] "it is as though these nudes had been abruptly transplanted from the studio into nature".|$|E

500|$|The small Philadelphia {{panel is}} painted with oil on {{parchment}} (vellum); a reconstructed red vermilion border surrounds the image– it {{is similar to}} those seen in contemporary illuminated manuscripts. [...] It gives the illusion of the viewer looking through a window <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> The parchment measures the image measures [...] Underneath are five wood supports; the parchment is glued to one, and four smaller pieces, added at a later date, frame the image. The parchment is unusually thick and has a thin insoluble layer of primer. The wooden frames were primed in {{a thick layer of}} white, which overlaps the parchment in places. The borders were gilded at some time; technical analysis found particles of gold leaf on the lower border. The Turin panel is painted on two oak panels joined with a band of parchment or cloth, on a ground of chalk and animal glue.|$|E
500|$|Miralles {{sought to}} design a {{parliament}} building that could represent and present a national identity. This intractably difficult question was tackled by displacing the question of identity <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> of Scotland. In a characteristically poetic approach he talked about slotting the building into the land [...] "in {{the form of a}} gathering situation: an amphitheatre, coming out from Arthur's Seat." [...] where the building would reflect a dialogue between the landscape and the act of people sitting. So an early goal of the design was to open the building and its public spaces, not just to Edinburgh but to a more general concept of the Scottish landscape. Miralles intended to use the parliament to help build the end of Canongate—"not just another building on the street...it should reinforce the existing qualities of the site and its surroundings. In a subtle game of cross views and political implications." ...|$|E
500|$|The mixed public {{reaction}} {{contrasts sharply with}} the response from architectural critics. Its rampant complexity, iconography and layering of meaning and metaphor are widely regarded as producing a building which is [...] "quite a meal". This prompted Catherine Slessor, writing in the Architectural Review, to describe it as [...] "A Celtic-Spanish cocktail to blow both minds and budgets, it doesn't play safe, energetically mining a new seam of National Romanticism refined and reinterpreted for the twenty-first century." [...] Jencks attempted to dampen criticism of the cost overruns by questioning how 'value for money' might be judged. For him, the building {{is not just a}} functional or economic enterprise, it is an exploration of national identity and in comparing it to other comparable assemblies, not least the Palace of Westminster, he argues the cost is comparable. The conception of the building has been singled out for praise, particularly in the way it re-establishes Scotland's traditional focus towards mainland Europe and its values by means of the layout of the non-adversarial debating chamber and the creation of the public spaces in front of the building, [...] "where people can meet and express themselves as a force". In an era of the Bilbao effect and the iconic building, Jencks is impressed that rather than being a monumental building, as is usual for capital landmarks, the building creates a complex union of nature and culture that nestles itself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b>|$|E

500|$|The main {{defensive}} {{structure is}} a revetted lunette shaped earthwork. It has a [...] thick rampart with [...] {{of concrete and}} [...] of brick forming a retaining wall for the earth fill. The rampart is covered by natural vegetation and, in both the 19th and 21st century operation, is closed to access to preserve this. The glacis gives extra protection to the fort and was designed to blend the fort <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> It surrounded the fort on the north, south and seaward sides and was made by forming the surrounding sandhills. The side facing the fort—the scarp—is steep and, with the front face of the rampart, forms a [...] wide ditch that can be raked by rifle fire from the caponier or the stockade's sides. The outer face is a gentle slope and {{is designed to be}} covered by case shot fired from the fort's 64-pounder guns. The southern glacis section was removed during sand mining and construction of the caravan park, both after World War II. The western glacis is changed, but still visible, and the northern glacis was recreated in 1993—showcasing the purpose of the glacis and the function of the caponier. Access to the fort is via double gates at the fort's rear, one each through the stockade and the rear defence wall. Both gates were removed or destroyed over time and the 21st century gates are reconstructions. The formal parade ground or manning parade lies between the rear walls and barracks, and the raised terreplein. It was formerly used for drill training, assembly and formal parades. First gravelled when constructed, it was paved with tar in the 1890s to solve drainage problems. Around the seaward side of the manning parade runs the terreplein. It is a raised crescent shaped level on which the guns platforms sit, and is ascended from the manning parade by ramps and stairs.|$|E
