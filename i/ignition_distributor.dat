The displacement went from 3.3 L to 3.5 L. The timing belt was replaced with a timing chain and the <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor</b> was replaced with an individual coil ignition system.|$|E
50|$|It uses 2 {{ignition}} coils and no <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor.</b> Cylinders are fired in pairs (dual fire) - 1 and 4 together, and 2 and 3 together. The {{crankshaft position sensor}} is sensing the movement of two radially opposed position plates on the flywheel, {{one of which is}} magnetized, and the other is not. Thus, the engine management has precise information which group of cylinders to fire, and which group of injectors to spray.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s Oakland Motor Car {{engineers}} designed an all {{new engine}} for their [...] "companion" [...] make, the Pontiac that {{was introduced in}} 1926. It was a side-valve design with a one piece cast iron block with three main bearings. An unusual feature was that it had two separate cylinder heads that each covered three cylinders.

50|$|The {{appearance}} of the B16 was not unlike its predecessor, the B14. The block and cylinder heads bore no particular difference at a glance. The B16B sported twin SU HS4 carbs, notably larger than the B14A's HS2 carbs. Also, the remote oil filter attached next to the water pump on the <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor</b> side of the engine on the B14 had been relocated to a housing under the intake and exhaust manifold side on the B16. The exhaust manifold which dumped centrally on the B14 now was made to exit towards {{the rear of the}} B16 manifold.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{the model}} range was {{extended}} {{with the new}} Executive level, which featured a distinctive chromed grille and borrowed elements from the GLX, such as 14-inch wheels, bigger 256 mm ventilated disk brakes and the double overhead camshaft engine with 16 valves, that offered an increased power output. The Executive also received an electronic <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor</b> from the Lanos. Another addition to the 2000 model was the catalytic converter respecting Euro 2 emission standards. In 2004, because of harsher emission regulations, the factory installed the Lanos 1.5 SOHC engine, which meant a decrease in horsepower, but made the car Euro 3 compliant. During the last 2 years of production, {{in an effort to}} update the optional equipment available for the car, the Executive received a CD player instead of the obsolete cassette player. It remained in production until 2007, being marketed along with its successor, the Daewoo Nubira.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} in the North American market, {{emission}} control regulations were reducing engine {{performance at the}} same time as safety regulations were making cars heavier. An increase in performance was required for the G-engine, so a 2-barrel setup was released for the 1976 model year. This was not the same as the export 2-barrel package; the intake manifold used a throttle-bored plenum rather than an open one, and had provisions for an EGR valve. The carburetor, a Carter BBD similar but not identical to the one used on Chrysler's 318 V8 engine, used a standard Chrysler-style remote automatic choke. A -inch exhaust headpipe was also provided, as well as 2-barrel-specific advance curves in the <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor.</b> This package, called [...] "Super Six" [...] by the marketing division, brought rated horsepower from [...] and torque from 170 to 180 lbft Nm, while improving throttle response and driveability thus maintaining compliance with emission laws.|$|E
50|$|A {{distributor}} is {{an enclosed}} rotating shaft used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines that have mechanically-timed <b>ignition.</b> The <b>distributor's</b> main {{function is to}} route secondary, or high voltage, current from the ignition coil to the spark plugs in the correct firing order, and for the correct amount of time.

5000|$|Tucker {{initially}} {{tried to}} develop an innovative engine, with help from Ben Parsons, then owner {{and president of the}} Fuelcharger Corporation, and would later be Tucker's VP of engineering. It was a [...] flat-6 cylinder with hemispherical combustion chambers, fuel injection, and overhead valves operated by oil pressure rather than a camshaft. An oil pressure distributor was mounted in line with the <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor</b> and delivered appropriately timed direct oil pressure to open each valve at proper intervals. The oil pressure fed to each valve was [...] "timed" [...] by intake and exhaust eccentrics and measured by spring-loaded plungers. It had large pistons built of aluminum and magnesium castings with steel-plated cylinder linings. This unique engine was designed to idle at 100 rpm and cruise at 250-1200 rpm through the use of direct-drive torque converters on each driving wheel instead of a transmission. It was designed to produce almost 1 and [...] of torque at only 1800 RPM. When cruising at 60 mph, it would only turn at approximately 1000 rpm. [...] These features would have been auto industry firsts in 1948, but as engine development proceeded, problems appeared. Six prototypes of the 589 engine were built, but it was installed only in the test chassis and the first prototype.|$|E

50|$|Performance {{modifications}} {{started with}} an upgraded engine, which was enhanced by Lotus {{from the standard}} Opel 2969 cc 24v straight six unit (used in the GSi). The engine was enlarged to a capacity of 3615 cc. Lotus then added twin Garrett T25 turbochargers, which provide up to 0.7 bar of boost from about 1500 rpm. The original <b>distributor</b> <b>ignition</b> system of the engine was replaced with a three-coil wasted spark system. The distributor drive was re-purposed as a water pump drive for the water-air intercooler circuit. The intercooler itself is manufactured by Behr and is capable of reducing {{the temperature of the}} compressed charge from 120 °C to 60 °C.|$|R
5000|$|High tension leads or {{high tension}} cables or spark plug wires or spark plug cables are the wires that connect a <b>distributor,</b> <b>ignition</b> coil, or magneto {{to each of}} the spark plugs in some types of {{internal}} combustion engine. [...] "High tension lead" [...] or [...] "cable" [...] is also used for any electrical cable carrying a high voltage in any context. Tension in this instance is a synonym for voltage. High tension leads, like many engine components, wear out over time. Each lead contains only one wire, as the current does not return through the same lead, but through the earthed/grounded engine which is connected to the opposite battery terminal (negative terminal on modern engines) high tension may also be referred to as HT.|$|R
50|$|Technically speaking, the 1996 to 1998 US {{models with}} 4.0-litre engines {{had the same}} {{displacement}} as the 3.9-litre engines fitted to the earlier 1994 to 1995 US models; {{the differences between the}} engines involved improvements to the block rigidity and pistons, and a change from the Lucas 14CUX engine management to the distributor-less Generic Engine Management System ("GEMS"). In earlier 3.9-litre US engines the fuel injection computer (14CUX) did not control the ignition, which was instead controlled by a traditional system with an <b>ignition</b> coil and <b>distributor</b> made by Lucas. The GEMS system was developed jointly by Lucas and SAGEM; it controlled both spark timing and fuel injection. Unlike the earlier systems fitted to Rover V8 engines, GEMS was made OBD-II compliant. This change was largely driven by the federal requirement (starting in 1996) for vehicles sold in the United States to meet the OBD-II specification.|$|R
5000|$|Any {{condition}} that causes abnormally {{high levels of}} unburned hydrocarbons—raw or partially burnt fuel—to reach the converter will tend to significantly elevate its temperature, bringing {{the risk of a}} meltdown of the substrate and resultant catalytic deactivation and severe exhaust restriction. Usually the ignition system e.g. coil packs and/or primary <b>ignition</b> components (e.g. <b>distributor</b> cap, wires, <b>ignition</b> coil and spark plugs) and/or damaged fuel system components (fuel injectors, fuel pressure regulator, and associated sensors) could damage a catalytic converter - this also includes using a thicker oil viscosity not recommended by the manufacturer (especially with ZDDP content), oil and/or coolant leaks. Vehicles equipped with OBD-II diagnostic systems are designed to alert the driver to a misfire condition by means of illuminating the [...] "check engine" [...] light on the dashboard, or flashing it if the current misfire conditions are severe enough to potentially damage the catalytic converter.|$|R
50|$|One {{reason that}} {{ineffective}} fuel saving gadgets are popular is {{the difficulty of}} accurately measuring small changes in the fuel economy of a vehicle. This {{is because of the}} high level of variance in the fuel consumption of a vehicle under normal driving conditions. Due to selective perception and confirmation bias, the buyer of a device can perceive an improvement where none actually exists. Also, observer-expectancy effect can result in a user subconsciously altering driving habits. For these reasons, regulatory bodies have developed standardized drive cycles for consistent, accurate testing of vehicle fuel consumption. Where fuel economy does improve after the fitment of a device, it is usually due to the tune-up procedure that is conducted as part of the installation. In older systems with <b>distributor</b> <b>ignitions,</b> device manufacturers would specify timing advance beyond that recommended by the manufacturer, which by itself could boost fuel economy while potentially increasing emissions of some combustion products, at the risk of possible engine damage.|$|R
50|$|The 12-valve (2 valves per cylinder) DOHC 5M-GE is {{familiar}} as {{the engine of}} the Toyota Supra and Toyota Cressida of the 1980s. It was quite different from any previous member of the M family, with Bosch L Jetronic-derived electronic fuel injection (using an AFM intake measuring scheme), wide-angle valves, and belt-driven dual camshafts. It used hydraulic valve lifters, a first for Toyota. The use of rocker arms and valve lash adjusters eliminated the need for valve clearance maintenance, a world first for any twin cam engine. This version of the M made its US debut in 1982's Toyota Celica Supra MK2. The 1982 version had a vacuum-advance distributor, whereas the 1983-1988 versions found in the Celica Supra and Cressida had full electronic control of the <b>ignition</b> system and <b>distributor.</b> The newer engine control system found in these later cars was named TCCS, or Toyota Computer Control System and, together with different intake runners, increased max power by 5 PS from August 1983.|$|R
5000|$|Ford Motor Company {{invested}} $12 {{million in}} tooling to finance Ferguson's new distribution company.

It was officially called a [...] "Ford tractor with the Ferguson system", although the name Ford-Ferguson was widely used. It sold for $585 including rubber tires, power take-off, Ferguson hydraulics, an electric starter, generator, and battery; lights were optional. Ford's 9N further improved the cantankerous Model F by updating the <b>ignition</b> with a <b>distributor</b> and coil. An innovative system of tire mounts for the rear wheels and versatile axle mounts for the fronts enabled farmers to accommodate any width row-crop work they needed. The 9N weighed 2340 pounds and had 13 drawbar horsepower, which could pull a two-bottom plow. It was designed to be safe, quiet and easy to operate. Ford once said [...] "Our competition is the horse."; the 9N was intended for farmers who were not mechanically minded.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice in}} HEI system type is vitally {{important}} based on the engine {{it will be used}} with. Each GM division had its own engine design. Thus, a Chevrolet ignition may not be identical to an Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, or Cadillac engine. Typically, the ignition system compatibility followed the engine size. Most GM engines (of the same size) between 1974 and 1988 used a similar <b>distributor</b> <b>ignition</b> system. The module type is important as well. For non-computer controlled carburetor engines, the 4-pin unit is used since it uses mechanical timing controls (vacuum and centrifugal advance). The 5-pin module is like the 4-pin, with an added knock/detonation sensor input to the module so the ignition could be deliberately retarded and the power output dropped to the spark plug to aid disruption of the knock condition. The 7-pin module is designed for computer timing controls. It incorporates 2 magnetic signals from the pickup sensor, and 3 signals shared with the ECM engine control module), while the remaining 2 pins provide signal and power to the coil. Normally the 7 pin is not used on non-computerized engines since it does not contain mechanical timing controls, but some early designs used a seven-pin distributor module in conjunction with mechanical and vacuum advance in the distributor body, so the seven-pin module would be backward compatible.|$|R

50|$|It was the SCR, Silicon-controlled {{rectifier}} or thyristor {{invented in}} the late 1950s that replaced the troublesome thyratron, and {{paved the way for}} a reliable solid-state CD ignition. This was thanks to Bill Gutzwiller and his team at General Electric. The SCR was rugged with an indefinite lifetime, but very prone to unwanted trigger impulses which would turn the SCR 'on'. Unwanted trigger impulses in early attempts at using SCRs for CD ignitions were caused by electrical interference, but the main culprit proved to be 'points bounce'. Points bounce is a feature of a points-triggered system. In the standard system with points, <b>distributor,</b> <b>ignition</b> coil, ignition (Kettering system) points bounce prevents the coil from saturating fully as RPM increases resulting in a weak spark, thus limiting high speed potential. In a CD ignition, at least those early attempts, the points bounce created unwanted trigger pulses to the SCR (thyristor) that resulted in a series of weak, untimed sparks that caused extreme misfiring. There were two possible solutions to the problem. The first would be to develop another means of triggering the discharge of the capacitor to one discharge per power stroke by replacing the points with something else. This could be done magnetically or optically, but that would necessitate more electronics and an expensive distributor. The other option was to keep the points, as they were already in use and reliable, {{and find a way to}} overcome the 'points bounce' problem. This was accomplished in April 1962 by a Canadian, RCAF officer F.L. Winterburn working in his basement in Ottawa, Ontario. The design used an inexpensive method that would only recognize the first opening of the points and ignore subsequent openings when the points bounced.|$|R
