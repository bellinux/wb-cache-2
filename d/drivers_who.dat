5|$|Reactions from bobsledders {{about the}} track during the two-man event varied from {{exciting}} to anxious to dangerous. The Associated Press spoke to 13 of the 21 <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> competed at the two-woman event on 23–24 February 2010 {{and the only}} one who did not feel safe on the track was Erin Pac of the United States.

5|$|In 2006, Schiff {{sponsored}} eliminating {{a cap on}} taxi licenses in Minneapolis.

5|$|The top 35 {{drivers were}} {{assigned}} to Gatorade Duel races based upon their qualifying positions in the Daytona 500. <b>Drivers</b> <b>who</b> qualified in odd-number positions competed in the first Duel along with {{the winner of the}} 2012 Daytona 500 pole. Competitors who qualified in even-numbered places took part in the second Duel. The drivers' finishing positions in both Duels determined their starting positions in the Daytona 500. Positions 40 to 42 were filled with the quickest <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> did not qualify in the top 35. 43rd place was occupied by an eligible past champion. In the event a past champion was not available, the 43rd position would be filled by the next-fastest driver. Two drivers outside the top 35 were eligible for two transfer spots in each Duel which allowed them to qualify for the Daytona 500.|$|E

5|$|After initial resistance, Gibbs also {{successfully}} pushed {{legislation in}} 2007 to increase penalties for truck <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> fail {{to comply with}} Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move designed to improve accessibility and safety on I-70, which bisected Gibbs' house district.

Gibbs was named to the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee {{at the end of the}} 2007 regular session.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} {{race of the}} season in Melbourne, Webber {{qualified}} in 7th place and held that position for {{the early part of the}} race, managing to finish in 13th position after the RB3 suffered from a throttle-related malfunction and a jammed fuel flap. At the , he again out-qualified his more experienced teammate Coulthard and finished tenth, which was encouraging for the team in such a new and radical car. Bahrain was also going well for both <b>drivers,</b> <b>who</b> were running in sixth and seventh positions, until both cars retired due to mechanical malfunctions. Webber again was hampered by the aforementioned jammed fuel flap, radically affecting the aerodynamic drag, a vital set-up consideration for the Sakhir circuit.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E
5000|$|Tom {{goes on a}} {{trial run}} with Ed, the mechanic, who is {{impressed}} with his driving skill but appears noncommittal. Cartley hires him. Tom is accepted by all the other drivers except Red (Patrick McGoohan), an Irish foreman and head <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> is a violent bully. Tom befriends Gino (Herbert Lom), an Italian <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> {{is in love with}} Lucy. Red offers a £250 gold cigarette case to any <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> can make more runs than he does in a day, and Tom is determined to try.|$|R
50|$|First or worst—if both drivers {{commit a}} foul, the <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> commits the foul first loses, {{unless it is}} two {{separate}} fouls, where the loser is the <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> committed the worse foul (lane violation is worse than foul start, and failure {{to participate in a}} post-run inspection is worst).|$|R

5|$|Film badges used {{to measure}} {{exposure}} to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 {{had been exposed to}} more than 0.1 roentgens, but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank <b>drivers,</b> <b>who</b> made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> had reached Formula One often {{continued}} {{to compete in}} Formula Two. In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a Honda engine acting as a stressed component. The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races {{in the hands of}} the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were entered by MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their Formula One engine supplier.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch was quickest in the rain-delayed third {{practice}} with 44.943seconds, followed by Greg Biffle, Earnhardt, Johnson, and Juan Pablo Montoya. Earnhardt and Truex collided {{and hit the}} wall, both needing to use their back-up cars which meant Earnhardt forfeited pole position. Kasey Kahne led fourth {{practice with}} 44.985seconds, only one-thousandth of a second faster than Joey Logano. Gordon was third ahead of David Ragan and Kyle Busch. Kurt Busch and Burton were {{the winners of the}} Gatorade Duels. The qualifying grid was finalized with Busch in third and Burton fourth. Regan Smith qualified fifth ahead of Bowyer, Kevin Harvick, Waltrip, Matt Kenseth, and Kyle Busch. <b>Drivers</b> <b>who</b> failed to qualify were 1990 winner Derrike Cope, Kevin Conway, Todd Bodine, Michael McDowell and Casey Mears.|$|E

5|$|That night, two U.S. Army heavy {{equipment}} transporters entered {{the city of}} Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by Iraqi troops. Although one truck managed {{to turn around and}} escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Kuwaiti AMX-30, with its dead crew. That same night, a U.S. Air Force AC-130 was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.|$|E
5|$|The circuit {{passed its}} final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his satisfaction that the circuit {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. The circuit attracted some criticism from <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on the circuit. Following problems with loose kerbs in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the kerbs were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the white line denoting the entry lane to allow drivers more time to react to cars entering the pit.|$|E

Between 1943 and 1944 she served as press assistant at Jerusalem's Public Information office, and then moved to the same position at the British Council office in Jerusalem. Manning continued to work on her book about Stanley and Emin Pasha, and took advantage of army <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> were willing to give lifts to civilians; she visited Palestine, Petra and Damascus, gathering material for future works.|$|E
