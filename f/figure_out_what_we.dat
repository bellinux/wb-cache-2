[...] Guitarist Stone Gossard added that despite the bandmembers thinking that after the productive sessions the album was nearing completion, eventually they considered the tracks [...] "didn’t feel strong enough for a record. Work on the album resumed only in March 2013 as the bandmembers regrouped with new compositions, mostly done separatedly in each member's home studio—though McCready at times worked along with drummer Matt Cameron—before the group reunited to finish the songs together. O'Brien attributed the long break to the band's busy schedule, as the musicians got into side projects after putting the Pearl Jam album on hold: singer Eddie Vedder started a solo tour, drummer Matt Cameron returned to Soundgarden, guitarist Stone Gossard rejoined side project Brad, Ament recorded solo album While My Heart Beats and started the project RNDM, and McCready formed the group Walking Papers while also taking part in a partial reunion of Mad Season. Vedder still considered that all the diversions helped Pearl Jam to have [...] "more importance placed on the records" [...] and focusing on making the best album possible. Like with previous records the songs had their first recordings with all the musicians playing together, though O'Brien added that with Lightning Bolt [...] "we don’t keep as much of [...] as we used to." [...] Guest musicians include O'Brien himself at the keyboards, long time keyboardist Boom Gaspar, and violinist Ann Marie Calhoun. After six weeks of new recording sessions, the album was mixed in Seattle at the band's desire, with the process taking place in Studio X.|$|E

For Vices & Virtues, Urie had [...] "to step up and take the reins lyrically," [...] which he regarded as having not much experience in prior. The biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out, instead of locking themselves in and writing. Urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward, as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling. Urie explained [...] "We were so self-conscious about everything, hyper-aware of what we’re doing, that when we’re writing I go, [...] "Okay, I don’t {{want this to be}} Barry Manilow’s [...] "Mandy", but I want it to be as romantic and cute ...’ There’s a lot of that fighting within yourself.

[...] The lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of Ross and Walker. The sessions with Feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds. [...] "We really loved Paul Simon and got into using marimbas and string instruments," [...] explains Urie. [...] "We ended up buying some synths and messing around with them.

[...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was, just kind of went from there."

40|$|Many, if {{not most}} of our highly prized “laws” of physics cannot be {{adequately}} rendered as statements of regular association among the values of “occurrent” quantities, I have argued. 1 This is true {{even if we do}} not balk at the concept of natural necessity and are willing to add that the associations hold “by law”. They are rather ascriptions of capacities. They tell us what capacities a system will have by virtue of having a given property. The law of gravity is one example. A system of mass M has the capacity of strength GMm/r 2 to move another object of mass m a distance r away towards itself. I shall call this the gravitational capacity. My second thesis is a commonly shared one. Ascriptions of capacities do not reduce to conditionals involving only categorical properties.

The definition of writ-ing to learn that we use at MEC helped me come up with the idea that served as the basic principle for my further experi-ments and conclusions as I implemented writing to learn in math-ematics. Our definition of WAC @ MEC is this: We define writing across the curriculum as a means to connect writing to learning in all content areas. We define writing as the process through which students think on paper, explore ideas, raise questions, attempt solutions, uncover processes, build and defend argu-ments, brainstorm, introspect, and <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what’s</b> going on. <b>We</b> define all of these as thinking. Writing to learn across the curriculum provides a potent way for students to exercise their own voices as well as to take on new voices which represent their knowledge of the content and the language of the discipline they are learning (Lester, et. al, 2000, p. 4). The words that I have underlined gave me the idea of what the concept of writing to learn in mathematics should be–learn-ing the new language of the new discipline...|$|R
5000|$|The {{producer}} {{is known}} for his particular recording techniques and prefers laying down the rhythm section of guitar and drums first, as opposed to the usual method of drums and bass guitar. Avron has noted, [...] "Over the years I've had issues with recording bass first, especially when someone is hitting the strings really hard. For me it's difficult to tell whether the bass is in tune, because the fundamental is so low. When laying the rhythm guitars down first, it's much easier to tell whether the bass is out of tune or not. It also means that the bass has a place to fit." [...] Indeed, Jordan Pundik reflected on the recording process by stating, [...] "It was pretty smooth, we kind of go in there and do the drums first, which takes a couple of days. Then you do the guitars before I lay down vocals. It's kind of like this factory. It's not like before when we were trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> guitar sound <b>we</b> wanted, now we've established how we want to sound and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want to do." [...] The band revealed that Avron suggested [...] "simplifying" [...] some of the songs whilst recording. According to guitarist Steve Klein, certain songs had [...] "crazy guitars", but Avron pushed the band to [...] "make the melodies and vocals stand out, to enforce the lyrical themes." [...] Gilbert had the idea to use his backing vocals more prominently on the record, hoping to add some extra dynamics to a songs chorus. He noted that Rancid's Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen were an influence on this decision. Towards the end of recording, the band invited Bethany Cosentino of indie rock band Best Coast to provide backing vocals on a track later confirmed to be titled [...] "Caught in the Act". Cosentino is a fan of the band, and became friends through Twitter. Gilbert explained that the song is the [...] "slowest" [...] on the record, despite each being [...] "upbeat", and somehow [...] "called for a female backing vocal".
