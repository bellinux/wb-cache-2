5|$|In 1930, the {{congregation}} became divided over the need <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> community {{to hire a}} shochet to ritually slaughter animals for kosher meat, and over whether the synagogue should hire a Reform or Conservative rabbi.

The modern definition of the region follows the boundaries of that entity, which were fixed in the North and East in 1920-23 by the British Mandate for Palestine (including the Transjordan memorandum) and the Paulet–Newcombe Agreement, and on the South by following the 1906 Turco-Egyptian boundary agreement.|$|E

5|$|Elie Wiesel {{was born}} on 30 September 1928 in Sighet, a town in the Carpathian {{mountains}} of northern Transylvania, to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, née Feig. The family lived {{in a community of}} 10,000–20,000 mostly Orthodox Jews. Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were already in place, but the period Wiesel discusses {{at the beginning of the}} book, 1941–1943, was a relatively calm one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> population.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E

5|$|On 7 July 2014, Palestinians {{tried to}} burn down Joseph's tomb while protesting.

On December 22, 2014, Jews who were visiting the tomb to light candles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> holiday of Hanukkah discovered that the site had been vandalized. Lights were broken and electrical wiring had been cut. It was the first time Jews were allowed to visit the tomb in over a month.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} battle for the Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he would be forced to attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, the battle <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrew {{alphabet}} is, {{like the}} Persian alphabet, an abjad. It is used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Bukhori dialect primarily in Samarkand and Bukhara. Additionally, since 1940, when Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia, {{the use of}} the Hebrew Alphabet outside Hebrew liturgy fell into disuse and Bukharian Jewish publications such as books and newspapers began to appear using the Tajik Cyrillic Alphabet. Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian and went to Tajik or Russian schools in Central Asia only know the Tajik Cyrillic Alphabet when reading and writing Bukharian and Tajik.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, Egypt, {{which had}} been {{declared}} a British protectorate at {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954. British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted in joining the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, {{which had been}} incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 1) was the Wohnlager {{administrative}} and residential compound; it had a telephone line. The main road within the camp was paved and named Seidel Straße after Unterscharführer Kurt Seidel, the SS corporal who supervised its construction. A few side roads were lined with gravel. The main gate for road traffic was erected on the north side. Barracks were built with supplies delivered from Warsaw, Sokołów Podlaski, and Kosów Lacki. There was a kitchen, a bakery, and dining rooms; all were equipped with high-quality items taken from Jewish ghettos. The Germans and Ukrainians each had their own sleeping quarters, positioned at an angle for better control of all entrances. There were also two barracks behind an inner fence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> work commandos. SS-Untersturmführer Kurt Franz set up a small zoo in the centre next to his horse stables, with two foxes, two peacocks and a roe deer (brought in 1943). Smaller rooms were built as laundry, tailors, and cobblers, and for woodworking and medical aid. Closest to the SS quarters were separate barracks for the Polish and Ukrainian serving, cleaning and kitchen women.|$|E
