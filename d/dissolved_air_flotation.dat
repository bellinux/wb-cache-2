40|$|In {{this study}} {{the removal of}} various (DyStar and CIBA) {{reactive}} dyestuffs (red - blue - yellow) and their trichromatic mixtures was examined by flotation techniques. The scope of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of dispersed - <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> (DispAF), <b>dissolved</b> - <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> (DAF) and electroflotation (EF), {{in the treatment of}} simulated aqueous solutions and, consequently, of real industrial textile effluents, originating either from the dyeing reactor or from the equalization tank of a dye-house, bearing the same dyes as the simulated effluents. The main objectives were to characterize the experimental parameters affecting the three flotation processes, such as: the concentration and sort of dye (single dye solution, trichromatic mixture, real effluent), the concentration of added surfactants (CTAB, SDS), polyelectrolyte (Neoflock, PE) and flocculant (Zetag 87), the presence of electrolyte (NaCl) in the solution, the tension of the direct electric current (applied in electroflotation). To meet the demands of conservation of resources and sustainable development, this study was followed up by dyeing experiments and ultrasonic irradiation in order to investigate the possibility of water reuse and dyestuff degradation, respectively. The results of this study show that flotation seems to be an effective process for the removal of coloring matter from simulated effluents and textile industry effluents. Treated water could be totally reused in textile dyeing, if a small amount of supplement dye is used. The presence of collector in the effluent, in small quantities, favors the destruction of coloring matter. ...|$|R

Local Government requires that fish processors remove total suspended solids (TSS), fats, oil and grease (FOGs) and colloidal materials almost completely {{in order to allow}} for efficient disinfection. The OCS plant had only a limited amount of space. Clean Water Technology, Inc. (CWT) and OCS teams designed the system with an underground equalization tank, 1 / 8 inch rotating drum screens, flocculation flotation (GEM System) and chlorination dechlorination. Hybrid centrifugal <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> flocculation <b>flotation</b> (the GEM System), is the key component of the wastewater treatment plant. The GEM System built to treat 500 GPM of wastewater required only an 8 16 area. The System has operated since 2004.

The produced sludge after overnight drainage contains over 15 % of solids. Novel ultrahigh molecular weight polyacrylamide flocculants used in the process enabled TSS and FOG removal even at high salinity.

40|$|The {{injection}} {{water for}} the Nelson Project {{is a combination of}} produced and make-up water, typical of many Eastern Kansas operations. The make-up water is a low-salinity salt water from the Arbuckle Formation and contains dissolved minerals and sulfides. The produced water contains suspended oil, suspended clay and silt particles, along with a combination of other dissolved minerals. The combination of the two waters causes several undesirable reactions. The suspended solids load contained in the combined waters would plug a 75 -micron plant bag filter within one day. Wellhead filters of 75 -micron size were also being used on the injection wells. The poor water quality resulted in severe loss of injectivity and frequent wellbore cleaning of the injection wells. Various mechanical and graded-bed filtration methods were considered for cleaning the water. These methods were rejected {{due to the lack of}} field equipment and service availability.

The device measures the <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> content through an in situ, real-time process that requires no additional offline laboratory processing time. The method utilizes an instrument that measures the partial pressure of oxygen in the hydraulic fluid. By using a standardized calculation procedure that relates the oxygen partial pressure to the volume of <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> in solution, the <b>dissolved</b> <b>air</b> content is estimated. The technique employs luminescent quenching technology to determine the partial pressure of oxygen in the hydraulic fluid. An estimated Henry s law coefficient for oxygen and nitrogen in hydraulic fluid is calculated using a standard method to estimate the solubility of gases in lubricants. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the hydraulic fluid is estimated using the Henry s solubility coefficient and the measured partial pressure of oxygen in solution. The amount of dissolved nitrogen that is in solution is estimated by assuming that the ratio of dissolved nitrogen to dissolved oxygen is equal to the ratio of the gas solubility of nitrogen to oxygen at atmospheric pressure and temperature. The technique was performed at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The technique could be theoretically carried out at higher pressures and elevated temperatures...|$|R
