2500|$|Originally, the {{annulment}} of vows {{was performed}} on Rosh Hashana, the New Year, ten days before Yom Kippur. The Talmud (Nedarim 23b) says, [...] "Who wished to cancel his vows of a whole year should arise on Rosh Hashanah and announce, 'All vows that I will pledge {{in the coming year}} shall be annulled.'" [...] There is, in fact, a ritual for this that is supposed to take place the day before Rosh Hashana (because one does not do such chores on a holy day), known as Hatarat nedarim (Annulment of vows), wherein the individual presents himself before a tribunal of three and recites a Hebrew formula, very different from that of Kol Nidrei, asking for annulment of every vow or pledge or prohibition that he swore [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> or dreaming", [...] "whether they were matters relating to money, or to the body, or to the soul".... And the tribunal responds by reciting three times, [...] "May everything be permitted you, may everything be forgiven you, may everything be allowed you. There does not exist any vow, oath, ... or curse. But there does exist pardon, forgiveness, and atonement." [...] And the individual then concludes with a brief statement that [...] "I cancel from this time onward all vows and all oaths ... that I will accept upon myself, whether while awake or in a dream .... from this moment I preemptively regret them and declare of all of them they shall be utterly null and void...." ...|$|E

60|$|Early on the {{following}} morning, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awoke</b> by Talcott's giving me a hearty shake of the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awoke</b> {{next morning}} by John's {{appearing}} at my bedside, after having opened the shutter of my window.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, {{and very}} early in the morning, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awaked</b> by Uncle Beamish, who stood at my side.|$|R
60|$|When I {{heard those}} words I had to rub {{my eyes to}} make sure that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake.</b>|$|E
60|$|Morning broke {{dull and}} grey, but calm, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> early {{and had the}} boat in readiness.|$|E
6000|$|V. While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> I {{knew what}} you meant by [...] "spirit," [...] but now it seems only a word--such for {{instance}} as truth, beauty--a quality, I mean.|$|E
60|$|However--the Prosody and Serpent lectures {{are just}} {{finishing}} {{off and then}} I shall come {{to see you in}} the morning! while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>awake.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I was asleep, and {{she took}} unfair {{advantage}} of me," [...] answered the bird sadly. [...] "Had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>awake,</b> <b>I</b> could easily have protected myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Myles, in {{an almost}} breathless voice, [...] "I know not how to believe all these things, or whether <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>awake</b> or a-dreaming." ...|$|R
60|$|I began badly. The {{clock in}} the hall struck the quarter past the hour, the half-past, the three-quarters past, the new hour. Time was awake--and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> with Time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve had a {{very hard}} day’s work," [...] said the other, defensively, as he {{struggled}} into a sitting posture—"very hard. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> half the night with the toothache." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What his lordship saw and heard, Mr. Quatermain, neither more nor less. Except that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> {{having had}} one of my bad dreams about snakes, and saw her come through the door." ...|$|E
60|$|V. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>awake</b> <b>I</b> {{should like}} to die, {{but now it is}} no matter. The mesmeric {{condition}} is so near death as to content me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Julius! It is too much. You <b>are</b> sure <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>awake?</b> This <b>is</b> not the old dream!" [...] {{cried the}} exile, {{grasping}} his cousin's arm quite gainfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean what}} I say. Why should I care? Five years ago I had a foolish dream, and now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>awake</b> again. Think how old I {{have got to}} be!" ...|$|R
60|$|Sunday morning came. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> {{enjoying the}} balmy, lazy weather, and thinking. Thinking of the rescue--what else? I {{had no other}} thought now. I was absorbed in that, drunk with the {{happiness}} of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "She surely couldn't {{have got}} {{off in the}} night {{at any of the}} landings, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> and on the lookout, {{whenever}} the boat stopped. I never trust these yer things to other folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked a}} little self-conscious. [...] "Well--I--shall be delighted. You see, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> most of the night, and in riding one gets hungry--and, besides, breakfast was a little hurried. In fact, I don't {{remember}} that I had any." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>awake</b> when my true love <b>was</b> hereOf her <b>I</b> {{would have}} had my willIf not, the pretty birds in this merry green broomOf her blood they should all had her fill." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awoke</b> by {{somebody}} saying 'Here he is!' and uncovering my hot head. My mother and Peggotty {{had come to}} look for me, {{and it was one}} of them who had done it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>awake</b> now," [...] Dick said. [...] "What is it? It is not morning yet. I seem to {{have been}} asleep a long time, and don't my bones just ache? Jimmy, old boy, are you all right?" ...|$|R
60|$|All last night, or {{as much of}} it as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> {{there was}} a noise of song and of late revellers in the streets; but to-day we have waked up in the sad and sober season of Lent.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> longest that night. My cousins slept, {{the sleep}} of faith {{on either side}} of me. I decided I would whisper my prayers, and stopped midway because I was ashamed, and perhaps also because I had an idea one didn't square God like that.|$|E
60|$|Long before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> the shyster had disappeared, {{leaving his}} bill unpaid. I {{did not need}} to inquire where he was gone, I knew too well, I knew there was nothing left me but to follow; and about ten in the morning, set forth in a gig for Stallbridge-le-Carthew.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to do that. I hate my trances and those public circles. But will that {{put an end to the}} rappings and other things that go on around me when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>awake?</b> That <b>is</b> the question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you, my dear Priscilla," [...] said I, {{still holding}} her hand; [...] "but {{everything}} that I meet with nowadays makes me wonder whether <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>awake.</b> You, especially, have always seemed like a figure in a dream, and now more than ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will lie}} quiet {{as long as}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>awake,</b> but <b>I</b> cannot answer for myself if I go off to sleep, which will not <b>be</b> long, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as tired as a dog. To-day's walk would have <b>been</b> nothing if <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> all right, it was the pain that wore me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --I'm {{a simple}} person, said Davin. You know that. When {{you told me}} that night in Harcourt Street those things about your private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat my dinner. I was quite bad. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> a long time that night. Why did you tell me those things? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} is not what I mean," [...] she said reproachfully. [...] "I was mad last night. You took me by {{surprise}} and I forgot everything. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> all night. This morning I can see things clearly. Nothing--of that sort--is possible between you and me. So I want you to go away!" ...|$|E
60|$|HE. Once {{or twice}} {{in my life}} I have dreamed that I was exquisitely happy and blessed. But oh! the misgiving at the first stir of consciousness! the stab of reality! the prison walls of the bedroom! the bitter, bitter {{disappointment}} of waking! And this time! oh, this time I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake.</b>|$|E
60|$|I did not answer, fearing to {{tell him}} that <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>awake</b> {{watching}} him.|$|R
6000|$|It was on {{the second}} night after that - that is to say, the fourth in the week - when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>awoke</b> out of my sound sleep by Mr. James coming into my bedroom in his flannel-gown, with a lighted candle. He sat upon {{the side of my}} bed, and looking at me, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hope so,' {{replied the}} child. 'After <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dead, but not before. I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream {{so much of}} Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>awake.</b> Kiss me,' said the child, {{climbing}} up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver's neck. 'Good-b'ye, dear! God bless you!' ...|$|R
