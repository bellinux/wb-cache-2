25|$|In contrast, a hyphen that {{is always}} {{displayed}} and printed is called a <b>hard</b> <b>hyphen</b> (although some use this term {{to refer to a}} non-breaking hyphen; see below). Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation may occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using hyphenation algorithms are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.|$|E
2500|$|Hyphens are {{occasionally}} used {{to denote}} syllabification, as in syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion. Various British and North American dictionaries use an interpunct, sometimes called a [...] "middle dot" [...] or [...] "hyphenation point", for this purpose, as in syl·la·bi·fi·ca·tion. This allows the hyphen to be reserved only for places where a <b>hard</b> <b>hyphen</b> is intended (for example, , , [...] ). Similarly, hyphens {{may be used}} to indicate a word is being or should be spelled. For example, W-O-R-D spells [...] "word".|$|E
50|$|The soft {{returns are}} usually placed after {{the ends of}} {{complete}} words, or after the punctuation that follows complete words. However, word wrap may also occur following a hyphen inside of a word. This is sometimes not desired, and can be blocked by using a non-breaking hyphen, or <b>hard</b> <b>hyphen,</b> instead of a regular hyphen.|$|E
2500|$|As an orthographic concept, the hyphen is {{a single}} entity. In terms of {{character}} encoding and display, that entity is represented by any of several characters and glyphs (including <b>hard</b> <b>hyphens,</b> soft or [...] optional hyphens, and nonbreaking hyphens), {{depending on the context}} of use (discussed below).|$|R

25|$|It may be {{necessary}} to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word being mentioned (as when used in a dictionary) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a critical edition)—not only to control its word wrap behavior (which encoding handles with <b>hard</b> and soft <b>hyphens</b> having the same glyph) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph). Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary and the Chambers Dictionary use a double hyphen for integral hyphens and a single hyphen for line-breaks, whereas Kromhout's Afrikaans–English dictionary uses the opposite convention. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (fifth edition) repeated an integral hyphen {{at the start of the}} following line.|$|R
