50|$|A <b>fractional</b> <b>rig</b> is {{typically}} used on dinghy sailing boats and racing oriented keel boats, {{such as the}} J/24.|$|E
50|$|A large {{cockpit and}} open decks allows crew to easily move around easily and the <b>Fractional</b> <b>rig</b> means that sail costs are kept down.|$|E
50|$|Usually a <b>fractional</b> <b>rig</b> {{features}} a larger main sail {{and a smaller}} non-overlapping jib. This configuration is optimized for up-wind sailing efficiency. For downwind sailing, a larger jib is more desirable {{but in the case}} of many high-performance <b>fractional</b> <b>rig</b> sailboats, the smaller jib is substituted by a spinnaker or gennaker. On many modern skiffs and race dinghies, the jib is relatively small compared to the size of the main and it is normally left in place when the spinnaker or gennaker is used due to this type of jib's minimal aerodynamic interference.|$|E
50|$|Many (perhaps most) sailing sloops {{from the}} first part of the 20th century were <b>fractional</b> <b>rigged.</b> The {{increased}} prevalence of <b>fractional</b> <b>rigs</b> on sloops in the early 20th century probably coincided roughly with the disappearance of the gaff rig. One possibility for its increased prevalence during this era is that, relative to a masthead rig, it allows the designer to provide the boat with more sail area without using a bowsprit or a boom that extends beyond the stern, and without demanding that the sails be of a very high aspect ratio. This was important because the sailcloth available in those days made it difficult to construct high-aspect sails.|$|R
50|$|The Freedom 30 {{is a small}} {{recreational}} keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, {{with wood}} trim. It has a free-standing <b>fractional</b> <b>rigged</b> sloop rig, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder and a fixed fin keel. It displaces 7660 lb and carries 3150 lb of lead ballast.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fractional</b> <b>rigs</b> were {{introduced}} on race boats {{in order to}} allow more controllability of the surface of the main sail and also less drag during tacking. According to one manufacturer, [...] "a key to making fast boats easier to sail than slow boats is the fractional rig".|$|R
50|$|A <b>fractional</b> <b>rig</b> on a {{sailing vessel}} {{consists}} of a foresail, such as a jib or genoa sail, that does not reach {{all the way to}} the top of the mast.|$|E
5000|$|The Magic 25 has a <b>fractional</b> <b>rig.</b> [...] It {{utilizes}} a full carbon rig, triple trapeze, gennaker, retractable bowsprit, aluminium {{fin keel}} with a torpedo bulb, hydraulic mast ram {{and a powerful}} sail plan.|$|E
50|$|The {{boat was}} built by CS Yachts in Canada and {{is derived from the}} MG 335 also {{designed}} by Castro and built by MG Yachts starting in 1986. The MG 335 has a lighter displacement, a <b>fractional</b> <b>rig</b> and a shorter mast.|$|E
50|$|Since jibs need {{considerable}} {{fore stay}} tension to set properly {{and the amount}} of tension needed increases with wind speed, being able to drop the jib first in windy conditions puts less strain on the <b>rig</b> and hull. <b>Fractional</b> <b>rigs</b> are used on lightly built multi-hulls for this reason.|$|R
50|$|When first {{introduced}} the IOR rule was perfectly adequate for rating boats in existence at that time. However yacht designers naturally examined the rule to seize upon any advantage they could find, the most noticeable {{of which has}} been a reduction in displacement and a return to <b>fractional</b> <b>rigs.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>fractional</b> <b>rigged</b> sloop has its {{forestay}} attached {{at a point}} {{below the}} top of the mast, allowing the mainsail to be flattened to improve performance by raking {{the upper part of the}} mast aft by tensioning the backstay. A smaller headsail is easier for a short-handed crew to manage.|$|R

50|$|The Mutineer 15 is a sloop with a <b>fractional</b> <b>rig.</b> It is 15 ft long from bow to stern (LOA) and the Waterline length (LWL) of {{the boat}} is 14 ft, 1 inch. The primary {{construction}} material for the Mutt is fiberglass, with molded-in and textured cockpit seats and skid-resistant deck and flooring.|$|E
50|$|The boat is 24 ft {{long and}} 8 ft wide at the beam. The <b>fractional</b> <b>rig</b> carries around 1000 square feet (93 m²) of sail area, main, jib and {{spinnaker}} combined. Upwind, {{it has a}} mainsail and 100% jib. Downwind, it has a large 670 square foot (62 m²) Asymmetrical spinnaker that flies from a retractable bowsprit.|$|E
5000|$|On a sailing vessel, a forestay, {{sometimes}} just called a stay, {{is a piece}} of standing rigging which keeps a mast from falling backwards. It is attached either {{at the very top of}} the mast, or in <b>fractional</b> <b>rigs</b> between about 1/8 and 1/4 from the top of the mast. The other end of the forestay is attached to the bow of the boat.|$|R
50|$|The Hartley TS18 was a {{development}} of the 16 with more emphasis on family cruising being 10% larger with accommodation for four people. In total some 240 were built in Australia of which less than 40 were ever raced. Of these 220 were the standard Hartley designed <b>fractional</b> <b>rigged</b> boats, and 20 the Victorian Association Masthead version.A later trend was {{to set up the}} yacht as fractionally rigged but carry the Mast Head rigged spinnaker; this gave better performance.|$|R
50|$|The Ranger 16 {{is a small}} {{recreational}} dinghy, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a <b>fractional</b> sloop <b>rig,</b> a transom-hung rudder and a retractable centerboard keel. It displaces 450 lb.|$|R
50|$|A major {{advantage}} of the <b>fractional</b> <b>rig,</b> especially the '3/4' rig (where the fore stay goes 3/4 {{the way up the}} mast), is that the jib can be taken in without the boat rounding up into the wind like a weather vane. With the masthead sloop, both the main and the jib must be reefed, when shortening sail, to keep this from happening.|$|E

50|$|The Esse 850 is {{an example}} of the latest design {{concepts}} in high speed hulls and sail plans. The sail plan is characterized by a large mainsail and a high aspect ratio jib in a <b>fractional</b> <b>rig</b> design. These high speed fractional rigs are a nearly ubiquitous feature on sportboats and are used for their ease of handling and their high lift and low drag characteristics.|$|E
