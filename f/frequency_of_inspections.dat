The AD requires that aircraft with over 30,000 cycles be inspected within 20 days of receipt of the AD, or upon reaching 30,000 cycles. For aircraft with over 35,000 cycles, the inspection is required within 5 days. The AD also requires periodic inspections of the same joints at every 500 cycles for aircraft with over 30,000 cycles. The AD refers {{to a range of}} airframes, line numbers 2553–3132 inclusive, totaling 580 aircraft. Of the total of 580 aircraft, only 175 aircraft currently meet the 30,000 cycle requirement, with 80 of those operating in the United States. [...] The FAA AD is effective to only the portion of those that are registered in the United States, since the FAA can only mandate such changes in the United States. Countries with reciprocity airworthiness agreements will also follow the AD, but other nations are not required to adhere to the ruling. As a result of the incident, the FAA investigated Boeing's manufacturing techniques to discover whether or not they had any bearing on the cause of the failure.

40|$|Little {{is known}} of how client fish {{minimise}} the costs of cleaning behaviour while maximising ectoparasite removal by cleaner fish. Previous {{studies have found that}} abundance on fish and infestation behaviour of gnathiid isopods, the main parasite eaten by cleaner fish, varies diurnally. We examined whether reduced foraging is a cost of cleaning behaviour in clients and whether the behaviour of the client fish, the thick-lipped wrasse Hemigymnus melapterus, towards the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus varied diurnally to maximise ectoparasite removal, possibly in response to the diurnal changes in the abundance and infestation patterns of gnathiids. We found that during the midday and afternoon, client foraging rates were negatively related to the duration and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections,</b> suggesting that cleaning may, at some times of the day, be energetically costly to the client in terms of reduced foraging opportunities. Surprisingly, we found that the duration and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> of clients by cleaners did not vary among diel time periods. A model of gnathiid dynamics on individual fish is proposed. It shows that the observed diurnal pattern in gnathiid abundance on fish can be generated with the constant duration and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> that was observed in this study. Thus clients would not have more gnathiids removed by modifying their cleaning behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Mass {{produced}} custom parts require inspection routines {{that can}} facilitate variations in product parameters such as dimensions, tolerances, and throughputs. Quality control and <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> these parts, and part families, need to occur at higher frequencies than batched produced parts. This higher <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> significantly impacts inspection times, and inherently, production rates. An effective, diverse, accurate, robust, and time efficient method for inspecting custom parts is therefore needed. Vision systems are a continuously evolving method of quality control and part inspection. These systems offer {{the potential to}} be exceptionally diverse and effective in their applications, and are therefore suited to inspecting custom parts. This paper details the research, design, construction and assembly of a prototype apparatus, which provided a suitable environment in which customized parts were inspected. System integration using the Mechatronic Engineering approach was performed to integrate vision, sensor articulation, and control systems. The apparatus was tested in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) cell to quantify system performance. Intelligence was incorporated into the inspection routine by performing visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> only significant Regions of Interest (ROI). Dynamic access by the vision sensor to the various ROIs, allowed for <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> moving parts, which lead to an increased process efficiency.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a comprehensive review}} of the maritime safety regimes and provides recommendations on how to improve the system. The results show a complex legal framework which generates a high amount of inspections and overlapping of inspection areas where no cross-recognition is established by the various stakeholders. While the safety system seems to be successful in eliminating substandard vessels and while average insurance claims costs are substantially lower for inspected vessels than not inspected vessels, the results indicate that the economic conditions of the shipping market also have an effect on safety quality besides the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections.</b> No significant differences can be found between industry inspections and port state control inspections with respect to decreasing the probability of casualty. The system could be made more effective by combining data sources on inspections and use them respectively to improve risk profiling and to decrease the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> performed on ship types such as tankers. The results further indicate a lack of proper implementation of the International Safety Management Code (ISM code) and conventions with reference to working and living conditions of crew (ILO 147).

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a reliability-based optimization model of inspection, maintenance, and replacement {{for a system}} of several highway bridges. The objective in the formulation is to minimize the total expected social cost, including the expected cost of failure. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> is included as a decision variable. The probability of failure is explicitly {{taken into account in}} the constraints. A bottom-up approach is used, which allows for bridge-specific details to be taken into account. Most existing system level models assume that component deterioration is memoryless; however, this assumption is relaxed in this paper, and historydependent deterioration models are used. The formulation is flexible enough to accommodate different types of facilities, deterioration processes, and failure modes. A parametric study is conducted to demonstrate the model’s response to different assumptions on the deterioration rates, and maintenance costs and efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Parallel {{systems are}} a {{commonly}} used structure in reliability engineering. A common characteristic of such systems {{is that the}} failure of a component may not cause its system to fail. As such, the failure may not be immediately detected and the random (disruption) time at which the number of failed components reaches a certain predefined number may therefore be unknown. For such systems, scheduling maintenance policy is a difficult task, which is tackled in this paper. The paper assumes that times between inspections conform to a modulated Poisson process. This assumption allows the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> responds to the variation of the disruption state. The paper then estimates the disruption time on the basis <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> point process observations in the framework of filtering theorem.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The main {{requirement}} of maintenance and renovation of bridges is the continuous {{inspection of the}} condition and corrosion state of the bridges during the whole lifetime. The required mode, depth and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> is defined in regulations. Carrying out these investigations is rather costly apart from the simple visual supervision. The most commonly accepted method in Hungary of examining the statical behaviour of the structure at regular supervisions is the load test. The load test is carryed out by placing known concentrated forces on given points of the bridge and measuring the displacements. By {{increasing the number of}} the positions of load and points of measuring the "weak cross-sections" can be determined with approximate accuracy. Comparing the results of measurement and statical calculations provides informations about the behaviour of the structure.

This goal can possibly be realized by automated structural health monitoring (SHM) of structures using sparse active guided wave sensor arrays. Guided waves are sensitive to small defects and can propagate long distances across feature dense plates. Thus, a guided wave SHM system that enables reliable detection of critical defects or monitoring of their growth can potentially be used to reduce the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> for real structures.

40|$|A ship is {{required}} to operate for a fixed mission period. Should a critical item of equipment fail at sea, the ship is subject to a costly event with potentially high risk to ship and crew.

40|$|The {{proposed}} aging {{management plan}} for the Oyster Creek Drywell Liner, as proposed by AmerGen, is being discussed. It is shown that the UT monitoring locations (6 by 6 inch grids inside the drywell) as defined in 1989 are not representative of the corrosion, which had occurred in the sandbed region. Furthermore, since {{the outside of the}} drywell in the sandbed region had been coated in 1992, corrosion in the upper regions of the sandbed (i. e. where monitoring is being proposed) has become less relevant because water accumulations (the primary causes for corrosion) will now more likely occur towards the bottom of the former sandbed region.

40|$|If a firm can {{influence}} its monitorability vis-à-vis an environmental regulator, it is shown that increasing the thoroughness of inspections induces {{the firm to}} substitute towards more transparent technologies, whilst increasing their frequency may cause substitution the other way. Perversely, when the effect of such substitution is taken into account, {{an increase in the}} <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> (or, equally, the stringency of penalties) may worsen the firm's environmental performance. The agency should favour more thorough inspections than existing theory suggests, particularly in sectors where the scope for such substitution is great. Moreover, when monitorability adjusts only sluggishly to policy shocks (because it is an embodied characteristic of capital, for example) the environmental impacts of increased frequency and increased thoroughness well over- and under-shoot their respective long-run impacts. In assessing regulatory reform, therefore, it is important to leave sufficient time for the class of adjustments identified to occur. The possibility of overshooting can be used as an alternative to existing ‘regulatory capture’ theories to explain why the efficacy of some classes of regulatory reform may fade through time.
