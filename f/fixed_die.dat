40|$|Abstract — Fixed-die {{floorplanning}} is {{an important}} problem in the modern physical design process. An effective floorplanning algorithm is crucial to improving both the quality and the timeto-market of the design. In this paper, we present an analytical floorplanning algorithm {{that can be used}} to efficiently pack soft modules into a <b>fixed</b> <b>die.</b> The locations and sizing of the modules are simultaneously optimized so that a minimum total wire length is achieved. Experiments on the MCNC and GSRC benchmarks show that our algorithm can achieve above a 90 % success rate with a 10 % white space constraint in the <b>fixed</b> <b>die,</b> and the efficiency is much higher than that of the simulated annealing based algorithms for benchmarks containing a large number of modules.

40|$|Equal channel angular {{pressing}} (ECAP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising severe plastic deformation (SPD) techniques for fabrication of bulk ultrafine-grained (UFG) materials. There are many factors influencing the ECAP process which consist of the ECAP die geometries, strain paths, processing numbers, frictional conditions, processing temperatures, materials properties and so on. In this study, a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) model was used to investigate the influence of outer corner angle (OCA) of an ECAP die on the plastic deformation and texture evolution during the ECAP process. The simulation results revealed that Ψ = 20 resulted in the optimal distribution of effective plastic strain in the deformed sample for a <b>fixed</b> <b>die</b> channel angle of 90. It should be noted that the angle of Ψ ≤ 30 lead to similar textures after ECAP due to the development of corner gaps.

The framework of this thesis is the study of new materials for power electronics application, analysing their thermal, mechanical and electrical properties. Emerging application of high power systems requires new methods for power electronics integration and packaging. Stringent requirements in size and weight, reliability, durability, ambient and operation temperatures are pushing to go beyond the limits in industrial applications. As a consequence, our studies are focused on power modules, incorporating new materials and technology processes (sintering) for dies or chips (silicon), substrates and interconnection materials (wire bonding). This thesis work starts introducing the power semiconductor devices used in power electronics and their integration on Power Integrated Circuits (low and medium power density) and Power Modules (medium, high and very high power density). This chapter will explain technology evolution, power semiconductor device utilization mode and some applications. Chapter 2 will be focused on power modules packages. They have an important role for providing cooling, electrical connection and correct insulation, between the internal semiconductor devices and the external circuit. Isolated and non isolated packages are analysed and compared. Chapter 3 will make a point on the methods of thermal characterization and reliability tests, that were implemented to evaluate the impact of the introduction of new materials and processes into the device.

40|$|The {{placement}} process. The {{placement problem}} is to place objects into a <b>fixed</b> <b>die</b> such that no objects overlap {{with each other and}} some cost metric (e. g., wirelength) is optimized. Placement is a major step in physical design that has been studied for several decades. Although it is a classical problem, many modern design challenges have reshaped this problem. As a result, the placement problem has attracted much attention recently, and many new algorithms have been developed to handle the emerging design challenges. Modern placement algorithms can be classified into three major categories: simulated annealing, min-cut, and analytical algorithms. According to the recent literature, analytical algorithms typically achieve the best placement quality for large-scale circuit designs. In this paper, therefore, we shall give a systematic and comprehensive survey on the essential issues in analytical placement. This survey starts by dissecting the basic structure of analytical placement. Then, various techniques applied as components of popular analytical placers are studied, and two leading placers are exemplified to show the composition of these techniques into a complete placer. Finally, we point out some research directions for future analytical placement...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{interconnect}} {{effects are}} taken into account during logic synthesis via wireload models, but their ineffectiveness for DSM technologies has been demonstrated and various physical synthesis approaches have been spawned to address the problem. Of particular interest is that logic block size is no longer dictated exclusively by total cell area, yet synthesis optimization objectives are aimed specifically at minimizing the number and size of cells. Methodologies that incorporate congestion within the logic synthesis objective function have been proposed in [9][10][11] and [15]; however, as we will demonstrate, predicting the true congestion prior to layout is not possible, and the efficacy of any approach can only be evaluated after routing is completed within the <b>fixed</b> <b>die</b> size. In this paper we propose a practical, complete methodology which first performs congestion-aware technology mapping using a global weighting factor for the cost function [15], and then applies incremental localized unmapping and remapping on congested areas. This complete approach addresses the problem that one global factor is not ideally suited for all regions of the designs. Most importantly, through the application of this methodology to industrial examples we will show that any attempt at a purely top-down single-pass congestion-aware technology mapping is merely wishful thinking...|$|E

Floorplanning with bus planning {{is one of}} the most challenging modern floorplanning problems because it needs to consider the constraints with interconnect and block positions simultaneously. In this paper, the authors study two types of modern floorplanning problems: 1) fixed-outline floorplanning and 2) bus-driven floorplanning (BDF). This floorplanner uses B ∗-tree floorplan representation based on fast three-stage simulated annealing (SA) scheme called Fast-SA. For fixed-outline floorplanning, the authors present an adaptive Fast-SA that can dynamically change the weights in the cost function to optimize the wirelength under the outline constraint. Experimental results show that this floorplanner can achieve 100 % success rates efficiently for fixed-outline floorplanning with various aspect ratios. For the BDF, the authors explore the feasibility conditions of the B ∗-tree with the bus constraints, and develop a BDF algorithm based on the conditions and Fast-SA. Experimental results show that this floorplanner obtains much smaller dead space for the floorplanning with hard/soft macro blocks, compared with the most recent work. In particular, this floorplanner is more efficient than the previous works. Index Terms—Floorplanning, physical design. I...|$|E
