40|$|Mental {{illness is}} an {{all-inclusive}} diagnosis which includes {{many areas of}} abnormal behavior. One of those areas {{is the problem of}} the <b>exceptional</b> <b>child.</b> Probably the most difficult area of "exceptionality," to define and explain neatly, is that of the socially maladjusted and the emotionally disturbed child. A social and/or emotional problem, primarily one of degree, is usually defined as a moderate to marked reduction in to a child's behavioral freedom, which in turn reduces his ability to function effectively in learning or working with others. Because of its vagueness, the term "emotionally disturbed" is extremely hard to understand, and therefore, some prefer to use "maladaptation" or "maladjustment. " Because all three mean about the same thing, they will be used interchangeably throughout this paper. The <b>exceptional</b> <b>child</b> suffers from placement in a regular classroom environment; his ability to concentrate and learn is extremely limited. Therefore, either special schools, special classes within regular schools, or residential units, are beneficial for the child.
