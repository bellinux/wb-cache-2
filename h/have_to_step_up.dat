50|$|The Raiders {{entered the}} final game of the season with an {{opportunity}} to secure a first round bye as the number two seed in the AFC, but would have to do so without Derek Carr, following his injury on Christmas Eve. With a loss, the Raiders could still claim the number two seed, but they needed the Chiefs to lose to the Chargers. The Raiders started Matt McGloin, hoping he could provide enough offense to get the Raiders a win and the number two seed. The defense would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> to secure the bye, but on the first drive of the game, they could not stop the Broncos: a 13-yard touchdown run by Devontae Booker gave the Broncos an early 7-0 lead. The Raider offense could not move the ball well on their first two possessions and, on the Broncos third possession, they extended the lead on a Brandon McManus field goal. With a little less than seven minutes remaining in the first half, McGloin was hit by Bronco defensive end, Jared Crick, resulting in a roughing the passer penalty. McGloin, though shaky after the hit, finished the drive. However, he was soon escorted to the locker room. The Broncos scored again with less than two minutes remaining on a pass from Trevor Siemian to Booker to extend the lead to 17-0. On the ensuing Raider possession, rookie Connor Cook entered the game to replace McGloin, but the Raiders went three-and-out. As the half ended, the Raiders postseason chances looked even worse with their third-string quarterback in the game, trailing 17-0, and the Chiefs beating the Chargers. Cook started and played the whole second half. The first drive started well for the Raiders, but Cook was sacked and fumbled the ball on the Denver 37-yard line. The Broncos marched down the field and Siemian hit Virgil Green for a two-yard touchdown pass to extend the lead to 24-0. The Raider offense managed a touchdown on catch and run from Amari Cooper from 32 yards out, but could muster nothing. The Raiders fell 24-6. Meanwhile, Kansas City defeated the Chargers and the Raiders fell to a wild card sport with the likelihood of having to send their third-string quarterback out as their starter against Houston in the playoffs. After the game, Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak announced he was retiring due to health issues.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. Special {{relevancy}} of {{the dairy}} products promotion system on Ukrainian milk and dairy products market, along with traditional instruments such as availability of goods in time and territorial aspects, their price, quality and range, has been established. Under the conditions of reducing the demand for milk and dairy products, domestic milk processing companies <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> their marketing policy of communications using affordable and efficient channels of information dissemination. Efficiency of advertisement and sales promotion on preference the milk product of PJSC Ternopil Dairy Factory by consumers of Kyiv are investigated. The results of the analysis. The prospects for further development of the regional dairy products manufacturer (e. g. MOLOKIYA trade mark) towards achieving the national status by means of active promotion on the natural products market in the dairy products sector, primarily {{in the capital city}} of Kyiv and other major cities, have been substantiated. It has been established that in order to provide consumers with natural, fresh, high quality milk on a daily basis, PJSC Ternopil Dairy Factory developed the strategy of “Fresh milk: from the cow to the store”. Based on this strategy, Fresh Milk Technology was introduced, with the help of which raw materials (namely milk) are kept as close to freshly drawn milk as possible. It has been further determined that a detailed study of the target audience consumer behavior is required in order to gain access to new markets, such as the city of Kyiv and other major cities of Ukraine as well as to inform the consumers about the value of the brand and its key benefits with limited budget for new products promotion in the region. The analysis of the primary marketing information showed that consumer attitude in Kyiv is mostly pessimistic. The positive result for PJSC Ternopil Dairy Factory is that firstly, the consumers are not willing to skimp on essentials; secondly, the groups that belong to average and average+ segment tended to be more optimistic. Moreover, percentage of such consumers in the city of Kiev was higher than average for Ukraine. During the marketing research it was found that young mothers are the most relevant audience for the set objectives. They tend to switch from usual range of consumer products, to influence the opinion of others and they may find the information about Fresh Milk Technology important. Online survey was conducted in two stages – before and after the advertising campaign. Two hundred respondents were represented by women aged 25 - 45, with children, living in key cities of three regions: Kyiv, Vinnytsia and Lviv. The effectiveness of association combination, featured in the communication strategy developed by PJSC Ternopil Dairy Factory (family-oriented, traditional character of the dairy product and the production technology) has been confirmed. The appropriateness of the use of various technologies on the market of milk and dairy products to disseminate information about the products of the Company under the study, especially those that do not require significant funding and which are based on the Internet technologies with the focus on target audience, has been determined. The latter can be regarded as a free generator in the WOM mode and has a great potential to increase customer loyalty. Differentiation through visual communication was done using a specialized website that was designed to “educate” the audience on the Fresh Milk Technology. Complex technological information was presented in the most accessible to the target audience form – promotional games with music and animation support. Media activism on Google Display Network provided {{a better understanding of the}} product and the benefits of the technology. It has also performed the task of informing the target audience about the existence of the website. With this aim in mind an animated video was created. Conclusions and directions of further researches. On the basis of primary marketing information analysis, it was found that Internet-based advertising campaign of PJSC Ternopil Dairy Factory resulted in significant increase of the percentage of consumers who chose the dairy products of the Company. The newly-designed visual communication strategy of PJSC Ternopil Dairy Factory with the target audience of young mothers aimed at further recommending of MOLOKIYA brand was effective as it increased the sales of the Company by 78...|$|E
40|$|Labor leader Bill Shorten {{introduced}} a marriage equality bill to Federal Parliament {{this week and}} in his address to the House of Representatives, asked that members 2 ̆ 7 embrace a definition of marriage that respects, values and includes every Australian. 2 ̆ 7 __ MARRIAGE AMENDMENT (MARRIAGE EQUALITY) BILL 2015 BILL SHORTEN SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT, MONDAY, 1 JUNE 2015 I move that the bill be read a second time. The laws of our nation should give us hope. Our laws should tell our children what we believe. Our laws should tell strangers who Australians are. Our laws should be a mirror…reflecting our great and generous country and our free, inclusive society. And our Parliament should {{be a place where}} we make things happen rather than sit back and let them happen. On marriage equality, for too long we in this Parliament have been following, not leading. It is within our power to change this. This Parliament can change a law that no longer describes modern Australia…and pass a law of which we can all be proud. Let us delay no more. Let us embrace a definition of marriage that respects, values and includes every Australian. Let us declare, in the house of the Australian people – it is time. The right time to make marriage equality, a reality. This is a moment bigger than politics. This moment does not distract the nation – it complements our hopes for the future. I know all members of Parliament will engage in a respectful and considered debate, and I hope will be able to exercise a free vote. I pay tribute to the Member for Sydney, for offering her place on this bill to a member of the Government. Tanya, thank you. Your actions, the advocacy of Senator Penny Wong and the goodwill of many across the Parliament, prove that bipartisanship is not the problem here. What matters is the outcome, not who owns it. Madam Speaker For decades, the march to equality has been led by remarkable Australians from every part of our country and all walks of life. Governments from both sides of politics have delivered real progress too. The Fraser Government passed Whitlam law, decriminalising homosexuality in Commonwealth territories, following Don Dunstan’s lead in South Australia. Paul Keating lifted the ban on Australians who identified as gay serving in our military. The Rudd and Gillard governments removed discrimination against same-sex couples from more than 80 laws. In Victoria, the Napthine Government expunged the records of people who were charged under long-repealed homosexuality offences. Changing the Marriage Act is the next, overdue step in the path to true equality. Madam Speaker I’m a twin – it’s a special thing, growing up, an inseparable bond. But for other twins where one twin is gay and the other is not, the Marriage Act is the only Australian law that separates siblings. It’s a double standard which divides families, and our country. It’s not fair and it’s not who we are. And it should change. Currently, marriage is defined as: ‘the union {{of a man and a}} woman” Those eight words maintain a fiction that any other relationship is somehow inferior. Our legislation proposes a new definition: ‘the union of two people’ And it allows celebrants the choice of referring to ‘partners’, as well as husband and wife. To some, this may seem a small gesture. In truth, this means so much, to so many. To all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex Australians, we offer change that says: your relationship is equal under the law. To the parents, children, friends and families of same-sex partners, just as the people you love are equal and valuable in your eyes, their relationship should be equal and valuable in the eyes of our law. To same-sex couples, we offer the right to celebrate your love with the public measure of devotion: marriage. When someone has found not just another person they can live with, but a person they can’t live without, then they should have the same right to the true qualities of a bond that runs deeper than any law. The same joy and sacrifice. The same care and compassion. The same rights and responsibilities. And we say to all young gay people. We are proud of you, for who you are. You belong. We say to you, you have a right to the same hopes, dreams and opportunities as every other Australian including the right to marry the person you love. In removing discrimination from our country’s laws, we strive to eliminate prejudice from our people’s lives. Let’s be honest. Casual, unthinking discrimination and deliberate, malicious homophobia alike, are still far too common in our conversations. In our schoolyards, our workplaces and our sporting clubs…and even, occasionally, our Parliament too. This affects community, neighbourliness, harmony and mental health in our cities and especially our regions and the bush where physical remoteness can aggravate a sense of isolation. We know two out of five young Australians who are gay have thought about self-harm or suicide. Two out of every five. We know a young Australian who identifies as gay is six times more likely to consider taking their own life, compared to their sibling, classmate, colleague or teammate. Six times. When I was finishing school in the 1980 s, youth suicide was still a taboo topic. I can remember hearing of the passing of young men, and no-one spoke of how they died. I can close my eyes and see their faces, forever young. And I wonder now, if for some, the stigma and the struggle of imagining a future, lonely, isolated, treated differently was too much to bear. Marriage equality says to young people who identify as gay, you are never alone. You belong. This is an act of fairness for all ages. On the weekend, I spoke with Sandra Yates, from Devonport in Tassie. Like hundreds of other Australian couples, she and her partner Lee Bransden have been forced to travel to New Zealand to marry. Sandra and Lee had hoped to marry at home surrounded by friends and family but Lee is terminally ill, and has been told she only has weeks to live. Their community raised money to fund their trip and fulfil their dream. They are thrilled to be married…and sad it couldn’t happen here, in the country they love. Lee’s voice should be heard in this place: “Please, help switch on the light for same-sex couples and take us out of the darkness. ” Lee, Sandra, you, your friends and families should not have to wait one day longer for recognition. And this legislation will ensure that same-sex marriages, recognised in another country, are recognised here. A law that forces our citizens to travel overseas, or to the grounds of another nation’s embassy, to have their relationships recognised is a law not worth keeping. I have not made a habit of speaking publicly about my faith, and I do not seek to preach to others today. I do believe in God and I do believe in marriage equality. For me, there is nothing contradictory about extending love, compassion, charity and respect beyond heterosexual Australia. I understand, that for many people of different faiths, this is a complex question, I respect this. It is why I support a free vote. And why this legislation makes it clear that no minister of religion can be compelled, or is obliged, to conduct a particular marriage…including one where two people are of the same sex. AlI ask in return that this respect be mutual. Just as churches, mosques, temples and synagogues of all faiths and traditions will be free to choose if they consecrate same sex marriages. Let the same respect allow Australians to freely choose who they marry, without vilification or judgment. So often in our history, Australia has led the world in social and economic progress. The right to vote, pensions, the eight-hour day. Our healthcare and superannuation systems are among the best in the world. But on marriage equality, we have fallen behind. Like so many Australians, two Sunday mornings ago, when I first heard the result of the Irish referendum I thought: if the Irish can do it, why can’t we? How can Ireland, New Zealand, 37 US States, England, Scotland, South Africa and Canada and Brazil, Iceland and Uruguay be ahead of us? Twenty countries have already recognised the merit of marriage equality. I am confident Australia will. I don’t want us to wait, any longer. We cannot assume this change is inevitable. We cannot imagine it will just happen. We, the 44 th Parliament, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up,</b> to rise to the moment. Today, is neither the beginning, nor the end, of the journey to marriage equality. But I hope…with goodwill on all sides, with co-operation, with respect for one another this can be a historic step forward. Given a free vote, I believe this Parliament is ready for a definition of marriage which reflects the modern, inclusive and egalitarian Australia we love. We are ready to be as generous and kind-hearted as the Australians who trust us. Millions of Australians have waited long enough for this act of justice and inclusion. The opportunity of a generation is before us now. The moment is here. Let this law reflect the nation we want to see in the mirror: generous, smart, modern, diverse, honest and, above all, equal. Let’s switch on the light. Let’s make 2015, the year when Australia embraces marriage equality. Let’s make it happen, together. It’s time...|$|E
