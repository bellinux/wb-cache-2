Rather than simply organising the ditch diggers into one craft union and the dirt movers into another craft union, trade unionists sought to organise all people who moved earth into one union.|$|R

40|$|Evidence from Sri Lanka This paper {{uses the}} recent history of state-labor {{relations}} in Sri Lanka to question the wisdom of exporting the East Asian labor-repressive model of development to more politically and socially mobilized settings and to question the assumption that unions are bad for economic development. From 1978 to 1993, Sri Lanka’s United National Party (UNP) mimicked the East Asian model by repressing labor unions to facilitate low-wage, low-end export production. I show how the repression of private sector unions destroyed the legitimacy of unions and the structure of institutionalized bargaining that was in place prior to UNP rule. This erosion of the system of institutionalized bargaining eventually led workers to take {{matters into their own hands}} and culminated in a wave of extreme and violent forms of protest which chased away much needed foreign direct investment. To support these claims, I provide anecdotal and statistical evidence based on surveys and interviews conducted in Sri Lanka during 16 months of field research. The vital social and political functions trade unions may perform in countries attempting swift economic growth are perhaps of even greater significance than the economic consequences of <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> [...] .

40|$|M. Comm. (Business Management) <b>Trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and <b>trade</b> unions {{activities}} in South Africa’s labour relations system and workplaces {{has a long}} history of racial segregation characterised by confrontation and antagonism between the employer (management) and trade unions in the workplaces. However, in the South African contemporary labour relations environment the emphasis is more on creation of constructive and cooperative relations between the employer (management) and trade unions in the workplace. The literature study cites managers’ attitudes towards trade unions as one of the factor that could facilitate genuine interaction and promote productive cooperative management – trade unions relations in the workplace. The objective of this study was to assist in identifying and understating managers’ attitudes towards workplace <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> in the workplace utilising a coal mining company as a case study. For the purpose of investigating managers’ attitudes towards <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and <b>trade</b> unions in the workplace, a literature review was conducted and the self-administered questionnaire was utilised as the research instrument to collect the primary data about managers’ attitudes towards <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and <b>trade</b> unions in the workplace. The findings of the study reveal that most of the respondents generally harbour positive attitudes towards <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and <b>trade</b> unions in the workplace. Another significant research finding of the study is the identification and existence of four factors underlying managers’ attitudes towards <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and <b>trade</b> unions in the workplace. The factors identified relates to the awareness and understanding of the concept <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and <b>trade</b> unions in the workplace, operational aspects in terms of perceived destructive and constructive role and function of trade unions in the workplace and lastly, management – trade union cooperation and relationship building in the workplace. Recommendations of the study were presented that will assist in improving and entrenching managers’ positive attitudes towards <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and <b>trade</b> unions in the workplace...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>unionism</b> is criticised {{by those}} of council {{communist}} and left communist tendencies. Here, <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> is seen as being more useful to capitalists than to workers, and {{as a kind of}} [...] "safety-valve" [...] that helps to keep working-class discontent within reformist channels and prevent it from evolving into revolutionary action. They think that a global state composed of workers' councils to be the ultimate union to where all workers in the world belong; unions that organize based on trade further divide the working class and act as a mechanism to allow the working class to vent concerns without actually uniting and becoming revolutionary. In contrast to other left critiques of <b>trade</b> <b>unionism,</b> these tendencies do not accept that the problems they identify could be remedied by changing the structure, leadership or objectives of trade unions. They argue that <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> is inherently reformist because it is sectarian and is not founded in the workplace itself and that revolutionary action is possible only if workers act outside <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> through workers' councils or other channels.|$|R

Survey data reveal that, in fact, the attitudes of insecure workers towards <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and mobilization at work are more positive than those of stable employees, and they are more critical of the prevailing economic system. These results are discussed within the framework of current debates on the crisis of <b>trade</b> <b>unionism</b> and the effects of flexibility in industrial relations...|$|R
