5|$|A {{group of}} judges, {{including}} Efraín Rivera Pérez, a former {{judge of the}} Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and Héctor Laffitte, former federal judge, expressed themselves {{in favor of the}} amendments. Also, former two-time Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department, Pedro Toledo, expressed himself in favor of the amendments. He added that some guidelines could be needed to allow judges to define the issue of the <b>dangerousness</b> of the accused.|$|E
5|$|Stack v. Boyle (1951) is {{the only}} {{case in which the}} Supreme Court has held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally {{excessive}}. There, the Court found $50,000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act. In United States v. Salerno (1987), the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which authorized the consideration of future <b>dangerousness</b> in the determination of the amount of, or the denial of, bail.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's <b>dangerousness</b> and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
25|$|Although the Supreme Court upheld {{two aspects}} of the appeal, it {{ultimately}} vacated and remanded {{on the question of}} the petitioner's <b>dangerousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in {{approving}} the lower court's order to allow forced medication to restore Sell's competence to stand trial because the original decisions of the hospital and the judge were based on an assessment of Sell's <b>dangerousness.</b> Since the experts testifying at the hearings focused mainly {{on the issue of}} <b>dangerousness</b> and not on Sell's trial competence, there was not enough evidence in the court record regarding the possible effect of the medication on Sell's ability to obtain a fair trial.|$|E
25|$|Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court case. The Court {{ruled on}} the {{admissibility}} of clinical opinions given by two psychiatrists {{hired by the}} prosecution in answer to hypothetical questions regarding the defendant's future <b>dangerousness</b> and the likelihood that he would present a continuing threat to society in this Texas death penalty case. The American Psychiatric Association submitted an amicus curiae brief {{in support of the}} defendant's position that such testimony should be inadmissible and urging curtailment of psychiatric testimony regarding future <b>dangerousness</b> and a prohibition of such testimony based on hypothetical data.|$|E
25|$|A {{characteristic}} {{trait of}} the movement was its defensive nature. Indeed, few offensive actions such as sabotages or occupation of localities have been recorded. While the groups did not pose a major material threat to the authorities, their <b>dangerousness</b> for the regime resided in the symbol they represented: {{as long as the}} resisters remained free, they created a tangible challenge to the regime’s claim of exercising total control over the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether the drug could be administered involuntarily was the subject of several other hearings. In August 2000 the magistrate found that Sell was a danger to himself and others, authorized Sell to be forcibly medicated on the grounds that only medication would reduce his <b>dangerousness,</b> that any serious side effects could be treated, that the benefits to Sell were greater than the risks, and that the medication were substantially likely to restore Sell's competence.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Sell appealed on certiorari to the Federal District Court which, while {{reversing}} the federal magistrate's finding of <b>dangerousness,</b> upheld {{the order of}} forced medication {{on the grounds that}} it was necessary to restore Sell's competency to stand trial. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision in a divided vote. Sell's attorney pointed out that Sell had already been incarcerated for a longer period of time than if he were convicted for the offenses as charged.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 {{study in}} Ireland found that dog bite {{injuries}} greatly increased since {{the introduction of}} legislation targeting specific dog breeds. This study also suggested that targeting dog breeds may actually contribute to increases in dog-bite hospitalisations through the reinforcing of incorrect stereotypes of risk being determined by breed. The study reported {{that as a result}} of targeting dog breeds, stereotypes of the <b>dangerousness</b> of certain breeds and assuming the safety of others simply due to their breed may result in people incorrectly interacting with dogs from both categories.|$|E
25|$|However, {{forensic}} experts {{state that}} psychiatric testimony on ultimate questions at law is unreliable {{due to the}} inherent limitations of current psychiatric clinical and experimental knowledge and practice. Dr. James P. Grigson, one of the psychiatrists that testified in this case, was expelled from the American Psychiatric Association and the Texas Association of Psychiatric Physicians (TAPP) for making statements in testimony on defendants he had not examined. The TAPP said his expulsion was due not only to his replies to hypothetical questions but also for predicting <b>dangerousness</b> with 100% certainty.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{essential}} aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The {{observation of the}} patient's behavior is {{an important aspect of}} emergency psychiatry inasmuch as it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on <b>dangerousness</b> or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation {{for a period of time}} may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, this will help the staff decide that hospital admission may be needed.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{government}} was showing a more indulgent attitude toward the foreign rock groups, as part of an international campaign which purpose was to achieve an opening in the commercial transactions and investments of the US and Europe in Cuba, it continued to implement an inflexible repression against any form of internal dissidence. This was the case of the rocker Gorki Águila and his group Porno para Ricardo. In August 2008, Águila was arrested under charges of <b>dangerousness,</b> a law that allows the authorities to detain people whom they think are likely to commit crimes; even when they have not yet committed them.|$|E
25|$|These dogs, or strains {{and crosses}} thereof, {{must be kept}} on a strong, short lead (less than 2 metres / 6'7") by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of {{controlling}} them. The dog/s must be securely muzzled too. A recent study conducted in Ireland found that dog bite injuries significantly increased since the introduction of such legislation, although data from before {{the introduction of the}} ban was not included. The study reported that dog bite hospitalisations may rise as a result of targeting dog breeds due to reinforcing incorrect stereotypes of the <b>dangerousness</b> of certain breeds and assuming the safety of others simply due to their breed may result in people incorrectly interacting with dogs from both categories.|$|E
25|$|Like all Latrodectus species, L.geometricus has a {{neurotoxic}} venom. The venom acts on {{nerve endings}} causing the very unpleasant symptoms of latrodectism. However, brown widow bites {{are usually not}} very dangerous; usually much less dangerous than those of L.mactans, the black widow. The effects of the toxin are usually confined to the bite area and surrounding tissue, unlike the black widow's. Mere toxicity of the venom {{is not the only}} factor in <b>dangerousness.</b> Brown widow bites are minor compared to black widow bites because they cannot deliver the same amount of venom as the black widow. The LD50 of L. geometricus venom has been measured in mice as 0.43mg/kg, and separately again as 0.43mg/kg (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.31-0.53).|$|E
500|$|According to Larry Gostin, {{the root}} cause of the problem was the State itself. The {{definition}} of danger was radically extended by the Soviet criminal system to cover [...] "political" [...] as well as customary physical types of [...] "danger". As Bloch and Reddaway note, there are no objective reliable criteria to determine whether the person's behavior will be dangerous, and approaches to the definition of <b>dangerousness</b> greatly differ among psychiatrists.|$|E
500|$|... "To {{avoid any}} misunderstandings, please {{take note of}} the following: ...a {{distinction}} must be made between those who may be dealt with in the usual way and those who must be given special treatment. The latter case covers subjects who, due to their most objectionable nature, their <b>dangerousness,</b> or their ability to serve as tools of propaganda for the enemy, are suitable for elimination, without respect for persons, by merciless treatment (namely, by execution).|$|E
500|$|After these attacks, Binky {{received}} {{international news}} coverage. Binky merchandise was created, including T-shirts, mugs, and bumper stickers, often adorned with the shoe photo {{or with the}} slogan [...] "Send another tourist, this one got away". Local {{letters to the editor}} supported Binky during both incidents, most often arguing that polar bears' <b>dangerousness</b> should be respected. [...] The Zoo's director, Sammye Seawell, criticized Warburton's actions in the Anchorage Daily News, saying [...] "he violated the rules and jeopardized the bear's life." [...] Though Seawell initially insisted that the attack would not change how the zoo was run, security around Binky's cage was upgraded to keep zoo visitors out.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, the Visual Effects Society awarded Transformers four awards: for {{the best}} visual effects in an [...] "effects driven" [...] film and the [...] "best single visual effects sequence" [...] (the Optimus-Bonecrusher battle). The film's other two awards were for its miniatures and compositing. Broadcast Music Incorporated awarded {{composer}} Steve Jablonsky for his score. Entertainment Weekly named Bumblebee as their fourth favorite computer generated character, while The Times listed Optimus Prime's depiction as the thirtieth best film robot, citing his coolness and <b>dangerousness.</b> On the negative side, Jon Voight was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor (also for , September Dawn and [...] ) at the 28th Golden Raspberry Awards.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010 Hodgson was {{returned}} to prison awaiting trial over new and unconnected allegations of rape and sexual assault of a 22-year-old woman with learning difficulties at a care home in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in August 2010. On 3March 2011, Hodgson pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court to sexual touching but denied rape. David Crook, prosecuting, {{said that he would}} offer no evidence on the rape charge, which was withdrawn. Hodgson's solicitor, Julian Young, said: [...] "The wrongful imprisonment for 27 years of my client has had a devastating effect on his life since he was cleared of the murder he did not commit [...] has been gripped by a number of personal difficulties, including a degree of alcohol abuse." [...] The judge, Mr.Justice Prince, requested the preparation of pre-sentence reports {{to address the issue of}} Hodgson's <b>dangerousness,</b> and Hodgson was remanded in custody. On 13May 2011 he was sentenced to a three-year community order. The judge said that the total of 156 days Hodgson had been remanded in custody prior to sentence would be taken into account, and told Hodgson he [...] "could walk free should he agree to complete a psychiatric order imposed by the court, but his barrister Martin Heslop QC, said his client 'clearly bears a great resentment against a criminal justice system which has deprived him of 27 years of liberty'" [...] and rejected the option.|$|E
500|$|There {{is rapidly}} growing {{interest}} in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as [...] "open-ended, {{in the sense that}} subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated {{as if they were the}} same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that [...] "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent". However, [...] "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and <b>dangerousness</b> of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." [...] For example, [...] "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454 (1981), the Supreme Court {{previously}} {{ruled on}} a Texas death penalty case {{regarding the use}} of a psychiatric examination to determine the defendant's competency to stand trial to predict future <b>dangerousness.</b> [...] In that case the Court held that the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination applied to pretrial psychiatric examinations by a prosecution psychiatrist who later testified regarding the defendant's future <b>dangerousness</b> without warning the defendant that such evidence could be used against him. The Court reasoned that although a defendant has no generalized constitutional right to remain silent at a psychiatric examination limited to the issues of sanity or competency, full Miranda warnings must be given with respect to testimony concerning future <b>dangerousness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Court's {{decision}} in this death penalty case {{was very important}} in influencing the legal opinion regarding psychiatric predictions of <b>dangerousness,</b> a position with which the [...] American Psychiatric Association and other medical ethicists disagree, leading some experts to conclude that a psychiatrist making such statements verges {{on the brink of}} being a quack. Nevertheless, courts have been willing to accept such testimony despite the lack of empirical evidence that these predictions of future <b>dangerousness</b> are accurate.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{evidence}} {{with respect}} to the <b>dangerousness</b> of pit bulls, although conflicting and inconclusive, is sufficient, in my opinion, to constitute a 'reasoned apprehension of harm'. In the face of conflicting evidence as to the feasibility of less restrictive means to protect the public, it was open to the legislature to decide to restrict the ownership of all pit bulls." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Loring and Powell gave 290 psychiatrists a {{transcript}} of a patient interview and told half of them that the patient was black {{and the other half}} white; they concluded of the results that [...] "clinicians appear to ascribe violence, suspiciousness, and <b>dangerousness</b> to black clients even though the case studies are the same as the case studies for the white clients." ...|$|E

2500|$|Felicity Hampel SC, {{president}} {{of civil liberties}} group Liberty Victoria, replied in response to Hulls, [...] "Neither imprisonment in itself nor parole in itself {{is going to stop}} everybody from committing offences. What's important to bear in mind is that a person has to be sentenced for the offence they've committed, and that might mean that somebody gets a sentence that is proportionate for the crime, but it doesn't cure them of the <b>dangerousness</b> or the characteristic that makes them continue to offend".|$|E
2500|$|The {{dog owners}} claimed the pit bull ban {{violated}} {{their right to}} equal protection since pit bulls were singled out for prohibition, for which there was [...] "no scientific or empirical basis" [...] and that <b>dangerousness</b> {{is a function of}} [...] "environment, training, and upbringing." [...] The Court of Appeals found that the evidence of the unique danger posed by pit bull-type dogs was sufficient that the dog owners could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the discrimination was unfounded, as required by previous court precedent.|$|E
2500|$|Wayfarers were {{designed}} in 1952 by American optical designer Raymond Stegeman, {{who worked for}} Bausch and Lomb, Ray-Ban's parent company at that time. The design was inspired by, [...] "a mid-century classic to rival Eames chairs and Cadillac tail fins." [...] According to design critic Stephen Bayley, the [...] "distinctive trapezoidal frame spoke a non-verbal language that hinted at unstable <b>dangerousness,</b> but one nicely tempered by the sturdy arms which, according to the advertising, gave the frames a 'masculine look.'" [...] The sunglasses also featured a new plastic molding technology.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, the United States Supreme Court {{decided the}} case of Simmons v. South Carolina. The U.S. Supreme Court held {{in this case that}} where a capital defendant's future <b>dangerousness</b> is at issue, and the only {{sentencing}} alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process requires that the jury be informed of the defendant's parole ineligibility. The state of South Carolina had changed its sentencing laws in the succeeding years to include the actual possibility of parole in absence of the death penalty, after sentencing questions were answered by the jury.|$|E
2500|$|Per the State Department, the Cuban Penal Code {{includes}} {{the concept of}} [...] "dangerousness," [...] defined as the [...] "special proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest contradiction of socialist norms." [...] If the police decide that a person exhibits signs of <b>dangerousness,</b> they may bring the offender before a court or subject him to therapy or political reeducation. [...] According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, this provision amounted to a subjective criterion used by the Government to justify violations of individual freedoms and due process for persons whose sole crime was to hold a view different from the official view.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{cases can}} be {{observed}} as well in games between chess engines. In , rather than capturing the bishop (57...Kxg6), Black played 57...Rxg4. Instead of retracting the bishop, White answered 58.h5? After Black’s response 58...Rxg5!, {{the result was a}} draw since after 59.fxg5 Kxg5 ½–½, White cannot promote its pawn as it is left with a wrong-color bishop and the black king reaches the h8 square in time. Of course, rather than embodying an instance of swindling proper, the decision of [...] to play 57...Rxg4 instead of 57...Kxg6 is based on general considerations regarding the <b>dangerousness</b> of connected passed pawns. In fact, for a chess engine to be able to swindle in a narrower sense, it requires an [...] that enables it to exploit the relative weaknesses of its particular adversary, enabling [...] to performing speculative play.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg {{wrote the}} Opinion of the Court, which {{reversed}} {{the decision of}} the South Carolina Supreme Court, finding in favor of Shafer. She wrote that [...] "whenever future <b>dangerousness</b> is at issue in a capital sentencing proceeding under South Carolina's new scheme, due process requires that the jury be informed that a life sentence carries no possibility of parole." [...] She continued with this line of thinking, explaining [...] "t is only when the jury endeavors the moral judgment whether to impose the death penalty that parole eligibility may become critical. Correspondingly, it is only at that stage that Simmons comes into play, a stage at which South Carolina law provides no third choice, no 30-year mandatory minimum, just death or life without parole." [...] Therefore, South Carolina's actions violated Shafer's Due Process rights, and the case was sent back for renewed sentencing determinations.|$|E
