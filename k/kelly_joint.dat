40|$|The position-momentum quasi-distribution {{obtained}} from an Arthurs and <b>Kelly</b> <b>joint</b> measurement model {{is used to}} obtain indirectly an "operational" time-of-arrival (TOA) distribution following a quantization procedure proposed by Kochański and Wódkiewicz [Phys. Rev. A 60, 2689 (1999) ]. This TOA distribution is not time covariant. The procedure is generalized by using other phase-space quasi-distributions, and sufficient conditions are provided for time covariance that limit the possible phase-space quasi-distributions essentially to the Wigner function, which, however, provides a non-positive TOA quasi-distribution. These problems are remedied with a different quantization procedure which, on the other hand, does not guarantee normalization. Finally an Arthurs and Kelly measurement model for TOA and energy (valid also for arbitrary conjugate variables {{when one of the}} variables is bounded from below) is worked out. The marginal TOA distribution so obtained, a distorted version of Kijowski's distribution, is time covariant, positive, and normalized...|$|E

50|$|From 1965 to 1971, <b>Kelly</b> {{chaired the}} <b>Joint</b> Committee on State Administration. In 1969, he also chaired the Special Committee Special Senate Committee to {{investigate}} {{the activities of the}} commissioner of administration, John J. McCarthy In this role, Kelly had an opportunity to bring down the administration of popular Republican Governor John A. Volpe. However, Kelly, according to a Volpe aide, assisted the governor's team by keeping them abreast {{of what was going on}} behind the scenes and assisting them in planning their strategy. Many, including fellow committee member Beryl Cohen, believed that Kelly leaked a damaging report to the Volpe administration, which gave it time to counterattack. After the investigation, Kelly enjoyed a close relationship with Volpe's Commissioner of Administration and Finance Anthony DeFalco and was able to get patronage from the Volpe's administration. In 1971, Kelly backed Kevin B. Harrington for the Senate Presidency over Ways and Means Committee Chairman James F. Burke. Harrington defeated Burke and chose Kelly to replace Burke as Chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful positions in the legislature.|$|R
