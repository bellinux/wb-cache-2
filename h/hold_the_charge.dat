50|$|FeRAM {{is based}} on the {{physical}} movement of atoms in response to an external field, which happens to be extremely fast, settling in about 1 ns. In theory, this means that FeRAM could be much faster than DRAM. However, since power has to flow into the cell for reading and writing, the electrical and switching delays would likely be similar to DRAM overall. It does seem reasonable to suggest that FeRAM would require less charge than DRAM, because DRAMs need to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge,</b> whereas FeRAM would have been written to before the charge would have drained. However, there is a delay in writing because the charge has to flow through the control transistor, which limits current somewhat.|$|E
50|$|Thin-film {{transistors}} {{are usually}} used for constructing an active matrix {{so that the}} two terms are often interchanged, even though a thin-film transistor is just one component in an active matrix and some active-matrix designs have used other components such as diodes. Whereas a passive matrix display uses a simple conductive grid to apply a voltage to the liquid crystals in the target area, an active-matrix display uses a grid of transistors and capacitors {{with the ability to}} hold a charge for a limited period of time. Because of the switching action of transistors, only the desired pixel receives a charge, and the pixel acts as a capacitor to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> until the next refresh cycle, improving image quality over a passive matrix. This is a special version of a sample-and-hold circuit.|$|E
40|$|The finite {{part of the}} self-force on {{a static}} scalar test-charge outside a Schwarzschild black hole is zero. By direct {{construction}} of Hadamard’s elementary solution, we obtain a closed-form expression for the minimally coupled scalar field produced by a test-charge held fixed in Schwarzschild spacetime. Using the closed-form expression, we compute the necessary external force required to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> stationary. Although the energy associated with the scalar field contributes to the renormalized mass of the particle (and thereby its weight), we find there is no additional self-force acting on the charge. This result is unlike the analogous electrostatic result, where, after a similar mass renormalization, there remains a finite repulsive self-force acting on a static electric test-charge outside a Schwarzschild black hole. We confirm our force calculation using Carter’s mass-variation theorem for black holes. The primary motivation for this calculation is to develop techniques and formalism for computing all forces — dissipative and non-dissipative — actin...|$|E

50|$|The {{nuclear force}} plays an {{essential}} role in storing energy that is used in nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Work (energy) is required to bring charged protons together against their electric repulsion. This energy is stored when the protons and neutrons are bound together by the nuclear force to form a nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum total of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons. The difference in masses is known as the mass defect, which can be expressed as an energy equivalent. Energy is released when a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two or more lighter nuclei. This energy is the electromagnetic potential energy that is released when the nuclear force no longer <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> <b>charged</b> nuclear fragments together.|$|R
50|$|This {{demonstration}} {{appears to}} suggest that capacitors store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar. In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred {{to the surface of}} the glass cup by corona discharge when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of <b>the</b> residual <b>charge</b> after <b>the</b> jar is reassembled. Handling the cup while disassembled does not provide enough contact to remove all <b>the</b> surface <b>charge.</b> Soda glass is hygroscopic and forms a partially conductive coating on its surface, which <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge.</b> Addenbrook (1922) found that in a dissectible jar made of paraffin wax, or glass baked to remove moisture, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> remained on <b>the</b> metal plates. Zeleny (1944) confirmed these results and observed <b>the</b> corona <b>charge</b> transfer.

5000|$|An {{induction}} furnace {{consists of a}} nonconductive crucible <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> of metal to be melted, surrounded by a coil of copper wire. A powerful alternating current flows through the wire. The coil creates a rapidly reversing magnetic field that penetrates the metal.

[...] The eddy currents, flowing through the electrical resistance of the bulk metal, heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic materials like iron, the material may also be heated by magnetic hysteresis, the reversal of the molecular magnetic dipoles in the metal. Once melted, the eddy currents cause vigorous stirring of the melt, assuring good mixing.

The goal is to obtain a good estimate of the diagonal by applying {{only a small number}} of matrix-vector products, using selected vectors. We begin by considering the use of random test vectors and then explore special vectors obtained from Hadamard matrices. The methods are tested in the context of computational materials science to estimate the diagonal of the density matrix which <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> densities.

40|$|The Fermi {{velocity}} {{is one of}} the {{key concepts}} in the study of a material, as it bears information on a variety of fundamental properties. Upon increasing demand on the device applications, graphene is viewed as a prototypical system for engineering Fermi velocity. Indeed, several efforts have succeeded in modifying Fermi velocity by varying charge carrier concentration. Here we present a powerful but simple new way to engineer Fermi velocity while <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> carrier concentration constant. We find that when the environment embedding graphene is modified, the Fermi velocity of graphene is (i) inversely proportional to its dielectric constant, reaching 2. 5 × 10 ^ 6 m/s, the highest value for graphene on any substrate studied so far and (ii) clearly distinguished from an ordinary Fermi liquid. The method demonstrated here provides a new route toward Fermi velocity engineering in a variety of two-dimensional electron systems including topological insulators.
