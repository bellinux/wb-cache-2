5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E
25|$|When the {{pressure}} of the engine's <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> is increased, its temperature also increases. In addition, heat soak from the hot exhaust gases spinning the turbine will also heat the <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> The warmer the <b>intake</b> <b>air,</b> the less dense, and the less oxygen available for the combustion event, which reduces volumetric efficiency. Not only does excessive intake-air temperature reduce efficiency, it also leads to engine knock, or detonation, which is destructive to engines.|$|E

Forced water circulation technology {{was used to}} solve the high temperature problem with the supercharger surface. Compared to natural <b>air</b> <b>intake,</b> the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> increases 30  %, and lays a foundation for increasing efficiency and reducing emission.|$|R

30|$|The <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> {{volume is}} the least because the {{manifold}} 3 is closest to the intake port, {{and it has the}} greatest resistance; the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> volume decreases from manifold 1 to manifold 3; and the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> is increased dramatically in the manifold 4 because it is the farthest from the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> and closed to the tank wall, the vortex cannot be formed.|$|R

25|$|Turbocharger units {{often make}} use of an {{intercooler}} (also known as a charge air cooler), to cool down the <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> Intercoolers are often tested for leaks during routine servicing, particularly in trucks where a leaking intercooler {{can result in a}} 20% reduction in fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|In {{automobiles}} {{and other types}} of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the <b>intake</b> <b>air,</b> so that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a supercharger), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a turbocharger).|$|E
25|$|Internal {{combustion}} engine exhaust gas containing CO {{in the air}} being drawn into a diving air compressor. CO in the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> cannot be stopped by any filter. The exhausts of all internal {{combustion engine}}s running on petroleum fuels contain some CO, {{and this is a}} particular problem on boats, where the intake of the compressor cannot be arbitrarily moved as far as desired from the engine and compressor exhausts.|$|E

The standard starter is a recoil start type, with an electric starter optional. An integral alternating current generator producing 170watts at 12volts with external rectifier-regulator is optional. The engine includes an <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> filter and can be fitted with an intake silencer system.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is generally}} avoided {{as far as}} is reasonably practicable by positioning of the air intake in uncontaminated air, filtration of particulates from the <b>intake</b> <b>air,</b> use of suitable compressor design and appropriate lubricants, and ensuring that running temperatures are not excessive. Where the residual risk is excessive, a hopcalite catalyst {{can be used in}} the high pressure filter to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, which is far less toxic.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E

50|$|Most {{vehicles}} manufactured {{from the}} mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems that regulate {{the temperature of}} the air entering the engine's intake tract, providing warm air when the engine is cold and cold air when the engine is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy. With the advent of advanced emission controls and more advanced fuel injection methods modern vehicles do not have a thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system and the factory installed <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> draws unregulated cold air. Aftermarket cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems are marketed with claims of increased engine efficiency and performance. The putative principle behind a cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> is that cooler air has a higher density, thus containing more oxygen per volume unit than warmer air.|$|R
25|$|The ported shroud is a {{performance}} enhancement {{that allows the}} compressor to operate at significantly lower flows. It achieves this by forcing a simulation of impeller stall to occur continuously. Allowing some air to escape at this location inhibits the onset of surge and widens the operating range. While peak efficiencies may decrease, high efficiency may be achieved over a greater range of engine speeds. Increases in compressor efficiency result in slightly cooler (more dense) <b>intake</b> <b>air,</b> which improves power. This is a passive structure that is constantly open (in contrast to compressor exhaust blow off valves, which are mechanically or electronically controlled). The ability of the compressor to provide high boost at low rpm may also be increased marginally (because near choke conditions the compressor draws air inward through the bleed path). Ported shrouds are used by many turbocharger manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> flow.|$|E
25|$|An interim {{statement}} {{was published in}} February 2012 in line with European Union regulatory requirements. Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below flight idle power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The stall warning horn also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|E

50|$|A {{classification}} of equipment (shelves and cabinets) into Equipment-Cooling (EC) classes serves {{the purpose of}} classifying the equipment {{with regard to the}} cooling <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> and hot <b>air</b> exhaust locations, i.e., the equipment airflow schemes or protocols.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the engine <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> flow, causing both engines to flame out after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard operating procedure. It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.|$|E

500|$|The {{keys to the}} R engine's high {{power-to-weight ratio}} were its {{supercharger}} design, ability to run at high revolutions due to its structural strength, and the special blends of fuel used. The double-sided supercharger impeller was a new development for Rolls-Royce: running {{at a ratio of}} almost 8:1, it could supply <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> at up to 18pounds per square inch (psi) (1.24bar) above atmospheric pressure, a figure known as [...] "boost" [...] and commonly abbreviated as [...] "+xlb". By comparison the maximum boost of the earlier Rolls-Royce Kestrel design was +6lb (0.4bar), this figure not being achieved until 1934. The high boost pressures initially caused the spark plugs to fail on test, and eventually the Lodge type X170 plug was chosen as it proved to be extremely reliable.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{discusses}} on {{the fuel}} economy and exhaust emissions at variations of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure. The <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure {{is influenced by}} the degree of opening throttle plate and venturi effect which draw the fuel to the combustion chamber in carbureted engine. The experimental work is conducted at variations of engine speed and load using a single cylinder four stroke SI engine attached with 5 kW dynamometer. Gas analyzer was used to measure exhaust emissions compositions and to identify the quality of combustion. The results show that the standard <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system resulted in rich combustion which led to the incomplete combustion due to less availability of air. By eliminating the air filter, the air flow restriction through the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system was reduced. Hence, better combustion and less unburned components are achieved because of higher air availability. A higher <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure is required to increase air density in allowing for better combustion within a limited time to improve fuel economy, power output and exhaust emissions. Complete combustion also lead to the reduction of unburned components such as carbon (C), hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydroxide (OH) that resulted in less hazardous emissions...|$|R
