5|$|Worker {{policing}} {{occurs when}} worker bees {{in the colony}} are genetically {{more closely related to}} the queen than the reproductive female. In many instances, the eggs of the <b>female</b> <b>worker</b> are eaten, or she is repeatedly attacked by other workers. This mechanism of egg removal ensures that the queen's sons predominate.|$|E
5|$|Official sources {{state that}} the rioting began at around 2 a.m., and {{there were reports that}} they lasted until at least 4.30 a.m., when police arrived.

Two dozen Han workers armed with batons and metal rods then responded; they called for backup using their phones.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely, <b>female</b> <b>worker</b> bees {{lay eggs}} that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.|$|E
30|$|<b>Female</b> <b>workers</b> often {{encounter}} various obstacles, such as hostile working environments, including unpleasant {{behavior by}} male colleagues, public questioning of a woman’s competence, and resentment that <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> are taking men’s jobs (Ferguson and Sharples 1994). Among the various obstacles that <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> {{face in the}} blue-collar occupations, how <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> in blue-collar occupations have been portrayed in the media is of grievous concern. Kleiman (1988) indicated that <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> in blue-collar occupations are often portrayed as “helpless victims” and “unable to act in their own interests”. <b>Female</b> <b>workers</b> in blue-collar occupations are still depicted negatively in the media (Jhally and Alper 2005). The negative stereotype of <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> in blue-collar occupations has hindered their entrance to the occupations, however, only few studies have investigated this issue. In this regard, exploration of how <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> in blue-collar occupations are communicated in the media is highly needed as an initial step of resolving the issue.|$|R

5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in <b>female</b> <b>worker</b> bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E
5|$|Organizations are now {{attempting}} to assist and empower female migrant workers through {{training and education}} on their labor-related rights. Legal clinics have begun to assist female migrants in filing claims against employers and local labor bureaus. One case of <b>female</b> <b>worker</b> exploitation in the Hua Yi garment factory in Beijing resulted in mistreatment by management as well as withholding pay for at least 24 women.

40|$|Comments are Welcome. This paper {{analyzes}} how {{the number}} of female managers at top positions affects other male or <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> in the workplace. We use mergers and acquisitions as a natural experiment. When a firm with few top female managers acquires another firm with many top <b>female</b> managers, <b>workers</b> in the acquiring firm suddenly face more top female managers. In such a case, this paper finds that other <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> in the acquiring firm become less likely to quit after the acquisition, but male workers become more likely to quit. In contrast, if {{the number of}} top male managers increases, <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> do not seem to care, while male workers become less likely to quit. This result suggests that gender policies such as gender quotas will help <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> as intended, but will negatively affect male workers. We distinguish whether top female managers are within the same occupation or in different occupations, and also analyze the number (or share) of female supervisors at one rank above, or the relative number of <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> below one’s own rank. These analyses help us distinguish different theoretical explanations...|$|R
5|$|The <b>female</b> <b>worker</b> ants do {{not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs. There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; {{this may be a}} common trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are able to control the direction of their descent while falling.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{are known}} to produce their own eggs, but these eggs are unfertilised and hatch into male ants. There is a chance of workers attacking a {{particular}} individual who has successfully produced male offspring due {{to a change in}} a workers cuticular hydrocarbon; cuticular hydrocarbons are believed to {{play a vital role in}} the regulation of reproduction. However, this is not always the case. Myrmecia is one of several ant genera which possess gamergate workers, where a <b>female</b> <b>worker</b> is able to reproduce with mature males when the colony is lacking a queen. Myrmecia workers are highly fertile and can successfully mate with males. A colony of M. pyriformis without a queen was collected in 1998 and kept in captivity, during which time the gamergates produced viable workers for three years. Ovarian dissections showed that three workers of this colony mated with males and produced female workers. Queens have bigger ovaries than the workers, with 44 ovarioles while workers have 8 to 14. Spermatheca is present in M. gulosa workers, based on eight dissected individuals showing a spermatheca structurally similar to those found in queens. These spermathecas did not have any sperm. Why the queen was not replaced is still unknown.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the job {{adjustment}} situation of middle-aged women who are (re-) entering the labor market after a long break of job career and may be experiencing conflicts in the process of their settlement in the new workplace. Most of previous studies about female labor market have focused on the causes and the impact of ‘career interruptions’ of <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> pointing out the social and personal problems caused by the withdrawal of married <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> due to burden of housekeeping and child-raising. However, another important issue except preventing such withdrawal of <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> is how to encourage the return or new entrance of middle-aged <b>female</b> <b>workers</b> who are out of the labor market for a while and to help them smoothly settling down in new working environments. In this respect, this study was conducted to gather basic information on workplace adaptation status of middle-aged (re-) employed women.

25|$|Much {{debate and}} {{controversy}} {{exist in the}} scientific literature about the dynamics and apparent benefit of the combined forms of reproduction in honey bees and other social insects, known as the haplodiploid sex-determination system.

They {{also serve as a}} vehicle to mate with a new queen to fertilize her eggs. <b>Female</b> <b>worker</b> bees develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid in origin, which means that the sperm from a father provides a second set of 16chromosomes for a total of 32one set from each parent.
