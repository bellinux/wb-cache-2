40|$|This study {{adopts a}} {{two-stage}} approach, {{data envelopment analysis}} (DEA) and tobit regression, to investigate the bank <b>efficiency</b> <b>index</b> and <b>efficiency</b> effect incorporated into account credit and market risk. The authors use the DEA method {{in the first stage}} to estimate bank cost efficiency, and the tobit regression model in the second stage to estimate efficiency effects. The empirical results are summarized as follows: First, results indicate that risk factors impact bank efficiency. Banks with a higher degree of nonperforming loans or value at risk will see efficiency decrease by incorporating account risk. Second, there is no significant difference with the bank <b>efficiency</b> <b>index</b> taking only credit risk or market risk into consideration, but there are significant differences on the bank <b>efficiency</b> <b>index</b> in situations without risk or with credit and/or market risks. Finally, the study notes that different bank <b>efficiency</b> <b>indexes</b> calculated according to different risks are affected by different factors.

Drying {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} process in producing a good quality of rosella tea. The study was aimed to evaluate the <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> of rosella tea by using a cabinet dryer. The source of energy for the dryer was from the burning of charcoal. The charcoal was prepared from the coconut shell since it was abundant biomass product. About 7. 5 kg of fresh rosella flower was dried for 17 hours. The total of charcoal consumed was 17 kg. The moisture content of rosella flower was reduced from 90 to 12 %. The analysis showed that the total of energy produced from the burning of 17 kg charcoal was 309. 4 MJ, whilst the total energy needed to dry the flower was 15, 72 MJ. Therefore, the <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> was still low about 4. 58 %.

Scheme of paths is compact representation of the radioelectronic complex system?s behavior and it is easily and directly formed from the behavior algorithm?s flowchart. <b>Efficiency</b> <b>indexes</b> of tested behavior algorithm ? probability and mean time value of successful performance ? were obtained.

Very few papers have assessed the energy efficiency of office buildings using real data.

Overall energy efficiency is decomposed into two indices: the architectural energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>index,</b> and the management energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>index.</b> This decomposition is an essential step in identifying the main drivers of energy inefficiency and designing measures for improvement.
