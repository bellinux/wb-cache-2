500|$|The {{costumes and}} looks {{for each of}} the {{different}} women were chosen by Spears and Kahn. The scenes in the sauna were suggested by Kahn, {{as a response to the}} attacks Spears received over the years about her weight. He stated, [...] "I knew that the whole world would be watching, so I wanted something in there that stated, 'This is Britney, this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should respect her'". The set was cleared for two hours, leaving her and Kahn alone shooting the sequence. Kahn also decided to end the video with an image of Spears smiling, because [...] "We just needed to tell everybody she's OK".|$|E
500|$|Artist V. Jeevananthan {{compared}} Aval Appadithan {{to other}} films whose central theme was women, such as Charulata (1964), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), and Panchagni (1986), while also labelling them as [...] "classics {{that put the}} spotlight on women." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, Dhakam, which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that Aval Appadithan uses a [...] "fluid narrative style" [...] and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and [...] "glossy pictorialism". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks [...] "what {{do you think of}} 'women's liberation'", [...] Arun's wife answers, [...] "I don't know", [...] to which Manju says [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> are happy", send the message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour.|$|E
500|$|The truth finally emerges that Manju {{was merely}} baiting Thyagu {{to teach him}} a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he {{attempts}} {{to take advantage of}} her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, [...] "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, [...] "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, [...] "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".|$|E

2500|$|Feeling that he {{had failed}} to {{sufficiently}} address and explain the context of his relationship with the Reverend, Obama began writing the speech that became [...] "A More Perfect Union". Obama's usual speechwriting practice during the 2008 campaign was to discuss major themes with speechwriter Jon Favreau, let Favreau write a draft, and then edit the result. However, on Saturday, March 15, Obama dictated a lengthy draft of this speech to Favreau, who edited the speech the next day. [...] Obama stayed up until 3:00 a.m. Sunday night working on the speech, and continued to work on it Monday and {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday. [...] He sent his final draft of the speech to Favreau and campaign strategist David Axelrod. After reading Obama's final draft, Axelrod sent him an email saying [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should be president." ...|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} speech MSNBC host Chris Matthews admitted, [...] "I {{have to tell}} you, a little chill in my legs right now. That is an amazing moment in history right there. It is surely an amazing moment. A keynoter like I have never heard." [...] He added later in the night, [...] "...I have seen the first black {{president}} there. And the reason I say that is because I think the immigrant experience combined with the African background, combined with the incredible education, combined with his beautiful speech, not every politician gets help with the speech, but that speech {{was a piece of}} work." [...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes. What does Obama believe about this war?" [...] On PBS, columnist David Brooks responded positively, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> go to conventions, to watch a speech like this," [...] while Mark Shields said, [...] "A star is born." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Brooklyn office, Giles and O'Keefe tell a loan {{counselor}} {{they want}} to buy a house, and that an abusive pimp is [...] "aggressively" [...] pursuing Giles. She [...] "wanted to leave because it is scary being subjected to a huge man who has control over your life." [...] The ACORN counselor advises her [...] "you get a tin if [...] is going to come beat you... you get a tin and bury it down in there and you put the money right in and you put grass over it and you don't tell a single soul." [...] When discussing getting a house and Giles' earnings, O'Keefe says that Giles is very honest and an ACORN counselor replies, [...] "honest {{is not going to get}} you the house that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> probably been denied cause you probably going in saying." [...] Another stated to Giles, [...] "you can't say what you do for a living." [...] For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a [...] "freelancer". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E
2500|$|Ms. Splosion Man was {{announced}} December 3, 2010 via {{a press release}} and teaser trailer. [...] "I think with Splosion Man a follow up was something {{we really wanted to}} do, and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> never saw DLC for that game. We could have churned out new levels, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't just want to do Splosion Man 2, it had to be something a little more interesting. That is why we decided to do MSM," [...] stated Josh Bear of Twisted Pixel Games. [...] The team chose a female variation on 'Splosion Man as an homage to Ms. Pac-Man, which, according to Bear, the game pays homage to. [...] Bear continued by explaining that as Ms. Pac-Man was an improvement on Pac-Man so Ms. Splosion Man is meant to be an advancement on Splosion Man. [...] He stated the goal was to ensure that the game [...] "stands out on its own as a much bigger and better game overall, not to be confused as an over-priced DLC pack which I think a lot of retail [...] "sequels" [...] can be a lot of the time." [...] The game runs on Twisted Pixel's BEARD engine, which has been used to power all of their titles.|$|E
