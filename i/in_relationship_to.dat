5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E
5|$|While using Dante's terza rima style, {{the poem}} {{continues}} by describing the Battle of Britain. The image of warfare merges with {{the depiction of}} Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air-raids on London. In the second section, a ghost, representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds, begins talking to the narrator of the poem. The ghost discusses change, art in general, and how humankind is flawed. The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity, according to the ghost, is to experience purgation through fire. The fire is described {{in a manner similar}} to Julian of Norwich's writing about God's love and discussed <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the shirt of Nessus, a shirt that burns its wearer. Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern. The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn, and that salvation should be the goal of humankind.|$|E

25|$|Afrocentric {{education}} is education designed to empower {{peoples of the}} African diaspora. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them.

Like educational leaders of other cultures, proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group–so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the Africans in a given context.|$|E

25|$|Brown was an {{unsuccessful}} candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in 1966, {{and served in}} the Hawaii State Senate 1968 to 1974.

Brown managed the passage of long-term environmental protection policies, and advocated for opportunities through which the hotel industry might support the preservation of Hawaiian culture and historic sites. Brown’s position on tourism in Hawaii, made public at the 1984 Governor’s Tourism Conference, represents a key statement for the role of tourism in the state.|$|E
25|$|Simon {{followed}} Chester Barnard who {{pointed out}} that “the decisions that an individual makes {{as a member of}} an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions”. Personal choices may be determined whether an individual joins a particular organization, and continue to be made in his or her extra–organizational private life. As a member of an organization, however, that individual makes decisions not <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> personal needs and results, but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent, purpose, and effect. Organizational inducements, rewards, and sanctions are all designed to form, strengthen, and maintain this identification.|$|E

In August 1918, railway sections were formed under the Gubcheks.

25|$|Gutasaga {{contains}} {{legends of}} how the island was settled by Þieluar and populated by his descendants.

It later tells that the Gutes voluntarily submitted to the king of Sweden and asserts that the submission was based on mutual agreement, and notes the duties and obligations of the Swedish King and Bishop <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> Gotland. According to some historians, it is therefore an effort not only to write down the history of Gotland, but also to assert Gotland's independence from Sweden.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 Doehring {{took over}} the {{chairmanship}} of the Evangelical Alliance to Preserve German-Protestant Interests (EB). His appointment to this position was not unanimously approved by the alliance's members. His insistence on uncritical attachment to the abdicated Kaiser and his rigid hostility towards the Catholic Church contributed to the increasing isolation of the Protestant church in German society, and in particular <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the proletariat and to bourgeois democracy. Doehring also refused increasingly urgent prospective interdenominational political cooperation with state-preserving Catholic forces, which had been drifting towards the Center Party and the DNVP since the end of 1926. Following the withdrawal of Adolf von Harnack and Otto Baumgarten, the conflict over the direction of the EB culminated in Doehring's resignation in February 1927.|$|E
