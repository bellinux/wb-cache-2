50|$|Because a {{bonus issue}} does not {{represent}} an economic event - no wealth changes hands. The current shareholders simply receive new shares, for free, and in proportion to their previous share in the company. Therefore, a <b>bonus</b> <b>share</b> issue {{is very similar to}} a stock split. The only practical difference is that a bonus issue creates a change {{in the structure of the}} company's shareholders' equity (in accounting). Another difference between a bonus issue and a stock split is that while a stock split usually also splits the company's authorized share capital, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>shares</b> only changes its issued share capital (or even only its outstanding shares).|$|R

Little is known about these private enterprises although these are surpassing the state-owned enterprises to become the most important corporate sector in China.

We also examine how a firm’s political connection, generally believed to be instrumental to a firm’s success in transition economies, affects its business policies.

5000|$|In late June, Matthews was {{selected}} first {{overall in the}} 2016 draft by the Toronto Maple Leafs, becoming the first American to be picked with the top selection since Patrick Kane in 2007. He had been widely expected to go first overall {{for over a year}} leading up to the event, consistently topping prospect charts and major scouting reporters. Media speculation suggested that Matthews and the team had engaged in a minor contract dispute over the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> performance bonuses; Matthews was asking the team for a contract similar to that of Connor McDavid or Jack Eichel, which were both valued at $3.775 million annually (with all bonuses factored in). Although Maple Leafs general manager Lou Lamoriello has been very open over his disapproval <b>of</b> including <b>bonuses</b> in player contracts in the past, he was very clear in stating that performance bonuses were never an issue while discussing Auston's contract. It is widely expected that first overall selections, as well as any other highly touted early draft picks, receive the maximum entry-level compensation under the NHL's Collective Bargaining Agreement. Lamoriello had previously been involved in a contract dispute while in New Jersey with 4th overall pick Adam Larsson over the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonuses.</b> Larsson came out of negotiations without any performance bonuses attached to his entry-level deal. On July 21, the two parties finalized a deal, with Matthews inking a three-year entry-level contract, which included the maximum allocation <b>of</b> performance <b>bonuses.</b> Lamoriello would go on to state that the contract was agreed upon within 10 minutes of sitting down with Matthews' agent Pat Brisson, and that the deal was done [...] "the Toronto way." [...] Brisson would later confirm that the two parties did not have any issues ironing out the deal. The contract was identical in value to those McDavid and Eichel had secured a year earlier. Two weeks later, Matthews was given the NLA Youngster of the Year award, which is reserved for the league's top rookie. It would be his fifth award from his stint in Switzerland.|$|R
