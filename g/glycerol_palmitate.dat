50|$|Palmitic acid is used {{to produce}} soaps, cosmetics, and {{industrial}} mold release agents. These applications use sodium palmitate, which is commonly obtained by saponification of palm oil. To this end, palm oil, rendered from palm tree (species Elaeis guineensis), is treated with sodium hydroxide (in the form of caustic soda or lye), which causes hydrolysis of the ester groups, yielding <b>glycerol</b> and sodium <b>palmitate.</b>|$|R
40|$|A major {{antigenic}} constituent {{of the inner}} membrane of Escherichia coli ML 308 - 225 {{was identified as a}} 28. 5 -kilodalton lipoprotein containing covalently bound <b>glycerol</b> and <b>palmitate.</b> This lipoprotein corresponded to antigen 47 in the crossed immunoelectrophoresis profile of membrane vesicles (P. Owen and H. R. Kaback, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75 : 3148 - 3152, 1978) and to new lipoprotein 4 described for E. coli B by Ichihara et al. (S. Ichihara, H. Hussain, and S. Mizushima, J. Biol. Chem. 256 : 3125 - 3129, 1980). Experiments involving isopycnic centrifugation of spheroplast envelopes indicated that antigen 47 was enriched in cytoplasmic membrane subfractions of low density. The protein did not manifest an obvious association with peptidoglycan of the types displayed by the bound form of the Braun (Lpp) lipoprotein, the 21 -kilodalton peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein, or the ompF/C gene products. Antibodies specific for antigen 47 were used to demonstrate that the molecule was immunologically distinct from both the Braun lipoprotein and the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein of E. coli. Antigens of similar molecular mass to and cross-reacting with antigen 47 were present in the envelopes of eight type species of the Enterobacteriaceae. A protocol for the purification of antigen 47, based upon its solubility in a chloroform-methanol-water mixture, was developed...|$|R

The specific activities and concentrations of plasma <b>palmitate,</b> <b>glycerol,</b> or glucose and expired CO 2 were measured at various intervals after the injection {{for a period of}} 24 h.

A bicarbonate subsystem was also included in the model to account for its role in shaping the CO 2 curves...|$|R
40|$|Isolated liver cells {{prepared}} from starved sheep converted palmitate into {{ketone bodies}} {{at twice the}} rate seen with cells from fed animals. Carnitine stimulated palmitate oxidation only in liver cells from fed sheep, and completely abolished the difference between fed and starved animals in palmitate oxidation. The rates of palmitate oxidation to CO 2 and of octanoate oxidation to ketone bodies and CO 2 were not affected by starvation or carnitine. Neither starvation nor carnitine altered the ratio of 3 -hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate or the rate of esterification of [1 - 14 C]palmitate. Propionate, lactate, pyruvate and fructose inhibited ketogenesis from palmitate in cells from fed sheep. Starvation or the addition of carnitine decreased the antiketogenic effectiveness of gluconeogenic precursors. Propionate was the most potent inhibitor of ketogenesis, 0. 8 mM producing 50 % inhibition. Propionate, lactate, fructose and <b>glycerol</b> increased <b>palmitate</b> esterification under all conditions examined. Lactate, pyruvate and fructose stimulated oxidation of palmitate and octanoate to CO 2. Starvation {{and the addition of}} gluconeogenic precursors stimulated apparent palmitate utilization by cells. Propionate, lactate and pyruvate decreased cellular long-chain acylcarnitine concentrations. Propionate decreased cell contents of CoA and acyl-CoA. It is suggested that propionate may control hepatic ketogenesis by acting {{at some point in the}} beta-oxidation sequence. The results are discussed in relation to the differences in the regulation of hepatic fatty acid metabolism between sheep and rats...|$|R
40|$|Comparison of estuarine {{detrital}} microbiota grown {{with and}} without light {{in the absence of}} macroscopic grazing showed shifts in the community structure that enabled correlation between various biochemical measures. Analysis of these biochemical measures showed that growth in light induces the smallest increases in procaryotic attributes such as muramic acid; wall glucosamine; lipid phosphate; total extractable adenosine nucleotides; short-branched, cyclopropane, and cis-vaccenic fatty acids; lipid glucose and mannose; the incorporation of acetate into lipid; and the formation of deoxyribonucleic acid from thymidine. Measures of the microfauna such as lipid inositol and the γ-linolenic series of polyenoic fatty acids also increased minimally in the light-grown microbiota. Measures of sulfo-lipid synthesis, lipid <b>glycerol,</b> total extractable <b>palmitate,</b> 18 -carbon polyenoic fatty acids, and total polyenoic fatty acids longer than 20 carbons increased 10 - to 15 -fold in algae and fungi. Chlorophyll a, lipid galactose, and the 16 - and 20 - carbon polyenoic fatty acids characteristic of diatoms increased maximally in the light. This increase of diatom measure correlated with the sheets of diatoms detected by scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} {{procedure for}} determining the pattern of peptidoglycan synthesis during the division cycle has allowed the measurement of the rate of side wall synthesis during the division cycle without the contribution due to pole formation. As predicted by a model proposing that the surface growth of the cell is regulated by mass increase, we find a decrease in side wall synthesis {{in the latter half}} of the division cycle. This supports the proposal that, upon invagination, pole growth accommodates a significant proportion of the increasing cell mass and that residual side wall growth occurs in response to the residual mass increase not accommodated by pole volume. The observed side wall synthesis patterns support the proposal that mass increase is a major, and possibly sole, regulator of bacterial surface increase. Membrane synthesis during the division cycle of the gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium has also been measured with similar methods. The rate of membrane synthesis [...] measured by incorporation of radioactive <b>glycerol</b> or <b>palmitate</b> relative to simultaneous labeling with radioactive leucine [...] exhibits the same pattern as peptidoglycan synthesis. The results are compatible with a model of cell surface growth containing the following elements. (i) During the period of the division cycle prior to invagination, growth of the cell occurs predominantly in the side wall and the cell grows only in length. (ii) When invagination begins, pole growth accommodates some cytoplasmic increase, leading to a concomitant decrease in side wall synthesis. (iii) Surface synthesis increases relative to mass synthesis during the last part of the division cycle because of pole formation. It is proposed here that membrane synthesis passively follows the pattern of peptidoglycan synthesis during the division cycle...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia regulates {{adipocyte}} metabolism. Hexosamine biosynthesis is {{implicated in}} murine 3 T 3 L 1 adipocyte differentiation {{and is a}} possible underlying mechanism for hypoxia's effects on adipocyte metabolism. Lipid metabolism was studied in human visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes in in vitro hypoxic culture with adipophilic staining, <b>glycerol</b> release, and <b>palmitate</b> oxidation assays. Gene expression and hexosamine biosynthesis activation was studied with QRTPCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and Western blotting. Hypoxia inhibits lipogenesis and induces basal lipolysis in visceral and subcutaneous human adipocytes. Hypoxia induces fatty acid oxidation in visceral adipocytes but {{had no effect on}} fatty acid oxidation in subcutaneous adipocytes. Hypoxia inhibits hexosamine biosynthesis in adipocytes. Inhibition of hexosamine biosynthesis with azaserine attenuates lipogenesis and induces lipolysis in adipocytes in normoxic conditions, while promotion of hexosamine biosynthesis with glucosamine in hypoxic conditions slightly increases lipogenesis. Hypoxia's net effect on human adipocyte lipid metabolism would be expected to impair adipocyte buffering capacity and contribute to systemic lipotoxicity. Our data suggest that hypoxia may mediate its effects on lipogenesis and lipolysis through inhibition of hexosamine biosynthesis. Hexosamine biosynthesis represents a target for manipulation of adipocyte metabolism...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} early {{defects in}} glucose production, lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in non-obese, normally glucose tolerant women, who are nevertheless {{at risk of}} type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Ten women with previous gestational diabetes (pGDM) and ten controls were studied in two 4 h infusions of stable isotopes 6, 6 -(2) H(2) -glucose, 1 -(13) C-palmitate, and 1, 1, 2, 3, 3 -(2) H(5) -glycerol with and without infusion of adrenaline. Fatty acid oxidation was quantified using indirect calorimetry and (13) CO(2) measurements. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated using the short insulin tolerance test. RESULTS: The pGDM and control women were non-obese and carefully matched for body mass index and fat mass. Whole body insulin sensitivity and basal insulin concentrations {{did not differ significantly}} but basal glucose concentrations were increased in women with pGDM. During a 0. 9 % saline infusion, glucose appearance was not significantly different at the first (90 - 120 min) and second (210 - 240 min) steady states. However, glucose appearance decreased in controls but was maintained in the pGDM women (- 0. 33 +/- 0. 02 vs - 0. 03 +/- 0. 08 mg/kg per min; P = 0. 004). Basal glycerol appearance (0. 27 +/- 0. 02 vs 0. 38 +/- 0. 03 mg/kg per min; P = 0. 02), palmitate appearance (0. 74 +/- 0. 09 vs 1. 05 +/- 0. 09 mg/kg per min; P = 0. 03) and palmitate oxidation (0. 07 +/- 0. 01 vs 0. 10 +/- 0. 01 mg/kg per min; P = 0. 03) were lower in the pGDM women. During the adrenaline infusion, changes in glucose, <b>glycerol</b> and <b>palmitate</b> concentrations and kinetics were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained glucose production during fasting is an early abnormality in non-obese subjects at risk of type 2 diabetes. Lipolysis and non-esterified fatty acid appearance and oxidation are diminished, suggesting an increased tendency to store fat. The observations are not readily attributable to differences in insulin or catecholamine sensitivity...|$|R
50|$|Fungal {{growth is}} {{affected}} by the presence of optimal nutrients necessary for growth, by the presence of minerals, by temperature, by pH and by osmotic pressure. The presence of organic nutrients in the medium that C. coronatus finds itself in favors the formation of vegetative germ tubes, with glucose inducing vegetative germ growth far more effectively than asparagine. In terms of necessary nutrients for growth and survival, glucose and trehalose are both good sources of carbon for C. coronatus, other adequate sources of carbon are fructose, mannose, maltose, <b>glycerol,</b> oleate, stearate, <b>palmitate</b> and casamino acids, whereas galactose, starch and glycogen are all poor sources of carbon for C. coronatus. When looking at nitrogen, complex nitrogen sources seem to be best suited for optimal C. coronatus growth, however L-asparagine, ammonium salts, L-aspartic acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and urea can all adequately be used by the fungus as nitrogen sources to varying extents. This fungus is unable to utilize nitrate as a nitrogen source. Certain minerals are able to stimulate fungal growth, for C. coronatus these minerals are Magnesium and Zinc. In terms of temperature effects on fungal growth, the temperature at which C. coronatus growth is at an optimal stage on agar is 27 °C, and the minimum temperature at which it is able to grow on agar is 6 °C. Though there is no growth seen below 6 °C, good survival of C. coronatus has been demonstrated at temperatures of 1 °C. Finally, the maximum growth temperature of C. coronatus on agar is 33 °C, this maximum growth temperature increases to 40 °C when the fungus is grown in liquid culture.In terms of pH effects on C. coronatus, the optimal pH broad range of growth for this fungus is pH 5.5 to pH 7, however sub-optimal growth can occur anywhere within the range of pH 3.5 to pH 8. In terms of pH dependent physiology, there is more frequent production of germ tubes on mildly acidic or neutral media (range of pH 5 to pH 7) with the greatest percent of germination occurring at pH 5. In addition, the percentage of spores that produce secondary spores is far greater on acidic media than on both neutral and basic media. In addition to organic nutrient and mineral presence, temperature and pH, osmotic pressure also has an effect on C. coronatus growth and dispersal. The spores of this fungus are more likely to germinate at lower osmotic pressures, and any medium with osmotic pressures greater than 10 atm will almost entirely inhibit germination of this fungus.|$|R
40|$|<b>Palmitate,</b> glucose, and <b>glycerol</b> {{oxidation}} to CO 2 {{were investigated}} in the fasted state in 10 normal subjects and 9 patients (6 hyperlipoproteinemias, 1 xanthomatosis, and 2 glycogenosis) after intravenous injection of [1 14 C]palmitate, [1 14 C]glucose, or [1 14 C]glycerol in tracer amounts. The specific activities and concentrations of plasma <b>palmitate,</b> <b>glycerol,</b> or glucose and expired CO 2 were measured at various intervals after the injection {{for a period}} of 24 hr. All studies were analyzed in terms of a multicompartment model describing the structure for each of the subsystems, the transfer of carbon label between subsystems, and the oxidation to CO 2. A bicarbonate subsystem was also included in the model to account for its role in shaping the CO 2 curves. All the CO 2 activity following a palmitate injection could be accounted for by a direct oxidative pathway from plasma FFA {{with the addition of a}} 20 min delay compartment. The same also applied to glucose, except that the delay compartment had a mean time of about 150 min. Only about a third of the injected glycerol was directly oxidized to CO 2 from plasma; the delay time was about 4 min. Most of the remainder was converted to glucose. In normals about 45 % of the FFA is oxidized to CO 2 directly. This constitutes about 30 % of the total CO 2 output. In hyperlipemia the CO 2 output is nearly unchanged and the contribution from FFA is nearly the same. There is a considerable increase (factor of 2), however, in FFA mobilization, most of which is probably diverted to triglyceride synthesis. The glucose and glycerol subsystems are roughly the same in normals and hyperlipemics. About 50 % of glucose is oxidized by the direct pathways which accounts for about 35 % of the CO 2 output. Glycerol accounts for only 1. 5 % of the CO 2 produced. Major changes occurred in the glycerol and glucose subsystems in glycogenesis. The changes are consistent with the known deficiency in glucose 6 phosphatase in this disorder. There is a considerable reduction (factor of 2 or more) in the release of glucose to plasma (gluconeogenesis) and in the conversion of glycerol to glucose. Despite the integration of the kinetics of the glucose, glycerol, and FFA subsystems over a 24 hr period, 36 % of the CO 2 production was still unaccounted for in normals and 50 % in hyperlipemics. Thus, some of the carbon must wind up in very slowly turning over pools which supply CO 2 through subsystems not covered in these studies (triglycerides, glycogen, amino acids, etc.).
