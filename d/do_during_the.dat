5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects that exist in the setting, and what characters can <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> fall of Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E
5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to <b>do.</b> <b>During</b> <b>the</b> opening of the recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her {{that she has been}} chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E

25|$|Gregory also {{mandated}} {{a number}} of practices within the Church. He decreed that in Lent, on the Thursdays, people should fast, {{just as they were}} required to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> other days of the week. Apparently the practice had been frowned upon by popes of previous centuries, as pagans had fasted on Thursday as part of their worship of Jupiter. He also prescribed the offices to be said during church services on Thursdays in Lent, as prior to this, the Mass of the preceding Sunday was said on those Thursdays.|$|E
25|$|Richardson had {{advocated}} {{the use of}} the Police on motorbikes in the mid 1930s because of their speed and maneuverability. When the Second World War started he increased the number to at least six. The motor bikes had sidecars attached and were equipped with gas masks and tin helmets. In January 1940 Alfred Richardson issued a booklet for animal owners in Halifax. It listed what animal owners should <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> expected blitz. 11 civilians were killed and 10 injured when a bomb dropped on Hanson Lane, Halifax on 22 November 1940. Ten other local bombing incidents occurred between June 1940 and December 1944. There was a total of 588 casualties in Halifax in the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|Lloyd's second {{stint in}} WCW {{was when he}} was booked to be {{defeated}} by The Great Muta at a house show in Atlanta. Following that match, at Muta's request, Lloyd joined Muta on a string of WCW house shows before he moved to Japan in 1993. He joined the UWFI as a guest of shootfighter Nobuhiko Takada, and competed against Japanese and American fighters. Lloyd returned to the United States after UWFI folded in 1996, and during a conversation with friend Diamond Dallas Page, he mentioned that he was planning to integrate martial arts into his wrestling, which he had been unable to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early days of his career. At Page's request, WCW president Eric Bischoff, a martial arts practitioner himself, met with Lloyd for three hours and signed him to a contract.|$|E
25|$|Once La Rue {{was engaged}} with the Grande chapelle, he made two trips to Spain. On the second trip, in 1506, he was shipwrecked in the English Channel, and spent three {{months at the}} court of Henry VII of England. After two more years in Spain, {{in the service of}} Juana of Castile – Joanna the Mad – he {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1508, probably because Juana had been forced out of power (her husband, Philip, had died of typhus in 1506). Juana was inconsolable, unable to leave the corpse of her dead husband, and had become quite insane; why La Rue stayed as long as he did is not known, but it is not impossible that his dark, intensely expressive music {{was one of the few}} things that brought her solace. In addition, he was treated well. Juana promoted him to premier chapelain, the head of the chapel, and paid him twice what the other singers received; paying the singers was apparently the one of the only practical administrative matters she was able to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> period of her madness.|$|E
25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not {{keep track of what}} numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, so as to be able to identify unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one is counting persons, then one can ask the persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> process of lining up would be something like this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line ask each other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E

Maintaining up-to-date neighbour information can be <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> execution of any maclet, and is handled by the NMF.|$|R

25|$|A retired Chicago {{police officer}} named Bill Dorsch has stated he {{has reason to}} believe {{there may be more}} victims buried within the grounds of the {{apartment}} building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago; a property which Gacy is known to have been the caretaker of for several years prior to his 1978 arrest. In 1975, Dorsch—then a Chicago police officer—observed Gacy (whom he knew on a casual basis), holding a shovel {{in the early hours of}} the morning. When confronted by Dorsch as to his actions, Gacy stated he was performing work that he was too busy to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> day. Dorsch has also related that several other residents of West Miami Avenue have stated that, in the early- to mid-1970s, they had observed Gacy digging trenches in the grounds of the property; one of these residents has also stated that Gacy would later place plants in the elongated trenches he had dug. At the time these actions had been observed, Gacy had still been married to Carole Hoff. Following his first murder in January 1972, he is not known to have buried any murder victims beneath his own home until one month after his March, 1976 divorce. (John Butkovitch had been buried beneath his garage and the unknown victim known as Body 28 had been buried in his backyard.) Gacy's wife had informed investigators that, on several occasions in the years preceding their divorce, she had found several men's wallets and identification cards discarded about the property at 8213 Summerdale. When she had confronted Gacy about these items, he had angrily informed her the property was none of her business.|$|E

Bo pledged to reinvigorate the city with the Marxist ideals reminiscent of the Mao era.|$|E
500|$|The Kazakh tabloid Karavan {{declared}} Borat to be {{the best}} film of the year, having had a reviewer see the film at a screening in Vienna. The paper said that it was [...] "...certainly not an anti-Kazakh, anti-Romanian or anti-Semitic" [...] film, but rather [...] "cruelly anti-American ... amazingly funny and sad at the same time." [...] Another favorable word came from Kazakh novelist Sapabek Asip-uly, who suggested Baron Cohen be nominated for the annual award bestowed by the Kazakh Club of Art Patrons. In a letter published by the newspaper Vremya, Asip-uly wrote, [...] "(Borat) has managed to spark an immense interest of the whole world in Kazakhstan—something our authorities could not <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> years of independence. If state officials completely lack a sense of humor, their country becomes a laughing stock." [...] Amazon UK has also reported significant numbers of orders of Borat on DVD from Kazakhstan.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{wanted to}} have gospel music {{as part of the}} song, with {{virtually}} no instrumentation, only the sound of an organ and her singing. So she started experimenting using just her vocals, giving away to the bridge being composed. After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a choir around September 1988. Both of them met with musician Andraé Crouch and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to [...] "find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard." [...] At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and explained to them what they needed to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> recording session. He had listened to the demo of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in his car, and directed the choir accordingly. The choir was recorded separately, and Leonard wanted it to be added during post-production.|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} gained widespread {{attention from}} the media after M.I.A. extended her middle finger to the camera {{near the end of}} her verse instead of singing the word [...] "shit". Media criticized M.I.A. for the gesture and compared the incident to Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction. People said, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna herself expressed her disappointment during an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She felt that it was a [...] "teenager... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> show, since it was [...] "out of place". Brian McCarthy, spokesman for the NFL said, [...] "Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers. The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show. There was a failure in NBC's delay system. The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans." [...] McCarthy also clarified that the gesture was not revealed during rehearsals, M.I.A. improvised it on stage. [...] The league later fined the rapper a total of $16.6 million as penalty, which was resolved through a confidential agreement in 2014.|$|E

He admitted not realising soon enough that [...] "life is for living," [...] and suggested he perhaps still did not acknowledge that fact.
