40|$|The {{molluscan}} {{hosts of}} Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni and Fasciola spp. {{have been found}} to flourish in association with certain submersed, floating and <b>emergent</b> <b>weeds</b> in the irrigation system of the Egypt 49 project area. The efficacy of acrolein in killing Potamogeton crispus, an important submersed weed, has been previously established. The present paper deals with field trials of different herbicides, alone or combined, against the other predominant types of floating and emergent weeds—Eichhornia crassipes, Panicum repens, Typha ungustata and Scirpus inclinatus. The trials showed that some of the herbicides are effective and have economic advantages over the manual removal of weeds, besides eliminating the health hazard involved in manual removal. Laboratory tests showed that the herbicides also have ovicidal properties. Aquatic-weed control by the use of appropriate herbicides as an adjunct to molluscicides is therefore advocated...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vegetation}} {{is often an}} important consideration in hydraulic engineering. The design flowrate for hydraulic structures reflects the amount of overland flow and storage, {{both of which are}} affected by vegetal resistance. In open channels, the energy loss from the flow through and above vegetation affects the water surface profile, which could result in flooding. The velocity distribution, pressure distribution, and boundary shear stress distribution are also affected by the hydraulic resistance of the vegetation. Knowledge of these flow parameters is typically needed for the design of hydraulic structures. The density, extent, and type of vegetation present affect the capacity of water supply and flood diversion canals. Canals designed with earth linings can be susceptible to weed infestation, which can increase flow depth and lead to overbank flow or increased seepage, or which can create flow concentrations leading to increased erosion. The Research Institute for Weed Control and Channel Maintenance in Cairo, Egypt estimated that 10 % of the earth-lined canal length in Egypt is infested with <b>emergent</b> <b>weeds,</b> and 50 % is infested with submerged weeds (Balay, Gates and Khattab, 1992). Grass lining is frequently used in irrigation canals, spillways, terraces. and roadside ditches. The condition and type of the grass directly influence channel capacity and stability. As with earth-lined channels, weed maintenance plays a significant role in channel performance (Temple, Robinson, Ahring, and Davis, 1987) ...|$|E
40|$|Weed species {{respond to}} the {{cumulative}} effect of multiple practices employed within weed management systems. However, this response is rarely studied at the system level and the relationship between weed communities and management systems in crops is not well understood. We used a questionnaire, on-farm sampling, and multivariate analyses to assess the relationship between management systems and weed communities in tomatoes. Growers provided detailed information about their management practices from 1998 to 2004 through the questionnaire and on-farm interviews for 59 fields which were sampled for <b>emergent</b> <b>weeds</b> and weeds in the soil seedbank in 2003 and 2004. Minimum variance and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination were used to identify five management systems based on the questionnaire. The systems differed primarily in the use of irrigation and in the extent to which hand weeding was used to control weeds. Conventional processing tomatoes growers typically used multiple applications of herbicides with very little hand weeding. Fresh market growers used a combination of herbicides, plastic mulch and hand weeding to control weeds, market growers that followed organic weed control practices used higher amounts of hand weeding and suppressive cover crops as a replacement for herbicides in weed control. ^ Canonical correspondence analysis and species indicator analysis revealed strong associations of weed species in the seedbank and emerged populations with the objectively identified production systems. Several species displayed association for different production systems. Emergent populations of bamyardgrass, goosegrass, yellow nutsedge, smartweed spp., redroot pigweed and common ragweed were strongly associated with the organic fresh market system. Redroot pigweed and goosegrass were associated with the seedbank population in the organic fresh market system. In both the emergent and seedbank studies, common purslane was closely associated with the nonirrigated fresh market system while irrigated fresh market systems were associated with fall panicum. Emergent populations of giant ragweed, ivyleaf morningglory, prickly sida, and velvetleaf were associated with the two processing systems. ^ This work clearly demonstrates the importance of research that looks beyond a single management practice or a single weed species to the combined weed management system and how it affects weed communities. ...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{the weed}} seedbank composition, {{dynamics}} and {{relationships with the}} <b>emergent</b> <b>weed</b> community, is necessary to improve weed management practices. Field research was made over {{three years in a}} maize (Zea mays L.) -soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) crop rotation under two contrasting tillage regimes [conventional (CT) and no-till (NT) ] to evaluate (i) changes in the weed seedbank and in the emerged community and (ii) to determine if the soil seedbank composition has any predictive value for the composition of the <b>emergent</b> <b>weed</b> community. The experiment was a randomised complete block design. Each year, after crop planting, samples of the seedbank were taken, then the seeds were extracted by washing soil samples through a sieve. Weed emergence was recorded during the first month after planting. Data were analysed with Principal Components Analysis and diversity was estimated using the Shannon index. Although the most abundant species found in the seedbank were always present in the above-ground community, percentage recruitment varied markedly between tillage regimes and years. The degree of soil disturbance, timing of tillage practices, crop rotation and planting date act as filters which allow or prevent the germination and emergence of weeds. The results indicated that knowledge of soil seedbank composition alone has relatively little predictive value for the composition of the <b>emergent</b> <b>weed</b> community...|$|R
40|$|Dodder (Cuscuta gronovii Willd.) is a weed {{of serious}} concern to {{cranberry}} (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) growers. It develops vigorously {{and has a}} long-lived seed bank. Cranberries are a perennial crop and therefore strategies available to growers of annual crops are not practical. Herbicides, the primary management tool for dodder, although effective, have a narrow window of application and extended seedling emergence after applications can result in escapes. This project examined the effect of water temperature on dodder seed germination {{and the use of}} short-term floods (less than 72 hr) for dodder management. Experiments investigated the effect of water temperature on dodder seed germination. Studies, ran twice, submerged dodder seed in water for 0 to 48 hr at 10, 15, and 20 C in one experiment (simulating spring water temperatures) and 0 to 48 hr at 15, 20, and 25 C in a separate experiment (simulating summer water temperatures). In Run 1, the effect of temperature on percent seed germination varied by flood duration; and by temperature alone in Run 2. Percent seed germination however, always fell within normal ranges (35 - 59 %), indicating that flooding may not impact seed germination. Two 1 -yr field studies were conducted to evaluate the use of short-term floods (24 to 48 hr) for managing dodder in cranberries. Two scenarios were simulated: cranberry beds with no <b>emergent</b> <b>weed</b> populations (cranberries alone) and cranberries with <b>emergent</b> <b>weed</b> populations (cranberries with additional host). There were three flood durations (0, 24, and 48 hr) and four flood initiations (1 to 4 wk after first seedling emergence). In 2006, mean percent germination from seeds incubated in Petri dishes was lower for seeds submerged 3 and 4 wk after first emergence (AFE) for the 48 -hr flood durations. In 2007, mean percent germination for seeds submerged for 24 and 48 -hr decreased for floods initiated at 4 wk AFE. Flooding 4 wk AFE resulted in lowest mean attachment ratings in both years and lowest mean dodder biomass on cranberry in the 2007 cranberry and tomato study, suggesting later flood initiation may provide better dodder management...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the impact}} of aquatic {{invasive}} species on biodiversity {{has become a major}} global concern. In the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in the Central Valley of California, USA, dense infestations of the invasive aquatic <b>emergent</b> <b>weed,</b> water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) interfere with ecosystem functioning. This silent invader constantly encroaches into waterways, eventually making them unusable by people and uninhabitable to aquatic fauna. Quantifying and mapping invasive plant species in aquatic ecosystems is important for efficient management and implementation of mitigation measures. This paper evaluates the ability of hyperspectral imagery, acquired using the HyMap sensor, for mapping water hyacinth in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Classification was performed on sixty-four flightlines acquired over the study site using a decision tree which incorporated Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm, absorption feature parameters in the spectral region between 0. 4 and 2. 5 μm, and spectral endmembers. The total image dataset was 130 GB. Spectral signatures of other emergent aquatic species like pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides) and water primrose (Ludwigia peploides) showed close similarity with the water hyacinth spectrum, however, the decision tree successfully discriminated water hyacinth from other emergent aquatic vegetation species. The classification algorithm showed high accuracy (K value = 0. 8) in discriminating water hyacinth...|$|R
40|$|This report {{outlines}} {{a framework}} of the overall process of prioritising targets for biological control and includes a decision support tool that enables policy makers to determine whether biological control is a suitable option for a proposed target species. Introduction Establishing effective biological control agents in Australia is costly in both resources and time, yet it is often a valuable component of weed control. It {{has been estimated that}} biological control of weeds in Australia has provided around 10 billion worth of agricultural protection over the past century. To date significant investment has been made in the selection process of biocontrol agents and the identification of priority weeds for biocontrol. However there is no nationally agreed system that facilitates prioritisation of weed targets for biological control. The Department of Agriculture commissioned ABARES to develop:• a framework that outlines the overall process of prioritising targets for biological control and• a decision support tool that enables policy makers to determine whether biological control is a suitable option for the proposed target species. A recent work related to the selection and prioritisation of weeds for biological control targets was published by Paynter et al 2009 (hereafter 2 ̆ 7 Paynter 2 ̆ 7). Paynter was used as a basis for discussion about how to assist policy makers in assessing whether biocontrol is an appropriate option for weed control. The proposal for a decision support tool for policy makers was discussed at a workshop fully recognising that such a system would need to have a science basis that is both transparent and repeatable to be rigorous. The participants were experts in biocontrol or other weed science, state representatives and other relevant stakeholders. The proposal was outlined in a background/discussion paper and provided to participants prior to the workshop. The purpose of the paper was to provide participants with relevant background information and a proposed approach for a decision support tool for policy makers to be debated and progressed at the workshop. Aim of the workshop and background/discussion paper The workshop was held in Canberra on 4 April 2013. The objectives of the workshop were to:• discuss whether the approach based on Paynter is suitable as a decision support tool at the policy level to prioritise targets for biological control• reach a consensus amongst workshop participants on key principles that need to be considered in the prioritisation process of biological control targetsSuggestions made at the workshop are addressed in this report. Many of the concerns raised at the workshop corresponded with the common 2 ̆ 7 core 2 ̆ 7 issues recorded in Paynter. These include concerns about lack of data, the tendency of the framework to overlook weeds outside the Weeds of National Significance, concerns that weightings are arbitrary, and a need for the framework to be able to anticipate <b>emergent</b> <b>weeds</b> and potential future problems. Here, those issues that are relevant to policy have been considered with the acknowledgement that remaining 2 ̆ 7 core 2 ̆ 7 issues need to be addressed elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{population}} increase in southern Benin {{has changed the}} prevailing system of shifting cultivation into one of more permanent land use. New herbaceous weeds exacerbated rural poverty through crop failure, higher labour inputs, rising costs of production and reduced availability of suitable land. We investigated how different actors reacted {{to the emergence of}} weeds, in terms of the construction of knowledge, labour practices and technology development. Weeds have become an important cause of rural poverty. Farmers have actively engaged in technology development and new labour practices have emerged. Officials early on did report weed problems, especially where export crops were concerned. Researchers have not translated the new weed problem into a research priority until very recently, resulting in limited and inappropriate weed management technologies.

40|$|Abstract. Biomass and {{structural}} changes of weed communities, and CO 2 exchange between the flooding {{water and the}} atmosphere were examined in a paddy field under ambient and free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE). The biomass of planktonic algae was small throughout the experimental period due to the shallow and variable depth of flooding water in the paddy field. Elevated CO 2 slightly increased the biomass of algae, but the increment was not statistically significant. The CO 2 fertilization effect on the biomass of floating weeds (Lemna perpusilla and Spirodela polyrhiza) was 3 -fold in August, and 1. 6 -fold in September {{in terms of the}} ability to exhibit vegetative propagation. In contrast, community structures of the paddy <b>weeds</b> (<b>emergent</b> and terrestrial plants) under FACE conditions did not differ from the ambient condition. The CO 2 fertilization effect on the paddy weeds might be reduced by frequent human weeding and/or nutrient limitation by growth of rice plants. CO 2 evolution from the flooding water occurred throughout the entire day under the ambient CO 2 condition, although the CO 2 evolution rate decreased in th...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effects of seed burial and flooding depths on the emergence and seedling growth of watergrass (Echinochloa oryzoides) and barnyardgrass (E. crus-galli), this experiment was conducted in a covered free air condition, at the Rice Research Institute of Iran, Rasht in summer of 2009. The treatments included four seeding depths (0. 1 (seeds were mixed with the top soil), 2, 4 and 6 cm), and four flooding depths (0. 1 (saturated soil with no standing water), 3, 6, and 9 cm) arranged as a factorial arrangement in a randomized complete block design with three replications. After 28 days, number of <b>emergent</b> seedlings, <b>weed</b> seedlings height, root and shoot fresh weight, leaf and root area were measured, and emergence percentage and root/shoot ratio were calculated. Since no germination of seeds was observed at the 6 cm sowing depth, this treatment wasn’t presented in results. Measured or calculated variable per unit was significantly different between two species and between various levels of seed burial and flooding depths. These variables also influenced by the interactions of the mentioned factors with an exception of emergence percentage. Emergence percentage and growth characteristics except for plant height were higher in E. oryzoides than E. crus-galli when weed seeds were located in the depth of 0. 1 centimeter. In seeds located in the depth of 2 centimeters, all variables were higher in E. oryzoides than E. crus-galli. In both species, the higher values for mentioned variables was observed in the saturated condition of soil, when weed seeds were located at the depth of 0. 1 centimeter and reduced with increasing flooding and seed burial depth. Results indicated that flooding condition with adequate height caused major limiting effects on emergence, establishment and growth of two Echinochloa species, especially when the seeds were deeply buried; but at decreased height specially saturated soils, emergence and growth of E. oryzoides were significantly more than E. crus-galli...|$|R
40|$|Purple loosestrife is a {{perennial}} herb, an <b>emergent</b> aquatic noxious <b>weed,</b> and {{a species that}} is prohibited {{for sale in the}} state of Washington. As a noxious weed, control is required in designated areas of the state, or in areas as deemed appropriate by county weed control boards. Control is defined as preventing all seed production. Lythrum salicaria, L. virgatum, and all cultivars are prohibited for sale by the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Why is it illegal to buy or sell any cultivars? In 1987 the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) declared purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) a noxious weed, due to the alarming spread in its wetlands. All sales of this species were also prohibited. At this time, The MDA did not prohibit the sale of L. virgatum, or the cultivars – partly out of sympathy for the nursery industry. The cultivars of L. virgatum were considered sterile AND it was thought the cultivars could be morphologically identified from purple loosestrife. By 1988 both species were listed as noxious weeds (in Minnesota), and any and all cultivars were prohibited for sale.

40|$|Aquatic macrophytes have {{tremendous}} potential for remediation {{of the heavy}} metal. In this study, Pistia stratiotes had been used as phytoremediation agent to remediate the aquaculture wastewater and heavy metals. The objectives {{of this study were}} to study the removal efficiency of Pistia stratiotes in heavy metal and changing in physico-chemical parameter of aquaculture wastewater, to determine the accumulation of heavy metals in Pistia stratiotes and to study the suitability Pistia stratiotes for phytoremediation of aquaculture wastewater and heavy metals. Heavy metal pollution is a serious and widespread environmental problem due to their toxicity. They enter the environment through various natural methods and human activities. Thus, Pistia stratiotes is chose as a phytoremediation agent to treat aquaculture wastewater and heavy metal. Pistia stratiotes is a wide spread <b>emergent</b> aquatic <b>weed.</b> It generally grows on wastewater discharged areas like bogs, lakes, river pools and other places. The aquaculture wastewater was inserted into reactor tank and three reactors (Pistia stratiotes) were put into reactor tank. Then, the concentration of pollutants such as heavy metals and aquaculture waste were analyzed based on HRT. The experiment was repeated with 6 cycles. All the samples were analyzed both before treatment and after the treatment by the XRF and YSI 556 multi-parameter to identify the concentration of each pollutant in the water samples and physico-chemical parameters. The data analysis and statistics were calculated by Microsoft Excel 2010. The result of physico- chemical analysis showed that Pistia stratiotes has the ability to increase the values of pH, DO and reduce the value of TDS. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate that Pistia stratiotes significantly remove Al, P, Cl, Cd, Fe and Ba respectively in aquaculture wastewater. The average removal efficiencies for these elements were 79. 71 ± 8. 90, 35. 74 ± 12. 51, 44. 57 ± 26. 23, 49. 88 ± 37. 31, 76. 45 ± 28. 4, and 7. 49 ± 7. 76 ppm respectively after three days of HRT. Besides that, Pistia stratiotes can accumulate these elements in the plant tissues. The maximum BCF value of Cd was 34. 56 mg/L concentrated which points towards the suitability for removing Cd from surface waters by this phytoremediation agent. Thus, Pistia stratiotes useful to reduce pollutants water sources and increase water quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrity}} of South Africa’s valuable freshwater ecosystems has been threatened by aquatic invasive plants since the 1900 s. Floating aquatic weeds, such as Eichhornia crassipes (C. Mart) Solms (Pondederiaceae), Pistia stratiotes L. (Araceae), Salvinia molesta D. S. Mitchell (Salviniaceae), Azolla filiculoides Lam. (Azollaceae), and the <b>emergent</b> <b>weed,</b> Myriophyllum aquaticum Verdc. (Haloragaceae) benefited from open, nutrient-rich water bodies. Due to {{the limitations of}} mechanical and chemical control in aquatic environments, classical biological control {{has been a huge}} asset in managing these weeds; consequently bringing them under complete or substantial control. However, submerged aquatic weeds are widely distributed through the aquarium trade in South Africa; facilitating their invasion into new habitats. The removal of surface mats following the successful management of floating weeds has enhanced the growth and competitive ability of submerged aquatic weeds, such as Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle (Hydrocharitaceae), Myriophyllum spicatum L. (Haloragaceae) and Egeria densa Planch. (Hydrocharitaceae) in South Africa. Of these species, E. densa has become the most widely distributed, invading numerous systems across South Africa. Compared to other exotic submerged aquatic plants, E. densa is the only species capable of inhabiting freshwater systems in every province and therefore, it is vital to manage existing populations and prevent its further distribution and invasion. Hydrellia spp. (Diptera: Ephydridae) biological control agents have been used extensively in the management of submerged aquatic weeds elsewhere, particularly those in the Hydrocharitaceae (Balciunas and Burrows 1996; Wheeler and Center 2001. Hydrellia egeriae Rodrigues (Diptera: Ephydridae) has been identified as a promising candidate for E. densa and was imported into quarantine at Rhodes University, Grahamstown in 2014. The aims of this study were to conduct a pre-release assessment of the potential of H. egeriae as a biological control agent for E. densa in South Africa. The first objective {{of this study was to}} establish the life history of the agent under controlled conditions on E. densa found in South Africa, as well as its population growth parameters to predict its invasion success in the field. Secondly, laboratory host-specificity testing was conducted to validate the host range of the agent, in view of published native range host-specificity testing, and to establish potential risks to non-target species, should it be released. Finally, a biological control agent should also effectively reduce the fitness of its host plant, and therefore, impact studies were conducted. Laboratory impact studies have been limited in the past, in that they only investigate agent damage for short ecological periods, thus underestimating the damage capacity of the agent under investigation. Therefore, the damage capacity of H. egeriae was investigated over three consecutive generations in multi-generational impact trials. In a controlled environment of 22 ± 2 °C, H. egeriae exhibited the ability to rapidly increase in population size within a short period of time, which will enhance agent establishment and build-up in the field. Host-specificity trials indicated that H. egeriae has a host range restricted to the Hydrocharitaceae, with exploratory feeding and development on Lagarosiphon major Ridley, L. muscoides Harvey and Vallisneria spiralis L. However, only L. major supported agent development during paired larval choice tests, and continuation trials showed that the test species was not physiologically capable of supporting viable agent populations. Risk analysis illustrated that the feeding and reproductive risks that H. egeriae pose to non-target species are very low and therefore, H. egeriae should be safe for release in South Africa. Additionally, significant damage to vital plant structures (shoot growth and side shoot length) was only recorded under high (five larvae) agent abundances. Encouragingly, the number of leaves mined at the end of the experiment was similar for both intermediate (three) and high (five) larval abundances, suggesting that cumulative leaf-mining under intermediate larval abundances has the potential to reduce the fitness of E. densa, given sufficient time. Results from pre-release assessments provide a robust understanding of the specialization of the potential biological control agent to its host plant. Nevertheless, the absolute success of a biological control programme depends on the many factors after prerelease assessments that determine agent establishment, persistence and target weed suppression, e. g. mass-rearing, release protocols and a/biotic factors within the recipient community. Considering these factors, the best mass-rearing and release protocols are proposed here and future research priorities are identified. Finally, the long term success for managing E. densa in South Africa will require a holistic approach to address the underlying factors, such as eutrophication and human-mediated distribution that drive submerged aquatic plant invasions...|$|R
