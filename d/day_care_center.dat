5|$|The victims, {{including}} three pregnant women, {{ranged in age}} from 3 months to 73 years. Of the dead, 108 worked for the Federal government: Drug Enforcement Administration (5); Secret Service (6); Department of Housing and Urban Development (35); Department of Agriculture (7); Customs Office (2); Department of Transportation/Federal Highway (11); General Services Administration (2); and the Social Security Administration (40). Eight of the Federal government victims were Federal law enforcement agents. Of those law enforcement agents four were members of the U.S. Secret Service, two were members of the U.S. Customs Service, one {{was a member of the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and one was a member of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Six of the victims were U.S. military personnel; two members of the U.S. Army, two members of the U.S. Air Force, two members of the U.S. Marine Corps. The rest of the victims were civilians, including 19 children, of whom 15 were in the America's Kids <b>Day</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Center.</b> The bodies of the 168victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene. A team of 24 identified the victims using full-body X-rays, dental examinations, fingerprinting, blood tests, and DNA testing. More than 680 people were injured. The majority of the injuries were abrasions, severe burns, and bone fractures.|$|E

She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{monitoring}} of indoor air quality parameters, namely: indoor temperature, humidity, velocity, particulate matter, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centres. This study selected 15 <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centres located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. These <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centres were categorized as follows: (1) <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near an industrial area, (2) <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near a main road, and (3) <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> in a residential area. The obtained data showed that the values for the indoor air quality parameters in all <b>day</b> <b>care</b> centres were still well below the recommended value according to the Department of Safety and Health, Malaysia. The <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near an industrial area had the highest value of carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide {{as compared to the}} <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near a main road and the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> in a residential area. The average concentrations of carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near an industrial area were 3. 67 ppm and 801. 56 ppm respectively. Meanwhile, the carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near a main road area and the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> in a residential area were 3. 13 ppm, 768. 22 ppm, 2. 92 ppm and 733. 70 ppm, respectively...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given that {{environmental}} factors, {{such as the}} school environment, can influence child development, more attention should {{be paid to the}} development of children attending <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers.</b> OBJECTIVE: Todetermine whether there are differences in the gross motor, fine motor, or cognitive performances of children between 1 and 3 years-old of similar socioeconomic status attending public and private <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> full time. METHOD: Participants were divided into 2 groups, 1 of children attending public <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> (69 children) and another of children attending private <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> (47 children). All children were healthy and regularly attended <b>day</b> <b>care</b> full time for over 4 months. To assess cognitive, gross and fine motor performance, the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III was used. The Mann-Whitney test was used for comparative analyses between groups of children between 13 and 24 months, 25 and 41 months, and 13 and 41 months. RESULTS: Children in public <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> exhibited lower scores on the cognitive development scale beginning at 13 months old. The fine and gross motor performance scores were lower in children over the age of 25 months attending public centers. Maternal education was not related to the performance of children in either group. CONCLUSION: The scores of cognitive performance as well as fine and gross motor performance of children of similar socioeconomic status who attend public <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> are lower than children attending private daycare centers...|$|R

One evening, Ned wants Marge to watch Rod and Todd while he attends a Chris Rock concert (that he misinterprets to be an abbreviation for a christian rock concert and after is surprised by the language). But Marge is out identifying the body of her Uncle Lou (which ends up being a very much alive Hans Moleman, although the morgue attendant seems convinced that he is dead), so Ned asks Homer instead.
