50|$|In a {{semiconductor}} diode, the anode is the P-doped layer which initially supplies {{holes to}} the junction. In the junction region, the holes {{supplied by the}} anode combine with electrons supplied from the N-doped region, creating a depleted zone. As the P-doped layer supplies holes to the <b>depleted</b> <b>region,</b> negative dopant ions are {{left behind in the}} P-doped layer ('P' for positive charge-carrier ions). This creates a base negative charge on the anode. When a positive voltage is applied to anode of the diode from the circuit, more holes are able to be transferred to the <b>depleted</b> <b>region,</b> and this causes the diode to become conductive, allowing current to flow through the circuit. The terms anode and cathode should not be applied to a Zener diode, since it allows flow in either direction, depending on the polarity of the applied potential (i.e. voltage).|$|E
50|$|Strong {{electric}} {{fields are}} created by thermal poling of silica, subjecting the glass simultaneously to temperatures {{in the range of}} 280 °C and a few kilovolts bias for several minutes. Cations are mobile at elevated temperature (e.g., Na+) and are displaced by the poling field from the anode side of the sample. This creates a region a few micrometers thick of high electrical resistivity depleted of positive ions near the anodic surface. The <b>depleted</b> <b>region</b> is negatively charged, and if the sample is cooled to room temperature with the poling voltage is on, the distribution of electrons becomes frozen. After poling, positive charge attracted to the anodic surface and negative charge inside the glass create a recorded field that can reach 109 V/m. More detailed studies, show that {{there is little or no}} accumulation of cations near the cathode electrode, and that the layer nearest to the anode suffers partial neutralization if poling persists for an excessively long time. The process of glass poling is very similar to the one used for Anodic bonding, where the recorded electric field bonds the glass sample to the anode.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Divergence of {{transcription}} factor binding sites {{is considered to}} be an important source of regulatory evolution. The associations between {{transcription factor}} binding sites and phenotypic diversity have been investigated in many model organisms. However, the understanding of other factors that contribute to it is still limited. Recent studies have elucidated the effect of chromatin structure on molecular evolution of genomic DNA. Though the profound impact of nucleosome positions on gene regulation has been reported, their influence on transcriptional evolution is still less explored. With the availability of genome-wide nucleosome map in yeast species, it is thus desirable to investigate their impact on transcription factor binding site evolution. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of nucleosome positioning in the evolution of transcription factor binding sites. Results We compared the transcription factor binding site frequency in nucleosome occupied <b>regions</b> and nucleosome <b>depleted</b> <b>regions</b> in promoters of old (orthologs among Saccharomycetaceae) and young (Saccharomyces specific) genes; and in duplicate gene pairs. We demonstrated that nucleosome occupied regions accommodate greater binding site variations than nucleosome <b>depleted</b> <b>regions</b> in young genes and in duplicate genes. This finding was confirmed by measuring the difference in evolutionary rates of binding sites in sensu stricto yeasts at nucleosome occupied <b>regions</b> and nucleosome <b>depleted</b> <b>regions.</b> The binding sites at nucleosome occupied regions exhibited a consistently higher evolution rate than those at nucleosome <b>depleted</b> <b>regions,</b> corroborating the difference in the selection constraints at the two regions. Finally, through site-directed mutagenesis experiment, we found that binding site gain or loss events at nucleosome <b>depleted</b> <b>regions</b> may cause more expression differences than those in nucleosome occupied regions. Conclusions Our study indicates the existence of different selection constraint on binding sites at nucleosome occupied regions than at the nucleosome <b>depleted</b> <b>regions.</b> We found that the binding sites have a different rate of evolution at nucleosome occupied and <b>depleted</b> <b>regions.</b> Finally, using transcription factor binding site-directed mutagenesis experiment, we confirmed the difference in the impact of binding site changes on expression at these regions. Thus, our work demonstrates the importance of composite analysis of chromatin and transcriptional evolution. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{example of}} a {{depletion}} region occurs in the MOS capacitor. It {{is shown in the}} figure to the right, for a P-type substrate. Supposing that the semiconductor initially is charge neutral, with the charge due to holes exactly balanced by the negative charge due to acceptor doping impurities. If a positive voltage now is applied to the gate, which is done by introducing positive charge Q to the gate, then some positively charged holes in the semiconductor nearest the gate are repelled by the positive charge on the gate, and exit the device through the bottom contact. They leave behind a <b>depleted</b> <b>region</b> that is insulating because no mobile holes remain; only the immobile, negatively charged acceptor impurities. The greater the positive charge placed on the gate, the more positive the applied gate voltage, and the more holes that leave the semiconductor surface, enlarging the depletion region. (In this device {{there is a limit to}} how wide the depletion width may become. It is set by the onset of an inversion layer of carriers in a thin layer, or channel, near the surface. The above discussion applies for positive voltages low enough that an inversion layer does not form.) ...|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} and widely used FET in modern microelectronics is the MOSFET. There are different kinds in this category, such as MISFET (metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor), and IGFET (insulated-gate FET). A schematic of a MISFET {{is shown in}} Figure 1a. The source and the drain are connected by a semiconductor and the gate is separated from the channel by a layer of insulator. If there is no bias (potential difference) applied on the gate, the band bending is induced due to the energy difference of metal conducting band and the semiconductor Fermi level. Therefore a higher concentration of holes is formed on the interface of the semiconductor and the insulator. When an enough positive bias is applied on the gate contact, the bended band becomes flat. If a larger positive bias is applied, the band bending {{in the opposite direction}} occurs and the region close to the insulator-semiconductor interface becomes depleted of holes. Then the <b>depleted</b> <b>region</b> is formed. At an even larger positive bias, the band bending becomes so large that the Fermi level at the interface of the semiconductor and the insulator becomes closer {{to the bottom of the}} conduction band than to the top of the valence band, therefore, it forms an inversion layer of electrons, providing the conducting channel. Finally, it turns the device on.|$|E
40|$|Up to now {{calculations}} {{of the occupation}} statistics at dislocation states and reduction of the free carrier mobility by dislocation scattering mechanisms have been done by evaluating the screening effect either according to Debye Hückel's approximation or by using the <b>depleted</b> <b>region</b> approximation introduced first by Read. We present in this paper a numerical method, following the rigid shift approximation. This method allows a self consistent determination of the dislocation charge and of {{the knowledge of the}} potential surrounding the dislocation line. This potential is, then, used in transport calculation in order to calculate the reversal mobility induced by dislocation Coulomb potentials. The present results invalidate the Debye Hückel approximation but gives results very near those obtained within the <b>depleted</b> <b>region</b> approximation in physical situations where it can be used. Finally it gives a means of computing dislocation occupation statistics in special situations as, for example, within the <b>depleted</b> <b>region</b> of a Schottky diode or in presence of multiflat impurities or in the intrinsic regime for which the <b>depleted</b> <b>region</b> approximation is no more easy to handle...|$|E

40|$|During the {{incubation}} period of isothermal treatment(or aging) within the bainitic transformation temperature range in a salt bath (or quenching in water) immediately after solution treatment, {{not only are}} the defects formed at high temperatures maintained, but new defects can also be generated in alloys, iron alloys and steels. Due to the segregation of the solute atoms near defects through diffusion, this leads to non-uniform distributions of solute atoms in the parent phase with distinct regions of both solute enrichment and solute depletion. It is proposed that when the M-s temperature at the solute <b>depleted</b> <b>regions</b> is equal to or higher than the isothermal (or aged) temperature, nucleation of bainite occurs within these solute <b>depleted</b> <b>regions</b> in the manner of martensitic shear.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} evolution of a depleted atomic distribution created by laser enhanced ionisation (LEI) was employed to determine both a diffusion coefficient for sodium (Na) and an electron (e(-)) and sodium ion recombination rate coefficient in an analytical air-C 2 H 2 flame.
