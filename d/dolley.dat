5|$|The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), {{also known}} as the <b>Dolley</b> Madison House, was {{constructed}} in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady <b>Dolley</b> Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, <b>Dolley</b> Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased the home in 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch {{on the west side of}} the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of <b>Dolley</b> Madison rocking in a chair in the space where the porch used to be, smiling at passersby.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{was born}} in 1838 near Charles Town, Virginia, in present-day West Virginia. She was the {{daughter}} of William Temple Washington, through whom she was a great-grandniece of George Washington, first President of the United States, and a grandniece of <b>Dolley</b> Payne Todd Madison. Following her family's relocation to Stafford County, she and her family witnessed the Battle of Fredericksburg first hand during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Another celebrated {{image of}} Washington is the Lansdowne {{portrait}}, a large portrait with one version {{hanging in the}} East Room of the White House. This painting was saved during the burning of Washington by British troops in the War of 1812 through the intervention of First Lady <b>Dolley</b> Madison and Paul Jennings, one of President James Madison's slaves. Four versions of the portrait are attributed to Stuart, and additional copies were painted by other artists for display in U.S. government buildings. In 1803, Stuart opened a studio in Washington, D. C.|$|E
50|$|In 1830, <b>Dolley's</b> son Payne Todd, who {{had never}} found a career, went to debtors' prison in Philadelphia and the Madisons sold land in Kentucky and mortgaged half of the Montpelier {{plantation}} to pay his debts.|$|R
50|$|In 1835, Rose married Dr. Robert Greenhow Jr. with <b>Dolley's</b> blessing, {{and by the}} 1850s {{had long}} been an {{established}} socialite in the capital. Robert Greenhow worked at the U.S. Department of State. Robert's step-sister, Mary Greenhow Lee, would visit him and Greenhow and the two women became close friends.|$|R
50|$|Heyfield's Hutt, kept by a Mr Heyfield {{who died}} in 1778, was located on a site at the {{southern}} end of Hayfield Road. This became known as <b>Dolley’s</b> Hut, after the landlord William Dolley.The Oxford Canal reached the outskirts of Oxford in 1789, when a coal wharf was opened at Heyfield Hutt. The Anchor inn was established in 1796 on the site of Heyfield's Hutt to serve the canal boat trade at what was then the end of the Oxford Canal.|$|R
5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. <b>Dolley</b> Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E
25|$|The Cutts–Madison House (also {{known as}} the <b>Dolley</b> Madison House) is an American colonial-style {{historic}} home located at 1520 H Street NW in Washington, D.C.The house {{is best known for}} being the residence of former First Lady <b>Dolley</b> Madison, who lived there from November 1837 until her death in July 1849.|$|E
25|$|Cutts {{secured a}} {{mortgage}} {{to build the}} house, and on August 22, 1828, the bank holding the mortgage sold it to ex-President James Madison for $5,750. When James Madison died in 1836, <b>Dolley</b> Madison held the mortgage. Her husband's death had left <b>Dolley</b> Madison in a financially difficult position, so to reduce her expenses she took up residency in the house in November 1837. Presidents James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, James K. Polk, and Zachary Taylor all visited her in the home, as did John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster. <b>Dolley</b> Madison's financial difficulties continued, however. She also owned Montpelier, her husband's country estate and farm in the Piedmont of Virginia. But Montpelier's finances were in poor condition, and <b>Dolley</b> {{moved out of the}} Cutts–Madison House in 1839 to live once more at Montpelier and see if she could save the estate. She rented out the Cutts–Madison house, but was unable to stabilize Montpelier. She moved back to the Cutts–Madison House in 1843, and sold Montpelier in 1844.|$|E
2500|$|Some historians {{speculate}} that Madison's mounting debt {{was one of}} the reasons he refused to allow his notes on the Constitutional Convention, or its official records in his possession, to be published in his lifetime. [...] "He knew the value of his notes, and wanted them to bring money to his estate for <b>Dolley's</b> use as his plantation failed—he was hoping for one hundred thousand dollars from the sale of his papers, of which the notes were the gem." [...] Madison's financial troubles weighed on him as deteriorating mental and physical health ensued.|$|R
5000|$|Jennings {{was born}} into slavery at Montpelier in 1799; his mother, who was African-Native American, was enslaved by the Madisons. [...] She told the boy his father was Benjamin Jennings, an English trader. The mixed-race slave as a child was a {{companion}} to <b>Dolley's</b> son Payne Todd. [...] He began to serve James Madison as his footman and later was trained as his [...] "body servant". At the age of 10, Jennings accompanied Madison and his family to the White House after the statesman's election as president. In his 1865 memoir, {{he noted that the}} East Room was yet unfinished from the first construction, most of the Washington streets were unpaved, and the city was [...] "a dreary place" [...] in those years.|$|R
25|$|In {{the last}} period of construction, Phase 3 (1809–1812), Madison {{had a large}} drawing room added, as well as one-story wings {{at each end of}} the house and he {{directed}} construction of single-story flat-roofed extensions at either end of the house; these provided space for the separate household of the newlyweds James and <b>Dolley</b> Madison. After his second term as president, in 1817 Madison retired there full-time with his wife <b>Dolley.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{the mid-19th}} century, {{witnesses}} have {{claimed to have}} seen the ghost of <b>Dolley</b> Madison rocking in {{a chair in the}} space where the porch {{on the west side of}} the house used to be, smiling at passersby.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dolley</b> Madison {{lived in}} the house on Lafayette Square until her death on July 12, 1849. Her only {{surviving}} child, John Payne Todd (from her first marriage to Quaker lawyer John Todd), inherited the property. On April 3, 1851, Todd sold the house and property to Charles Wilkes.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Dolley</b> {{ultimately}} {{sold the}} remainder of Madison's papers to Congress in 1848, she apparently {{did not realize that}} her son, John Payne Todd, had retained for himself many of the more valuable manuscripts from that collection. These he sold periodically to various creditors until his death in 1851, gaining funds to pay his gambling and liquor debts.|$|E
25|$|Madison {{was married}} {{for the first}} time at the age of 43; on September 15, 1794, James Madison married <b>Dolley</b> Payne Todd, a 26-year-old widow, at Harewood, in what is now Jefferson County, West Virginia. Madison had no {{children}} but adopted Todd's one surviving son, John Payne Todd (known as Payne), after the marriage.|$|E
25|$|In 1844 or 1845, {{after her}} return to the Cutts–Madison House, arsonists put lit matches into the {{shutters}} {{in the rear of}} the house, and <b>Dolley</b> Madison had to be wakened and saved from death by a servant. The fire was quickly put out, and the damage to the building not extensive (Mrs. Madison returned to her bedroom the same night).|$|E
25|$|The Public Vault at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. is {{an early}} {{classical}} revival structure built 1832–34 with funds appropriated by the United States Congress to store the bodies of government officials {{and members of the}} public before burial. About 4,600 individuals were temporarily interred in the vault, including three U.S. presidents, First Lady <b>Dolley</b> Madison, and sixteen congressmen who died while serving in office.|$|E
25|$|Phase 2 (1797–1800) of {{construction}} began in 1797, after the son James Madison returned to Montpelier {{with his new}} wife <b>Dolley</b> Madison. He was then 39 {{and she was a}} young widow with a child. At this time Madison added a thirty-foot extension and a Tuscan portico to the house. Madison's widowed mother, Nelly, still resided in the house following the death of her husband, James, Sr., in 1801.|$|E
25|$|During the War of 1812, {{the invading}} British burned the Capital, the White House, and other {{government}} buildings including that which housed the State Department and its library on August 24, 1814. While <b>Dolley</b> Madison famously saved the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington hanging in the White House, Secretary of State James Monroe can be credited with saving the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, housed {{at that time in}} the State Department's Library.|$|E
25|$|After <b>Dolley</b> Madison {{sold the}} estate to Henry W. Moncure in 1844, the {{property}} was held {{by a total of}} six additional owners before the du Ponts bought Montpelier in 1901. The various owners and the dates associated with the site include: Benjamin Thornton (1848–1854), William H. Macfarland (1854–1855), Alfred V. Scott (1855–1857), Thomas J. Carson and Frank Carson (1857–1881), Louis F. Detrick and William L. Bradley (1881–1900) and Charles King Lennig (1900).|$|E
25|$|When Madison {{left office}} in 1817 at age 65, he retired to Montpelier, his tobacco {{plantation}} in Orange County, Virginia, {{not far from}} Jefferson's Monticello. <b>Dolley,</b> who thought they would finally {{have a chance to}} travel to Paris, was 49. As with both Washington and Jefferson, Madison left the presidency a poorer man than when elected. His plantation experienced a steady financial collapse, due to the continued price declines in tobacco and also due to his stepson's mismanagement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dolley</b> Madison put {{her social}} gifts {{to use when}} the couple lived in Washington, {{beginning}} when he was Secretary of State. With the White House still under construction, she advised as to its furnishings and sometimes served as First Lady for ceremonial functions for President Thomas Jefferson, a widower and friend. When her husband was president, she created the role of First Lady, using her social talents to advance his program. She is credited with adding to his popularity in office.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dolley</b> Madison {{transferred}} (or deeded), {{most of the}} enslaved {{people to}} her son, John Payne Todd. He stipulated in his will that upon his death, the slaves would be manumitted. However, due to legal and financial complications after Todd's death, the slaves were not manumitted. The Taylors petitioned James C. Maguire, the administrator of the estate, for their freedom. After being officially freed in 1853, they chose to live in Washington, which had a large free black community and opportunities for varied work.|$|E
25|$|Drapery {{panels of}} yellow-gold silk satin with {{elaborate}} swags and jabots of red with gold medallions with handmade fringe recall {{a description of}} drapery used here during <b>Dolley</b> Madison's day. The curtains were designed by Edward Vason Jones, and are based on historical patterns held by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now called Historic New England) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Conger returned use of the decorative tape along the ceiling moulding but not above the dado.|$|E
25|$|On November 20, 1856, Douglas {{married a}} second time, to 20-year-old Adele Cutts, a {{southern}} {{woman from the}} capital. She {{was the daughter of}} James Madison Cutts of Washington, D.C., nephew of President James Madison, and Ellen O'Neal, niece of Rose O'Neal Greenhow. Her great-aunt was the former U.S. First Lady <b>Dolley</b> Madison. Her mother Ellen O'Neal Cutts was from a Maryland Catholic family and raised Adele as a Catholic. With Stephen's approval, she had his two sons baptized as Catholic and reared in that faith.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dolley</b> Madison was interred in the Public Vault from July 16, 1849, to February 10, 1852, {{the longest}} known interment in the vault, while funds were being raised for her re-interment at Montpelier. Her body was {{transferred}} to the Causten family vault, directly {{to the west of the}} Public Vault, for another six years before the funds were raised. She was briefly joined in May 1852 in the Causten vault by First Lady Louisa Catherine Adams, though it has been reported that Adams was interred in the Public Vault.|$|E
25|$|Edward’s elder brother, Isaac A. Coles, {{served as}} private {{secretary}} to both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison during their administrations. Thomas Jefferson's Monticello plantation was nearby in Albemarle County. Furthermore, {{the wife of}} James Madison, <b>Dolley</b> Payne Todd Madison, was Coles' first cousin, and Coles became a frequent guest at their Montpelier plantation also nearby. James Monroe owned Ash Lawn-Highland plantation {{on the other side}} of Green Mountain for 24 years (until forced to sell it in 1825 due to financial problems), and offered young Coles use of his library, although the relationship with this family was more distant since Monroe split his time at Oak Hill plantation in Loudoun County.|$|E
25|$|The British then {{entered and}} burned the capital {{during the most}} notably {{destructive}} raid of the war. British troops {{set fire to the}} capital's most important public buildings, including the Presidential Mansion (the White House), the United States Capitol, the Arsenal, the Navy Yard, the Treasury Building, and the War Office, as well as {{the north end of the}} Long Bridge, which crossed the Potomac River into Virginia. The British, however, spared the Patent Office and the Marine Barracks. <b>Dolley</b> Madison, the first lady, or perhaps members of the house staff, rescued the Lansdowne Portrait, a full-length painting of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart as the British approached the Mansion.|$|E
25|$|Ice cream was {{introduced}} to the United States by Quaker colonists who brought their ice cream recipes with them. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Catham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790. The same records show president Thomas Jefferson having an 18 step recipe for ice cream. First Lady <b>Dolley</b> Madison, wife of U.S. President James Madison, served ice cream at her husband's Inaugural Ball in 1813.|$|E
25|$|Rev. Balmain {{was also}} like his protege Bishop Meade {{active in the}} American Colonization Society. Also, McKay's Chapel (where he {{occasionally}} held services) had been founded by a Quaker between the Hopewell and Crooked Run meetings, and before the Revolutionary War, the lay reader was John Lloyd, an African American (although the McKays supposedly became Baptist after the Quakers refused to allow their members to own slaves). Balmain's {{last will and testament}} gave his wife Lucy the power to emancipate their slaves (whom Meade remembered them treating as their children) in her life or own last will (unlike <b>Dolley</b> Madison, Lucy Balmain did emancipate all her slaves when she died in 1845).|$|E
25|$|Several grand {{public or}} state funeral processions ended {{in front of}} the Public Vault, after {{starting}} at the White House or the Capitol and then moving down Pennsylvania Avenue and E Street SE to the cemetery. These included the funerals for Presidents Harrison, J. Q. Adams, and Taylor; Senator Calhoun; First Ladies <b>Dolley</b> Madison and Louisa Adams; the victims of the USS Princeton disaster; and several other congressmen. Some of these processions were two miles long, led by military bands and troops for the funerals of military men, members of both houses of congress and the administration, and pall bearers carefully chosen for political balance to symbolize unity and stability in government.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dolley</b> Payne {{was born}} May 20, 1768, at the New Garden Quaker {{settlement}} in North Carolina, where her parents, John Payne and Mary Coles Payne, lived briefly. Dolley's sister, Lucy Payne, had recently married George Steptoe Washington, a nephew of President Washington. As {{a member of}} Congress, Madison had doubtless met the widow Todd at social functions in Philadelphia, then the nation's capital. She had been living there with her late husband. In May 1794, Madison asked their mutual friend Aaron Burr to arrange a meeting. By August, she had accepted his proposal of marriage. For marrying Madison, a non-Quaker, she was expelled from the Society of Friends. Also in 1794 Madison was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} similar to its sister show, That's So Raven. Cory has two best friends, one a boy, Newton Livingston III (Jason <b>Dolley),</b> and one a girl, Meena Paroom (Maiara Walsh). Note that in That's So Raven, the main {{character}} also has two best friends, one a boy and one a girl and Newt and Meena's persona's are similar to Chelsea and Eddie. Cory attends a middle school in Washington, D.C. Also in the series, the president's daughter Sophie (Madison Pettis) constantly pesters Cory, like Cory did to Raven in That's So Raven. Cory also participates in crazy situations in which he learns a moral lesson and will most likely get punished. Candy Smiles plays in Cory's love life multiple times, and Stickler continuously spies on Cory, Newton and especially Meena's.|$|E
25|$|Coles {{turned to}} history during his later years. He was {{recognized}} as one of the few remaining men with close personal knowledge of both Madison and Jefferson, and burnished their reputations as champions of the republican ideals that had also motivated Coles during his entire life. Coles had lobbied both Jefferson and Madison (and later Thomas Jefferson Randolph) to free their slaves. Coles was surprised when Madison failed to do so, only later learning that lawyer Robert Taylor had persuaded the former President to leave emancipation instructions for his widow, whose father had gone bankrupt after freeing his slaves many years earlier. <b>Dolley,</b> with other personal economic priorities (especially a son addicted to gambling), freed no slaves upon her death in 1849. Coles also wrote about the Northwest Ordinance. However, most of Coles' own papers from Illinois were destroyed in a fire in 1852 while his friend John Mason Peck was writing a history of the new state. Coles also assisted Virginia historians William Cabell Rives and Hugh Blair Grigsby, and New Yorker Henry S. Randall.|$|E
25|$|Madison {{hoped that}} the war would be over in a couple months after the capture of Canada, but his hopes were quickly dashed. Madison had {{believed}} the state militias would rally to the flag and invade Canada, but the governors in the Northeast failed to cooperate. Their militias either sat out the war or refused to leave their respective states for action. The senior command at the War Department and in the field proved incompetent or cowardly—the general at Detroit surrendered to a smaller British force without firing a shot. Gallatin discovered the war {{was almost impossible to}} fund, since the national bank had been closed and major financiers in the Northeast refused to help. The American campaign in Canada, led by Henry Dearborn, ended with defeat in the Battle of Stoney Creek. The British armed American Indians in the Northwest, most notably several tribes allied with the Shawnee chief, Tecumseh. But, after losing control of Lake Erie at the naval Battle of Lake Erie in 1813, the British were forced to retreat. General William Henry Harrison caught up with them at the Battle of the Thames, where he destroyed the British and Indian armies, killed Tecumseh, and permanently destroyed Indian power in the Great Lakes region. Madison remains the only president to lead troops in battle while in office, although that battle (the Battle of Bladensburg in 1814) did not go well for the American side. The British then raided Washington, as Madison headed a dispirited militia. <b>Dolley</b> Madison rescued White House valuables and documents shortly before the British burned the White House, the Capitol and other public buildings.|$|E
