Steven Obermeir of the United States Geological Survey is one of several scientists who have found sediments suggesting Wabash Valley Fault earthquakes around magnitude 7 on the Richter scale. Michael Wyssession, an associate professor of earth and planetary sciences, denigrated the Madrid fault zone and said, [...] "in 20years there have been three magnitude5 or better earthquakes on the Wabash Valley Fault. There is evidence that sometime in the past the Wabash Valley Fault has produced as strong as magnitude7 earthquakes. On the other hand, the New Madrid Fault has been very quiet <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>now.</b> Clearly, the Wabash Valley Fault has gotten our deserved attention." ...|$|E
500|$|The kiss between Mulder and Scully {{caused a}} furor of opinions. The Complete X-Files noted that many fans were [...] "ecstatic" [...] about Mulder and Scully's [...] "long-awaited" [...] kiss. David Blar from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "shocking" [...] because of Mulder and Scully's kiss, asking, [...] "why they didn't lock lips sooner"? Paula Vitaris {{noted that the}} kiss [...] "seems stuck on to the episode by a tack in its {{complete}} irrelevance to the storyline or Mulder and Scully in general." [...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files is getting more attention for what happens near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip your clothes off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s been going on <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>now,</b> right under our noses." ...|$|E
500|$|Seventy-one {{years of}} age and {{becoming}} increasingly deaf, Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972, that he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, having served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley. The lame duck Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war, after an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again. Without advance notice, Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionally end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months. The measure, which had no co-sponsors, stunned Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and provoked heated debate in the Senate. Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The revised amendment passed 62–33, whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill. At Nixon's insistence, the Senate defeated the amended bill 48–42. Disappointed, Cooper nevertheless proclaimed, [...] "I feel purged inside. I've felt strongly about this <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Now</b> it's {{in the hands of the}} President. He's the only person who can do anything about ending the war now." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{commercial}} lackluster of her eighth studio album, Britney Jean (2013), Spears started her Las Vegas residency show, , which attained commercial success. Later, in September 2014, the singer posted {{a picture of}} herself in a recording studio, hinting that she was recording new music. In an interview with Extra, a month later, she revealed that she was working [...] "very slowly, but progressively" [...] on a studio album. She also released the song [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] in 2015 with Iggy Azalea, which was met with moderate impact. This resulted in Spears {{heading back to the}} studio to record more songs without having plans to release a new album. In late 2016, during interviews to promote Glory, Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record, and that it was her [...] "most hip-hop album," [...] explaining, [...] " [...] there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted to do <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>now,</b> and I just haven't really done that." [...] Talay Riley, who was among the songwriters that worked with Spears on the album, previously co-wrote Iggy Azalea's [...] "Bounce" [...] (2013) and Nick Jonas' [...] "Levels" [...] (2015). After the release of first single [...] "Make Me..." [...] and the promotional single [...] "Private Show" [...] on August 8, 2016, Spears and website PopCrush announced that [...] "Clumsy" [...] was going to be made available as the second promotional track from the Glory as an instant grant for those who pre-ordered the album. It was subsequently released on August 11, 2016 for digital download and streaming.|$|E

2500|$|Buckland {{developed}} {{a reputation as one}} of the infant film industry's great artists, as reflected in the following 1918 newspaper report:"Among the producing firms who belong to the class where imagination is based upon culture, are those associated with Paramount. [...] <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>now,</b> picture play reviewers have been fond of saying 'up to the usual Paramount standard.' That standard to [...] a large extent has been raised higher and higher by the Wilfred Buckland whose name appears in front of all the Lasky pictures. Such men as Cecil DeMille, William DeMille, J. Searle Dawley, Maurice Tourneur, Joseph Kaufman, Robert Vignola, Robert Thorley, Marshal Neilan, Thomas H. Ince, J. Stuart Blackton and the others who produce for Paramount have added their very considerable bit to spelling Art with a capital A in motion pictures, but that is Wilfred Buckland's business exclusively." ...|$|E

2500|$|Responses to Gamergate have {{encouraged}} {{the video game}} industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them. Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a [...] "Diversity in Technology" [...] program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at {{increasing the number of}} women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stated in announcing the program that [...] "it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent". Electronic Arts (EA) COO Peter Moore said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling Fortune [...] "f there's been any benefit to Gamergate, ... I think it just makes us think twice at times". Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the Seattle Times, IGDA executive director Kate Edwards said, [...] "Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>now.</b> There's ample evidence of that over and over again... What we're finally seeing is that it became so egregious that now companies are starting to wake up and say, [...] "We need to stop this. This has got to change." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2015, Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) {{revealed}} {{plans for}} Daniel's [...] "good-natured" [...] personality {{to change as}} {{he turned away from}} his hippy ideals. Daniel changed his look and became more career-driven. Of the changes to Daniel's personality, Phillipps explained: [...] "I think it's an important change that had to happen for Daniel's development. He's always been a positive person, and I don't think that goes away in this storyline. But Daniel has been under Paul's guidance <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>now.</b> It's made him start to understand some really important life messages about how sometimes you've got to take more risks, be more ruthless and push a little harder. It's all part of Daniel's evolution as a character." [...] Phillipps told Kilkelly that he spoke to the writers about giving Daniel [...] "more status" [...] within the community and believed that making him more career-driven would be a good way for him to gain respect from other characters. The actor also believed that viewers would find Daniel more interesting, but added that his positive attitude would still be there. Daniel began working at Lassiter's Hotel, following his brief stint in real estate sales. He already knew the hotel business from working alongside Paul. Daniel's new attitude and career change was marked by a new haircut. Phillipps had chosen to shave his hair off, so the writers incorporated his new style into the storyline. Phillipps added that he would not like to see Daniel become a copy of his uncle, but he did want Daniel to be [...] "strong-willed and street smart" [...] like him.|$|E
