40|$|The {{individual}} exposure integral noise load on workers {{before the beginning}} of hearing impairment was determined for a group of 20 male miners who had worked with drilling equipment and harvesters for 8 to 20 years before the onset of the disability. Results show that the total exposure energy <b>load</b> <b>of</b> about 4 kw x h sq m, obtained by miners in the examined group, resulted in occupational injury to the auditory organ (cochlear neuritis) in 75 % of the cases. The equivalent energy level of noise computed according to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> total energy <b>load</b> is roughly 99 db A, which significantly exceeds the permissible amount of 85 db A.

40|$|Current {{military}} operations require soldiers to carry heavy external loads that are widely acknowledged to impair {{the ability to}} move tactically on the battlefield. However, to <b>date,</b> the effect <b>of</b> <b>load</b> on susceptibility to enemy fire (the probability of being hit) has not been examined. Nineteen soldiers completed a break contact simulation (five 30 -m sprints commencing every 44 seconds) and a fire and movement simulation (sixteen 6 -m bounds commencing every 20 seconds) in each <b>of</b> the 5 <b>load</b> conditions (ranging from 9. 8 to 30. 1 kg). For each simulation, the impact <b>of</b> <b>load</b> on exposure time and peak movement velocity was examined. In addition, the 6 fastest and 6 slowest soldiers (determined by exposure time in the heaviest condition) were parsed into subgroups to examine interindividual differences in response to load. Susceptibility for the 2 subgroups was modeled using exposure time for the 2 simulations and the assumed reaction time, shooting cadence, and shooting accuracy of the enemy. Susceptibility increased as a function <b>of</b> <b>load</b> for both the break contact and fire and movement simulations and became more pronounced when the participant population was parsed into fast and slow groups. When the impact of personal protection systems was isolated and analyzed, it was found that not only were the slower participants more vulnerable (as a result of not wearing the personal protection system) but also more susceptible than the faster participants who carried 11. 2 kg more load. Large interindividual differences in response to external load have meaningful consequences for battlefield susceptibility, and it is therefore critical that personnel are afforded tailored training such that they maximize their proficiency in the execution of tactical combat movements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor {{critical}} aircraft structural {{features such}} as mechanically fastened joints, coatings which prevent the ingress of moisture are vital for preventing the onset of corrosion which might require costly rectification or, at worst, threaten structural integrity. While aircraft coatings are usually of relatively high quality, they must provide a long service life in a demanding environment, with thermal cycles, high levels of ultraviolet radiation, and mechanical loading. To <b>date,</b> the effect <b>of</b> <b>load</b> history on coating longevity has received little attention, despite clearly being a factor in promoting coating failure at specific sites (such as joints) {{and the rate of}} coating degradation. This paper describes the key characteristics of coatings at aircraft joints and also outlines the factors which influence the complex strain history at joints. The research identifies the important regions in a joint and specifically the strain concentration locations where coatings are likely to fail. These regions include exposed sheet ends, shear interfaces and fastener heads. Finite element modelling and experimental testing of a generic joint configuration, which is representative of many light military and civil aircraft structures, is use to predict the sheet end movements under the maximum <b>load</b> capacity <b>of</b> the joint, and to measure critical displacements which would be experienced by a coating layer at the interfaces. This study {{is part of a larger}} program developing a prognostic capability for the durability of surface coatings at critical locations...|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{changes to}} an {{aircraft}} trip’s temporal information {{results from the}} unload entire aircraft and inter-aircraft pallet swap neighborhoods. First, an aircraft trip departure date might require modification to minimize pallet temporal violations. If the current departure <b>date</b> <b>of</b> a trip is later than the ready to load date, DALP-TS can decrease the departure date; however, the algorithm does not schedule an aircraft trip’s departure date prior to its ready to load date. Decreasing a departure date only occurs if doing so improves the solution. Changing the departure date to a date which causes infeasibilities in the majority <b>of</b> the <b>loaded</b> pallets is unproductive. Decreasing the departure <b>date</b> <b>of</b> an aircraft trip creates a series <b>of</b> ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> decreases in subsequent aircraft trips; DALP-TS modifies the departure <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the succeeding aircraft trips if doing so improves the overall objective function value. Note that the trip ready to load date is the earliest date upon which an aircraft may depart; this date does not necessarily correspond to the best departure date for a given pallet load. By increasing a trip’s departure date, DALP-TS could trigger a series of updates to the subsequent aircraft trips. This occurs when a trip’s altered departure date causes the ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the succeeding trip to be after its departure date; DALP-TS then equates the departure date with the ready to load date.|$|R

Dynamic fuzzy {{reliability}} {{models of}} mechanical components are proposed {{in this paper}} {{in the case of}} small samples <b>of</b> <b>load.</b> The proposed models are established based on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>load</b> obtained from a load history, which reflects the relationship among the occurrence frequency <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> with different magnitude in a given time period, rather than the distribution at each load application. To deal with the uncertainty of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>load</b> from a load history due to the randomness of the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>load</b> at each load application, the statistical parameters involved in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>load</b> are modeled as fuzzy variables.
