50|$|Airport {{check-in}} is {{the process}} whereby passengers are accepted by an airline at the airport prior to travel. The airlines typically use service counters found at airports. The check-in is normally handled by an airline itself or a handling agent working on behalf of an airline.

This paper proposes a compositional approach to the formal verification of routing in MHS. The approach is based on the theory of assume-guarantee reasoning, where proofs of the overall system are derived from proofs of subsystems. Moreover, the approach has been implemented in a tool that automatically carries out the verification. A real-world example is discussed in this paper, showing the benefits and scalability of the presented approach...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} trend in self-service check-in (SSCI) utilization. SSCI would impact the passenger flow and baggage flow in airport operation because of the reduction of check-in processing time and the change of passenger arrival time to the airport. This dissertation is using the simulation model to simulate the passenger flow and a demand analysis model to calculate the baggage flow under various SSCI utilization rate {{for the assessment of}} the impacts on airport operation. The simulation results suggest that the higher the SSCI utilization rate, the shorter the queue length and waiting time at the check-in desks. However, the bottleneck would be potentially relocated to the downstream passenger security check and emigration process. Nevertheless, the increasing SSCI utilization provides room for the reduction of check-in desk without compromising the service level provided to passenger. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>baggage</b> system demand analysis is based on the modified arrival profile with addressing later passenger arrival time due to perception of shorter in-airport time. The results show that the later the passenger arriving at airport, the less the make-up devices required for the baggage handling system, which reduces the operation cost and delays the need for baggage hall expansion. Increasing SSCI utilization would bring both opportunities and challenges to the airport operation and this dissertation provides a study framework to assess the impacts on airport operation which could be applied by the airport operators. Airport operator could develop a more accurate and realistic simulation model and demand analysis model with real data collected from regular surveys and use them to forecast the service level and facility requirement with the change of SSCI utilization. As a result, airport operator can have a better facility planning to achieve cost-effectiveness and provide satisfactory service level to passenger. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|R

On {{the very first day}} of the long march, a band of Indians from the north, finding Hearne defenceless, plundered him of wellnigh all he had. 'Nothing can exceed,' wrote Hearne, 'the cool deliberation of the villains. A committee of them entered my tent. The ringleader seated himself on my left hand. They first begged me to lend them my skipertogan[1] to fill a pipe of tobacco. After smoking two or three pipes, they asked me for several articles which I had not, and among others for a pack of cards; but, on my answering that I had not any of the articles they mentioned, one of them put his <b>hand</b> on my <b>baggage</b> and asked if it was mine.

40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of aviation, cargo loading on {{aircraft}} has remained virtually constant. A person and a baggage cart together have been the primary method of loading baggage on to aircraft, and this practice has virtually remained unchanged, especially for narrow body aircraft. This study explores {{the question of whether}} a loading device, designed for Embraer 190 aircraft, can increase economic efficiency by reducing aircraft turnaround times, increasing aircraft utilization and reducing work hours. In the course of designing a theoretical loading device for an Embraer 190, various literature ranging from elaborate articulating conveyor belts, to the use of LD 3 - 45 W containers in Airbus 320 aircraft were analyzed. In the pursuit of understanding ground operations with containers, the study looked at the Boeing 767 - 300 and the Boeing 777 - 200 LR to analyze the timeliness in which containers can be loaded and unloaded from an aircraft. With the goal of using common narrow body ground support equipment, time trials were done with a Purdue University baggage belt loader to see if loading a container on a conventional belt loader was feasible. To create a theoretical working container design, the LD 3 - 45 W boundaries in relation to the Airbus 320 aircraft cargo walls was scaled to match the Embraer 190 s. With this scale, a container size could be derived, as well as volume, capacity, tare weight and maximum weight. In determining these various parameters, the amount of baggage that could be placed in 11 loading device containers was determined. With these figures an extensive comparison between loading <b>baggage</b> by <b>hand</b> and loading <b>baggage</b> utilizing containers, was analyzed. ...|$|R

40|$|This research’s {{central focus}} is the {{regulation}} of top officials in pre-modern administration of the Dutch Republic. These officials had more say in how they performed their duties than they would in modern, bureaucratic, organisational embedding. Whether this meant that civil servants were completely free {{to do their work}} according to their own views remains to be seen. This historic-administrative study therefore focuses on the way in which officials’ work was regulated. In order to answer this question, two models of regulation are used: bureaucratic and professional. Bureaucratic regulation is based on a fixed set of rules, procedures, and supervisory relationship, on the basis of which the work within an organisation is standardised. Professional regulation, on the other hand, depends on regulation carried out by the professionals themselves. Together, they construct and uphold rules and standards considered important in their line of work. In the book, both mechanisms will be expanded upon, in addition {{to the way in which}} they relate to each other. Based on an analysis of primary and secondary sources, this study shows that pre-modern top officials were regulated both bureaucratically and professionally. Bureaucratic regulation has mainly to do with the way the organisation was structured. Professional regulation played an important role in the knowledge, skill, and experience that was developed by top officials according to ever recurring patterns. This way, the work was not only regulated through bureaucratic mechanisms, the collective of officials and administrators also regulated the work by means of standardised training and careers. Their background and, with that, their upbringing will also have played a part. There are also certain differences in how the functions involved in this study were regulated. The work of the sheriff (Dutch: schout) was hardly bureaucratically regulated, in contrast to the work of the Grand Pensionary (Dutch: raadpensionaris) and other top positions in the Dutch Republic. Inspired by the analysis of pre-modern administration we end this book with an eye on modern public administration. Herein we will focus on the bureaucracy paradox, with which we mean a bureaucratic organisation where civil servants are selected on the basis of knowledge and skill, while discretionary power, which can optimise the use of this knowledge and skill, is reduced as much as possible through procedures and standards. The conclusion of this book draws the picture of an even balance of bureaucratic and professional regulation of the work of officials in order to be able to optimise knowledge and skill, serving the public interest. This indicates a framework of competencies on the one <b>hand,</b> and professional <b>baggage,</b> meaning education, on the other. In this fashion, embedded constraints offer a possible detour from the bureaucracy paradox...|$|R
