40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{it has been}} {{discovered}} that the verbally based communication amongst paramedics is unsatisfactory. The ‘one-to-all’ radio communication system which is utilized today {{does not have the}} capacity needed to handle major incidents. It is furthermore fragile when it comes to both environmental noise and signal disturbances, due to the presence of for example helicopters and buildings. Thus a need for an improved communication system was identified. It was found that management of personnel and patients uses {{a major part of the}} capacity of the radio. In this thesis a suggested system will be presented as a mean to enhance the quality of communication. By designing a system which visualizes <b>information</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> and patients – with status, position and ID – in a real-time map on a screen, much of the information which today is provided verbally will with this system be available visually. The evaluation of the system is conducted with an Operational Commander which is defined as an end-user. The findings suggest that geospatial visualization of personnel and patients with status, position and ID, will reduce the amount of verbal communication and will furthermore improve information accuracy and enhance efficiency in management of major incidents...|$|E

I. Background and Significance Physical and mental health is an important symbol and component element of individual health. With the development of network and computer science technology, computer-based physical fitness and mental health detection system has been widely used both at home and abroad. However, the following shortcomings still exist in physical fitness and mental health detection systems both at home and abroad. (1) The previous physical fitness and mental health detection systems belong to independent systems, and thus it is impossible to analyze the correlation between physical health and mental health; (2) The detection systems are generally run in a single computer, which is not conducive to the large-scale implementation of detection; (3) The <b>information</b> verification <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> to be tested is not standardized, and the test data does not have a strong authenticity an...|$|R

40|$|English is {{considered}} as {{the medium of}} communication in different social and professional contexts. It {{is important to have}} the ability to communicate using the language in order to be successful in the job field. In the customer service industry which is a part of the business world, employees especially Information Desk Personnel are expected to have good communication skills as well as the ability to use the language to perform their duties as required. The purpose of this study is to examine the spoken English Language needs and challenges faced by Information Desk Personnel working in shopping malls in Malaysia. The main aim of this research is to conduct a needs analysis <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Desk <b>Personnel</b> in shopping malls, explore their needs, problems faced in terms of speaking skills and propose a course design focusing on speaking skills. This study is a qualitative study complemented with quantitative findings in terms of frequency counts and percentages. A total of 40 questionnaires were distributed to Information Desk personnel from three different shopping malls. To obtain in-depth perception of the issue, 3 managers from the shopping malls were interviewed, 10 customers were chosen randomly to know their views on this issue and an observation session was conducted by the researcher to get a clear picture of the scenario involved, focusing on the communication between the Information Desk Personnel and customers. The key findings showed that the English language, especially speaking skills, is important for the Information Desk Personnel. The participants agreed that speaking is the main skill they use the most in their routine job and findings reveal that grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation and fluency are important aspects of their speaking skills. iv This study incorporated the Target Situation Analysis (TSA), Present Situation Analysis (PSA) and Learning Situation Analysis (LSA) in order to collect the information required. Recommendations on how to overcome some of the English language challenges faced by Information Desk Personnel working in shopping malls, particularly in Malaysia are included in Discussion (Chapter 5). Based on the findings, a course design was proposed to cater for the English language needs <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Desk <b>Personnel</b> in shopping malls. The results of the survey would help related organizations such as the Tourism of Malaysia to design appropriate language training to meet the needs <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Desk <b>Personnel.</b> Moreover, it is hoped that the study could also raise the awareness of learners’ needs, which are important factors for designing the language course.
