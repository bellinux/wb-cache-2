5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> black <b>howler</b> is {{the largest}} of the <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> species and one of {{the largest of the}} New World <b>monkeys.</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> black <b>howler</b> males are larger than those of any other Central American monkey species. On average, males weigh 11.4 kg and females weigh 6.4 kg. [...] The body is between 521 and 639 mm in length, {{excluding}} the tail. [...] The tail is between 590 and 690 mm long. Adults of both sexes have long, black hair and a prehensile tail, while infants have brown fur. [...] Males over four months old have white scrotums.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> black <b>howler,</b> or Yucatan black howler, (Alouatta pigra) is {{a species}} of <b>howler</b> <b>monkey,</b> a type of New World monkey, from Central America. It is found in Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, in and near the Yucatan Peninsula. It lives in evergreen, semideciduous and lowland rain forests. [...] It {{is also known as}} the baboon in Belize, {{although}} it is not closely related to the baboons in Africa.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> black <b>howler</b> shares several adaptations {{with other}} species of <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> that allow it to pursue a folivorous diet (mostly leaves). Its molars have high {{shearing}} crests, to help it eat the leaves, and the male of the species has an enlarged hyoid bone near the vocal cords. [...] This hyoid bone amplifies the male howler's calls, allowing it to locate other males without expending much energy, which is important, since leaves are a low-energy food. Howling occurs primarily at dawn and at dusk.|$|R
50|$|Characteristic of manteled <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys,</b> the Mexican <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> has a prehensile tail, a deepset jaw {{with small}} incisors and large canines, {{and a large}} vocal box to make deep howls.

50|$|Like catarrhines, <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> (a {{family of}} platyrrhines) show routine {{trichromatism}} {{that has been}} traced to an evolutionarily recent gene duplication. <b>Howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{are one of the}} most specialized leaf-eaters of the New World monkeys; fruits are not a major part of their diets, and the type of leaves they prefer to consume (young, nutritive, and digestible) are detectable only by a red-green signal. Field work exploring the dietary preferences of <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> suggests that routine trichromaticism was selected by environment.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the social relationships among adult females in two multimale-multifemale groups of black <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> Alouatta pigra during a 14 -month study in Palenque National Park, Mexico. Based on over 900 focal hours and over 5400 scan samples recording neighboring group members, {{we found that}} females very rarely engaged in agonistic interactions and no dominance hierarchy could be discerned. Relationships among resident females were primarily affiliative, but females of one study group spent {{a higher proportion of}} time in close proximity and engaged in affiliative interactions with one another at higher rates than females in the other study group. The strength of female relationships increased with the birth of an infant. Although no females immigrated during the study period, the temporary association of three extragroup females with our study groups implies that the social system of black <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> is more dynamic than previously suggested. These findings suggest that female black <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> behave more similarly to female red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> A. seniculus than to female mantled <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> A. palliata [Current Zoology 57 (1) : 1 – 7, 2011]...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two major}} {{theories}} that attempt to explain hand preference in non-human primates-the `task complexity' theory and the `postural origins' theory. In the present study, we proposed a third hypothesis to explain the evolutionary origin of hand preference in non-human primates, stating {{that it could have}} evolved owing to structural and functional adaptations to feeding, which we refer to as the `niche structure' hypothesis. We attempted to explore this hypothesis by comparing hand preference across species that differ in the feeding ecology and niche structure: red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys,</b> Alouatta seniculus and yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus xanthosternos. The red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> used the mouth to obtain food more frequently than the yellow-breasted capuchin <b>monkeys.</b> The red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> almost never reached for food presented {{on the opposite side of}} a wire mesh or inside a portable container, whereas the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys reached for food presented in all four spatial arrangements (scattered, on the opposite side of a wire mesh, inside a suspended container, and inside a portable container). In contrast to the red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> that almost never acquired bipedal and clinging posture, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys acquired all five body postures (sitting, bipedal, tripedal, clinging, and hanging). Although there was no difference between the proportion of the red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> and the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys that preferentially used one hand, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys exhibited an overall weaker hand preference than the red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Differences in hand preference diminished with the increasing complexity of the reaching-for-food tasks, i. e., the relatively more complex tasks were perceived as equally complex by both the red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> and the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys. These findings suggest that species-specific differences in feeding ecology and niche structure can influence the perception of the complexity of the task and, consequently, hand preference...|$|R
50|$|The Mexican howler can eat a {{remarkable}} variety of foods including leaves, flower, buds, petioles, and fruits. This subspecies of <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> {{is known to}} be a frugivore and a behavioural folivores. Their digestive system is slow and they have significantly fewer enzymes for protein and fiber digestion than other frugivores, but they compensate for this by selectively eating leaves with less fiber. Consequently, much of this the Mexican <b>howler</b> <b>monkey's</b> activity is dedicated for foraging for fruit and young leaves which it can easily digest. Frugivory is typically observed in New World monkeys instead of Old World <b>monkeys,</b> but <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> are an exception to this categorization.|$|R
5000|$|John Lloyd Stephens {{described}} the <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> at the Maya ruins of Copán as [...] "grave and solemn, almost emotionally wounded, as if officiating as {{the guardians of}} consecrated ground".

40|$|The Community Baboon Sanctuary (CBS) in Belize is a {{community}} reserve for the endangered black <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> (Alouatta pigra). This study assessed {{the performance of the}} CBS as an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category IV protected area through deforestation and forest fragmentation of the CBS and 500 m river buffer, and impacts on black <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> habitat over 15 years (1989 - 2004). Using satellite imagery remote sensing and landscape metrics, this study helps fill the gap in our understanding of forest fragmentation processes and habitat provision, using the black <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> as a specific example. Increased fragmentation resulted in decreased forest cover by 33 % within both the CBS and river buffer. However, connectivity between habitat patches has remained high, indicating that dispersal and colonising potential between most forest patches has not been jeopardised. We conclude that conservation within the CBS may be more complex than simply equating forest conservation with black <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> conservation. One could say the CBS has been successful at black <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> conservation, as documented by population increases over the past 20 years. However, if the conservation objective is forest preservation, one could conclude conservation failure and may signal that the CBS should not be managed for a single outcome as assigned by an IUCN Category IV designation...|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{field studies}} are {{critical}} for our understanding of animal life history and the processes driving changes in demography. Here, we present long-term demographic data for the northernmost population of mantled <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Alouatta palliata) residing in a highly anthropogenically fragmented landscape in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We carried out 454 monthly group visits to 10 groups of mantled <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> between 2000 and 2011. The population remained relatively stable over the 11 -year study period, with an overall increase in {{the total number of}} individuals. Birth rates and inter-birth intervals were comparable to those of <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> at non-fragmented sites, suggesting that living in a fragmented landscape did not affect the reproductive output of our study population. Moreover, despite the landscape, dispersal events were commonplace, including many secondary dispersals (individuals emigrating from groups that they had previously immigrated into). Finally, we found a marked effect of seasonality on the dynamics of our study population. In particular, the period of lowest temperatures and resource scarcity between November and March was associated with higher mortality and reproductive inhibition, while the period of resource abundance between April and May was associated with the majority of conceptions and weaning of offspring. This, in turn, could be influencing dispersal patterns in our study area, as male <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> seem to time some of their immigrations into new groups to coincide with the start of the period of higher fertility, while females preferentially joined new groups several months before the onset of this period. These data have important implications for the conservation and management of <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> in fragmented landscapes, as well as for our understanding of the effect of seasonality over <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> dispersal, reproduction and survival...|$|R
