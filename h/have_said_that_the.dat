5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, {{both of whom are}} known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
5|$|Starship Troopers {{brought to}} an end Heinlein's series of {{juvenile}} novels. It became one of his best-selling books, and is considered his most widely known work. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military, an aspect described as propaganda and likened to recruitment. The ideology of militarism {{and the fact that}} only military veterans had the right to vote in the novel's fictional society led to it being frequently described as fascist. This description is disputed, some commentators arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein's depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> terms used to describe the aliens were akin to racial epithets.|$|E

25|$|The 1998 {{home run}} race had {{generated}} nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' {{run for the}} all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's testosterone level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease.

25|$|In 2006, {{there was}} a surge in Foreign Direct Investment and a net {{increase}} of 3,795 in IDA supported jobs, with International and Financial Services having the highest growth rate. The reasons for {{the continuation of the}} Irish economic boom were somewhat controversial within Ireland. Some Economists, Civil Rights Activists and Social Commentators <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> growth throughout this period was merely due to a great increase in property values, and to catch-up growth in employment in the construction sector.|$|E

Some independent observers, including Álvaro Gil-Robles, the human rights envoy for the Council of Europe, and Louise Arbour, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war has largely concluded as of 2006.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{surrounded}} Genro's {{decision to}} grant refugee status to Battisti. Many law specialists <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> decision was illegal. The Brazilian Supreme Court began trying {{the case in}} September 2009. By 5 to 4 (simple majority), the court ruled Genro's decision null and void on 18 November. However, the court also decided by 5 to 4 that the Brazilian constitution gives the president personal powers to deny the extradition if he chose, effectively putting the decision {{in the hands of}} Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.|$|E

The tribe has expressed concern over leaks because the pipeline passes under Lake Oahe, which serves as a major source of water. Protests at pipeline construction sites in North Dakota began in the spring of 2016 and drew indigenous people, calling themselves water protectors and land defenders, from throughout North America as well as many other supporters, creating the largest gathering of Native Americans in the past hundred years.|$|E

25|$|Rome {{is often}} quite vocal about his {{frequent}} displeasures with affiliates, specifically {{those who do}} not carry the entire three hours, air the show on tape delay, or frequently pre-empt the broadcast. Rome has openly admitted that he is intrigued by the idea of satellite radio and broadcasting the program free of affiliates' interference. However, he is also aware of some listeners' problems with paying for satellite radio, and has received numerous phone calls and e-mails from terrestrial radio listeners who <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> humor of the show has brought them through difficult times or keeps them entertained at work.|$|E
25|$|By 2000, {{the need}} for {{additional}} An-225 capacity had become apparent, so the decision was made in September 2006 to complete the second An-225. The second airframe was scheduled for completion around 2008, then delayed. By August 2009, the aircraft had not been completed and work had been abandoned. In May 2011, the Antonov CEO is reported to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> completion of a second An-225 Mriya transport aircraft with a carrying capacity of 250 tons requires at least $300million, but if the financing is provided, its completion could be achieved in three years.

25|$|The mutineers at Taurama Barracks {{were still}} armed on 27January, and had {{announced}} that they would retain their weapons until they received a pardon.

Sasa was also reported to be seeking a pardon. Due to the intensification of the political crisis following the mutiny, the PNG Government's credit rating was downgraded from stable to negative by ratings agency Standard & Poor's.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, President Chen was re-elected to {{a second}} {{four-year}} term after an assassination attempt which occurred {{the day before the}} election. Two shots were fired, one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing, the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury). Police investigators <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most likely suspect {{is believed to have been}} Chen Yi-hsiung, who was later found dead. Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.|$|E
25|$|Ghailani was transported from Guantanamo Bay to New York City {{to await}} {{trial in the}} United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in June 2009. When the case came to trial, the judge {{disallowed}} the testimony of a key witness. On November 17, 2010, a jury found him guilty of one count of conspiracy, but acquitted him of 284 other charges including all murder counts. Critics of the Obama administration said the verdict proves civilian courts cannot be trusted to prosecute terrorists because it shows a jury might acquit such a defendant entirely. Supporters of the trial <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conviction and the stiff sentencing prove that the federal justice system works.|$|E
25|$|Yet, in {{attempting}} to show, in a mainstream movie, the reprehensibility of torture, and what was done in our name, the filmmakers seem to have conflated events, and in this they have generated a sore controversy: the chairs of two Senate committees <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> information used to find bin Laden was not uncovered through waterboarding. Do such scenes hurt the movie? Not as art; they are expertly done, without flinching from {{the horror of the}} acts and without exploitation. But they damage the movie as an alleged authentic account. Bigelow and Boal– the team behind The Hurt Locker– want to claim the authority of fact and the freedom of fiction at the same time, and the contradiction mars an ambitious project.|$|E
