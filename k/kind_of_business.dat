[...] Cruft overhauled the bookkeeping in the shop, changing it from a system using crosses to distinguish between wholesale and retail customers to a far more detailed system. The Maltese cross that was previously used in the bookkeeping was later instead stamped onto the biscuits as a type of trademark to distinguish Spratt's biscuits from other dog biscuits.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln {{returned}} to practicing law in Springfield, handling [...] "every <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> {{that could come}} before a prairie lawyer". Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Lincoln handled many transportation cases {{in the midst of}} the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.|$|E

The now-closed Stamford, Connecticut, branch was seen when Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) transferred there {{during the first half}} of the third season. Another episode, [...] "Branch Wars", gave viewers a brief glimpse of the Utica branch, one of several purportedly in upstate New York. Zbornak says that city was on the short list for where to base the show, with some of its writers having ties to Central New York, and that they always intended for at least a branch office to be located there, for reasons of phonetics.

500|$|After {{folding the}} Colonels, Brown stated that {{basketball}} {{was not the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> {{he wanted to be}} involved in. Despite this declaration, he purchased half-ownership in the NBA's Buffalo Braves later in 1976. The Braves had posted a dismal 30–52 record in the 1975–76 season, and Brown immediately set out to make moves that would improve the franchise's fortunes in the next season. He re-signed All Star guard Randy Smith, who had threatened to leave as a free agent, then traded the club's first-round draft pick to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Swen Nater. In a single day, he made two significant trades. In the first, he swapped reigning Rookie of the Year Adrian Dantley for the Indiana Pacers' Billy Knight, who was second in the league in scoring the previous season. Four hours later, he acquired Nate [...] "Tiny" [...] Archibald from the New York Nets for George Johnson and a first-round draft pick in 1979. In 1977, Brown purchased the remaining share of the team from owner Paul Snyder.|$|E
500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for me, it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience working on that one because I just couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxist academics {{are convinced}} that the statistical data show that profitability is falling, businessmen can often happily see their profits grow anyway, and have more real money in the bank. In theory they should have less money, but in practice they have more. That is because financial relationships between quantities of money (defined using a currency unit) can vary from the value proportions that exist between products or physical assets (defined in terms of the MELT, i.e. the monetary equivalent of labor time). If there is a significant drop in overall profitability, this will very likely also be reflected in data about the profit included in value-added, but that is only a rough indicator of the trend (the data quality may not be very great). Official statistics include in value-added only the net value of new production; if a business makes money simply from selling an asset it has, or from asset appreciation, this is not normally considered [...] "value-added", but property income. [...] If that was not the case, then any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> income (or just about any kind of income) would represent value-added. It does not.|$|E

The standpoint of this analysis is the role <b>of</b> <b>business</b> rule modeling in achieving business process flexibility. In particular, it is argued that flexible business process models require business rules as a declarative formalism to capture the semantics of policy and regulation. Four <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> rules {{can be used as a}} starting point to generate less complex control-flow-based business process models.
