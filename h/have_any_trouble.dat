5|$|The {{build-up}} to {{the final}} had focused upon many Manchester United fans' discontent at their takeover by American businessman and sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer, and large demonstrations were planned {{inside and outside the}} Millennium Stadium. Despite this, the final was played in the rain and only a small group of around 100 supporters held protests and sang anti-Glazer songs. The police were out in force but did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> to deal with.|$|E
25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E
2500|$|After his {{performance}} {{in the first two}} tests, Shane Warne's future was the subject of considerable speculation in the media. A Reuters report suggested that he was troubled by chronic shoulder troubles, but that if he could overcome them he would be the mainstay of Australia's bowling attack for a long time. The England skipper added to the Australian eulogies, describing Warne as [...] "easily the best bowler on either side", though Pakistan's Saleem Malik was less effusive, noting that [...] "I didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> picking out his variations".|$|E

5000|$|Kane {{conceived}} the character Savage, an espionage agent and troubleshooter, and developed {{the story and}} art. He based his protagonist visually on actor Lee Marvin, whom Kane {{had seen in the}} movie Point Blank. The resemblance was much more pointed on Robert Foster's photo-referenced painted cover, which was replaced by a new Kane illustration for the 1982 Fantagraphics reprint. Kane said in 1996, [...] "We never <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> from Lee Marvin [...] - [...] obviously he never saw the goddamn thing. We never <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> from anybody".|$|R

I am saying now to these meddlers from out of our city the best thing for them to do is stay out if they don't want to get slapped in jail. Our people of Birmingham are a peaceful people and we never <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> here unless some people come into our city looking for trouble. And I've never seen anyone yet look for trouble who wasn't able to find it".|$|E
2500|$|Fools and Worthless Liars was {{generally}} very well received by critics, with many {{noting that the}} band had progressed significantly. Ian Winwood, writing for Kerrang! magazine expressed some reservations about the 'generic' nature {{of some of the}} choruses, but also remarked that 'there are also moments when Fools and Worthless Liars is quite superb, and represents a stark stride forward for its creators'. This viewpoint is supported by Andy Ritchie, writing for Rock Sound: 'forget what you know about Deaf Havana. ...everything up until this point has just been a practise run'. He commended the band for writing a 'confident and precise rock record'. Tom Aylott, of punktastic.com, lauded the band for producing 'one of the best albums from a UK band this year' and noted that the 'most endearing quality isn’t the strength of the standout tracks, it’s that it doesn’t really seem to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>trouble</b> staying consistent until the end'. He, too, highlighted the progress the band had made, expressing his opinion that the album was 'mature'. The departure of Ryan Mellor and the subsequent transition was also a focal point of a review by Nick Robbins of Alter the Press!, who commented; 'the move away from a pigeonholed sound... has really given Deaf Havana the freedom to explore their sound'. He also praised Veck-Gilodi, describing him as a 'fantastic vocalist, with a large enough range to sound like two different singers'. He concluded; 'delivering on every level, on nearly every track, ‘Fools And Worthless Liars’ is one of 2011’s best albums'. A less favourable review came from Oliver Thompson of Dead Press!. He agreed with many other critics that Fools and Worthless Liars was an opportunity for Deaf Havana to showcase their ability, but felt that 'the band appear dreary and fail to get out of second gear' on the album. He described the flow of the album as 'difficult', highlighting [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] as a 'weak filler track', and suggested that 'unless you were a die-hard Deaf Havana fan, you may find this album a tad tedious and eventually boring'. Ourzone Magazine and Glasswerk also gave the album positive reviews.|$|E
