5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. <b>Joint</b> <b>pain</b> usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the <b>joint</b> <b>pain,</b> including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, <b>joint</b> <b>pain</b> and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the <b>joint</b> <b>pain</b> typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is a form}} of {{inflammatory}} arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen <b>joint.</b> <b>Pain</b> typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours. The joint {{at the base of the}} big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.|$|E
500|$|The {{characteristic}} {{symptoms of}} dengue are sudden-onset fever, headache (typically located behind the eyes), muscle and <b>joint</b> <b>pains,</b> and a rash. The alternative name for dengue, [...] "breakbone fever", {{comes from the}} associated muscle and <b>joint</b> <b>pains.</b> The course of infection {{is divided into three}} phases: febrile, critical, and recovery.|$|R
40|$|IN 1937 Healey 1 {{reported}} that about 3 per cent {{of young adults}} being immunized against scarlet fever developed multiple <b>joint</b> <b>pains</b> {{as a reaction to}} one or more injections of the sterile filtrate of broth cultures of scarlet fever streptococci. She noted that the majority of persons who had this reaction gave a history of previous <b>joint</b> <b>pains</b> associated with rheumatic fever, or of streptococcus infections of the nose and throat. We had made similar observations. Healey showed that 74. 6 per cent of a group of 63 such persons which she studied did not have <b>joint</b> <b>pains</b> when injected with the same dose of streptococcus filtrate which had been heated, and that 17. 4 per cent had some <b>joint</b> <b>pains</b> but milder ones when given the heated material. Her conclusion was that the majority of such reactions were caused by the toxin in the filtrate rather than the protein of the streptococci or the culture medium. Coburn and Pauli 2 studied in various ways 40 strains of hemolytic strep-tococci cultured from 38 rheumatic subjects during pharyngeal infections...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} are diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and <b>joint</b> <b>pains.</b> The <b>joint</b> <b>pains</b> {{may be due}} to migratory non-deforming arthritis, which may occur many years before any digestive tract symptoms develop; they tend to involve the large joints but can occur in any pattern and tend not to damage the joint surface {{to the point that the}} joint becomes deformed. Fever and chills occur in a small proportion of people.|$|R
5|$|Since bubbles {{can form}} in or migrate to {{any part of}} the body, DCS can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from <b>joint</b> <b>pain</b> and rashes to {{paralysis}} and death. Individual susceptibility can vary from day to day, and different individuals under the same conditions may be affected differently or not at all. The classification of types of DCS by its symptoms has evolved since its original description.|$|E
5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss or loss of appetite, shortness of breath, anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, petechiae (flat, pin-head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and <b>joint</b> <b>pain,</b> and persistent or frequent infections.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, and <b>joint</b> <b>pain</b> are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present: Germline mutations in the PHOX2A or KIF1B gene have {{been implicated in}} familial neuroblastoma as well. Neuroblastoma is also a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.|$|E

50|$|The syndromes are diverse, but tend {{to cause}} episodes of fever, <b>joint</b> <b>pains,</b> skin rashes, {{abdominal}} pains and {{may lead to}} chronic complications such as amyloidosis.|$|R
5|$|The {{next most}} common type, acinar cell {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and <b>joint</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1588, Gebhard's <b>joint</b> <b>pain</b> (Gelenkenschmerz) {{prevented}} him from riding a horse; the climate of Cologne, damp and cold, made his condition worse, so he relinquished his claim on the Electorate {{to the protection of}} Adolf von Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, which they pursued until their deaths later that year. In the summer 1588, Gebhard established his residence at Strassburg, where he had held the office of dean of the cathedral since 1574and had maintained it concurrently with his position in Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized <b>joint</b> <b>pain,</b> swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E

The classification of types of DCS by its symptoms has evolved since its original description over a hundred years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection; however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, <b>joint</b> <b>pain,</b> vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. <b>Joint</b> <b>pain</b> occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.|$|E

5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with <b>joint</b> <b>pain</b> and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
5|$|Initially Los Alamos was {{supposed}} to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at , diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral <b>joint</b> <b>pain.</b> The plan to commission scientists fell through when Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.|$|E
5|$|OCD is a {{relatively}} rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W et al. found OCD to {{be the cause of}} articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of <b>joint</b> <b>pain</b> in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.|$|E
50|$|Uveitis {{may cause}} {{pain of the}} {{affected}} eye together with changes in vision. It may be accompanied by nonspecific systemic symptoms such as fever, involuntary weight loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal <b>pain,</b> and <b>joint</b> <b>pains.</b>|$|R
50|$|Deferasirox can, however, have a {{wide variety}} of side effects. These may include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and <b>joint</b> <b>pains.</b> Some {{evidence}} has been shown of a link to gastrointestinal disorders experienced by some people who have received the treatment.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} (approximately 1%) {{side effect of}} {{pyrazinamide}} is <b>joint</b> <b>pains</b> (arthralgia), {{but this is not}} usually so severe that patients need to stop taking the pyrazinamide. Pyrazinamide can precipitate gout flares by decreasing renal excretion of uric acid.|$|R
5|$|While bubbles {{can form}} {{anywhere}} in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. <b>Joint</b> <b>pain</b> ("the bends") accounts for about 60% to 70% of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site. Neurological symptoms are present in 10% to 15% of DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances being the most common symptom. Skin manifestations are present in about 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS ("the chokes") is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre-breathing protocols. The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of <b>joint</b> <b>pain</b> in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E
5|$|By Spring 1588, Gebhard {{had run out}} of options. In 1583, he {{had refused}} the {{settlement}} offered to him after the conferences at Frankfurt and in Westphalia, counting on the support of the other Protestant electors. When their support did not materialize, he pursued diplomatic options with the French, the Dutch, and the English; these also were of limited help. After the destruction of Neuss in 1586, and the loss of the most of southern part of the Electorate in 1587, Rheinberg and its environs were the only territories of the Electorate he could claim, and much of this slipped from his grasp in 1588. He had exhausted his diplomatic, financial and military possibilities. His health problems (referred to as Gelenkenschmerz, or <b>joint</b> <b>pain)</b> prohibited him from riding, which limited his ability to travel. In the spring of 1588, he relinquished his claim on the Electorate to the protection of Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, and retired to Strassburg. Neuenahr and Schenck continued to fight for him, but the former died in an artillery explosion in 1589, and the latter was killed at Nijmegen that summer. Without them to defend his claim on the Electorate, Rheinberg, Gebhard's last outpost in the northern Electorate, fell to Parma's force in 1589.|$|E
