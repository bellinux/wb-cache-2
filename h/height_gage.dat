40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the possibility of a generic rating curve with a small number of adjustable parameters for the restricted class of bedrock step-pool rivers. The motivation for this study arose from Utah Valley University’s long-term program of groundwater development in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which requires hydrographs for bedrock step-pool rivers near remote mountain villages. Based upon personal communications from USGS state hydrologists and Google Earth satellite images and aerial photos, 71 USGS active or historic gaging sites were identified as bedrock step-pool rivers, involving 403 rating numbers and 13, 409 <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> vs. discharge measurements. For comparison, 71 gaging sites were chosen randomly, involving 268 rating numbers and 7617 <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> vs. discharge measurements. As the distributions of <b>gage</b> <b>heights</b> and discharges were a good fit to a lognormal distribution, the data were normalized by computing the Z-scores of the logarithms of discharge and <b>gage</b> <b>height,</b> in which the average and standard deviation were computed separately for each rating number. The linear relationships between Z-scores of <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> (y-axis) and discharge (x-axis) were surprisingly similar for bedrock step-pool and random rivers. For bedrock step-pool rivers, the slope was 0. 8829 with R 2 = 0. 78, while for random rivers, the slope was 0. 8467 with R 2 = 0. 72. Numerical experiments on generating rating curves based on two random measurements for each rating number showed that 50 % of all observed discharges deviated from predicted discharges by less than 31. 0 % for bedrock step-pool rivers and 27. 3 % for random rivers...|$|R

The PICA material was developed {{as a member of the}} Light Weight Ceramic Ablators (LCA's), and the manufacturing process of this material has since been significantly improved. The density of PICA material ranges from 14 to 20 lbm/ft(exp 3), having uniform resin distribution with and without a densified top surface. The thermal performance of PICA was evaluated in the Ames arc-jet facility at cold wall heat fluxes from 375 to 2, 960 BtU/ft(exp 2) -s and surface pressures of 0. 1 to 0. 43 atm. Heat loads used in these tests varied from 5, 500 to 29, 600 BtU/ft(exp 2) and are representative of the entry conditions of the proposed Discovery Class Missions. Surface and in-depth temperatures were measured using optical pyrometers and thermocouples.

40|$|The flow {{fields and}} the tracer {{concentrations}} of turbulent jets discharged vertically into standing water wave environments are studied theoretically and experimentally. The governing equations of the jet-wave interacting flow have been derived based on the Navies-Stokes equations and the technique of dimensional and scale analysis. An integral momentum equation along the jet axis is obtained. An expression for the variation of the axial velocity along the jet axis is developed in the jet dominated flow field. Experiments are performed in a water tank equipped with a jet generation mechanism and a surface standing wave generator. The wave displacements are measured by a capacitance wave <b>height</b> <b>gage.</b> The technique of laser-induced fluorescence is used to visualize the flow patterns. A laser Doppler velocimetry system is {{used to measure the}} flow field. The velocity signal is synchronized with the signal from the wave <b>height</b> <b>gage.</b> The signals are processed by time and phase averaging techniques for the investigations of the mean flow field and turbulence structures. Verification of experimental results for standing waves and for pure jets, respectively, shows that the generated waves are nearly perfect standing waves and the behaviors of the pure jets are consistent with previous researches. Visualization of the flow pattern and measurement of longitudinal velocity along the jet axis at the node of waves indicates that there are three flow regions, namely, the Jet Dominated Near Field (JDNF), Jet Dominated Far Field (JDFF) and Wave Dominated Far Field (WDFF). The distinction among these fields depends strongly to the relative importance of the wave motion and the jet initial velocity. The mean flow characteristics of JDFF are studied to determine its range and the variation of its longitudinal velocity along jet axis. The coefficient of velocity decay shows a nearly constant trend when the ratio between the jet initial velocity and wave-induced velocity at the exit of the jet nozzle, w 0 /û 0, is sufficiently large. The behaviors of the interacting flow in JDFF for large w 0 /û 0 are studied in detail. The results of the flow characteristics and tracer concentration under node and antinode of wave reveal that imposition of the surface water waves is to deform the axial symmetric circular cross-section for pure jet into an elliptical cross-section for a jet with wave. The results also show that the effect of wave oscillations can enhance greatly the spreading of jet mixing, turbulent intensity and Reynolds stresses. The enhancement caused by horizontal oscillations at node is larger than that caused by vertical oscillations at antinode. Modifications of wave-induced velocity, turbulent intensity and Reynolds stresses by the discharging of jet flow are also investigated and reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of round buoyant jets with water waves was studied experimentally by flow visualization techniques. The experiments were {{performed in a}} water tank equipped with a jet generating mechanism and a surface wave generator. The jets were driven by a constant head mechanism whereby the ejected water was pre-heated {{to a series of}} temperature differences from the ambient temperature of the tank water. The temperature profiles at various distances from the jet nozzle were measured by a thermistor scanned through the jet cross-section. Surface water waves were generated by a plunger-type wave maker. For this experiment, standing waves were produced at different frequencies to form nodes and antinodes above the jet. The wave amplitudes were measured by a capacitance wave <b>height</b> <b>gage.</b> Using potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) as a dye tracer, the response of the buoyants jets to the wave motions was then monitored by video recording and analyzing systems. The jet diffusion angles measured from the jet axis to the tracer outline were determined from visualization to quantify the level of dilution. The present results indicated that a) the far field cross-sectional temperature distributions for the buoyant jet are Gaussian, b) the surface water waves have very strong diluting effects on the jet mixing, c) the jet mixing is enhanced by a stretching/compression mechanism for vertical oscillations (antinode) and by a deflection/looping mechanism for horizontal oscillations (node), and d) the degree of jet mixing depends strongly on the competing process of buoyant force and wave action which is qualified by a wave Richardson number...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the qualification {{of the light}} weight Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablators (PICA) as the forebody heatshield for the Stardust Discovery Class Mission. The Stardust spacecraft will be launched in early 1999 and fly by Comet Wild- 2 to collect cometary and interstellar dust and return them back to earth in the Sample Return Capsule (SRC). This earth re-entry will be the fastest to date, at 12. 6 km/s, and therefore requires a heatshield that can withstand very high heating rates and stagnation pressures, {{as well as provide}} the necessary insulation to the vehicle structure. The PICA material was developed as part of the Lightweight Ceramic Ablators program at NASA Ames Research Center, and was baselined as the forebody heatshield because of its low density and superior ablation and thermal performance at severe aerothermodynamic conditions. Under a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program with NASA Ames, Fiber Materials, Inc. developed a process to manufacture a single-piece PICA heatshield for the forebody of the SRC, along with witness material for the fabrication of the test models. The test models were fabricated and instrumented by the staff of Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, Colorado. Full body preliminary aerothermal CFD calculations were performed at NASA Ames to determine the heating and stagnation pressure conditions. The Heat shield sizing was also performed at NASA Ames by using a new material response code that accounts for the highly porous characteristics of the PICA material. The ablation and thermal performance of PICA was qualified in the NASA Ames Interaction Heating Arc Jet Facility. A total of 24 models and four test conditions were used to qualify PICA at the predicted peak heat flux, heat load, shear, and stagnation pressure conditions. Surface and in-depth temperatures were measured using optical pyrometers and thermocouples. Surface recession was measured by using a template and a <b>height</b> <b>gage.</b> Several models were tested to evaluate repair procedures, and two models were cold soaked in liquid nitrogen, prior th testing, to investigate the effect of the cold space environment on the performance of the material.

40|$|Information on {{the flow}} of rivers and streams is a vital {{national}} asset that safeguards lives, protects property, and ensures adequate water supplies for the future. The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates a network of more than 9, 000 streamgages nationwide with more than 500 in Texas. If you have ever crossed a highway bridge and noticed a metal structure with an antenna {{by the side of}} it, you’ve probably seen a USGS streamgage (fig. 1). A streamgage contains instruments that measure and record the amount of water flowing in the river or stream, or its discharge. Generally, these measurements occur automatically every 15 minutes or more frequently in times of flooding. Words that have the same meaning used throughout this text: Stream stage = <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> = water level Streamflow = discharge = flow Streamflow station = streamgage = gaging station = gage continuously measure streamflow, the <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> of a stream is continuously measured. There is a strong mathematical relation between this height and streamflow and, as a result, a continuous record of streamflow can be calculated from the record of stream stage. Measuring the relative height of streams is done many times a day through an underwater tube contained in the streamgage (fig. 2). Gas is continually pushed through the tube into the stream. As the depth of water above the tube opening increases, more pressure is required to push the gas through the tube. As the water decreases, less pressure is needed to push the gas out. This level of pressure is used to calculate the height of the water above the tube. These changes in pressure are recorded as changes in height, or stage. Stage data are measured usually every 15 minutes. When intense rainfall and runoff cause the river or stream to rise quickly, the time intervals sometimes are shorter. The time interval can be as short as every 5 minutes. These data are transmitted to a satellite on a preset schedule which is usually every 1 to 4 hours. During high water or other emergency situations, data will be sent to the satellite every 15 minutes to provide more timely data. Figure 1. Examples of gage structures located at U. S.

The Mureş River {{is the most}} eloquent model regarding the alternation of characteristic river courses. In this alternation presents a special interest the course between Arieş and Strei, where due to the morphological and geological conditions we find lower course characteristics. The analysis of the river bed dynamics is carried out in two ways, vertically and horizontally. To evaluate the aggradation and degradation we used hydrometrical data found in the discharge measurements. The difference between the water <b>gage</b> <b>height</b> and the maximum depth indicate {{the evolution of the}} thalweg compared to the zero stage of the gage. The analysis of the horizontal dynamics is based on the cartographic method, in which we compare the topographic outlines of the river from three cartographic sources (1911, 1978 and 2005). The horizontal evolution was followed at first on the entire course of the river and then in three separate case studies. The case studies were chosen to illustrate different evolution types of meanders. The significant variations of different morfometrical parameters highlight the lower course character in the analyzed river sector...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} an extraction {{method of}} widespread flooded areas {{occurred in the}} Chao Phraya River basin, central Thailand, in the rainy season of 2011. RADARSAT- 2 imagery data have been mainly used to extract affected areas, while THAICHOTE imagery data {{have been used as}} optical supporting data for the Thai Government. In this study, the same data were used in a somewhat different method with more deeply in detail. ScanSAR Narrow-mode imagery with cross-polarization of RADARSAT- 2 was introduced to improve the accuracy and get more information on the ground surface. The SAR intensity images, which can be acquired also in the nighttime or under bad weather conditions, were found to be the most effective because the smoothness of water surface always shows low backscatter values. In the same way, the NDVI values calculated from the THAICHOTE images could also recognize flooded areas form open space under a clear sky condition. However, both of these sensors could not discriminate flooded urban areas easily because of the limitation of their spatial resolutions. Backscatter values still kept high although buildings were surrounded by water. The extracted results were validated by a high-resolution optical satellite image, water <b>height</b> data from <b>gaging</b> stations and a digital surface model (DEM) from LiDAR...|$|R
