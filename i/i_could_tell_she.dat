Although I was barely out of law school, Margaret convinced me to think about becoming a professor at Brooklyn. I think the rest of the faculty were somewhat less sanguine about my candi-dacy at the time⎯after all, I hadn’t even taken the bar exam and was not quite sure what lay in my future.

40|$|In this {{extract from}} her new book KATHLEEN MALTZAHN {{describes}} how the federal government’s attitude to the trafficking of women for prostitution began to change just six years ago, {{through the efforts of}} community activists and two journalists from the Australian. IN LATE 2002, I {{received a phone call from}} Charandev Singh, a human rights advocate at the Brimbank Community Legal Centre in Melbourne’s outer west. We had never met, but Singh had heard that Project Respect, where I worked, had been following the case of a young woman who had died in the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney. Puongtong Simaplee died on 27 September 2001, and the manner of her death was noticed by Senator Brian Harradine. In parliament Harradine asked Senator Ellison, the minister representing the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, whether he was “aware that the death of the young girl occurred after she had been in a distressed state and crying for over a period of three or four days and was obviously in need of special care. ” Senator Ellison replied that the “detainee had been in detention since 23 September as a result of a major compliance operation in Sydney targeting several premises associated with the sex industry and people smuggling within that industry. ” We were concerned. In 2001, we had received funding from the Myer Foundation to research trafficking, and we had uncovered a pattern of the detention and deportation of trafficked women. Victims of crime, it seemed, were being treated like criminals - held in immigration detention and deported without recourse to justice. We did not know anything about the young woman who had died, but her death raised significant questions. But while the news was disturbing, we weren’t sure what to do about it. A few months before, I had sat in on the coronial inquiry into the death of another woman who had died having been at Villawood. Vietnamese woman Thi Hang Le had come to Australia in 1997 on a student visa. In 2000 her request for a new student visa was rejected; she was detained on 4 July 2001 and taken to Villawood. By 13 January 2002 she was dead. At the time, the coronial inquiry made me think she couldn’t have been trafficked - none of the cases of trafficking our research had uncovered had involved student visas. Now, having seen student visas regularly used as a way to get trafficked women into Australia, I am not as confident that Thi Hang Le wasn’t a victim of trafficking. Such questions, though, were not within the purview of the inquiry, even if there had been official concern about trafficking at that time. Thi Hang Le was transferred to a psychiatric unit at Bankstown Hospital, seemingly having attempted to jump off a balcony. She tried to escape at least twice, and finally succeeded. On 12 December, after some six months outside Villawood, she was captured after a storekeeper found her stealing food in his shop. He didn’t want her charged, he said, but as a detention centre escapee she was taken straight back to Villawood. She weighed 42 kilos, down from 56 kilos when she had been detained in July. In Villawood, she again tried to jump off a balcony, and was again transferred to the psychiatric unit. Villawood staff said she was now terrified of men. She refused food and medication, and staff held her down to administer drugs. By 8 January she was on fifteen-minute watches. She was clearly not well. Immigration, however, had a job to do - they had set 13 January as Thi Hang Le’s deportation date and nothing, it seemed, was going to change that date. Remarkably, after a short consultation, medical staff agreed that she was well enough to travel. She was transferred back to Villawood in preparation for leaving the country. On 13 January, the day she was due to be deported, Le jumped again, from the first storey of a building. This time the impact was fatal. Sitting in on the coronial inquiry, it was evident to me that many of the facts in Thi Hang Le’s case were unclear, witnesses had been deported, records were contradictory, and the actions of Australasian Correctional Management, the organisation contracted to run Villawood, were deeply problematic. Despite this, the coroner took little more than the morning to hear the case. We were concerned that the same thing would happen with Puongtong Simaplee’s inquiry, but we had no idea that we could do anything about it. Charandev Singh’s phone call solved the problem. Singh is a prison activist with a profound understanding of the coronial process, particularly in relation to deaths in custody. When he rang, he had been involved in eleven coronial inquiries into deaths in prisons and immigration detention. He also has one of the finest minds I have ever encountered. He suggested that Project Respect seek legal standing at the coronial inquiry. With little idea about what this meant, and even less about what it would entail, we agreed. We had no funding for such a venture, had little support and were already overworked, but the more we found out about trafficking in Australia, the clearer it became that immigration detention of trafficked women had to be addressed. In the year leading up to Singh’s call, Project Respect had had more and more contact with trafficked women. A clear pattern had emerged. Women - at that time often Thai women - were coming to Australia on the promise of decent conditions and good pay. Many knew they might be doing prostitution, or at least would be connected to the sex industry through karaoke bars or strip clubs. Some, a small minority, had no inkling that they would have anything to do with prostitution. Either way, their experience was similar. Women told us of being lied to, raped, beaten and locked up, of having no control over how or if they had sex with customers, having to have sex when they were sick or menstruating, being deprived of their passports and threatened with violence and deportation. Some women were sold on from one trafficker to the next. All were paying off “debts” of at least $ 35, 000. Some escaped and, if found, were beaten and fined. They saw all the same things happening to other women. Many said they believed that women had been killed for running away, and I was shown a gruesome photo of a tortured Thai woman slumped in a rice field. Women I’d met in brothels and other people connected with the sex industry said they knew the runaway contract girl in the picture. Whether the photo was staged or real, its impact was the same - women believed they were expendable. The violence they had seen and experienced had taught them that their life under contract in Australia was worth little and crimes could be committed against them with impunity. Life was hard and frightening. As one woman told us, “I thought easy, but very hard. ” Another woman told us that she would “never do contract again. ” “Something stuck in here,” she said, touching her chest, “never happy, can’t sleep, bad dream every sleep, very bad feeling. ” Many of the women had experienced poverty in their homeland and wanted to help their parents, educate their siblings or feed their children. Some were leaving behind violence - abusive husbands, bosses who harassed them. Others were simply in search of a new life, adventure, a good job - all the things Australians in their twenties are looking for when they set off on backpacker holidays. Some had done prostitution before, either in their home country or abroad, and they consistently said that where the experience in another country had been difficult - “Macau was too hard,” one woman said, “it feels like in jail” - they expected that prostitution in Australia would be easier. At that time, despite the many crimes committed against the women, if they were found by the Department of Immigration to be in breach of their visa conditions they were put in detention and deported. No charges were laid: even leaving aside the federal sexual slavery legislation, crimes under state law - rape, battery and imprisonment - were going undetected by the authorities. Compounding the women’s fear of deportation, traffickers themselves threatened to and in fact at times did report women to immigration authorities. It was difficult to know how many women were being trafficked. The authorities weren’t counting - they didn’t believe trafficking existed - and it was hard for a small organisation like ours to come up with national estimates. There were three significant barriers to documenting trafficking cases. First, victims were fearful of both immigration authorities and traffickers, and so were often reluctant to tell their stories. Second, there was little official documentation of trafficking, and no prosecutions to establish how it worked. Third, and obviously, the very nature of trafficking makes it difficult to reach victims, and even when we found women (for example, during outreach to brothels) it was often not safe to talk openly to them about their experiences. In the face of inaction by other bodies, however, we tried to do the sums ourselves. In March 2004, a year after the 2003 coronial inquiry into Puongtong Simaplee’s death, Project Respect compiled a case-by-case list of trafficking victims. In only six weeks of research in early 2004 we documented 300 cases in Australia, the great bulk trafficking for prostitution. This research was clearly partial. We weren’t able, for example, to travel to Perth or Adelaide to investigate in more detail stories we had heard of trafficking there. The work was done quickly with few resources, based on interviews with trafficked women themselves, with other people connected to the sex industry, and with NGOs and unions. What it showed, however, was that even a fairly cursory exploration found far too many victims. It reinforced our belief that the estimate we had come up with a year earlier, around the time of the 2003 coronial inquiry, was reasonable - we believed that up to 1000 women could be being trafficked to Australia yearly. International estimates were high. The 2004 Trafficking in Persons Report, from the US Department of State, said that each year “an estimated 600, 000 - 800, 000 men, women, and children are trafficked across international borders (some international and non-governmental organizations place the number far higher), and the trade is growing. ” Millions more, it found, were trafficked within borders. “The US government,” it added, “estimates that over half of all victims trafficked internationally are trafficked for sexual exploitation. ” The United Nations and the US government both estimated that criminal networks made seven billion dollars every year from trafficking people. Numbers are clearly important - they help governments determine the scale of their response, and are a benchmark for charting success or failure in addressing the problem. But knowing the numbers is not enough. In the words of Professor Liz Kelly from the London Metropolitan University’s Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit, a highly respected researcher in this area, “having a sense of the scale of trafficking tells us only part of the picture Equally as important is understanding trafficking methods; where women are trafficked from, [and] their experiences of procurement, migration and treatment after arrival” in the destination country. What the coronial inquiry into the death of Puongtong Simaplee did was start people asking these sorts of questions - what sort of crimes were foreign women in Australia experiencing, how were traffickers able to exploit women in this way, why were authorities missing the problem, and what were trafficked women doing to survive in the absence of a humane government response? Arriving at the point where trafficking was being discussed at all was testament to Charandev Singh’s skill and inordinate hard work. Months before the case, when we had little reason to expect that we would get legal standing, let alone anything more than that, he was clear. We needed a legal strategy, he said, and a media strategy, and he proceeded to pull them together. He was formally employed three days a week by Brimbank Community Legal Centre to work on issues like ours, but he worked day and night on our case, far beyond the hours he was paid for. We had little information to go on at that stage. Our cause received a boost, however - albeit a saddening one - when the coroner’s office told Singh that Puongtong Simaplee had indeed been trafficked, and that this had happened when she was a child. The first step in the legal strategy was to gain legal standing, to argue that Project Respect should be represented at the coronial inquiry as “a person of sufficient interest in the subject matter” of the inquest. Singh argued that, in a long line of such parties at coronial inquiries, Project Respect could bring expertise and unique knowledge about trafficking that would help the court. The areas that concerned us, we stated in our application, were the medical and welfare services and assessments provided to Simaplee, the decision to send her to Villawood rather than to a health facility, and the fact that the Department of Immigration and Australasian Correctional Management were aware that Simaplee had probably been trafficked and yet acted as they did. Among a number of statements, not all true, Puongtong Simaplee had told Department of Immigration official Daniel Bell that she was from a hill tribe in Thailand, had come to Australia fifteen years before, and had been sold by her parents. The case was scheduled for 12 March. Much to my surprise, the coroner gave us standing. But my sense that the coroner was not entirely open to our participation was soon confirmed. As the inquiry began, he set the parameters. “This is not an enquiry into the sex industry,” he told the court. “This is not an enquiry into immigration detention. ” This position impacted immediately on what we were allowed to ask. When we asked questions relating to the sex industry or trafficking, our lawyer was told she was out of line. Having been given legal standing solely on the basis of our expertise on trafficking, we were told we could not ask questions on that issue. So we didn’t. At least not immediately. Having read through the brief again and again, it was devastatingly clear that Puongtong Simaplee had died without reason. There was no doubt she was vulnerable. Court documents show that before her detention she had a heroin addiction, was homeless and, in the words of an older friend, was “not in a positive state of mind. ” She was so physically underdeveloped that detention officials ordered a medical examination to establish if she was male or female. Her arms were marked by scars. (Her boyfriend told police that she marked herself when she did something wrong so she could remember why she did it.) A title search of the brothel she had been picked up in showed that at the time of her detention it was owned by Kean Chang. Puongtong Simaplee also told immigration officials that she had been trafficked as a child. But these things shouldn’t have killed her. She had survived 27 years, many of them hard, but it wasn’t until she entered an Australian government institution that she died. Dr Allan Carla, a pathologist at the Institute of Forensic Medicine at Glebe, told the court that her life could have been saved with “simple measures,” such as placing her on a drip. She had given Villawood officials precise information about the medication she needed to withdraw from the heroin in her system, but was ignored. She was left in a room with a bucket of faeces and urine because the staff thought cleaning it up might motivate her. Handover processes were so poor that staff coming onto new shifts didn’t know that Simaplee had been vomiting since she had arrived. When she had arrived at Villawood, Puongtong’s weight was noted as 37 kilos. When she died less than 72 hours later, she weighed 31 kilos. For the two days of witnesses, we asked questions about Simaplee’s medical treatment, welfare measures and the processes in place at Villawood to protect vulnerable detainees. The coroner made it clear, however, that his court was not the place for further conversations about what role trafficking had played in getting this woman into Australia and ultimately immigration detention. “This is not a human rights court,” he said succinctly. It was here that Charandev Singh’s second strategy kicked in. We took the questions we weren’t allowed to ask within the coronial inquiry and asked them outside. It’s a well-worn approach of course, but in this case the strategy of using the legal process as much as we could and then working with the media to raise questions that weren’t allowed in the hearing was crucial. Crucial, but not without risk. It didn’t take a lot of imagination to work out what some members of the media could do with the story of a heroin-addicted Asian prostitute. The Department of Immigration had already set the tone in its 2001 media release on Simaplee’s death. A Thai drug addict, the release said, had died from overdose in Villawood in a pool of her own vomit. The text seems since to have been removed from the department’s website. We were fortunate though. Singh had previously dealt with Australian journalist Elisabeth Wynhausen on stories about immigration detention, and he knew we could trust her to tell the story fairly. I know now that Wynhausen is an award-winning journalist and book author who worked for twelve years in New York as correspondent for the Age and the National Times and had also worked for the Bulletin, but at that time all I really knew was that Singh trusted her. I first met her in November 2002 when I walked, dazed, out of a long night in a brothel, having heard story after story from women who had been trafficked to Australia. A train ride later, unwashed and sleep-deprived, in a cafe over the road from the Australian’s shiny headquarters, I blurted out what I had spent the last months listening to. Wynhausen listened for a bit, cut me off, fired questions at me, interrupted a bit more, and told the waiter off for wishing her Merry Christmas. For a community worker schooled in letting people speak, it was a surprise, but I was sold. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> understood the issues. By the time the coronial inquiry began in early 2003, Wynhausen was ready to go, and the Australian soon teamed her up with its new investigative editor, Natalie O’Brien, who a couple of years before had uncovered the truth about the “children overboard” story. The Australian’s stories began with Puongtong Simaplee’s death and the fact that despite her claims that she had been trafficked into Australia as a child, and despite her vulnerability, neither the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre nor the Department of Immigration took the steps needed to address these issues and keep the young woman alive. Many news agencies jumped on the story that Puongtong Simaplee had been trafficked to Australia as a child - a statement that was not investigated in the coronial inquiry and was later shown to be untrue - but Wynhausen and O’Brien saw the broader story. The child-trafficking claim pulled in media outlets that might not ordinarily have bothered with a death-in-custody story. In Sydney in particular, the coverage seemed intense, as newspapers such as the Daily Telegraph and usually conservative talkback radio programs expressed outrage at her death. Undeterred by the fact that its own back pages included numerous advertisements for dubious brothels, the Daily Telegraph’s editorial proclaimed that trafficking was a “loathsome practice” and Simaplee’s death a tragic cruelty. In time, it became clear that Puongtong Simaplee had not been trafficked to Australia when she was a child. While the deputy coroner said that it was not the role of the coronial process to investigate if Simaplee’s claim was true, other people thought it was a question that should be addressed, and a Bangkok-based journalist went looking for her parents. I had been unconvinced by the claim that Puongtong Simaplee had been sold by her parents. Although the coroner’s office had told Singh that Simaplee had been trafficked as a child, the suggestion that she had been sold was, in my view, a whole different charge, and one that needed as much investigation as the question of the trafficking. Although stories of Asian parents selling their children into prostitution have become part of our folklore, it is hard to find evidence that the practice is in any way widespread. It’s not that it has never happened, it is just that it happens far less frequently than popular imagination would have us believe. Chris Payne’s 2005 documentary, Trafficked, about “Ning,” a young teenaged girl found in a Sydney brothel in 1995 after Papertiger was disbanded - the girl who Senator Ian Macdonald referred to in his second reading speech on the 1999 Slavery and Sexual Servitude Bill - suggests it is very likely that Ning’s father accepted payment for her, and may have suspected she would be prostituted. At the very least, it is clear that he did little to ensure his daughter would be going to a safe job and,...|$|E

It happened, and I heard it when Nicki gave me the record and it really was one of those incredible things that was really a blessing. It manifested. She said she wanted it and it happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{my way to}} {{the hotel}} I passed the end of the square in which Mrs. Catherick lived. Should I go back to the house, and make another attempt to see her. No. That news of Sir Percival's death, which was the last news she ever {{expected}} to hear, must have reached her hours since. All the proceedings at the inquest had been reported in the local paper that morning--there was nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her which <b>she</b> did not know already. My interest in making her speak had slackened. I remembered the furtive hatred in her face when she said, [...] "There is no news of Sir Percival that I don't expect--except the news of his death." [...] I remembered the stealthy interest in her eyes when they settled on me at parting, after she had spoken those words. Some instinct, deep in my heart, which I felt to be a true one, made the prospect of again entering her presence repulsive to me--I turned away from the square, and went straight back to the hotel.|$|R

Without saying a word she took hold of the winch (it was turned by handpower then), and round she swung him, and Jack began to flop about inside. 'O Lard! stop the churn! let me out!' says he, popping out his head. 'I shall be churned into a pummy!' (He was a cowardly chap in his heart, as such men mostly be). 'Not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence!' says {{the old woman}}. 'Stop the churn you old witch!' screams he. 'You call me old witch, do ye, you deceiver!' says she, 'when ye ought to ha' been calling me mother-law these last five months!' And on went the churn, and Jack's bones rattled round again. Well, none of us ventured to interfere; and at last 'a promised to make it right wi' her. 'Yes--I'll be as good as my word!' he said. And so it ended that day." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 17 October 1998 Harris went to {{the house}} of 33-year-old Yvonne Ford, who had a mild {{intellectual}} handicap. Harris later said he [...] "just went there. I was probably out on one of me walks and I probably had a few drinks, in the area so I just went {{went to the}} house ended up there". Ford let him in, and after some time he made a sexual advance towards her. He later said [...] "We struck up a bit of a friendship, as, just, just driving her around, and <b>I</b> obviously <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> was lonely, she was slightly handicapped. I didn't come, I didn't come around here for sex, I didn't come around here for anything, I just came around to say Hello, I live nearby, but then these thoughts started entering my head that I wanted to kill her." [...] As they sat in the bath together, Harris strangled her and held her under the water for 3 or 4 minutes. [...] "It could have been her, it could've been anybody. She was just unlucky...I just thought she would be easy, to target, she wouldn't put up a fight or ... she would be relatively easy to kill". Asked how he felt after the murder he said [...] "powerful, angry, just anger, pure anger. Not, not that she, there was no sex or anything, I was angry at the world. This is why this whole thing has happened, has started, and it was just my total anger building up from, I don't know, from the day I was adopted, it's just all built and built and, and something has set, set me off and I, I killed her".|$|R
60|$|The little railway {{carriage}} {{in which we}} sat rocked with speed as we flew through the French landscape. I caught glimpses of solid, Norman farm buildings, of towers and keeps and delicate steeples, and quaint towns; of bare poplars swaying before the March gusts, of green fields ablaze in the afternoon sun. I took it all in distractedly. Here was Maude beside me, but a Maude I had difficulty in recognizing, whom I did not understand: who talked of a life she had built up for herself and that seemed to satisfy her; one with which I had nothing to do. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> how <b>she</b> regarded my re-intrusion. As she continued to talk, a feeling that was almost desperation grew upon me. I had things to say to her, things that every moment {{of this sort of}} intercourse was making more difficult. And I felt, if I did not say them now, that perhaps I never should: that now or never was the appropriate time, and to delay would be to drift into an impossible situation wherein the chance of an understanding would be remote.|$|R

She {{asked whether}} you had seen {{anything}} of her sister, or whether Mrs. Lecount knew anything of her sister--I suppose {{because she was}} aware you had been at Aldborough. Of course <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her nothing. <b>She</b> entered into no details on the subject, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not presume to ask her for any. All I did was {{to set to work}} with might and main to assist her inquiries. The attempt was an utter failure; nobody could give us any information. We tried personal description of course; and strange to say, the only young lady formerly staying at Aldborough who answered the description was, of {{all the people in the}} world, the lady you have married! If she had not had an uncle and aunt (both of whom have left the place), I should have begun to suspect that you had married your cousin without knowing it! Is this the clew to the mystery? Don't be angry; I must have my little joke, and I can't help writing as carelessly as I talk. The end of it was, our inquiries were all baffled, and I traveled back with Miss Vanstone and her attendant as far as our station here. I think I shall call on the Tyrrels when I am next in London. I have certainly treated that family with the most inexcusable neglect.|$|R

My dear young Monsieur, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>tell</b> when <b>she</b> would fling over her pretended {{sweetness}} and put her tongue out at me. Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> you about a boy, the son of pious and rich parents, whom she tried to lead astray into the wildness of thoughts like her own, till the poor dear child drove her off because she outraged his modesty? I saw him often with his parents at Sunday mass. The grace of God preserved him and made him quite a gentleman in Paris. Perhaps it will touch Rita’s heart, too, some day. But she was awful then. When I wouldn’t listen to her complaints she would say: ‘All right, sister, I would just as soon go clothed in rain and wind.’ And such a bag of bones, too, like the picture of a devil’s imp. Ah, my dear young Monsieur, you don’t know how wicked her heart is. You aren’t bad enough for that yourself. I don’t believe you are evil at all in your innocent little heart. I never heard you jeer at holy things. You are only thoughtless. For instance, I have never seen you make {{the sign of the cross}} in the morning. Why don’t you make a practice of crossing yourself directly you open your eyes. It’s a very good thing. It keeps Satan off for the day.” ...|$|R
60|$|She flushed a little, {{embarrassed by}} the passion in his tone. His letters {{had told me that}} he was very much in love with his wife, and I saw that he could hardly take his eyes off her. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> if <b>she</b> loved him. Poor pantaloon, he was not an object to excite love, but the smile in her eyes was affectionate, and it was {{possible}} that her reserve concealed a very deep feeling. She was not the ravishing creature that his love-sick fancy saw, but she had a grave comeliness. She was rather tall, and her gray dress, simple and quite well-cut, did not hide the fact that her figure was beautiful. It was a figure that might have appealed more to the sculptor than to the costumier. Her hair, brown and abundant, was plainly done, her face was very pale, and her features were good without being distinguished. She had quiet gray eyes. She just missed being beautiful, and in missing it was not even pretty. But when Stroeve spoke of Chardin it was not without reason, and she reminded me curiously of that pleasant housewife in her mob-cap and apron whom the great painter has immortalised. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> imagine her sedately busy among her pots and pans, making a ritual of her household duties, so that they acquired a moral significance; I did not suppose that she was clever or could ever be amusing, but there was something in her grave intentness which excited my interest. Her reserve was not without mystery. I wondered why she had married Dirk Stroeve. Though she was English, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not exactly place her, and it was not obvious from what rank in society she sprang, what had been her upbringing, or how she had lived before her marriage. She was very silent, but when she spoke it was with a pleasant voice, and her manners were natural.|$|R
