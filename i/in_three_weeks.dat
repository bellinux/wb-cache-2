5|$|Scaly-breasted munia {{clutches}} usually contain 4 to 6 eggs, but {{can contain}} up to 10. Both sexes build the nest and incubate the eggs, which hatch in 10 to 16 days.

In the wild, however, since maturation may be impacted by variable daylight and humidity, both sexes can take between 12 and 18 months to reach sexual maturity depending {{on the time of}} year. Scaly-breasted munias have a typical life expectancy of 6 to 8 years.|$|E

5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive eruption hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> as Kīlauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a major highway on the way there. An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 eruption, is at risk from future eruptions. The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, but stopped short after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E

5|$|B'Day is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was {{released}} to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday on September 4, 2006 through Columbia Records, Music World Entertainment, and Sony Urban Music, and three days earlier in Latin America through Sony BMG Music Entertainment. The record was originally planned as a 2004 follow-up to Beyoncé's debut studio album Dangerously in Love (2003), however it was delayed to accommodate the recording of Destiny's Child's final studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004) and her starring role in the film Dreamgirls (2006). While on vacation after filming Dreamgirls, Beyoncé began contacting various producers; she rented Sony Music Studios, and completed B'Day <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> Most of the lyrical content of the album was inspired by Beyoncé's role in the film. The album's musical style ranges from 1970s–80s funk influences and balladry to urban contemporary elements such as hip hop and R. Live instrumentation was employed in recording most of the tracks as part of Beyoncé's vision of creating a record using live instruments.|$|E
5|$|Ride the Lightning is {{the second}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory {{to the rest of}} the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine.|$|E
