5|$|In late April, the {{division}} loaded onto troop trains {{for a trip}} to the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia {{along with the rest of}} the 31st Army, which was transferring to the 1st Ukrainian Front for the final push to Prague. It disembarked in Saxony on the night of May 6. The army's role was as a <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> on the left of the 1st Ukrainian Front, protecting the northern prong of the attack on the Czech capital. Advancing against little organized resistance, the 331st was on the outskirts of the town of Schlewitz when it got word of the German surrender.|$|E
5|$|Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen {{ignored the}} {{confusion}} {{as their own}} troops struggled in the wheeling pivot. From their vantage point, it appeared to the Allied commanders that the Prussians were moving eastward; Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen presumed that the Prussians were about to retreat {{in order to avoid}} being taken in their flank and rear. The Allied generals hurried the march, sending on the leading (right wing) cavalry towards Reichardtswerben. They also called up part of the left wing cavalry from the tail of the column and even the <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> cavalry to take part in what they presumed would be the general chase. Any semblance of the wheeling pivot was lost in these fresh maneuvers, and the remaining columns lost all cohesion and order.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights {{to the right and}} the Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced to remain on the defensive. His only chance at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E

5|$|When the Prussians broke camp, {{they left}} {{a handful of}} light troops to {{demonstrate}} before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> on the Schartau hill, which lay {{at right angles to}} the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies' army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|E
5|$|The 52nd (Lowland) Division {{was to make}} a preparatory attack {{near the}} coast to open the way for the attack on Junction Station the next day. They were to attack north of the Nahr Sukhereir between the villages of Burqa and Yazur with the Yeomanry Mounted Division acting as <b>flank</b> <b>guard.</b> Their {{objective}} was an important Ottoman rearguard position which ran from the village of Burqa to Brown Hill. While the village was easily taken it was necessary to make an extremely difficult attack on the steep sided Brown Hill. The hill was topped by a large cairn and commanded a long field of fire over the plain southwards across the Nahr Sukhereir. By the time a battalion of the 156th Brigade, covered by two batteries of the 264th Brigade Royal Field Artillery and the South African Field Artillery Brigade of 75th Division, captured the crest it had been reduced to a handful of men. But just 20minutes after taking Brown Hill the remnants of the Scots battalion (now down to just one officer and about 100 men) was unable to withstand an Ottoman counterattack and was driven off after a fierce struggle at close quarters.|$|E
5|$|Thus, on {{the morning}} of 13 September, the tenth day of the march from Caputvada, the Roman army {{approached}} Ad Decimum. There Gelimer planned to ambush and encircle them, using a force under his brother Ammatas to block their advance and engage them, while 2,000 men under his nephew Gibamund would attack their left flank, and Gelimer himself with the main army would attack from the rear and completely annihilate the Roman army. In the event, the three forces failed to synchronize exactly: Ammatas arrived early and was killed as he attempted a reconnaissance with a small force by the Roman vanguard, while Gibamund's force was intercepted by the Hunnic <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> and was utterly destroyed. Unaware of all this, Gelimer marched up with the main army and scattered the Roman advance forces present at Ad Decimum. Victory might have been his, but he then came upon his dead brother's body, and apparently forgot all about the battle. This gave Belisarius the time to rally his troops, come up with his main cavalry force and defeat the disorganized Vandals. Gelimer with the remainder of his forces fled westwards to Numidia. The Battle of Ad Decimum ended in a crushing Roman victory, and Carthage lay open and undefended before Belisarius.|$|E

5|$|Div Cav rested near Filignano and Montaquila. Two {{troops from}} C Squadron were {{positioned}} along the Venafro–Atina {{road and the}} rest of the regiment built the road between Filignano and Montaquila. On 18 April, Bonifant left for New Zealand on furlough and was replaced by his second-in-command, Major Nicholas Wilder. On 10 May, the final offensive against the Gustav Line began; the regiment was combined with the 22nd and 24th Battalions and No. 2 Company of the 27th Machine Gun Battalion to become Pleasants Force, to take over positions held by the Kimberley Rifles. On the night of 11 May, the final battle for Monte Cassino began. The French Expeditionary Corps outflanked the German defences in an advance along the Aurunci Mountains. The 78th Infantry Division advanced to Route 6 and on the right of the Eighth Army the II Polish Corps captured Monte Cassino. The Gustav Line was soon broken through and Allied troops in the Anzio beachhead conducted a breakout. By 26 May, the Axis was retreating; the regiment retrieved its vehicles and drove up the valley to Atina, passing through during the evening before it was stopped by opposition at Vicalvi. Three days later Vicalvi was captured by the 21st Battalion and the regiment advanced through the town. Since the bridge over the Fibreno River had been destroyed, BSquadron guarded the site while two troops found their way across and provided a <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> for the Maori Battalion. CSquadron remained in Vicalvi on 31 May and A Squadron held Posta until it was replaced by the RAF Regiment. BSquadron moved up to Sora when the bridge was completed. On 1 June, B Squadron advanced toward Isola del Liri, which was captured by the 8th Indian Infantry Division. A Squadron was transferred to the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade to advance with it in pursuit, while the rest of the regiment laagered on the Fibreno. Allied troops rapidly advanced and Rome was captured on 4 June.|$|E
25|$|Murat routed General-Major Christian Ludwig Schimmelpfennig's 1,300-man <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> at Zehdenick on 26 October. After losing 250 men, the {{survivors}} fled {{along the highway}} until they reached Stettin. The next day, General of Brigade Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud got across Hohenlohe's escape route at Boitzenburg. After a three-hour action, Hohenlohe drove off the French light cavalry brigade, but not before Murat's dragoons captured most of the Gensdarmes Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 10 which was acting as a <b>flank</b> <b>guard.</b> On 28 October, Murat finally ran Hohenlohe to earth at the Battle of Prenzlau. General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy's 2nd Dragoon Division cut a swath through the Prussian column of march, after which General of Division Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division captured the rear guard. With 3,000 of Lannes' infantry on hand in addition to Lasalle and the dragoons, Murat bluffed Hohenlohe into surrendering his remaining 10,000 troops by falsely claiming that the Prussians were surrounded by overwhelming forces.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Seventh Army {{formed a}} new {{provisional}} combat detachment designed to counter-attack into the British flank. On 1 May the Ottoman troops which pushed in the 4th Light Horse Brigade's <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> near Jisr ed Damieh, were the Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division {{and part of}} an infantry division (probably the VIII Corps' 48th Division) part of whom continued on up the road to attack Es Salt.|$|E
50|$|The Allied horse {{pursued the}} fleeing Frenchmen for 8 mi in the {{direction}} of Bouchain. Seeing the defeat, two French <b>flank</b> <b>guards</b> of 5,000 men each {{on each side of the}} defeated column hastily retired on Cambrai, covered by cavalry. Otto's men withdrew on Saint-Aubert to reform, but Bonnaud's cavalry had meanwhile recovered and counterattacked. Otto however, was now reinforced with three squadrons of Austrian Hussars, one from the Archduke Ferdinand and two from the Karaczay Regiments. Two pieces of Austrian horse artillery bombarded the French and menaced their flank, forcing them to retreat once more.|$|R
25|$|In 1810, a newly {{enlarged}} French army under Marshal André Masséna invaded Portugal. British opinion both at {{home and}} in the army was negative and there were suggestions that they must evacuate Portugal. Instead, Lord Wellington first slowed the French down at Buçaco; he then prevented them from taking the Lisbon Peninsula by the construction of his massive earthworks, the Lines of Torres Vedras, which had been assembled in complete secrecy and had <b>flanks</b> <b>guarded</b> by the Royal Navy. The baffled and starving French invasion forces retreated after six months. Wellington's pursuit was frustrated by a series of reverses inflicted by Marshal Ney in a much-lauded rear guard campaign.|$|R
50|$|The French {{army was}} greatly {{demoralized}} and ill-equipped. Much of the French ammunition had been soaked {{in the rain}} giving the Prussians a major advantage against the obsolete French gunnery. But Chanzy still ordered his forces into trenches prepared before Le Mans. The Germans hit the French left <b>flank</b> <b>guarded</b> by the Huisne River. The flank was turned and nearly routed until artillery and a counterattack halted the German attack. A bold German attack was launched on the French right flank, which fell apart. Jauréguiberry attempted to rally the broken troops to mount a counterattack but failed to do so. The French defense dissolved, the stragglers falling back into Le Mans.|$|R
25|$|Originally, Archduke Charles {{deployed}} six corps in Bohemia {{with only}} two corps south of the Danube. This proved to be too ambitious for the Austrian high command, so four corps were transferred south of the Danube. Accordingly, the I and II Armeekorps remained in Bohemia; the III, IV, and I Reserve Armeekorps formed a central mass under Charles; and the V, VI, and II Reserve Armeekorps made up the southern <b>flank</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|E

On the right flank, General of Division Jacques MacDonald led two infantry divisions and General of Division Charles Randon de Pully's cavalry, altogether 14,000 troops. General of Division Jean-Baptiste Rusca commanded a <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> that marched on Eugène's left.|$|E
25|$|Following the Soviet {{victory at}} the Battle of Kursk, STAVKA began {{developing}} its first summer offensive, beginning with Operation Kutuzov against the vulnerable salient centered at Oryol. 50th Army was given a supporting role, both due to its relatively small size and STAVKA's limited faith in Boldin's military capabilities. In this operation the army formed a right <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> for 11th Guards Army as it attacked {{to cut off the}} salient. German 9th Army escaped encirclement, but Boldin's army managed a 50km advance before the advance stalled.|$|E

They had with them horse and foot not only of the Army, but also of the militia of Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland and Lancashire, and were heavily outnumbered, having only 8,600 men against perhaps 20,000 of Hamilton's command. But the latter were scattered for convenience of supply along the road from Lancaster, through Preston, towards Wigan, Langdale's corps having thus become the left <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> instead of the advanced guard.|$|E
25|$|In February 1810, the VII Corps was {{reinforced}} by Marie François Rouyer's German Division. The troops arrived from France as an escort for a large supply convoy destined for Barcelona. Marshal Pierre Augereau, who taken command of VII Corps, ordered the divisions of Philippe Eustache Louis Severoli and his brother Jean Augereau to march on Tarragona. Meanwhile, {{one and a half}} battalions were dropped off at Vilafranca del Penedes while a brigade of Rouyer's division under Schwarz occupied Manresa as a <b>flank</b> <b>guard.</b> On 27 March 1810, the French demanded that Tarragona surrender, but Henry O'Donnell who commanded its 6,000-man garrison refused. Meanwhile, O'Donnell sent Juan Caro to attack the French lines of communication.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October, Napoleon {{ordered his}} army {{to make a}} left wheel to the west. The Prussian generals decided to retreat, using the Saale River to protect their flank. Brunswick marched the main army north from Weimar, while Hohenlohe stood on the {{defensive}} near Jena as a <b>flank</b> <b>guard.</b> Rüchel's orders were to stay at Weimar until Saxe-Weimar returned with his division. The double Battle of Jena-Auerstedt occurred on 14 October as Napoleon attacked Hohenlohe while Brunswick ran into Marshal Louis Davout's III Corps. The troops of Brunswick, Hohenlohe, and Rüchel were driven in rout from the two battlefields. Brunswick's army lost 13,000 men and its commander was mortally wounded. Hohenlohe and Rüchel suffered as many as 25,000 casualties.|$|E
25|$|General Stevenson {{reported}} to the Army of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and was given command of a division in William J.

He withdrew his troops after the Battle of Lookout Mountain and destroyed the bridges over Chickamauga Creek and other waterways to delay the advance of Joseph Hooker's Union corps. He reinforced the main Confederate battle line on Missionary Ridge just before the Battle of Chattanooga. During the 1864 Atlanta Campaign, Stevenson's division was in John Bell Hood's corps and fought in the battles around Atlanta, including Resaca, Kennesaw Mountain and Peachtree Creek. When General Hood was elevated to command of the army, Stevenson temporarily assumed command of Hood's corps.|$|R

Gambier-Parry and Vaughan planned a surprise break-out at first light next morning and a retreat to El Adem. Axis artillery took up positions to the south and east and in the afternoon a bombardment began until nightfall, when Axis infantry attacked until [...] and then the bombardment resumed, followed by two more infantry attacks. Vaughan planned to make the escape in box formation, the KEO and the cruiser tank forming an advanced guard. The divisional and brigade headquarters were to follow, then the engineers and other services, with flank protection by the PAVO, the regimental headquarters and one squadron on the left, the other squadron on the right. Behind them as the main guard were the 2nd Lancers, less two squadrons which were the rearguard. Munro was to provide two troops of anti-tank guns for the advanced guard and brigade headquarters, a troop for the <b>flank</b> <b>guards</b> and two troops for the 2nd Lancers; M Battery, 3rd RHA, was to protect the divisional headquarters. Three troops of the 10th Battery, 2/3rd Australian Anti-Tank Regiment went to the advanced guard and two to the <b>flank</b> <b>guards.</b> The advanced guard was to rush the guns to the east at [...] before it was light enough for the Axis gunners to see. The force was to head east, where the besiegers were in greatest strength, to avoid a roundabout route through worse terrain and the risk of later interception. Few men slept and in the early morning, the noise of preparations seemed sure to alert the Axis troops nearby; a gusty wind blew up.|$|R
25|$|On the German right flank, {{against the}} French Tenth Army, the 4th Army of Army Group B was to attack with the 5th Panzer Division, 7th Panzer Division, the 57th Infantry Division, 31st Infantry Division, 12th Infantry Division, 32nd Infantry Division, 27th Infantry Division, 46th Infantry Division and the 6th Infantry Division and the 2nd Motorised Division, the 11th Motorised Brigade and the 1st Cavalry Division. Advancing {{on a line}} from Abbeville to Amiens, with a <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> on the left facing Paris, the main force was to make for the lower Seine, quickly to capture Le Havre and bridgeheads at Rouen, Les Andelys and Vernon.

25|$|As Hohenlohe neared Boitzenburg on the 27th, he met Graf von Arnim who {{notified}} {{him that}} he had collected supplies for the hungry soldiers at his manor, the Schloss Boitzenburg. Unfortunately, when the Prussians arrived around 2:00 PM they found that Milhaud's cavalrymen got there first and were pillaging the estate. It took Hohenlohe's advanced guard three hours to drive Milhaud's brigade out of the town. In the meantime, Murat heard the sound of the battle and hurried north with Grouchy's dragoons. South of Boitzenburg at Wichmannsdorf, Hohenlohe's right <b>flank</b> <b>guard</b> blundered into Grouchy's column. Three regiments of French dragoons drove the Prussian Gensdarmes Cuirassier Regiment # 10 against a marsh and forced its surrender.

50|$|Wellington {{approached}} San Sebastián in {{the aftermath}} of the Vitoria campaign and put the city under siege in July 1813, aiming to reduce the important coastal fortress while the French army retired east, nursing its wounds from Vitoria. San Sebastián and Pamplona sat on Wellington's <b>flanks,</b> <b>guarding</b> the approaches to the French border, and needed to be pried from French hands before the allies could pursue operations into France. However, it appears Wellington misjudged the resourcefulness and determination of the French garrison and its talented commander, General of Brigade Louis Rey. British assaults sustained very bloody repulses, losing 600 killed in a 26 July attack. Before Wellington could organize a new effort, news reached him that Soult had rebuilt the French field army and reappeared to the east—weeks earlier than Wellington had believed possible—and the allies broke off the siege to confront him.|$|R
