5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> abundant.|$|E

5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3tuning <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on {{the involvement of the}} irregular major-third.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the barn}} owl has been much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet {{have been made in}} most parts of the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms do not seem to be consumed.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{accurately}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical odometer. The Chinese odometer was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by {{the rotation of the}} carriage's wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels turned about. The concept of the differential gear that was used in this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply an equal amount of torque to a car's wheels <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> rotating at different speeds.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to serving as social cues {{between members of}} the same species, Mups can act as kairomones—chemical signals that transmit information between species. Mice are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural predators, including cats and rats. This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations. When the chemical cues responsible for the fear response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine, two homologous protein signals were identified: Feld4 (Felis domesticus allergen 4), the product of the cat Mup gene, and Ratn1 (Rattus norvegicus allergen 1), the product of the rat Mup13 gene. Mice are fearful of these Mups <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> made in bacteria, but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups showed no fear of rats, demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour. It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours, but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice. This implies the mouse perceives them differently, via distinct neural circuits. The pheromone receptors responsible for Mup detection are also unknown, though they are thought be members of the V2R receptor class.|$|E

25|$|Radulae {{are usually}} {{difficult}} to detect, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> preserved in fossils, as the rock must weather and crack {{in exactly the}} right fashion to expose them; for instance, radulae have only been found in nine of the 43 ammonite genera, and they are rarer still in non-ammonoid forms: only three pre-Mesozoic species possess one.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the females}} {{initiate}} courtship, {{female and male}} cardinalfish are mutually selective. Females have been observed courting larger males more intensively. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> already {{in the process of}} courting one male, they often moved on to an intruder male if it is larger than the original. Females have also been observed producing larger eggs for larger, hence more ‘attractive,’ males. Females are also able to increase egg size even after the onset of egg maturation if they encounter a new, larger male to brood its eggs.|$|E
25|$|The wine {{regions in}} Germany usually {{referred}} to are the 13 defined regions for quality wine. The German wine industry has organised itself around these regions and their division into districts. However, {{there are also}} a number of regions for the seldom-exported table wine (Tafelwein) and country wine (Landwein) categories. Those regions with a few exceptions overlap with the quality wine regions. To make a clear distinction between the quality levels, the regions and subregions for different quality level have different names on purpose, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> allowed to be produced in the same geographical area.|$|E
25|$|The Numerical Stroop effect {{demonstrates}} the {{close relationship between}} numerical values and physical sizes. Digits symbolize numerical values {{but they also have}} physical sizes. A digit can be presented as big or small (e.g., 5 vs. 5), irrespective of its numerical value. Comparing digits in incongruent trials (e.g., 3 5) is slower than comparing digits in congruent trials (e.g., 5 3) and the difference in reaction time is termed the numerical Stroop effect. The effect of irrelevant numerical values on physical comparisons (similar to the effect of irrelevant color words on responding to colors) suggests that numerical values are processed automatically (i.e., <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> irrelevant to the task).|$|E
