5|$|The {{origin of}} life on Earth is not well understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the <b>hadean</b> or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.|$|E
5|$|The early Earth {{during the}} <b>Hadean</b> eon is {{believed}} by most scientists {{to have had}} a Venus-like atmosphere, with roughly 100 bar of CO2 and a surface temperature of 230°C, and possibly even sulfuric acid clouds, until about 4.0billion years ago, by which time plate tectonics were in full force and together with the early water oceans, removed the CO2 and sulfur from the atmosphere. Early Venus would thus most likely have had water oceans like the Earth, but any plate tectonics would have ended when Venus lost its oceans. Its surface is estimated to be about 500million years old, so it would not be expected to show evidence of plate tectonics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hadean</b> Eon: – Ma. This {{term was}} {{intended}} originally {{to cover the}} time before any preserved rocks were deposited, although some zircon crystals from about 4400 Ma demonstrate the existence of crust in the <b>Hadean</b> Eon.

5|$|Written by Barbara Clegg, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} in late 1982 and saw the Doctor travel down the River Styx in Ancient Greece where he would discover an alien race, the <b>Hadeans,</b> kidnapping the women of Greece due to their own race being rendered infertile.|$|R
25|$|The initial crust, {{formed when}} the Earth's surface first solidified, totally {{disappeared}} {{from a combination}} of this fast <b>Hadean</b> plate tectonics and the intense impacts of the Late Heavy Bombardment. However, it is thought that it was basaltic in composition, like today's oceanic crust, because little crustal differentiation had yet taken place. The first larger pieces of continental crust, which is a product of differentiation of lighter elements during partial melting in the lower crust, appeared {{at the end of the}} <b>Hadean,</b> about 4.0Ga. What is left of these first small continents are called cratons. These pieces of late <b>Hadean</b> and early Archean crust form the cores around which today's continents grew.|$|E
25|$|The primary defined {{divisions}} of time are eons, in sequence the <b>Hadean,</b> the Archean, the Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{at least}} one notable {{scientific}} work has advocated using the lunar geological time scale to subdivide the <b>Hadean</b> eon of Earth's geologic time scale. In particular, it is sometimes found that the <b>Hadean</b> is subdivided into the Cryptic, Basin Groups 1-9, Nectarian, and Early Imbrian. This notation is not entirely consistent with the above lunar geologic time scale in that the Cryptic and Basin Groups 1-9 (both of which are only informal terms that are not used in geologic maps) comprise the Pre-Nectarian period.|$|E
25|$|A {{terminology}} {{has evolved}} covering {{the early years}} of the Earth's existence, as radiometric dating has allowed real dates to be assigned to specific formations and features. The Precambrian Supereon is divided into three eons: the <b>Hadean</b> (– Ma), Archean (- Ma) and Proterozoic (- Ma). See Timetable of the Precambrian.|$|E
25|$|From crater {{counts on}} other {{celestial}} bodies, it is inferred that {{a period of}} intense meteorite impacts, called the Late Heavy Bombardment, began about 4.1Ga, and concluded around 3.8Ga, {{at the end of}} the <b>Hadean.</b> In addition, volcanism was severe due to the large heat flow and geothermal gradient. Nevertheless, detrital zircon crystals dated to 4.4Ga show evidence of having undergone contact with liquid water, suggesting that the Earth already had oceans or seas at that time.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Archean, the Earth had cooled significantly. Present life forms could not have survived at Earth's surface, because the Archean atmosphere lacked oxygen hence had no ozone layer to block ultraviolet light. Nevertheless, it is believed that primordial life began to evolve by the early Archean, with candidate fossils dated to around 3.5Ga. Some scientists even speculate that life could have begun during the early <b>Hadean,</b> as far back as 4.4Ga, surviving the possible Late Heavy Bombardment period in hydrothermal vents below the Earth's surface.|$|E
25|$|As {{the world}} ocean is the {{principal}} component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The world ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species, but because {{much of it is}} unexplored, the number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger, possibly over two million. The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the <b>Hadean</b> eon and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life.|$|E
25|$|Mantle convection, {{the process}} that drives plate tectonics, {{is a result of}} heat flow from the Earth's {{interior}} to the Earth's surface. It involves the creation of rigid tectonic plates at mid-oceanic ridges. These plates are destroyed by subduction into the mantle at subduction zones. During the early Archean (about 3.0Ga) the mantle was much hotter than today, probably around , so convection in the mantle was faster. Although a process similar to present-day plate tectonics did occur, this would have gone faster too. It is likely that during the <b>Hadean</b> and Archean, subduction zones were more common, and therefore tectonic plates were smaller.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally it {{was thought}} that during the period between 4.28 and 3.8Ga, changes in the orbits of the giant planets may have caused a heavy {{bombardment}} by asteroids and comets that pockmarked the Moon and the other inner planets (Mercury, Mars, and presumably Earth and Venus). This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. Geologically, the <b>Hadean</b> Earth would have been far more active {{than at any other time}} in its history. Studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17×105 years, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.250×109 years, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common. Internal heating as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle would have caused a great deal of mantle convection, with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.|$|E
25|$|Three to four {{billion years}} ago, the Sun emitted only 70% as much power {{as it does}} today. If the {{atmospheric}} composition had been the same as today, liquid water should not have existed on Earth. However, there is evidence {{for the presence of}} water on the early Earth, in the <b>Hadean</b> and Archean eons, leading to {{what is known as the}} faint young Sun paradox. Hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere, with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist. Over the following approximately 4 billion years, the energy output of the Sun increased and atmospheric composition changed. The Great Oxygenation Eventnbsp&– oxygenation of the atmosphere around 2.4 billion years agonbsp&– was the most notable alteration. Over the next five billion years, the Sun's ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate, with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on Earth that survives until that time.|$|E
500|$|The Earth {{is about}} 4.54 billion years old. The {{earliest}} undisputed evidence {{of life on}} Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten <b>Hadean</b> Eon.

500|$|Immediately after {{recounting the}} {{stories from the}} Old Testament, Proba again appeals to God before {{examining}} the birth of Jesus, his life and deeds, his crucifixion, and {{the coming of the}} Holy Spirit. Although Jesus and Mary are featured, Joseph is omitted. Jesus is often described with language befitting a Virgilian hero, and Mary is depicted with lines originally relating to Venus and Dido. Proba's Sermon on the Mount begins by borrowing the Sibyl of Cumae's description of punishment for the unrighteous (from Book VI, Aeneid), and some scholars contend that this portion of De laudibus Christi is the first account of hell in Christian poetry. Christ's deeds are reduced to three events: calming the sea, walking on water, and calling his first disciples. Proba partially conveys his crucifixion with several lines describing <b>Hadean</b> punishment (from Book VI, Aeneid). After detailing Christ's death, Proba transforms lines referring to the erotic love between Dido and Aeneas to signify [...] "the sacred love of Christ and his followers." [...] After his resurrection, Christ describes the world to come to his followers with the prophecy made by Celaeno and the Oracle of Delos (from Book III, Aeneid). His ascension is represented by language which originally described Mercury.|$|E

2500|$|During the <b>Hadean</b> the Late Heavy Bombardment {{occurred}} (approximately [...] ) {{during which}} {{a large number}} of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon, and by inference on Earth, Mercury, Venus and Mars as well.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Hadean</b> Earth {{is thought}} to have had a {{secondary}} atmosphere, formed through degassing of the rocks that accumulated from planetesimal impactors. At first, it was thought that the Earth's atmosphere consisted of hydrogen compounds—methane, ammonia and water vapour—and that life began under such reducing conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining. According to later models, suggested by study of ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late <b>Hadean</b> period consisted largely of water vapour, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and sulfur compounds. As Earth lacked the gravity to hold any molecular hydrogen, this component of the atmosphere would have been rapidly lost during the <b>Hadean</b> period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases. The solution of carbon dioxide in water {{is thought to}} have made the seas slightly acidic, giving it a pH of about 5.5. The atmosphere at the time has been characterized as a [...] "gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory." [...] It may have been similar to the mixture of gases released today by volcanoes, which still support some abiotic chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|The Precambrian (colored {{green in}} the {{timeline}} figure) is a supereon that is subdivided into three eons (<b>Hadean,</b> Archean, Proterozoic) of the geologic time scale.

2500|$|The term [...] "Precambrian" [...] is {{recognized}} by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as the only [...] "supereon" [...] in geologic time; it is so called because it includes the <b>Hadean</b> (~4.6-4 billion), Archean (4-2.5 billion), and Proterozoic (2.5 billion-541 million) eons.

The oldest rocks found on Earth date to about 4.0Ga, and the oldest detrital zircon crystals in rocks to about 4.4Ga, soon after the formation of the Earth's crust and the Earth itself. The giant impact hypothesis for the Moon's formation states that shortly after formation of an initial crust, the proto-Earth was impacted by a smaller protoplanet, which ejected part of the mantle and crust into space and created the Moon.|$|E
2500|$|The Precambrian era {{dates from}} the {{beginning}} of Earth’s formation (4.6 billion years ago) {{to the beginning of the}} Cambrian era, 542 million years ago. The Precambrian consists of the <b>Hadean,</b> Archaean and Proterozoic Eons. Specifically, this article will examine the Ediacaran, when the first multicellular bodies are believed to have arisen, as well as what caused the rise of muticellularity. [...] This time period arose after the Snowball Earth of the mid Neoproterozoic. The [...] "Snowball Earth" [...] was a period of worldwide glaciation, which is believed to have served as a population bottleneck for the subsequent evolution of multicellular organisms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} life on Earth existed {{more than}} 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era when sufficient crust had solidified following the molten <b>Hadean</b> Eon.

2500|$|The <b>Hadean</b> {{environment}} {{would have}} been highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to [...] in diameter, {{would have been}} sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the ocean {{within a few months}} of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapour becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. After a few months, the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years, rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 years after the impact event.|$|E
2500|$|The {{geological}} time scale (GTS) depicts the larger spans of time, {{from the beginning}} of the Earth to the present, and it chronicles some definitive events of Earth history. The <b>Hadean</b> eon represents time before the reliable (fossil) record of life beginning on Earth; it began with the formation of the planet and ended at 4.0 [...] billion years ago [...] as defined by international convention. The Archean and [...] Proterozoic eons follow; they produced the abiogenesis of life on Earth and then the [...] evolution of early life. The succeeding eon is the [...] Phanerozoic, which is represented by its three component eras: [...] the Palaeozoic; the Mesozoic, which spanned the rise, reign, and climactic extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs; and the Cenozoic, which presented the subsequent development of dominant mammals on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Oceans {{may have}} {{appeared}} {{first in the}} <b>Hadean</b> Eon, as soon as two hundred million years (200 Ma) after the Earth was formed, in a hot [...] reducing environment, and the pH of about 5.8 rose rapidly towards neutral. This has been supported by the dating of 4.404Ga-old zircon crystals from metamorphosed quartzite of Mount Narryer in the Western Australia Jack Hills of the Pilbara, which are evidence that oceans and continental crust existed within 150Ma of Earth's formation. Despite the likely increased volcanism and existence of many smaller tectonic [...] "platelets," [...] {{it has been suggested}} that between 4.4 and 4.3 Ga (billion year), the Earth was a water world, with little if any continental crust, an extremely turbulent atmosphere and a hydrosphere subject to intense ultraviolet (UV) light, from a T Tauri stage Sun, cosmic radiation and continued bolide impacts.|$|E

More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.|$|E
2500|$|The {{deep sea}} vent, or {{alkaline}} hydrothermal vent, theory posits that life {{may have begun}} at submarine hydrothermal vents, William Martin and Michael Russell have suggested [...] "that life evolved in structured iron monosulphide precipitates in a seepage site hydrothermal mound at a redox, pH, and temperature gradient between sulphide-rich hydrothermal fluid and iron(II)-containing waters of the <b>Hadean</b> ocean floor. The naturally arising, three-dimensional compartmentation observed within fossilized seepage-site metal sulphide precipitates indicates that these inorganic compartments were the precursors of cell walls and membranes found in free-living prokaryotes. The known capability of FeS and NiS to catalyze the synthesis of the acetyl-methylsulphide from carbon monoxide and methylsulphide, constituents of hydrothermal fluid, indicates that pre-biotic syntheses occurred at the inner surfaces of these metal-sulphide-walled compartments,..." [...] These form where hydrogen-rich fluids emerge from below the sea floor, {{as a result of}} serpentinization of ultra-mafic olivine with seawater and a pH interface with carbon dioxide-rich ocean water. The vents form a sustained chemical energy source derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors (molecular hydrogen) react with electron acceptors (carbon dioxide); see Iron–sulfur world theory. These are highly exothermic reactions.|$|E
2500|$|There is no single, {{generally}} accepted {{model for the}} origin of life. Scientists have proposed several plausible theories, which share some common elements. While differing in the details, these theories {{are based on the}} framework laid out by Alexander Oparin (in 1924) and by J. B. S. Haldane (in 1925), who postulated the molecular or chemical evolution theory of life. According to them, the first molecules constituting the earliest cells [...] "were synthesized under natural conditions by a slow process of molecular evolution, and these molecules then organized into the first molecular system with properties with biological order". Oparin and Haldane suggested that the atmosphere of the early Earth may have been chemically reducing in nature, composed primarily of methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2) or carbon monoxide (CO), and phosphate (PO43−), with molecular oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3) either rare or absent. According to later models, the atmosphere in the late <b>Hadean</b> period consisted largely of nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen (H2), and sulfur compounds; while it did lack molecular oxygen and ozone, it was not as chemically reducing as Oparin and Haldane supposed. In the atmosphere proposed by Oparin and Haldane, electrical activity can produce certain basic small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. The Miller–Urey experiment reported in 1953 demonstrated this.|$|E
