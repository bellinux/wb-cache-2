30|$|Transversal {{adaptive}} filter with linear structure has high feasibility, {{and has the}} same {{adaptive filter}}ing capability for tailing interference and leading interference. While compensating for fading, it increases noise, and it has poor adaptive filtering capability for <b>heavy</b> <b>fading.</b> Compared with transversal adaptive filter, the characteristics of decision feedback adaptive filter include low tap number and lower operation throughput. If the decision is correct, each feed tap does not increase noise, and has better adaptive filtering capability for <b>heavy</b> <b>fading.</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{combination}} with the characteristics of satellite data transmission, the major factors of inter-symbol interference include microwave channel group delay and amplitude unbalance, modem orthogonal unbalance, power amplifier nonlinearity, and so on, which mainly cause signal inter-symbol tailing interference and cross interference. Satellite high-speed data transmission systems mostly adopt Ka band, which is little influenced by multipath factor, hence it will not generate channel <b>heavy</b> <b>fading</b> in general. Therefore, the transversal linear structure can meet the system requirements.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} dual-hop satellite relay networks with hardware impairments and co-channel interference. Specifically, the exact closed-form expression for the outage probability of the considered system was derived, {{which made it}} easy to evaluate the impact of the impairing parameters on the system performance. The results revealed that an outage floor appeared when the hardware impairments existed. In addition, the analytical expression for the instantaneous capacity was also derived, which revealed that the instantaneous capacity had an upper bound when the system had hardware impairments. However, when the channel was under <b>heavy</b> <b>fading,</b> the performance of the system was worse.|$|E

A preliminary analysis of two case studies shows that on-board dynamic power allocation coupled with ACM reduces the impact of <b>heavy</b> <b>fades,</b> permits a larger exploitation of efficient MODCODs and equalizes {{the performance of the}} user links. However, in the presence of convective cells, co-channel interference can be dominant, hence reducing the benefits of the above techniques...|$|R

40|$|Excess {{path loss}} due to {{multipath}} severely restricts {{the performance of}} power limited mobile networks such as those using satellite-aided links. To reduce multipath related losses, the higher elevation angle of the spacecraft can be exploited by utilizing mobile antennas which reduce {{the strength of the}} multipath reflections in favor of the line-of-sight signal. The presence of a strong and stable path in a fading link will change the envelope statistics of the received waveform from Rayleigh to a more favorable Rician distribution. It is determined that the excess path loss, or fade margin, of a Rician channel when coherent detection of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) or quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) signals is considered. The results are presented parametrically such that they can be applied {{to a wide range of}} propagation characteristics from <b>heavy</b> <b>fading</b> to nonfading situations. Furthermore, similar results are also given for the case where only limited coverage is provided...|$|E

60|$|Paul looked up, {{and then}} stood quite {{still for a}} moment without speaking. A great fear had fallen upon him. Out of the shadows of the past, he seemed to see again that deathbed scene, and the tragedy which had brought down the curtain upon two lives. Almost he could fancy himself again upon his yacht, with the salt sea spray beating against his face, and the white {{breakers}} hissing and seething around him, as they made the dangerous passage towards that faint light, which flickered and gleamed in the distant monastery tower. They are safe! They reach the land; they are hurried into that great, gloomy bed-chamber, where chill draughts rustled ghost-like amongst the <b>heavy,</b> <b>faded</b> hangings, and the feeble candlelight left weird shadows moving across the floor and upon the walls. Again he heard the rattling of the window-panes, bare and exposed to every gust of wind; the far-off thunder of the sea, like a deep, continuous undernote; and, from an almost unseen corner of the chamber, the monotonous, broken rhythm of sad prayers for the dying, mumbled by that dark, curious-looking priest. And then, when the background of the picture had formed itself in his memory, he saw the deed itself. He saw the white, stricken face suddenly ablaze with that last effort of passionate life; he saw the outstretched arm, the line of fire, and the sudden change in the countenance of the man who stood {{at the foot of the}} bed. He saw the cool cynicism replaced by a spasm of ghastly fear, and he heard the low, gurgling cry dying away into a faint moan of terror, as the murdered man sank on to the floor, a crumpled heap. And, last of all, he saw that little brown girl, with her tumbled hair and tear-stained face, clasping the dead body and glaring at every one in the room, with a storm of hatred and impotent fury in her flashing eyes. And that last recollection brought him, like a flash, back to the present,--brought him swift, bewildering memories of Adrea, shaking his heart, and bringing the hot colour streaming into his face. He remembered where he was, and why he had left London. He remembered, too, that he was not alone, and with a little start he awoke to the present.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the Symbol Error Probability (SEP) {{performance}} of a hybrid/integrated satellite-terrestrial cooperative network. In particular, {{we focus on the}} case of mobile relays that forward the satellite signal to a masked mobile destination node. The Selective Decode-and-Forward (SDF) transmission scheme is implemented and only the relay nodes which can successfully decode the satellite message are selected to retransmit the signal. The destination node exploits the spatial diversity advantages by implementing a typical Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) technique. The closed-form expressions for the exact average SEP of the arbitrary M-ary phase shift keying and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation signaling with MRC diversity reception over independent but not necessarily identically distributed fading channels are derived using a Moment Generating Function (MGF) approach. These closed-form expressions are represented in terms of a finite sum of Lauricella hypergeometric functions. The analytical expressions show excellent agreement with the simulation results. Numerical results show that for a system using QPSK under the frequent <b>heavy</b> shadowed <b>fading</b> condition, the diversity gain of approximately 7 dB can be obtained at the SEP of 10 ^{- 1 } with respect to the direct transmission, when only one relay is used. It increases to around 12 dB in the case of 3 relays...|$|R

He kissed her pale cheeks, her hard forehead, her <b>heavy</b> eyelids, her <b>faded</b> lips; and the measured blows and sighs of the rising tide accompanied the enfolding power of his arms, the overwhelming might of his caresses.

40|$|A novel data-aided fading {{estimation}} technique that employs both pilot and data symbols is proposed to {{significantly reduce the}} bandwidth redundancy of the pilot-symbol-aided (PSA) systems using receivers with low complexity and latency in the shadowed mobile satellite fading channels. The shadowed mobile satellite fading channels are modeled as the sum of a lognormally distributed direct component and a Rayleigh distributed multipath component, and the PSA system employs 16 -ary quadrature-amplitude-modulation (16 QAM) for transmission. Monte Carlo computer simulation {{has been used to}} assess the technique on the bit-error-rate (BER) performances of the system in the light shadowed, the average shadowed and the <b>heavy</b> shadowed Rician <b>fading</b> environments. The results have shown that the proposed technique requires a very low bandwidth redundancy to provide satisfactory BER performances, and can substantially lower the error floors of the PSA systems. postprin...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am alone}} in the schoolhouse. On just such an evening as this last year my desolation drove me to Waster Lunny, where I was storm-stayed for the night. The {{recollection}} decides me to court my own warm hearth, to challenge my right hand again to a game at the [...] "dambrod" [...] against my left. I do not lock the schoolhouse door at nights; for even a highwayman (there is no such luck) would be received with open arms, and I doubt if there be a barred door in all the glen. But it is cosier {{to put on the}} shutters. The road to Thrums has lost itself miles down the valley. I wonder what they are doing out in the world. Though I am the Free Church precentor in Thrums (ten pounds a year, and the little town is five miles away), they have not seen me for three weeks. A packman whom I thawed yesterday at my kitchen fire tells me, that last Sabbath only the Auld Lichts held service. Other people realized that they were snowed up. Far up the glen, after it twists out of view, a manse and half a dozen thatched cottages that are there may still show a candle light, and the crumbling gravestones keep cold vigil round the grey old kirk. <b>Heavy</b> shadows <b>fade</b> into the sky to the north. A flake trembles against the window; but it is too cold for much snow to-night. The shutter bars the outer world from the schoolhouse.|$|R

Within the general research issue, the study introduces the distinctive {{features of the}} in-depth analysis of Pal- ermo focusing on its protagonists, the two neigh- bourhoods of Borgo Ulivia and ZEN (the acronym stands for northern expansion zone). Two innova- tive parts have been examined in the extensive ur- ban context of the two settlements: the experimen- tal centre in Borgo Ulivia, designed by Giuseppe Samonà (coordinator), Antonio Bonafede, Roberto Calandra, Edoardo Caracciolo and ZEN 2 designed by Franco Amoroso, Salvatore Bisogni, Vittorio Gregotti, Hiromichi Matsui and Franco Purini. The two innovative projects establish a different relationship with the compact fabric of the old town centre of Palermo, and develop a positive critique towards the Modern Movement heritage. Alongside {{the description of the}} architectural and urban spe- cificity of the experimental centre in Borgo Ulivia and ZEN 2, the research study also examined the two suburbs of the neighbourhoods, respectively South and North of Palermo. After a careful study phase of these two areas, an essential analysis of the archives, including the model and successive redesign, two bigger pictures of the issues were considered, from which six project topics have been drawn for each neighbourhood. Four design groups have been chosen to work on each topic from Italy and abroad. Some of these projects have been “put together” producing boards defined as recompositions. These works have reached the final phase of the research study where the various phases merged giving a larger audience the chance to be informed about the transformations of the neighbourhoods replacing with architectural edges the <b>heavy</b> and <b>fading</b> town planning nets...|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{five years}} after its launch, a Singer Vogue Series IV saloon tested by the Britain’s Autocar {{magazine}} in August 1966, now with an advertised power output of , had {{a top speed of}} 93 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 mph in 25 seconds. An overall fuel consumption of 22.0 mpgimp was achieved. The test car was priced by Rootes in the UK at £911 including taxes, {{at a time when the}} Austin 1800 was retailing for £888 and the Ford Corsair GT was offered at £925. The performance was felt to be lively, and the gear change, supported on the test car with an optional overdrive, ‘crisp’ with well chosen ratios. Comfort and fittings were also commended, but the fuel consumption and the tendency of the <b>heavy</b> brakes to <b>fade</b> when used hard disappointed the testers: this would presumably not have been an issue had the road test been of a Humber Sceptre which had its stopping power from a servo-assisted 10 in front disc/rear drum arrangement.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The performance of Trellis Coded Modulation scheme via Expectation-Maximization algorithm utilizing a Kalman filter over multipath fading is presented. EM algorithm offers an easier computation than the classical ML estimation does. To get a better prediction of the communication performance, a fading channel model whose characteristics match with the real fading is implemented in the simulation. In the study a multipath fading channel model is considered. Multipath fading channel is applied to a communication system where the direct line-of-sight signal is blocked. A Trellis coding scheme is used to increase the system performance in this type of fading channel which is found to be a burst error channel and/or a random error channel. To further combat the burst error a block interleaver is incorporated in the system. Simulation results are presented for various normalized fading bandwidth which correspond normal vehicle speed at 2400 baud rate for an L-band carrier frequency. The gain between a receiver with perfect channel information and a receiver employing EM algorithm is 3 - 4 db for <b>heavy</b> and light <b>fading</b> over a range BTs of 0. 01 - 0. 1...|$|R
