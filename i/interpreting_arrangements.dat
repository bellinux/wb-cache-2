Most health care institutions rely on ad hoc interpreting, which involves haphazard <b>interpreting</b> <b>arrangements</b> in which anyone who speaks the patient's language, is called on to interpret. Untrained interpreters are consistently used in clinical practice due to a severe lack of trained interpreters. Despite this, to date little research has been conducted investigating the differences between trained and untrained interpreters. Furthermore, little research has been undertaken on the use of interpreters in the field of Speech-Language and Hearing Therapy. There is much need for interpreters within our profession, as clinicians usually either speak English or Afrikaans, with very little or no knowledge of indigenous South African languages. In this study, differences between trained and untrained interpreters were examined in the initial assessment interview, within the field of Speech-Language and Hearing Therapy...|$|E

Much of this has been concerned primarily with arrangements over the rational, real and complex elds though several of the enumerative properties do carry over to arbitrary nite elds. Here we <b>interpret</b> an <b>arrangement</b> in a very general sense, develop a theory of the characteristic (or equivalently Poincare) polynomial in this general setting and show how the theory developed has a wide range of unexpected applications.

500|$|The Lord's {{tower is}} a secure, private set of rooms, {{probably}} {{intended for the}} sole use of the Lord and his family, and with its own lines of defence. The architectural historian W. Douglas Simpson <b>interpreted</b> this <b>arrangement</b> as being {{the product of the}} [...] "bastard feudalism" [...] of the 14th century. During this period, Lords were required to defend their castles by means of mercenaries, rather than the vassals of the earlier feudal system, and Simpson suggested that the Lord of Doune designed his tower to be defensible against his own, potentially rebellious, garrison. This interpretation is no longer widely accepted by historians, and the castle is instead seen as a development towards more integrated courtyard buildings, such as the royal palace of Linlithgow, which was constructed through the 15th and early 16th century. The layout of Doune has similarities with those of the contemporary castles at Tantallon and Bothwell, and appears, at various scales, in other buildings of the period.|$|R

40|$|Ethiopia’s coffee forests have {{witnessed}} {{high rates of}} deforestation during the last decades. Main reasons identified are intensified forest resource utilisation and expansion of smallholder agriculture. These are major drivers, however, as the processes and impacts are mediated and promoted by institutional arrangements through which intensification and expansion unroll. This paper <b>interprets</b> institutional <b>arrangements</b> primarily as rules and regulations. It provides {{an understanding of the}} particular (informal) forest resource use rights of smallholders in Kaffa Zone, South-western Ethiopia. Given the path dependent character of land tenure and property rights institutions, this research takes a historical perspective. In the case study area, the coffee forests are historically divided into use right plots individually held by local peasants. The nationalisation of all land in Ethiopia in 1975 was the major institutional turning point in which responsibility for forest use and management was by decree shifted from local peasants towards newly established centralised state entities. These bodies neither had experience, expertise nor financial resources to tackle the challenge of forest governance. In practice, state control did not ‘reach’ the forest areas, and rather created a muddled and frequently changing institutional framework that turned out to have no, or only minimal actual impact. Consequently, use and management of forest resources in large parts of Ethiopia remained defined by traditional use rights...|$|R

Agent types differ only in their degree of “sophistication”, that is, their ability to forecast the change in their future tastes. We fully characterize the menu of contracts which the principal offers in order to screen the agent’s sophistication. The menu does not exclude any type: it provides a perfect commitment device for relatively sophisticated types, and “exploitative ” contracts which involve speculation with relatively naive types.

40|$|The {{regional}} {{distribution of}} geochemical and isotopic compositions of granitoid rocks from a Gondwana continental margin is studied to highlight its structure and geodynamic evolution. The intrusive rocks emplaced {{during the early}} Palaeozoic Ross Orogeny in northern Victoria Land (Antarctica) constitute a high-K calc-alkaline association. The geographic patterns of isotope and geochemical data on granitoid rocks allow the distinction of two portions of the continental margin, separated by a sharp discontinuity. The portion towards the palaeo-Pacific Ocean (Oceanward Side) displays strongly regular inland increase of Sr-and decrease of Nd-isotope ratios, coupled with analogous variations in major and trace elements; on this basis we infer a NW-SE-trending margin affected by SW-directed subduction. The portion towards the East Antarctic Craton (Continentward Side) shows a similar regular variation only for Nd isotope compositions, consistent with a hypothesis of a N-S-striking margin with west-ward subduction. In the Oceanward suggest that the granites were generated by extensive interaction of Side, isotope and trace-element characteristics suggest that the granites were generated by extensive interaction of mantle-derived magmas with high-level crustal melts. The origin of Continentward Side intrusives is compatible with a process of interaction between mantle-derived melts and a mafic granulite lower crust. The granitoids of the two crustal sectors share the same Proterozoic Sm-Nd model ages, suggesting that they both {{belong to the same}} crustal province. We <b>interpret</b> this <b>arrangement</b> of crustal segments as due to the shift and rotation of a forearc sliver of the Gondwana margin, This movement was likely enhanced by oblique subduction under an irregular margin weakened by the presence of a magmatic are.

40|$|Purpose - To re-examine {{the role}} of {{property}} management from an institutional economics perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The role of property management is explored by asking why property management has emerged from the first principle. Then, an analytical framework for property management is put forward. Different dimensions of institutional arrangements, ranging from open access to communal private property or solely owned private property, {{are discussed in the}} real estate property context. Findings - The paper shows that a unique feature of property management is its role in excluding outsiders and resolving internal conflicts among the stakeholders of communal private property. Research implications/limitations - This approach opens up a new research agenda for property management. The adoption of different institutional arrangements in property management can be explained by further studies. Practical implications - The efficiency of different institutional arrangements for the governance of communal private property is situation-specific. An endogenous assumption of institutional regime property management practice greatly expands the flexibility of management.

In this analysis field data were collected during seasonal campaigns following a field survey protocol developed in the Polish Carpathian Mountains. Complementary information was conducted from cartographic materials and digital elevation model to map diverse sections of the semi-natural Váralja Stream in the Eastern Mecsek Mountains.

40|$|AbstractSynchrotron x-ray diffraction, {{differential}} scanning calorimetry, and {{electron spin}} resonance spectroscopy have been employed to characterize a quasicrystalline phase formed in aqueous dispersions of binary mixtures of glucocerebroside and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering intensity patterns were recorded during temperature scans between 20 ° and 90 °C from mixtures of composition 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mol glucocerebroside per 100 mol phospholipid. The quasicrystalline phase was characterized by a broad lamellar d-spacing of 6. 06 nm at 40 °C and a broad wide-angle x-ray scattering band centered at ∼ 0. 438 nm, close to the gel phase centered at ∼ 0. 425 nm and distinct from a broad peak centered at 0. 457 nm observed for a liquid-crystal phase at 80 °C. The quasicrystalline phase coexisted with gel and fluid phase of the pure phospholipid. An analysis of the small-angle x-ray scattering intensity profiles indicated a stoichiometry of one glucosphingolipid per two phospholipid molecules in the complex. Structural transitions monitored in cooling scans by synchrotron x-ray diffraction indicated that a cubic phase transforms initially into a lamellar gel. Thermal studies showed that the gel phase subsequently relaxes into the quasicrystalline phase in an exothermic transition. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy using spin labels located at positions 7, 12, and 16 carbons of phospholipid hydrocarbon chains indicated that order and motional constraints at the 7 and 12 positions were indistinguishable between gel and quasicrystalline phases {{but there was a}} significant decrease in order and increase in rate of motion at the 16 position on transformation to the quasicrystalline phase.

40|$|In {{standard}} contract-theoretic models, {{the underlying}} {{assumption is that}} an agent is purely selfish, and his objective is to maximize his own payoff. A large amount of empirical evidence {{has pointed out that}} many individuals are also motivated by other psychological considerations, such as fairness concerns and reciprocity. Theorists have been engaged in finding more realistic assumptions that are consistent with the ways in which economic agents behave in real life. Among the existing theories, the theory of inequity aversion developed by Fehr and Schmidt [35] has attracted enormous attention. It soon became a useful tool in behavioral contract theory, which capitalizes on the power of social preferences theories to enhance understanding of real-world contracting phenomena. The present thesis aims at contributing to the behavioral contract literature by investigating how inequality aversion preferences impact on the optimal contract design in a financial contracting environment and the agent's incentive in a career concerns experiment. Chapter 2 reviews some of the recent theoretical contributions {{to the development of the}} theories of reciprocity and fairness. Emphasis is placed on sketching the theories, demonstrating their abilities to explain experimental regularities and pointing out some potential problems that are inherent in the existing theories. In addition, we present a survey of the recent theoretical contributions linking inequality aversion and the theory of incentives, where the traditional selfish agent assumption is replaced by the more realistic assumption that the individual agent is also inequality-averse. Incorporating more realism into economic modelling, such as assuming some individuals are inequality-averse, appears to be a promising avenue for research in the theory of incentives, as it generates more refutable predictions that models based on the selfish agent assumption cannot offer. Chapter 3 analyzes a tractable two-period staged financing model in which a single principal interacts with an agent who is risk-neutral and inequality-averse, offering him an equity contract. We fully characterize the menu of the optimal sharing contracts. Our results show that inequality-aversion changes the structure of the optimal contract. More importantly, we show that it is more likely we will observe an equal sharing contract when the agent is inequality-averse. Our findings for efficiency comparison indicate that inequality-aversion exacerbates the distortions caused by moral hazard, which leads to a further downward distortion in terms of total social welfare in this staged financing context. Incorporating inequality-aversion into a dynamic staged financing game thus allows us to <b>interpret</b> real-world contractual <b>arrangements</b> in the venture capital industry where equal split contracts dominate. In Chapter 4, we revisit the innovative Holmström's-type career concerns experiment by Irlenbusch and Silwka [47]. In particular, we introduce inequality-aversion, a theoretical short cut for reciprocity, into the analysis and investigate if it is the missing link that potentially drives the results in the experiment. Two related but conceptually different models are considered. The complete information model confirms that inequality-aversion induces positive effort in the second period, but does not predict any differences in the effort choices across both periods in the revealed-ability setting. The incomplete information model's predictions conform more closely to the observations in the revealed-ability setting, and its predictions for the hidden-ability setting can partly explain the lower effort choices observed in the hidden-ability setting. Our analysis suggests that inequality-aversion is part of the missing link, but not all. Incorporating fairness intentions into the analysis should open more opportunities for explaining the experimental results in Irlenbusch and Silwka. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|The {{earthquake}} {{sequences of}} Bovec 1998 (strike-slip focal mechanism, MD 5. 6), L'Aquila 2009 (normal, Mw 6. 1) and Emilia 2012 (thrust, Mw 6. 0) had the main shocks ruptures propagating and several foreshocks and aftershock nucleating within sedimentary successions mostly made of carbonatic rocks. These earthquake sequences are often long lasting (several months to years) and follow a complex spatiotemporal evolution, {{which is probably}} {{the result of the}} geometry of the fault-fracture network, fault rock distribution, ingression of uids, etc. Seismic waves inversion analysis has limited spatial resolution (in most cases > 1 km), and does not allow to reconstruct the geometrical complexity of fault zones and the distribution of fault rocks. Here the need of dedicated studies, from metric to kilometric scale ("multiscalar") of the architecture of faults hosted in carbonatic sedimentary rocks. This information, associated with mechanical data obtained from friction and rupture experiments, could be used in physically-based earthquake forecasting models and in simulation of seismic ruptures for earthquake hazard studies. In this thesis, I used a multidisciplinary approach which includes remote sensing analysis, detailed geological eld survey and microstructural studies to quantify the architecture of the 30 km long north-south striking Foiana Fault Zone (FFZ, Linea della Foiana auctores: Val di Non, Italian Southern Alps). The FFZ activity lasted from the Permian (mainly normal faulting) to the Miocene (mainly strike-slip faulting). In the Val di Non area, the FFZ is mainly hosted in Triassic dolostones (Sciliar Fm.), was exhumed from 1. 5 km (southern segment) to 2. 5 km (central segment) depth and, in his southern part, curves to the south-west into a restraining bend producing a fault-propagation anticline. As discussed here, the FFZ underwent seismic activity during the Miocene as attested by eld and microstructural evidences. The remote sensing analysis, thanks to the high resolution (2. 5 to 1 m) 7 of the LIDAR-based digital terrain models images, allowed a detailed reconstruction of the structural lineaments of the FFZ and neighbor areas. The lineaments were organized in groups based on their strike. The Riedel-shear model was used to <b>interpret</b> their geometrical <b>arrangement,</b> which was consistent with the left-lateral kinematics of the FFZ. Detailed structural eld geology survey (which included systematic rock sampling) was performed in three localities (from south to the north: Carnalez, Salobbi and Doss de la Ceora) covering a ca. 7 km long segment of {{the southern part of the}} FFZ. I traced sections parallel and orthogonal to fault strike to determine the attitude and spacing of the main structural features (faults, joints, bedding, etc.) and the distribution and characteristics of the fault zone rocks. An intriguing aspect was the presence of large volumes (up to 300 m in thickness) of in-situ shattered (fracture density from 3 cm to few mm) dolostones with negligible or null shear strain, cut by ultracataclastic slipping zones with mirror-like surfaces. The presence of clasts truncated by the mirror-surfaces and of clasts with radial fractures ("exploded" grains) immersed in the ne matrix of the ultracataclasites, is indicative of the seismic origin of these fault rocks, consistently with recent experiments reproducing seismic slip deformation conditions. In general, the attitude of the minor faults of the FFZ evolves from scattered with dominant reverse dip-slip reverse component in the southern exposures (Carnalez) to sub-parallel faults with dominant strike-slip towards the northern exposures (Doss de la Ceora). This major change in the architecture of the FFZ is concomitant with a decrease in the thickness of the damage zone (in-situ shattered dolostones) from 300 m in Carnalez to 200 m in Doss de la Ceora. These architectural along strike variations are here interpreted as the result of the presence of southern fault bend or of dynamic coseismic rupture processes. In the latter case, the larger scatter in the attitude (and sense of shear) of the fault-fracture network with respect to the northern exposures may reect rupture directivity eects and the dierent depth of seismic faulting (larger the pressure connement, larger the scatter of the attitude of the faults), consistently with recently published earthquake simulations models. Lastly, the pre-existing bedding surfaces appeared to be primary factor in controlling the nucleation of slip surfaces and fault zone thickening and growth during progressive deformation. ...|$|R

We examine at first the European project Ideal-EU, in which, in 2008, Tuscany, Catalonia and PoitouCharentes organized a Participatory Electronic Assembly (APE) on Climate Change and developed a participatory website (www. idealdebate. eu). This project was part of the "eParticipation 2007 " program and was funded by the European Commission (DG Information Society) as. We examine at second the conciliation procedure set up by a special Commission for Public Debate (CPDP) in 2009 to determine the transformation of the waste treatment center in Ivry-Paris XIII. This consultation also organized the terms of face-to-face debates (meetings) and online debates ([URL] In both cases, the participatory web site seemed to occupy a specific place. The call for proposals of the European program stressed the need, for the funded actors, to make a website as part of deliberative procedures, while the proposition of various modes of expression - including a blog - was, according to the CPDP, an indispensable guarantee for the proper conduct of the debate. From an ethno-semiotic approach, we discuss the various mechanisms put in place in these procedures as evidence of a definition of participation produced by the stakeholders. This definition is first negotiated and discussed in the set design, technical or editorial, which are of course also constrained by economic factors or calendar. The computer media, in particular, are characterized by their indexical value. On the first hand, the technical and editorial choices mobilize images (the imaginery of network, the imaginery of participation, and so on.). On the other hand, it promotes activities - writing, reading, validating, measuring, classifying - and "sets up a dense network of writing" (Aim, Jeanneret, 2007). For their part, public meetings and APE are instrumented, framed and scripted. We study the stakes of these techno-semiotic devices by focusing on how they "norm" and regulate the action by offering models of speaking and reading to produce, to shape and to archive the debate (facilitators, summaries, and reports for example) (Aldrin, Hube, 2011). In other words, we analyze public speaking of participants, in the web sites as well as in public meeting and at the EPA, as "allowed speaking": the device, online or face to face, establishes the rules (Flon, Jeanneret, 2010). But the device is also produced by the actions it makes possible - even if they have not been envisaged in its project. We analyze the discursive and symbolic dimensions of these devices in questioning the forms of participation produced. This is not to assess a difference between the aims (that of the institution, that of the participants) or to measure the effectiveness of the format of expression. We observe the linguistic and semiotic signs to understand how the definitions of participation produced by the stakeholders are interpreted by participants. In this, the proposed approach differs from that adopted by our colleagues : they compared modes of justification of the actors in their speeches (Wojcik, Talpin, 2009) or the quality of online discussions and face-to-face (MonnoyerSmith, Wojcik, 2011) to assess the "ideal" conditions of involving. Our approaches completement each other. The "participation" we observed is defined at the junction of its interpretations by the participants in the procedure which are, at some point, the conditions of possibilities for public debate. Our methodology to study this issue adds semiotic analysis to ethnographic investigation (interviews and observations) : we see the modalities of debates (participatory websites, public meetings) as places of public speaking, more or less nested according to the procedures. The participants and their speech circulate between the different places. We wish to avoid two aporias. The first would be to focus only on the discursive exchanges, which is to think that the formats of deliberation are naturals and "non semiotizated" (Doury, Marcoccia, 2007). The second would be to consider these devices as "formatting" places and to ignore the possibility that individuals can produce something different than what the devices propose. Our Communication will be structured in three parts: First, we propose a global characterization of the two participatory procedures by highlighting the "intersemioticity" involved in the devices that articulate face-to-face interaction and on line communication: two modalities which have heterogeneous semiotic statutes. Secondly, this characterization allows us to detail finely models and standards: what are the forms of speaking which are suggested, indicated by the different formats? Finally, we question how participants <b>interpret</b> the proposed <b>arrangements</b> and "cope with" models and standards of enunciation. We pay particular attention to the traces of their paths in the devices. We describe the circulation of their speech into different formats and in over time, reflecting a tactical use of modes of expression available in the devicesCette communication propose un éclairage sur les formes de médiation du politique à l'œuvre dans les procédures participatives articulant des dispositifs de débat en ligne et en face-à-face. Ces dispositifs sont constitués par des assemblages de formats hétérogènes et séquencés (blog, forum, assemblée participative électronique, etc.) et engagent ainsi une véritable normalisation des modalités de production et d'inscription du débat (Bonaccorsi, Julliard, 2010). Nous nous appuierons sur deux exemples empiriques analysés dans le cadre d'une recherche collective (Les formats d'expression citoyenne dans les procédures locales de concertation, Programme Concertation, Décision, Environnement 2, Ministère de l'écologie, de l'énergie et du développement durable et de l'aménagement du territoire) selon le postulat qu'au sein de ces procédures, les dispositifs de prise de parole supportent et matérialisent des conceptions du débat public (Monnoyer-Smith, 2009; Street, Wright, 2007). Le premier terrain d'étude porte sur le projet européen Ideal-Eu, dans le cadre duquel, en 2008, les Régions Toscane, Catalogne et Poitou-Charentes ont organisé une Assemblée Participative Électronique (APE) sur le changement climatique, et conçu un site web participatif (www. idealdebate. eu). Ce projet s'inscrivait dans le cadre de l'appel à projets du programme " eParticipation 2007 " et était financé par la Direction générale Information Society de la Commission européenne. Le second terrain d'étude porte sur la procédure de concertation mise en place par une Commission particulière du débat public (CPDP) en 2009 pour statuer sur la transformation du Centre de traitement des déchets d'Ivry-Paris XIII. Cette concertation articule également des modalités d'échanges en face-à-face (réunions publiques) et en ligne ([URL] Dans l'un et l'autre cas, le site web participatif semble devoir occuper une place spécifique : l'appel à projets du programme européen insistait sur la nécessité pour les acteurs financés de réaliser un site web dans le cadre de procédures délibératives; tandis que la mise à disposition de modalités d'expression variées - incluant un blog - constituait, selon la CPDP, une garantie sine qua non du bon déroulement du débat. À partir d'une approche ethno-sémiologique, nous abordons les différents dispositifs mis en place dans le cadre de ces procédures comme les traces d'une définition de la participation produite/engagée par les acteurs du projet. Cette définition est d'abord négociée et discutée dans les choix scénographiques, techniques ou éditoriaux, qui sont bien entendu également contraints par des facteurs économiques ou calendaires. Les médias informatisés, notamment, se caractérisent par leur valeur indexicale. D'une part, les choix techniques et éditoriaux mobilisent des imaginaires (celui du réseau, du participatif, etc.) qui sont supposés pouvoir particulièrement bien trouver une traduction concrète grâce à la technique, en cela, le Web, en tant que support, signale un registre à la communication. D'autre part, il favorise des activités - écrire, lire, valider, évaluer, classer - et " configure un tissu dense d'écriture " (Aïm, Jeanneret, 2007). De leur côté, réunions publiques et APE sont instrumentées, cadrées et scénarisées. Nous prenons donc la mesure des enjeux techno-sémiotiques de ces dispositifs en nous intéressant à la manière dont ils norment et régulent l'action en proposant des modèles de prise de parole et de lecture pour produire, mettre en forme et archiver le débat (animateurs, synthèses, rapports, etc.) (Aldrin, Hubé, 2011). En d'autres termes, nous analysons les interventions des participants dans les sites web, en réunion publique ou lors de l'APE comme des prises de parole autorisées : le dispositif, en ligne ou en face à face, institue (Flon, Jeanneret, 2010). Mais le dispositif est également produit par les actions qu'il rend possibles sans qu'elles n'aient été envisagées dans son projet. Nous analysons la dimension discursive et symbolique de ces dispositifs en nous interrogeant sur les formes de participation produites. Il ne s'agit pas d'évaluer un écart entre des finalités (celle de l'institution, celle des participants), ni de mesurer l'efficacité du format d'expression : nous observons là des interprétations du projet d'un dispositif de prise de parole à partir des marques langagières et sémiotique. En cela, l'approche proposée diffère de celle adoptée par nos collègues qui comparent les modes de justification des acteurs dans leurs discours (Wojcik, Talpin, 2009) ou la qualité des débats en ligne et en face-à-face (Monnoyer-Smith, Wojcik, 2011) pour évaluer les conditions de réalisation d'une délibération " idéale " dans chacun de ces dispositifs et dans leur articulation, et la complète. L'observable " participation " est défini selon nous à la jonction des interprétations du projet, où se jouent, à un moment donné, les conditions de possibilités d'un débat citoyen. Ceci est analysé selon une entrée méthodologique qui articule analyse sémiologique et enquête ethnographique (entretiens et observations) : nous abordons les dispositifs (sites web participatifs, réunions publiques) comme des lieux de prise de parole, plus ou moins imbriqués selon les procédures, et entre lesquels les participants et leurs discours circulent. Nous souhaitons ainsi éviter deux apories. La première serait de ne traiter des dispositifs qu'à partir de l'analyse discursive des échanges réalisés, ce qui revient à penser comme naturels et non sémiotisés les formats de la délibération (Doury, Marcoccia, 2007). La seconde serait de considérer ces dispositifs comme des lieux " formatant " et d'ignorer la possibilité que les individus peuvent produire quelque chose d'autre que le projet des dispositifs. La communication sera structurée en trois volets : Dans un premier temps, nous proposons une caractérisation globale des deux procédures de participation étudiées en mettant en relief l'intersémioticité en jeu dans les dispositifs qui imbriquent interactions en face à face et communication scripturale c'est-à-dire des statuts sémiotiques hétérogènes. Dans un deuxième temps, cette caractérisation nous permet de détailler finement les modèles et les normes en jeu - quelles formes de prise de parole sont suggérées, indiquées par les différents formats, à quels outillages conceptuels renvoient-ils ? Dans un troisième temps, nous questionnons la manière dont les participants interprètent le projet des dispositifs et " font avec " ces modèles et ces normes énonciatives. Nous relevons notamment les traces de leurs trajectoires au sein des dispositifs et décrivons la circulation de leurs discours dans les différents formats et dans le temps, témoignant d'un usage tactique des modalités d'expression mises à leur disposition...|$|R
