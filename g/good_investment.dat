500|$|Remarking that Brain Age 2 {{uses the}} same formula as Brain Age [...] "with some {{different}} variables thrown in", Game Informer noted that players' opinions of the original Brain Age {{will most likely be}} similar to how much they appreciate Brain Age 2.

They found the daily training and quick play modes [...] "simply addictive", and appreciated the game's [...] "simple and easy to use interface". The video game website IGN felt differently, however, noting that the challenges felt fresh, with the exception of Sudoku. IGN agreed with GameZone on a particular point, however, writing that both the original Brain Age, and Brain Age 2, have [...] "calm, clean interface". The television series X-Play was intrigued by Brain Age 2s promise to improve a person's intelligence. GameSpy called the game [...] "the ideal video game gateway drug" [...] because of its accessibility {{to a wide variety of}} people, lack of requirements for special physical dexterity or experience, and regular reward system to motivate the player. They also considered Brain Age 2 a [...] "noble effort towards the betterment of our mental health through a painless training regimen". Game Revolution complimented the game's intelligent use of Nintendo DS features, [...] "fun" [...] sound effects, and [...] "competent" [...] handwriting recognition. Singapore's The Straits Times considered Brain Age 2 a <b>good</b> <b>investment,</b> despite noting that hardcore gamers might find the minigames [...] "gimmicky". Recognizing that Nintendo intends to use the game to target baby boomers, The Globe and Mail writes that they were tempted to play the game at work and justify it as a self-improvement program.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} two important issues: {{what are the}} determinants of public <b>goods</b> <b>investment</b> {{and what is the}} government's investment behavior in mountainous areas. The impacts of natural conditions, target, and demand elements on public <b>goods</b> <b>investment</b> are analyzed with statistical method, and the determinants of public <b>goods</b> <b>investment</b> in the areas are obtained by using population-weighted and stepwise regression models with Eviews 6. 0 software with survey data in 2008 and calculated data based on GIS of 20 typical villages in mountainous regions in Sichuan, China. The results showed: (1) natural conditions are the important determinants of public investment. Mountainous villages with steep slope have relatively high levels of investment; (2) concentration of population and the educational levels of the village leaders also have important impacts on public goods investment; (3) the government is more concerned with public investment resources particularly in areas characterized by fragile ecological environment and poor agricultural output. These results suggest that the current investment strategy helps to reduce disparities in regional development...|$|R

Weber's independence allowed her to shoot her films in sequence, as she preferred (rather than out of order to suit production schedules). William D. Routt indicates that [...] "Lois Weber Productions were a <b>good</b> <b>investment,</b> cost-effective.

[...] In 1932 he enrolled at Harvard for a Ph.D. in economics, with the hopes of learning what had caused the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent economic depression of the 1930s. For his thesis, Joseph Schumpeter suggested the question of the intrinsic value of a common stock, for which Williams' personal experience and background would serve him in good stead. He received his doctorate in 1940.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines whether ethical <b>investment</b> {{funds are}} <b>good</b> <b>investments</b> {{in comparison with}} other stock market investments for individual investors. Firstly, the financial performance of ethical funds was analysed using traditional risk adjusted performance measures. Performance was first compared with market benchmarks and then in comparison with other funds using a 'matched pair' approach (Luther, Matatko and Corner 1992; Mallin, Saadouni and Briston, 1995; Gregory, Matatko and Luther, 1997). This analysis indicated that the financial performance of ethical funds was {{not significantly different from}} market benchmarks and other funds. It was therefore concluded that ethical funds were <b>good</b> <b>investments</b> financially. A second empirical study used field research to examine the policies and processes of ethical funds. Two complementary strategies for dealing with ethical issues were identified; screening and engagement. Screening involves the use of exclusionary and/or positive ethical criteria in the stock selection process. This study indicated that ethical funds had a number of processes in place to address ethical issues. These processes included ethical screening; ethical advisory committees; specialist ethical researchers and use of other organisations. In terms of the policies and processes employed by ethical funds they were "good" investments compared to other funds. This confirms previous findings that ethical funds, although not a "panacea" were an improvement over other funds and that some ethical funds engaged with firms on ethical issues (Cowton, 1999; Mills, 2000; Friedman and Miles, 2001). Finally, ethical history and Church perspectives are employed in a tentative analysis of whether ethical funds are <b>good</b> <b>investments</b> ethically (Mackenzie, 1997). This preliminary analysis made it clear that some ethical funds would not be <b>good</b> <b>investments</b> in a moral sense for certain investors...|$|R

40|$|Public {{services}} {{provision in}} the developing world, including China, is crucial for rural development and poverty reduction. Although {{there has been much}} effort focused on public <b>goods</b> <b>investment</b> in China in recent years, there are still great differences among villages in the level of public <b>goods</b> <b>investment.</b> This study seeks to explain these differences by focusing on the effect of community governance on public goods provision at the village level, including investment into roads, water control and schools. During the recent several years, village governance in rural China has undergone a series of fundamental reforms. Arguably, the advent of direct elections for village leaders and the rural Tax for Fee reform are two of the most important shifts in the ways that communities manage themselves. Using a nearly nationally representative sample of communities from survey data that includes information from more than 2400 villages in rural China, we find that the direct election of a village's leader leads to increased public <b>goods</b> <b>investment</b> in the village. The paper also demonstrates that the rural Tax for Fee reform, ceteris paribus, has a negative effect on public <b>goods,</b> especially on <b>investment</b> by the village itself.
