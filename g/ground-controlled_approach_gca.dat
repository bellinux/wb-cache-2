5000|$|In {{aviation}} a <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (<b>GCA),</b> {{is a type}} {{of service}} provided by air-traffic controllers whereby they guide aircraft to a safe landing, including in adverse weather conditions, based on primary radar images. Most commonly a GCA uses information from either a Precision Approach Radar (PAR, for precision approaches with vertical, glidepath guidance) or an Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR, providing a non-precision Surveillance radar approach with no glidepath guidance). The term GCA may refer to any type of ground radar guided approach such as a PAR, PAR without glideslope or ASR. When both vertical and horizontal guidance from the PAR is given, the approach is termed a precision approach. If no PAR glidepath is given, even if PAR equipment is used for lateral guidance, it is considered a non-precision approach ...|$|E

50|$|Civilian Air Traffic Controllers' {{licensing}} is standardized {{by international}} agreement through ICAO. Many countries have Air Traffic Control schools, academies or colleges, often {{operated by the}} incumbent provider of air traffic services in that country, but sometimes privately. These institutions are structured to provide training to individuals without any prior air traffic control experience. At the completion of academic training, the graduating student will be granted an Air Traffic Control license, which will include one or more Ratings. These are sub-qualifications denoting the air traffic control discipline or disciplines in which the person has been trained. ICAO defines five such ratings: Area (procedural), Area Radar, Approach (procedural), Approach Radar and Aerodrome. In the United States, controllers may train in several similar specialties: Tower, <b>Ground-Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> (<b>GCA),</b> Terminal Radar Control, or En route Control (both radar and non-radar). This phase of training takes between 6 months and several years.|$|E

The Wullenweber could electronically scan the horizon 360° and determine the direction of any signal with reasonably good accuracy. Circular arrays were enhanced during the Cold War for eavesdropping purposes.The American Physicist Luis Walter Alvarez developed the first <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (<b>GCA)</b> system for landing aircraft in bad weather based on an electronically steered microwave phased array antenna. Alvarez tested and deployed the system in England in 1943. Near the end of the war, Germany’s GEMA built an early warning phased array radar system (the PESA Mammut 1) to detect targets up to 300 km away. The polyrod fire control antenna was developed by Bell Laboratories in 1947 using cascaded phase shifters controlled by a rotary switch (spinning at ten revolutions per second) to create a continuous scanning beam.|$|E

50|$|Precision {{approach}} radar (PAR) {{is a type}} of radar {{guidance system}} designed to provide lateral and vertical guidance to an aircraft pilot for landing, until the landing threshold is reached. After the aircraft reaches the decision height (DH) or decision altitude (DA), guidance is advisory only. Controllers monitoring the PAR displays observe each aircraft's position and issue instructions to the pilot that keep the aircraft on course and glidepath during final approach. It is similar to an instrument landing system (ILS) but requires control instructions. One type of instrument approach that can make use of PAR is the <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (<b>GCA).</b> Air traffic controllers must transmit a minimum of every 5 seconds to the pilot their relation to the azimuth portion and, once intercepting the glidepath, their elevation. The approach is terminated when the aircraft reaches the OCA/H (Obstacle Clearance Altitude/Height). Nevertheless, information is provided till threshold and aircraft may be monitored by controller till touchdown. Controller in charge of PAR should not be responsible for any duty other than the PAR approach concerned.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} labor-intensive nature—one GCA {{controller}} is normally required for each aircraft on final approach—GCAs {{are no longer}} in widespread use at civilian airports, and are being discontinued at many military bases. However, air traffic controllers at some locations in the United States are required to maintain currency in their use, while the Belgian Air Force still uses the PAR for <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approaches</b> on a daily basis. NATO has kept GCA active while civil aviation adopted the instrument landing system (ILS). Global Positioning System (GPS) based approaches that provide both lateral and vertical guidance are coming into widespread use, with approach minima as good as, or nearly as good as, GCA or ILS. Modern ILS and GPS approaches eliminate the possibility of human error from the controller, and can serve many aircraft at the same time. The <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> is useful when the approaching aircraft is not equipped with sophisticated navigation aids, and may also become a life saver when an aircraft's on-board navigation aids are inoperative, as long as one communication radio works. Sometimes the PAR-based <b>ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> is also requested by qualified pilots when they are dealing with an emergency on board to lighten their workload. In the United States, instrument approaches must be monitored by a PAR (if one exists with a coinciding final approach course) during certain condition such as times of darkness or low weather depending upon the controlling agency (USAF, U.S. Army, USN or FAA) or upon pilot request.|$|R

5000|$|Broadhurst was {{appointed}} Air Officer Commander-in-Chief Bomber Command in January 1956. In 1956, {{at the peak}} of Broadhurst's career as Commander in Chief of RAF Bomber Command, his reputation suffered following a fatal accident to an Avro Vulcan. Broadhurst took aircraft XA897, the first Vulcan delivered to the RAF, and a full Vulcan crew, on a round-the-world tour. On return to the UK, Broadhurst was to land at London Heathrow Airport, a civil airport, to complete the successful tour before the assembled aviation media. However, the weather at Heathrow was poor and RAF aircraft were not equipped to use the Instrument Landing System installed at Heathrow and other civil airports so a <b>Ground-controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (<b>GCA)</b> was carried out. XA897 struck the ground about 2,000 feet short of the runway just as power was applied. XA897 was damaged by the initial impact but rose back in the air. The pilot, Squadron Leader D.R. [...] "Podge" [...] Howard, and Broadhurst, who was occupying the co-pilot seat, both ejected from the aircraft and survived. The aircraft again hit the ground and broke up.
