60|$|The {{workshop}} is {{the only}} real school for a handicraft. The education which precedes that of the workshop should be entirely devoted to the strengthening of the body, the elevation of the moral faculties, and the cultivation of the intelligence; and, especially, to the imbuing the mind with a broad and {{clear view of the}} laws of that natural world with the components of which the handicraftsman will have to deal. And, the earlier the period of life at which the handicraftsman has to enter into actual practice of his craft, the more <b>important</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that he should devote the precious hours of preliminary education to things of the mind, which have no direct and immediate bearing on his branch of industry, though they lie at the foundation of all realities.|$|E
60|$|After all, {{it is an}} unorthodox age. We are all horribly {{afraid of}} being bourgeois, and unconventionality is the ideal of every respectable person. It is strange that we should cling so steadfastly to correct spelling. Yet again, one can partly {{understand}} the business, if one thinks of the little ways of your schoolmaster and schoolmistress. This sanctity of spelling is stamped upon us in our earliest years. The writer recalls a period of youth wherein six hours a week {{were given to the}} study of spelling, and four hours to all other religious instruction. So <b>important</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> that a writer who cannot spell is almost driven to abandon his calling, however urgent the thing he may have to say, or his need of the incidentals of fame. Yet in the crisis of such a struggle rebellious thoughts may arise. Even this: Why, after all, should correct spelling be the one absolutely essential literary merit? For it is less fatal for an ambitious scribe to be as dull as Hoxton than to spell in diverse ways.|$|E
60|$|And as our {{conception}} of the Great State grows, so we shall begin to realise {{the nature of the}} problem of transition, the problem of what we may best do in the confusion of the present time to elucidate and render practicable this new phase of human organisation. Of one thing there can be no doubt, that whatever increases thought and knowledge moves towards our goal; and equally certain is it that nothing leads thither that tampers with the freedom of spirit, the independence of soul in common men and women. In many directions, therefore, the believer in the Great State will display a jealous watchfulness of contemporary developments rather than a premature constructiveness. We must watch wealth; but quite as necessary it is to watch the legislator, who mistakes propaganda for progress and class exasperation to satisfy class vindictiveness for construction. Supremely <b>important</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to keep discussion open, to tolerate no limitation on the freedom of speech, writing, art and book distribution, and to sustain the utmost liberty of criticism upon all contemporary institutions and processes.|$|E

6000|$|If in the Descriptive-Historical {{portion of}} this Volume, Teufelsdrockh, {{discussing}} merely the Werden (Origin and successive Improvement) of Clothes, has astonished many a reader, much more will he in the Speculative-Philosophical portion, which treats of their Wirken, or Influences. It is here that the present Editor first feels the pressure of his task; for here properly the higher and new Philosophy of Clothes commences: all untried, almost inconceivable region, or chaos; in venturing upon which, how difficult, yet how unspeakably <b>important</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to know what course, of survey and conquest, is the true one; where the footing is firm substance and will bear us, where it is hollow, or mere cloud, and may engulf us! Teufelsdrockh undertakes no less than to expound the moral, political, even religious Influences of Clothes; he undertakes to make manifest, in its thousand-fold bearings, this grand Proposition, that Man's earthly interests [...] "are all hooked and buttoned together, and held up, by Clothes." [...] He says in so many words, [...] "Society is founded upon Cloth;" [...] and again, [...] "Society sails through the Infinitude on Cloth, as on a Faust's Mantle, or rather like the Sheet of clean and unclean beasts in the Apostle's Dream; and without such Sheet or Mantle, would sink to endless depths, or mount to inane limbos, and in either case be no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{difficult}} to understand those peculiar trials which called forth the mighty energies of Bunyan's mind, unless we are acquainted with the times in which he lived. The trammels of statecraft and priestcraft had been suddenly removed from religion, and men were left to form their own opinions as to rites and ceremonies. In this state of abrupt liberty, some wild enthusiasts ran into singular errors; and Bunyan's first work on [...] "Gospel Truths" [...] was published to correct them. Then followed that alarm to thoughtless souls--"A Few Sighs from Hell"; and, in 1659, as a further declaration {{of the most important}} truths of revelation, this work on the two covenants was sent forth to chastise error, and comfort the saints of God. It was published many times during the author's life; and since then, to a late period, very large impressions have been circulated. Upon a subject of such vast importance--upon which hangs all our eternal interests--all our indescribable joys or sorrows in a future and never-ending state--the requirements of our Creator--and His gracious provision of pardoning mercy, upon our failing to keep His Law--these are subjects of intense interest. How <b>important</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that all our researches into these solemn realities should be guided simply by the revealed will of God! That was the fountain at which Bunyan drunk in all his knowledge; and with simplicity, and most earnest desire to promote the glory of God in the salvation of sinners, he here gives the result of his patient, prayerful, painful investigation. The humble dependence upon Divine mercy which the author felt is very striking. He was sensible of his want of education; [...] "no vain, whimsical, scholar-like terms"--no philosophy from Plato or Aristotle. He felt, as to human teaching, his weakness, but proved that, [...] "when he was weak, then was he strong." [...] He claimed an interest in the fervent prayers of his fellow saints--"My heart is vile, the devil lieth at watch, trust myself I dare not; if God do not help me, my heart will deceive me." [...] This was the proper spirit in which to enter upon so solemn a subject; and the aid he sought was vouchsafed to him, and appears throughout this important work. His first object is to define what is the Law, a strict obedience to which is exacted upon all mankind. It was given to Adam, and was afterwards more fully developed upon Mount Sinai. It commands implicit, universal, perfect obedience, upon pain of eternal ruin. He shows us that man, under the influence of that law, and while a stranger to the Law of Grace, may repent and reform his conduct, become a member of a Christian church, be a virgin waiting for his Lord, [...] "but not step even upon the lowest round of the ladder that reacheth to heaven." [...] While man is a stranger to the new birth, [...] "his destiny is the lion's den; yea, worse than that, to be thrown into Hell to the very devils." [...] Bunyan in this, as well as all other of his works, is awfully severe upon those who say, [...] "Let us sin that grace may abound," [...] perverting the consolatory doctrine of Divine grace to their souls' destruction. [...] "What! because Christ is a Saviour, wilt thou be a sinner! because His grace abounds, therefore thou wilt abound in sin! O wicked wretch! rake Hell all over, and surely I think thy fellow will scarce be found. If Christ will not serve their turn, but they must have their sins too, take them, Devil; if Heaven will not satisfy them, take them, Hell; devour them, burn them, Hell!" [...] "Tell the hogs of this world what a hog-sty is prepared for them, even such an one as a God hath prepared to put the devil and his angels into." ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{religious}} and cultural implication involves the theme of “The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood:” the triumph of ma’at over isfet (Vinson 33). Ma’at had existed since creation but was in a constant struggle with the forces of chaos (Strudwick 366). If order broke down, chaos would follow (Strudwick 366). This concept is so <b>important</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> made the moral of “The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood.” The tale’s allegorical nature downplays the narrative’s mythological aspect in order to highlight an important moral that Egyptians wanted to ensure in their society and culture (Baines 374). This would guarantee that ma’at would continue and ultimately triumph over chaos.|$|E

The two dimensions are combined to create five styles for dealing with conflict. The individual will choose a style of handling conflict based on the importance of saving their face and that of the face of the other.|$|E
5000|$|Questions of subjectivity, agency, actors, and {{structures}} {{have always been}} of interest in social and cultural anthropology. In cyborg anthropology {{the question of what}} type of cybernetic system constitutes an actor/subject becomes all the more <b>important.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> the actual technology that acts on humanity (the Internet), the general techno-culture (Silicon Valley), government sanctions (net neutrality), specific innovative humans (Steve Jobs), or some type of combination of these elements? Some academics believe that only humans have agency and technology is an object humans act upon, while others argue that humans have no agency and culture is entirely shaped by material and technological conditions. Actor-network theory (ANT), proposed by Bruno Latour, is a theory that helps scholars understand how these elements work together to shape techno-cultural phenomena. Latour suggests that actors and the subjects they act on are parts of larger networks of mutual interaction and feedback loops. Humans and technology both have the agency to shape one another. ANT best describes the way cyborg anthropology approaches the relationship between humans and technology.|$|E
