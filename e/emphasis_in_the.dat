5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by readers that include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one question in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grading.|$|E
5|$|James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 {{demonstrated}} conclusively {{the likely}} hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused {{a shift of}} <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of the}} 19th century, away from trade and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898-99 (Adrien de Gerlache), the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent in this endeavor, which was characterized by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} adds new difficulty levels ('Beginner' and 'Expert') and new {{modes of}} play ('Arena Challenge' and 'Legend' modes). In 'Arena Challenge Mode,' the player can engage one-on-one duels against various opponents, where they'll be rewarded if they win. The new 'Legend Mode' elaborates {{on the individual}} prowess of each individual warrior within Dynasty Warriors. Individual weapons are given the availability to have an 11th evolved state, increasing the weapon's stats further. Due to the great <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> duelling system in this expansion, it is at times seen as its own individual game - separate from the original Dynasty Warriors 4.|$|E

5|$|The region {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in defense contracting, with particular <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.|$|E

25|$|Cruise ship calls also {{declined}} from 181 in 2007, to 122 in 2008. In mid-2008, Brown put additional tourism promotional <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New York market (Bermuda's largest), {{resulting in a}} 27% increase in New York arrivals for December 2008 compared to December 2007, officials said. Overall, December 2008 arrivals were almost 7% higher than December 2007. The government projected 300,000cruise visitors in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{changing}} <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> threat {{away from}} the manned bomber and to the ballistic missile brought reorganization and reduction in aeropace defense resources and personnel and almost continuous turmoil in the management structure. The headquarters of the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) and ADC were combined on 1 July 1973. Six months later in February 1973, ADC was reduced to 20 fighter squadrons and a complete phaseout of air defense missile batteries.|$|E

2500|$|Generally, {{there are}} two {{essential}} <b>emphases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> practice of Nichiren Buddhism. First is the chanting of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo which Nichiren believers contend has extraordinary power. Second is the Gohonzon, a calligraphy which is prominently displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home or temple altars of Nichiren believers. [...] <b>The</b> gohonzon used <b>in</b> Nichiren Buddhism is composed {{of the names of}} key bodhisattvas and Buddhas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lotus Sutra as well as Namu-Myoho-Renge-Kyo written in large characters down the center.|$|R

25|$|Medawar {{was awarded}} his Nobel Prize in 1960 with Burnet {{for their work}} in tissue {{grafting}} which {{is the basis of}} organ transplants, and their discovery of acquired immunological tolerance. This work was used in dealing with skin grafts required after burns. Medawar's work resulted in a shift of <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> science of immunology from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself, as in the attempt to suppress the body's rejection of organ transplants.|$|E
25|$|Saint Joseph's cult was {{increasingly}} promoted {{in the late}} Middle Ages in the West, by the Franciscans and others. His feast {{was added to the}} Roman Breviary in 1479. By the 15th century he is often more dignified, and this improvement continued through the Renaissance and Baroque, until a resurgence of Marian <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century again often leaves him stranded on the margins of Nativity compositions. The candle lit by Saint Joseph in Bridget's vision becomes an attribute, which he is often shown holding, lit or unlit, in broad daylight.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Momentum {{gained a}} new boss when Theodore Shackley {{transferred}} {{in as the}} CIA's Chief of Station in Laos. Shackley is credited with stating that Momentum was run like a country store, {{and it was his}} job {{to turn it into a}} supermarket. An ad hoc U.S. Air Force unit called the Raven Forward Air Controllers was founded to direct the swelling tide of airpower being unleashed in support of the Hmong and other irregulars. Rather than continuing to craft a strategy to defend Laos, the new <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war became the support of the combat in South Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the {{successor}}s of Christ's apostles, and that the Pope is the successor to Saint Peter to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition. The Latin Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders and enclosed monastic orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual <b>emphases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Church.|$|R
25|$|The Gazelle was {{designed}} to be easy to maintain, all bearings were life-rated without need for continuous application of lubrication and most fluid reservoirs to be rapidly inspected. The <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> design stage of achieving minimal maintenance requirements contributed towards the helicopter's low running costs; many of the components were designed to have a service life in excess of 700 flying hours, and in some cases 1,200 flight hours, before requiring replacement. Due to the performance of many of the Gazelle's subsystems, features pioneered upon the Gazelle such as the fenestron would appear upon later Aerospatiale designs.|$|E
25|$|E. B. Ford was an {{experimental}} naturalist {{who wanted to}} test natural selection in nature, virtually inventing the field of ecological genetics. His work on natural selection in wild populations of butterflies and moths {{was the first to}} show that predictions made by R. A. Fisher were correct. In 1940, {{he was the first to}} describe and define genetic polymorphism, and to predict that human blood group polymorphisms might be maintained in the population by providing some protection against disease. His 1949 book Mendelism and Evolution, helped to persuade Dobzhansky to change the <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third edition of his famous text from drift to selection.|$|E

The earliest volumes of the Journal addressed movements and concerns within public mental health. Quantitative analysis of mental health articles shows wide fluctuations over the last 75 years, probably due to variations in federal funding for mental health research.

25|$|In 2008, the MRC set up {{an expert}} group to {{consider}} how the MRC might encourage new high-quality research into CFS/ME and partnerships between researchers already working on CFS/ME and those in associated areas. It currently lists CFS/ME with a highlight notice, inviting researchers to develop high-quality research proposals for funding. In February 2010, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on ME (APPG on ME) produced a legacy paper, which welcomed the recent MRC initiative, but felt {{that there has been}} far too much <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past on psychological research, with insufficient attention to biomedical research, and that it is vital that further biomedical research be undertaken to help discover a cause and more effective forms of management for this disease.|$|E
25|$|Vocal {{music is}} music {{performed}} {{by one or}} more singers, which are typically called songs, and which may be performed with or without instrumental accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical cultures have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some blues rock songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called lyrics, although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical onomatopoeia. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a song, although, in classical music, terms such as aria are typically used.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately {{and not as}} one would expect where they occur together, for example voel (to feel) as opposed to voël (bird). The circumflex is used in ê, î, ô and û generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words wêreld (world) and môre (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add <b>emphasis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way as underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|E
