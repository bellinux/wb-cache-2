40|$|The {{effects of}} {{steaming}} and storage {{time on the}} microbial quality of <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> quail sausages were investigated. <b>Duck</b> <b>and</b> quail sausages were either inoculated with or without pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes during preparation and analyzed microbiologically for Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, total aerobic bacterial counts and coliforms on day 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Total aerobic bacterial counts for non-steamed inoculated <b>and</b> non-inoculated <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> quail sausages ranged from log 3. 19 cfu/g in day 1 to too numerous to count in day 10. Coliform numbers for non-steamed inoculated <b>and</b> non-inoculated <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> quail sausages ranged from 4. 9 MPN/g in day 1 to > 1100 MPN/g in day 10. Thus microbial load for non-steamed inoculated <b>and</b> non-inoculated <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> quail sausages increased with storage time. Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected in steamed <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> quail sausages from day 0 to 10. Steaming of sausages at a temperature of 110 oC for 2. 5 hours and to an internal temperature of 72 oC was effective to inactivate all the microorganisms investigated...|$|R

40|$|Consumer acceptability, {{consumption}} pattern, and {{preference for}} the <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> its meat products in Southern Nigeria were assessed, using Edo state as a case study.
