40|$|Nowadays the lay-out of profile dies {{is based}} on the {{experience}} of the die maker. Numerical methods in <b>die</b> <b>lay-out</b> might lead to faster and more repeatable results. In this article two different numerical approaches for <b>die</b> <b>lay-out</b> are introduced and their possibilities are shown by results. A simple method gives results for slit dies very fast while the complex method of the finite elements supplies information for expensive profile dies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a versatile sub-mTorr vacuum packaging approach ideally suited for R&D of high performance dynamic MEMS. The procedure {{takes advantage of}} processing steps and materials used throughout the MEMS industry while providing maximum flexibility for changes in <b>die</b> size and <b>lay-out.</b> Prototypes of a new tuning fork gyroscope con-cept optimized to minimize substrate energy dissipa-tion were packaged using the presented techniques and experimentally characterized to determine the sealed vacuum level. The combination of high-Q mechanical design with the packaging process resulted in a stable quality factor of greater than 91, 000...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{choosing}} the manufacturing route and characteristics in sheet metal processes, a very important element in computer aided process planning (CAPP) systems. At present, decisions concerning the operations, die, machine and process parameters used in sheet metal are based on experience. One of the objectives of this work has been to develop an activity model to help define sheet metal processes. This activity model allows focusing on the second objective, which is to implement a computer aided system to select and define the parameters of the process definition in the case of drawing operations with sheet metal. The result is the selection of parameters related to the operations chosen, the kinds of operations, the sequence of these operations and the <b>lay-out</b> <b>die</b> dimensions for the product. A range of parts were evaluated. They were chosen because they were considered to be representative cases. The results obtained by the system are compared with the values proposed in reference manuals, and by experienced experts. The work has served to determine how to adjust the computer aided system. Applying the method helps to make the right decisions about the sheet metal operations related to drawing processes. The experiments have led to a reduction in processing times...|$|R
