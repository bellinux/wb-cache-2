The study included 1211 samples of milk obtained in the summer season (663) and in the winter season (548) from cows maintained in traditional and intensive (TMR) system of production. Following parameters were determined: content of fat, protein, casein, lactose and dry matter; acidity (pH value); heat stability; rennet coagulation time; content of α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, lactoferrin, lysozyme and fatty acid profiles. Cows fed in the TMR system produced significantly (P≤ 0. 01) more milk and of a <b>better</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> regardless of the season of production.

40|$|One of {{the several}} {{challenges}} of cool climate viticulture with a short growing season is consistently reaching a uniform and optimal fruit technological maturity at harvest before the first autumn frost. Weather conditions in Michigan from veraison to harvest are widely variable and unpredictable between years, constraining the pre-harvest assessment of fruit quality for grape growers and wineries. In these environmental conditions, the commonly adopted viticultural techniques to enhance fruit ripening are cluster thinning and leaf removal. Cluster thinning consists of a selective elimination of clusters, therefore optimizing the source/sink ratio of the vine. Cluster zone leaf removal induces changes of fruit micro-environmental conditions, involving solar radiation, temperature and aeration. In this work, we evaluated the effects of cluster thinning and cluster zone leaf removal, applied separately or combined at veraison on Cabernet Franc for two consecutive years (2011 and 2012). The two seasons had very distinct weather patterns from veraison to harvest. Fruit maturity was enhanced at 15 – 20 days after veraison in both years {{in response to the}} viticultural techniques, but with completely different dynamics.

In the silage with calcium oxide, we evaluated the silage enriched with 5. 0 g kg− 1 calcium oxide (control) and the silage enriched with 5. 0 g kg− 1 urea and 5. 0 g kg− 1 calcium oxide (urea). Experimental silos were distributed in a completely randomized design in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (inclusion or lack of lime × inclusion or lack of urea), with four replicates. Crude protein concentration was greater in the silages that received urea, whereas in the case of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber, the lowest levels were found in the control silage. Control silage had the lowest pH (3. 75) and the silages that received lime displayed the lowest lactic acid content. Effluent losses were greater in the control silage and in the silage with lime (56. 1 kg t− 1 and 58. 4 kg t− 1, respectively).

The study evaluated the biometric traits of the plants, yield, the qualitative parameters of herbal raw material and weed infestation of the crop in dependence on growth simulators (Asahi SL, Bio-algeen, Titanit) and the forecrop (winter wheat or spring barley + white mustard cover crop). Plots without foliar application of the growth stimulators were the control treatment. Tillage, mineral NPK fertilization as well as mechanical and chemical weed control were typical for this plant species and consistent with the recommendations for herbal plant protection. A hypothesis was made that the application of growth stimulators would {{have a positive effect on}} basil productivity, raw material quality and weed infestation of the basil crop. It was also assumed that the phytosanitary and fertilizing effects of the cover crop would result in higher and qualitatively better yield compared to the cereal forecrop alone (winter wheat).

The forecrop - spring barley + a white mustard cover crop that is ploughed in - also had a beneficial effect on yield and weed infestation of the plant in question. The traditional crop protection method used in the basil crop, without the application of the growth stimulators, resulted in a lower plant height and a smaller number of shoots per plant. This caused higher weed infestation of the crop and a decrease in yield.

In this manuscript, we report {{for the first time}} the concentrations of 16 amino acids (AAs) in 25 cloud water samples. The concentrations of individual AAs ranged from a few nM up to ~ 2. 0 [*]μM, and the average contribution of AAs corresponded to 9. 1 % (4. 4 to 21. 6 %) of the dissolved OC (DOC) concentration. Considering their occurrence and concentrations, AAs were expected to represent an important hydroxyl radical (HO•) sink in aqueous cloud samples. In this work, we estimated that approximately 17 % (from 7 to 36 %) of the hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability of the DOC could be attributed to the presence of AAs, whereas comparing the AAs suggested that an average of 51 % (from 22 to 80 %) of their reactivity with HO• could account for the presence of tryptophan. These results clearly demonstrate that the occurrence and reactivity of AAs must be considered to <b>better</b> estimate the <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> and oxidant capacity of the cloud aqueous phase...|$|R
40|$|The IGAC Science Plan and Implementation Strategy {{lays out}} the {{scientific}} objectives and key research issues of the atmospheric chemistry project of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) as both IGAC and IGBP enter their second phase. It also lays out a framework for addressing these objectives and issues, recognizing the need for collaboration with partner programmes and projects. The scientific focus of this document emerged from {{the first decade of}} IGAC research, much of which was conducted in the context of focused, intensive measurement campaigns. The scope of IGAC in its next phase includes both regional characterisation and the extension into issues that cross more expansive boundaries in space, time and discipline. While local and regional-scale atmospheric <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> will be a primary focus, {{it is now clear that}} issues such as intercontinental transport and transformation of chemically active species and the interactions between atmospheric chemistry and climate must also be addressed in order to <b>better</b> understand atmospheric <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> and to provide guidance to the public and policy-making community...|$|R
40|$|Some chemical, sensorial and physical-mechanical {{properties}} of 19 apricot genotypes and Hungarian Best (control) such as moisture content, soluble solids content, titratable acidity ratio and their ratio, fruit and stone mass, flesh/stone ratio, fruit dimensions (length, width, thickness), arithmetic and geometric mean diameter, sphericity, surface area and aspect ratio were determined. Their application is also discussed. The highest moisture content and stone mass observed in X- 1 / 1 / 04 and X- 1 / 2 / 04, soluble solids content in ZO- 1 / 03, titratable acidity in ZL- 2 / 03, SS/TA ratio in ZL- 1 / 03, and fruit mass and flesh/stone ratio in DL- 1 / 1 / 04 genotype. The most number of genotypes have orange and deep orange skin and flesh colour, respectively, whereas sweet kernel taste was predominant in most genotypes. Regarding physical-mechanical properties, the superior fruit dimensions (length, width, thickness), arithmetic and geometric mean diameter and surface area observed in DL- 1 / 1 / 04 genotype, whereas the highest sphericity and surface area observed in X- 1 / 1 / 04 and X- 1 / 2 / 04 genotypes. Also, {{the series of}} genotypes evaluated <b>have</b> <b>better</b> <b>chemical,</b> sensorial and physical-mechanical properties than Hungarian Best (control).

40|$|The {{stability}} of lignin-derived bio-oil {{obtained from a}} continuous process [base (K 2 CO 3) -catalyzed, using phenol as a capping agent] under subcritical conditions of water (25 MPa, 290 - 370 degrees C) was investigated. The lignin-derived bio-oil obtained was stored at ambient temperature for 2 years. Our {{results show that the}} base concentration in the feed solution affects the {{stability of}} this lignin-derived bio-oil during its long-term storage. It was found that, at low base concentrations (i. e., 0. 4 %- 1. 0 %), the yields of all lignin-derived bio-oil fractions were relatively stable. At high base concentrations (i. e., 1. 6 %- 2. 2 %), however, the yield of high-molecular-weight (high-Mw) structures increased and that of low-molecular-weight (low-Mw) structures decreased after storage. This indicated that the low-Mw materials had been polymerized to form high-Mw materials. In addition, {{it was found that the}} yield of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) -identified compounds (excluding phenol) in this lignin-derived bio-oil decreased from 15 % to 11 %. This is probably due to the presence of solids in these lignin derived bio-oils, which promotes the catalytic polymerization reactions, suggesting that it is beneficial to remove the solids from this lignin-derived bio-oil in order to enhance its stability. Compared to the results obtained from bio-oil derived from biomass pyrolysis, our results show that bio-oil derived from the conversion of lignin in subcritical water <b>has</b> <b>better</b> <b>chemical</b> stability during long-term storage...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{physicochemical}} properties such as surface area, particle size and basicity of heterogeneous catalysts is in great interest nowadays. CaO yield {{a number of}} surface defects centers and these were important especially for heterogeneous catalyst. In this study, nano structured CaO was synthesized via hydration-dehydration method. The basic strength of the prepared CaO was also studied using simple back titration method {{with respect to the}} activation temperature. This result revealed that, the basic strength increases with the increasing of activation temperature. As the nano structured CaO were prepared, more surface cavity and defect were expected to be present and thus, exposing more O 2 - sites, which influences the basic strength. Finally it was found that nano structured CaO was successfully prepared, while compared to the commercial CaO <b>have</b> a <b>better</b> <b>chemical</b> properties for catalytic chemical reactions...|$|R
40|$|One {{thousand}} and fifty (1, 050) Ross male broilers from 23 to 36 days of age {{were used to}} evaluate the dietary effects of levels of lysine. It was used a random block design with 5 levels of digestible lysine (0. 95; 1. 00; 1. 05; 1. 10 and 1. 15 %). Each level was applied to seven replicates and the experimental unit was composed of 30 birds. Diets were offered in seven replicates and the experimental unit was represented by 30 birds. Weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion, carcass traits, cut yields, composition and deposition of body nutrients were evaluated. The concentration of 1. 09 % of digestible lysine optimized performance without significant effects on feed intake. Carcass traits and cut yields had no significant differences among levels of lysine. On the other hand, there was a quadratic effect on carcass weight, which was the best at the level of 1. 07 % of digestible lysine. On crude protein content of the empty body, the best response was observed at the level of 1. 10 % of dietary lysine. This same level corresponded to a quadratic response in the deposition of water from carcass and empty body. The level of digestible lysine for <b>better</b> performance, <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> and body nutrient deposition in broilers from 23 to 36 days of age is between 1. 07 and 1. 10 %...|$|R
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [41005082, 40505026]; MEL [MELRS 1017]Humic acid-like {{substances}} (HALS) are heterogeneous macromolecules {{having a}} range of physicochemical properties and exhibiting different reactivities in environmental systems. However, to study the HALS that were isolated from atmospheric falling dust is seldom compare to which were extracted from soils and sediments. To <b>better</b> understand the <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> and heterogeneous property of HALS, which were obtained in the present work by multiple extraction of atmospheric falling dust, and their <b>chemical</b> <b>composition</b> was characterized using pyrolytic gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). This quick and effective procedure provides an insight into the structure and source of HALS. The results indicated that polysaccharides, lignin, protein/amino acid and aromatics are the main sources of this macromolecule organic fraction. Higher content of aromatic compounds which reached 67. 42 % suggested that aromatic structure is an important unit for HALS. Lignin-derived aromatic compounds are also major components of pyrolysates, while compounds derived from proteins and carbohydrates at higher concentrations were also detected. Compared with HALS fraction from dust in different sampling sites, {{it was suggested that}} biological emission and anthropogenic activity were the main contributors in suburban area of the university town and anthropogenic pollution was the main sources in urban area of the Wushan. The relative contents of pyrolysates in different seasons at the same sampling site indicated that meteorology is also an important factor to influence composition of HALS...|$|R
