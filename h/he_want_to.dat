He is, of course, {{primarily}} concerned with facts of linguistic usage. However, some argue that Wittgenstein is basically a behaviorist because he considers facts about language use as all there is. Such a claim is controversial, since it is not explicitly endorsed in the Investigations.|$|E
25|$|However, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on {{numerous}} occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2 (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2). According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in {{taking part in the}} film's production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be involved in another Western film.|$|E

500|$|Goffman {{explains}} that the way a conversation is keyed is critical to understanding the intent behind many utterances in everyday speech. Key is probably best understood as {{the tone of the}} dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction. Signaling a change in key is one way that framing often takes place, “special brackets will have to be introduced should <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say something in a relatively serious way: [...] "Kidding aside," [...] "Now, I'm really serious about this," [...] and other such tags become necessary as a means of momentarily down keying the flow of words.” ...|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to start}} of {{production}} on the show, Hillenburg decided early that he wanted SpongeBob SquarePants to be a storyboard-driven show, rather than script-driven. Storyboard-driven is an approach that required artists who could take a skeletal story outline and flesh it out with sight gags, dialogue and a structure that [...] "would {{strike a balance between}} narrative and whimsy." [...] Hillenburg originally wanted [...] "a team of young and hungry people" [...] to work on the show. The group, who worked with Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life before, consisted of Alan Smart, Nick Jennings, and Derek Drymon. Tim Hill was asked about if <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work as story editor, but he was unavailable at the time. The crew got Peter Burns to work as story editor who developed the idea for the episode [...] "Ripped Pants" [...] about SpongeBob ripping his pants.|$|E
500|$|Preferring to {{concentrate}} on broad policy matters and speeches, McGovern was not a master of Senate legislative tactics, and developed a reputation among some other senators for [...] "not doing his homework". Described as [...] "a very private, unchummy guy", {{he was not a}} member of the Senate [...] "club" [...] nor did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be, turning down in 1969 a chance to join the powerful Senate Rules Committee. Relatively few pieces of legislation bore his name, and his legislative accomplishments were generally viewed as modest, although he would try to influence the contents of others' bills. In his political beliefs, McGovern fit squarely within modern American liberalism; through 1967 he had voted in accordance with the rated positions of the ADA 92percent of the time, and when lacking specific knowledge on a particular matter, he would ask his staff, [...] "What are the liberals doing?" ...|$|E

500|$|Cheney has {{publicly}} criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election. On December 29, 2009, {{four days after}} the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized Obama: [...] " [...] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe. [...] Why doesn't <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with {{what seems to be the}} goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society." [...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1998, {{the project}} {{was taken over by}} Franchise Pictures, a {{recently}} established company whose head, Elie Samaha, a former dry cleaning mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine Variety commented that they were [...] "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads". As Samaha put it, [...] "I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, what does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get paid?' … Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.'" [...] He learned of Battlefield Earth from Cassian Elwes, an agent at the theatrical agency William Morris, and approached Travolta. A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20million, lowering the film's cost from the $100million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by using Canadian locations and facilities.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry {{realized}} {{early on}} that a series with the original crew from Star Trek was unlikely to be practical, nor did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> recast the roles or have a [...] "retread" [...] crew– a series of different characters in very similar roles to the original series. He explained, [...] "I would hate to think our imagination is so slender that there aren't other possibilities to think about." [...] The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; [...] "Julien Picard" [...] would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear [...] "foreign" [...] or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought {{that there would be}} a greater number of storylines available if the character was male.|$|E

Nor did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> encourage insurgency among the Mexican people that would weaken his pacification program in progress. He also knew that the deserters were Irish-born Catholics, who had deserted Taylor's army because they allegedly felt mistreated and had witnessed atrocities [...] "sufficient to make Heaven weep" [...] against fellow Catholics, the Mexicans. In response to these, in 1847, Scott ordered that Protestants respect Catholic ceremonies.|$|E
2500|$|Following the elections, {{a wave of}} resignations {{occurred}} in the PSD. Foreign Minister Teodor Meleșcanu also resigned following the diaspora voting fiasco, thus setting a record for the shortest term as minister in Romania's post-Communist history, having served for only eight days. PSD senator Mircea Geoană, who ran unsuccessfully against Traian Băsescu in the 2009 presidential elections, characterized the result as a [...] "dramatic moment for the Romanian Left" [...] and warned that the PSD needs to [...] "reinvent itself".

2500|$|Gibson did {{not want}} to expose his quarterback to further risk of injury, nor did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> risk his players being fined for violating the league's rules against fighting. Most importantly, the last thing he wanted was for his team to get a penalty, which could stop the clock and require getting another first down to secure the win. [...] He also {{personally}} despised the kneeling play, considering it unsporting and somewhat dishonorable (a view popular among a lot of coaches of the period). Also given that the play clock at the time was only 30 seconds (as it would remain through the 1987 season), a play had to be run. So on second down he called [...] "65 Power-Up", a standard play which called for Csonka to take a handoff and run up the middle. Csonka took the ball and ran for 11 yards. For the third play in the Giants' series, the same play was called again.|$|E
2500|$|Berlusconi, due {{to being}} over 70 years of age, {{will not be}} placed direct in prison, but can instead decide if <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> serve his one-year jail term either by a house arrest {{at one of his}} private residences or by doing {{community}} service. As the gross prison term exceeds two years, the Severino law prompts the Italian senate to vote if Berlusconi shall be forced to resign his current senate seat immediately, or alternatively allowing the court imposed ban on holding public office only to take effect {{by the end of his}} current legislative term. The pending senate vote, combined with anger over Berlusconi's conviction – a poll indicated 42% of the public believe he has been unfairly persecuted by the magistrates – present a serious political challenge for the fragile ruling coalition. On 3 August, Berlusconi suggested that unless a [...] "solution" [...] to his predicament could be found, Italy was at [...] "risk of a civil war". The following day, thousands of supporters gathered in front of his house in protest of the ruling.|$|E
2500|$|Developed by Parroty Interactive, the self-professed National Lampoon of the {{interactive}} media industry, Microshaft Winblows 98 became the company's fourth interactive comedy video game, after Pyst, Star Warped, and The X-Fools, which parodied adventure video game Myst, science fiction film series Star Wars, and supernatural television series The X Files, respectively. Ed Bernstein, founder and CEO of Palladium Interactive had long-wanted to create works that emulated the parody found in Mad Magazine, and felt this game {{could be his}} [...] "piece de resistance", further commenting that his company {{would have been able}} to [...] "sell the empty boxes" [...] due to the game cover humour alone. Elizabeth Wasserman of Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News cited various examples of this including the tagline [...] "Who does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> own today?", a parody of Microsoft's own [...] "Where do you want to go to today?", and the version, listed as [...] "98 or 99 or 00 or 01". The game was written by Tony Camin, Ian Deitchman, J. P. Manoux and Kristin Rusk. In addition to containing a series of minigames for the player to explore, the software also offered enhancements to Windows 95, while additional content was available via the game's official website. Microshaft Winblows 98s animation and programming were outsourced to WayForward Technologies while Chronic Music handled the music and sound effects. The product was also released in the French language.|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with Bleeding Cool, Galligan again spoke {{about a third}} film saying that [...] "Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus {{wants to do it}} because he’d like to undo the Gremlins 2 thing as he wasn’t thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to do it I imagine – because he’s Spielberg – and why wouldn’t <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it." [...] He said that Columbus was now in control of the franchise and once confirmed {{that there will be no}} remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that that Columbus [...] "has been aggressively working on a Gremlins 3" [...] and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. Gremlins 3 takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – I guess in the style of a [...] type sequel. One thing we know for sure is they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between Gremlins and Gremlins 2; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was ‘gremlins in Vegas.’ They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I’m working for Donald Trump, our new President! That took six years to happen. Carl Ellsworth has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now." [...] Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.|$|E
