50|$|Bait <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} forage <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used {{particularly}} by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a fisheries term, {{and is used}} in that context. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> small <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> preyed on in the wild by larger predators for food. The predators can <b>be</b> other larger <b>fish,</b> seabirds and marine mammals. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms also overlap {{in the sense that}} most bait <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also forage <b>fish,</b> and most forage <b>fish</b> can also <b>be</b> used as bait fish.|$|R
50|$|Game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> {{pursued by}} {{recreational}} anglers. They can be freshwater or saltwater fish. Game <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> eaten after being caught. Some game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also targeted commercially, particularly salmon.|$|R

50|$|Smoked <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> <b>fish</b> {{that has}} <b>been</b> cured by smoking. Foods have been smoked by humans {{throughout}} history. Originally {{this was done}} as a preservative.

5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
25|$|Forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as bait fish or feeder <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms overlap in the sense that most bait <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also forage <b>fish,</b> and vice versa. Feeder <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage fish, small <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums.|$|R
5000|$|The jellynose fishes or tadpole <b>fishes</b> <b>are</b> {{the small}} order Ateleopodiformes. This group of ray-finned <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> monotypic, {{containing}} a single family Ateleopodidae.

50|$|Oily <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} white fish, which contain oil {{only in the}} liver, and much less overall than oily fish. Examples of white <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> cod, haddock and flatfish.

50|$|Cironka (Циронка) is a {{traditional}} Macedonian dish. It originates from Prespa region. This dish is made from common bleak. The fresh <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> salted {{with a lot of}} salt until they become whitish. Then, the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> left in a bowl for six to seven days. The bowl must be covered and except the fish, we can put some nettle. After that, the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> threaded and they're left to dry on sunny weather, until they get hard. Then the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> fried on both sides, and placed in hot water to become less salty. The <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> served with some peppermint, oil, vinegar and garlic.|$|R
50|$|These <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> often migratory forage fish, which feed on plankton, and {{the larger}} fish that follow and feed on the forage fish.
