40|$|Performance of {{recommender}} systems {{depends on}} whether the user profiles contain accurate information about the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the <b>users,</b> and this ill turn relies on whether enough information about their interests can be collected. Collaborative tagging systems allow users {{to use their own}} words to describe their favourite resources, resulting in some user-generated categorisation schemes commonly known as folksonomies. Folksonomics thus contain rich information about the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the <b>users,</b> which can be used to support various recommender systems. Our analysis of the folksonomy in Delicious reveals that the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>user</b> can be very diverse. Traditional methods for representing <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> are usually not able to reflect Such diversity.

40|$|Abstract—The {{capacity}} of rapidly disseminating {{information such as}} latest news headlines has made online social networks a popular and disruptive venue for spreading influence and distributing contents. Given the importance of online social networks, it becomes increasingly imperative to understand the shared <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> on the popular information or contents that circulate through these networks. This paper proposes a novel graphical approach based on bipartite graphs and one-mode projection graphs to model the interactions <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and information and to capture the shared <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> on the information. The experiments based on data-sets collected from Digg, a popular social news aggregation site, have demonstrated the proposed approach is able to discover inherent clusters <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and information within online social networks. The evaluation results also show that these clusters exhibit distinct characteristics. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to apply bipartite graphs and one-mode projections to shed light on the interactions of people and information in online social networks and to discover the clustered nature <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and contents.

Unlike previous works [1][4] this work provides an efficient technique to recommend product to the users {{with respect to}} the interest which changes dynamically. A method to classify users based on age groups is proposed to overcome the problem of cold start. Identifying the <b>users</b> <b>of</b> similar <b>interest</b> and providing recommendation based on the <b>user</b> contents <b>of</b> other <b>users</b> is proposed to enhance the recommendations techniques provided in existing work. To enhance e-marketing in the field of e-commerce a novel method of promoting new products to the users is proposed with periodically automated e-mail notifications which is purely based on recommendations provided in user’s page. This method gives an efficient technique of providing recommendations by considering the multiple phases <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and thereby providing recommendation dynamically. This enables to achieve efficient recommendation with accurate prediction <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> Keywords- feature extraction, time series analysis, collaborative filtering, personalized recommendation, adaptive weighting, ratings.

To alleviate this burden, intelligent tools can do much of the drudge-work of looking ahead, searching and performing a preliminary evaluation of the end pages on the user’s behalf, providing the user with more information with which to make fewer, more informed decisions. In order to accomplish this task, however, the tools need some form of representation <b>of</b> the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the <b>user.</b> This paper describes the SWAMI system; SWAMI stands for “Searching the Web with Agents having Mobility and Intelligence”.
