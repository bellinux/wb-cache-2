The present study was done to recognize {{the quality and quantity}} of the different generated wastes at various parts of the Faculty of Dentistry-Babol University of Medical Sciences. Methods: The whole solid wastes generated in the odd and even days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) of the middle of the week from the second month of each season were examined. Various dental solid wastes including general, infectious and <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>wastes</b> were weighted by typical scale. Results: The generation rate of the solid wastes were: total dental wastes: 291. 2 kg including general solid wastes: 251. 3 kg (% 86. 3), infectious wastes and sharps: 38 kg (% 13) and <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> waste: 2 kg (% 0. 7).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a community health survey of people living near a <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>waste</b> site in Kingston, Queensland. In comparison with a matched control group, people near the site were no more likely to report serious diseases, and reports of cancer and mortality rates did not differ in the two groups. Kingston residents reported higher rates of symptoms of general poor health, high levels of stress and anxiety and a higher incidence of miscarriages. The reports of poor physical health appear to be independent of proximity to the hazardous waste site and duration of residence in the area. Symptom prevalence and perceived recent decline in health correlate most strongly with the stress and anxiety measures. While long-term investigation is necesssary, it appears at this stage that the chemical waste is not associated with an increase in major diseases as reported by those who were interviewed.

40|$|The University of Georgia {{recognizes that}} {{laboratory}} waste may have {{adverse effects on}} the environment. A university-wide program has been directed at reducing the improper storage and disposal of toxic chemical wastes. The program extensively utilizes the Code of Federal Regulations 49, Transportation Parts 100 and 199. This code serves {{as a guide for}} the packaging and disposal, in an approved commercial burial site, of the waste chemicals generated at the university. The chemical waste program at the University of Georgia is effective, relatively inexpensive, and requires minimal manpower. The need for adequate and appropriate hazardous waste disposal is demonstrated by the fact that probably only 10 % of waste material considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic) is disposed of {{in a manner consistent with}} proposed federal regulations (7). By varying estimates, there are from 800 (8) to 34, 000 (7) potentially harmful disposal sites in the United States.

40|$|Binary oxides {{constitute}} an outstanding class of functional materials with potential applications in many {{fields such as}} catalysis, gas sensing, field emission, solar cells, photodetection, etc. Due to the difference in their physical/chemical properties, different oxides have been explored for different applications. For examples, SnO 2, Cr 2 O 3 and ZnO are being explored for gas sensing due to their high adsorption capacity for volatile gases, ZnO, Cu 2 O etc. are being explored in solar cells because of high adsorption coefficient in UV/visible region and so on. Various techniques are available for synthesis of binary oxides and tuning their properties. Most of the physical or chemical synthesis techniques are expensive, need high cost instruments and produces <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>waste.</b> We need a simple, cost effective and ecofriendly techniques for the synthesis of binary oxides. In present work, a simple and facile thermal oxidation strategy has been employed for the synthesis of various binary oxides (Cu 2 O, GeO 2 and ZnO). For example, CuO nanorods are obtained when Cu is heated around ~ 500 oC, which then heated in Ar atmosphere to obtain a film of porous Cu 2 O. Similarly, GeO 2 with different morphologies and green-luminescent ZnO are obtained by controlling the reaction parameters. These oxides have then been explored for various applications including white light phosphors, catalysis for the degradation of dyes and non-contact thermometry.

40|$|An {{important}} step {{of a new}} process being developed for the beneficiation of the mineral zircon (Zr(Hf) SiO 4) to produce nuclear grade zirconium (Zr) metal, is {{the separation of the}} Zr from the hafnium (Hf). Zr ores typically contain between 1 and 3 % Hf, whereas the use of Zr metal in the nuclear industry requires a Hf content < 100 ppm, owing to its relatively high neutron-capture cross section. The separation step is therefore key in the preparation of nuclear grade Zr, which is considered to be very difficult due to the various similarities in their chemical properties. The preparation of hafnium free zirconium relies on traditional wet separation systems, for example solvent extraction systems. In contrast to the traditional aqueous chloride systems, Necsa focusses on dry fluoride-based processes. Dry processes have the advantage of producing much less <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>waste.</b> In the work reported here, separation is achieved by sublimation/de-sublimation in the tetrafluoride form. The tetrafluoride is prepared by fluorination of plasma dissociated zircon (PDZ or Zr(Hf) O 2 ∙SiO 2) with ammonium bifluoride (ABF). The separation involves the selective sublimation of the two tetrafluorides in an inert atmosphere under controlled conditions, and subsequent similarly selective desublimation. An accurate estimation of the sublimation rates of both the zirconium tetrafluoride (ZrF 4) and hafnium tetrafluoride (HfF 4) as a function of temperature is required since this forms the basis of the development of a sublimation model to determine whether the concept under consideration is theoretically possible. The sublimation kinetics of ZrF 4 is reported in this paper. [URL]...|$|E

The CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH {{concentrations in the}} liquid {{as a function of}} the residence times were determined by a Raman spectrometer. The [CH 3 OH] and [C 2 H 5 OH] resp. decay followed first order kinetics and a rate con-stant k 1 (653 K) = 1. 3 × 10 − 2 s− 1 for CH 3 OH and k 2 (653 K) = 5. 5 × 10 − 2 s− 1 for C 2 H 5 OH was determined. The rate constant k 1 was found to be independent of the initial CH 3 OH concentration in the mass fraction range 0. 002 ≤ xm ≤ 0. 04. The rate depended on the history of the reactor. Treatment with NH 4 OH, C 2 H 5 OH or with H 2 O 2 at T = 653 K, did not change the rate. Treatment with HNO 3 /H 2 O 2, however, at T = 838 K reduced the rate by about a factor of 1000. The Arrhenius-activation energy over the above temperature range was determined to be EA = 164 kJ/mol for methanol and EA = 145 kJ/mol for ethanol. The major products from methanol decomposition were CH 4, H 2, and CO 2 as ob-served by gas chromatography and CH 4 and CO 2 by FTIR-spectrometry. No other products were found.
