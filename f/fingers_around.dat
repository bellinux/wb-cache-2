500|$|Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture {{wrote that}} [...] "the song veers toward Stefani's more mellifluous, sentimental fare," [...] {{calling it a}} [...] "heartrending track". Amanda Dykan of AltWire praised the track, stating: [...] " [...] reaches through, wraps its acrylic-nailed <b>fingers</b> <b>around</b> your {{pulsating}} heart, rips it from your chest, throws it on the floor, and stomps all over it." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media claimed that [...] "Stefani – now 20 years wiser – flips it"; she continued with: [...] "It’s a rare moment on the album where you can pick out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers." [...] Mapes concluded by claiming that [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was her greatest song since [...] "Don't Speak", comparing its effect to Madonna's 1989 single [...] "Like a Prayer". Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture warned that when listening to this [...] "heartending track" [...] that [...] "tissues are a must". Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel enjoyed the track, calling it a [...] "recognizable moment in heartbreak delivered in a charming falsetto burble". Nate Jackson from OC Weekly appreciated the [...] "somber" [...] of the track, while Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, claiming that [...] "every lyric and every note are sung with heart and chorus just gets you". Michael Smith from the same website acknowledged [...] "Used to Love You" [...] {{as one of the}} strongest songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like, calling it [...] "unexpectedly heartfelt".|$|E

[...] "I just {{picked it up and}} started moving my <b>fingers</b> <b>around</b> until the chords sounded right, which is the same way I work on compositions when the guitar's in different tunings." [...] It is also one of Page's favourite songs on Led Zeppelin III.|$|E

5000|$|While at St. John's, Jackson had {{the unusual}} habit {{while at the}} free-throw line of {{extending}} his hand and [...] "cupping" [...] his thumb and index <b>finger</b> <b>around</b> the rim.

60|$|And now, behold a wonder. For the emperor, in the fervour of {{his heart}} and of the memory of what had passed between them, called to mind that Orlando had promised to give him his sword, should he die before him; and he lifted up his voice more bravely, and adjured him even now to return it to him gladly; and it pleased God that the dead body of Orlando should rise on its feet, and kneel as he was wont {{to do at the}} feet of his liege lord, and gladly, and with a smile on its face, return the sword to the Emperor Charles. As Orlando rose, the Paladins and Turpin knelt down out of fear and horror, {{especially}} seeing him look with a stern countenance; but when they saw that he knelt also, and smiled, and returned the sword, their hearts became re-assured, and Charles took the sword like his liege lord, though trembling with wonder and affection: and in truth he could hardly clench his <b>fingers</b> <b>around</b> it.|$|E

60|$|It {{was not far}} to {{the scene}} of the obstruction, yet but for Tarbox's timely hint, the little trail up the {{mountain}} side would have escaped his observation. Ascending, he soon found himself creeping along a narrow ledge of rock, hidden from the road that ran fifty yards below by a thick network growth of thorn and bramble, which still enabled him to see its whole parallel length. Perilous in the extreme to any hesitating foot, at one point, directly above the obstruction, the ledge itself was missing--broken away by the fall of the tree from the forest crest higher up. For an instant Brice stood dizzy and irresolute before the gap. Looking down for a foothold, his eye caught the faint imprint of a woman's shoe on a clayey rock projecting midway of the chasm. It must have been the young girl's footprint made that morning, for the narrow toe was pointed in the direction she would go! Where SHE could pass should he shrink from going? Without further hesitation he twined his <b>fingers</b> <b>around</b> the roots above him, and half swung, half pulled himself along until he once more felt the ledge below him.|$|E
60|$|The {{particular}} point to which I wish {{to draw attention}} here, however, is this: that even the very simplest and most primitive animals do discriminate somehow between what is eatable and what isn't. The amoeba has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, no tongue, no nerves of taste, no special means of discrimination of any kind; and yet, {{so long as it}} meets only grains of sand or bits of shell, it makes no effort in any way to swallow them; but, the moment it comes across a bit of material fit for its food, it begins at once to spread its clammy <b>fingers</b> <b>around</b> the nutritious morsel. The fact is, every part of the amoeba's body apparently possesses, in a very vague form, the first beginnings of those senses which in us are specialised and confined to a single spot. And it is because of the light which the amoeba thus incidentally casts upon the nature of the specialised senses in higher animals that I have ventured once more to drag out of the private life of his native pond that already too notorious and obtrusive rhizopod.|$|E

[...] He stopped, evidently at some sign from her guest. The rest of the man's speech followed in a hurried whisper, which was stopped again by the voice she knew. [...] "No. Certainly not." [...] The next moment his tall figure was darkening the door of the kitchen; his hand was outstretched. [...] "Good-by, Mrs. Bunker, and many thanks for your hospitality. My friends here," [...] he turned grimly to the men behind him, [...] "think I ought to ask you to keep this a secret even from your husband. I DON'T! They also think that I ought to offer you money for your kindness. I DON'T! But if you will honor me by keeping this ring in remembrance of it"--he took a heavy seal ring from his finger--"it's the only bit of jewelry I have about me--I'll be very glad. Good-by!" [...] She felt for a moment the firm, soft pressure of his long, thin <b>fingers</b> <b>around</b> her own, and then--he was gone. The sound of retreating oars grew fainter and fainter and was lost.
