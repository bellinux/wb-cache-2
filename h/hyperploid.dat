Only once these barriers to oncogenesis have been overcome can malignant growth proceed unrestrained. Tetraploidization {{can contribute to}} oncogenesis because <b>hyperploid</b> cells are genomically unstable. We report that <b>hyperploid</b> cancer cells become immunogenic because of a constitutive endoplasmic reticulum stress response resulting in the aberrant cell surface exposure of calreticulin. <b>Hyperploid,</b> calreticulin-exposing cancer cells readily proliferated in immunodeficient mice and conserved their increased DNA content. In contrast, <b>hyperploid</b> cells injected into immunocompetent mice generated tumors only after a delay, and such tumors exhibited reduced DNA content, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and calreticulin exposure. Our results unveil an immunosurveillance system that imposes immunoselection against hyperploidy in carcinogen- and oncogene-induced cancers...|$|E

The possible age-related increase in aneuploidy frequencies was assessed. Ten thousand spermatozoa were scored per individual for the presence of <b>hyperploid,</b> i. e., disomic and diploid, cells. The overall hybridization efficiency was 98. 8 %. The frequency of spermatozoa with two chromosome 1 signals was 11. 5 +/- 5. 2 / 10, 000. The frequency of spermatozoa with two chromosome 7 signals was 6. 4 +/- 3. 9 / 10, 000. Diploidy was present in 15. 0 +/- 8. 9 / 10, 000 spermatozoa. Interindividual variation was quite large. No statistically significant correlation between age of the donors (range = 20 - 46 years) and the frequency of <b>hyperploid</b> spermatozoa was observed. The results give background information on the incidence of <b>hyperploid</b> spermatozoa in unexposed men and encourage the use of this novel technique of future studies on genetic effects in men exposed to potentially aneuploidogenic agents...|$|E
40|$|Background. Megakaryocyte (Mk) nuclear DNA {{content was}} {{measured}} by image analysis using new S-Form software. Feulgen-stained bone marrow aspirates from 11 patients with reactive thrombocytosis and 12 patients with clonal thrombocytosis of chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) were analysed. Ploidy of 100 Mk was calculated for each patient and the fractions of <b>hyperploid</b> cells were compared. The presence of more than 5 % of Mk with nuclear ploidy > 96 N or ≥ 2 % of Mk with nuclear ploidy > 128 N in patients with thrombocytosis strongly suggests CMPD. On the other hand, the absence of <b>hyperploid</b> cells > 128 N or {{the presence of a}} small fraction (less than 5 %) of moderately <b>hyperploid</b> cells (96 – 128 N) indicates reactive thrombocytosis. Image cytometry analysis therefore appears to add valuable information to conventional cytological examination in the diagnostic assesment of thrombocytosis. Conclusions. S-Form software image analysis is much faster and more reliable than microdensitometric DNA analysis, which we previously used for cytometric studies. We believe the method of image DNA analysis has the potential for widespread clinical use in the differential diagnosis of megakaryocyte disorders. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} chiefly with {{the behavior of a}} duplicating chromosome derived from the undescribed scute allelomorph known as scute- 10 - 2. This allelomorph, obtained by x-raying scute- 10, is associated with a reciprocal 1 - 4 translocation. The X-chromosome is broken near its left end, between the loci of silver and broad, and the short terminal piece (loci from yellow to silver) is exchanged for a section of the fourth chromosome that includes all the known loci of that chromosome (with the possible exception of cubitus-interruptus, which is difficult to test, since this translocation shows the position effect recently described by Dubinin and Sidoroff(1)). The small chromosome, made up of the left end of X attached to the spindle-fibre region of 4, may be obtained in individuals (of either sex) that are otherwise normal diploids. (2) If the normal X's of such <b>hyperploids</b> carry the recessive gene for yellow, the flies are wild-type in appearance {{because of the presence of}} +y in the duplicating chromosome.

40|$|Techniques {{have been}} {{developed}} for manipulating pericentric inversions in Drosophila that are based on the lethality of grossly aneuploid zygotes and the existence of recombinationally interconvertible genotypes for any heterozygous inversion complex: males of some of these genotypes will produce only aneuploid sperm, which can be used to rescue complementary aneuploid ova and selectively recover recombinational derivatives of inversions. Markers can be recombined into inversions through a sequence of selected single exchanges, and a novel type of duplication can be synthesized from overlapping inversions that has the characteristics of both insertional and tandem duplications; there are also applications to half-tetrad analyses. ——Two cytogenetic screens are developed: (1) the dominant lethality of a large insertional-tandem duplication can be reverted by deletional events that give rise to net deficiencies or duplications, and (2) deficiencies and tandem duplications in proximal regions can be selectively recovered as the results of unequal exchanges within an inversion loop. Recombinants have been recovered between breakpoints separated by distances of as little as fifty bands, arguing against the existence of some small number of sites necessary for the initiation of recombinational pairing. In several instances, <b>hyperploids</b> for four to six numbered divisions were observed to be fertile in both sexes...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} the transcription and replication patterns have been examined in different segments of the X chromosome and in certain specific segments (88 B— 92 A) of an autosomal segmental <b>hyperploid</b> in which an extra segment 88 B- 92 A (3 R) is translocated to the X chromosome {{in addition to the}} normal two doses. Transcriptive activity monitored by [3 H]uridine-labelling of these autosomal hyperploids reveals an enhanced hyperactivity of the male X chromosome while the female X chromosomes show no change in their activity. [3 H]thymidine autoradiograms reveal that while the labelling frequencies of most replicating sites are distinctly lowered in the autosomal <b>hyperploid</b> males, no change within sexes is resolvable with regard to labelling-intensity profile. Furthermore, the X-autosome labelling frequency relation shows a distinct deviation from linearity, suggesting multiple events that lead to a higher template form of the X chromosome. These findings lead us to suggest that the signals emanating from auto-some(s) do not interfere with the primary modulation inherent in the X chromosome, but act on a modulated organization of the same at a second step evoking higher activity in the male X chromosome. The results further reveal that the gene activity of the X chromosome remains unaffected by the pattern of pairing of the autosomal segments...|$|E

Maize B–A–A translocations contain segments of two nonhomologous essential A chromosomes in tandem arrangement attached to {{a segment of the}} long arm of a supernumerary B chromosome. By utilizing the frequent nondisjunction of the B centromere at the second pollen mitosis we produced plants containing an extra copy of the two A chromosome segments. We compared these <b>hyperploid</b> plants with nonhyperploid plants by measuring leaf width, plant height, ear height, internode length, stalk circumference, leaf length, and tassel-branch number in 20 paired families that involved one of the chromosome arms 1 S, 1 L, 4 L, 5 S, and 10 L. One or more of the seven measured traits displayed dosage sensitivity among 17 of the 20 B–A–A translocations, which included the involvement of chromosome arms 2 L, 3 L, 5 L, 6 L, and 7 L. The most obvious effect of an increased dosage of the B–A–A translocation was a significant decrease in the traits in the <b>hyperploid</b> plants. These effects may be either the additive effects of hyperploidy for the two chromosome segments or a result of gene interaction between them...|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Lewy body {{diseases}} (LBD) are the {{two most}} common age-related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neuronal loss and abnormal protein aggregations (Aβ and phosphorylated tau in AD, and α-synuclein in LBD). Ageing is the single most common risk factor for both AD and LBD, and neuronal senescence may therefore be a potential underlying factor for these diseases. Whether neuronal senescence increases with age or age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and whether it is related to the cell loss and protein deposition observed remains to be determined. Following institutional approvals, formalin fixed brain tissue samples were acquired from the New South Wales Brain Banks for 35 elderly controls, 10 AD, 17 LBD and 6 multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases. Depending on the study, dissociated nuclei from the hippocampal CA 1 region, the anterior cingulate cortex, the substantia nigra and/or the pontine base were assessed using flow cytometry for cell number (validated using optical methods) and average DNA content, and immunohistochemistry for the severity of protein deposition and the expression of the cell senescence marker, nuclear P 16 INK 4 a. Initial assessment of aneuploidy revealed no significant increase during normal brain ageing, no increase in the α-synucleinopathy MSA, but significantly more <b>hyperploid</b> neurons in AD and LBD. The increase in <b>hyperploid</b> neurons occurred prior to significant neuronal loss in cortical regions, relating most to AD type protein depositions, but also independently to substantia nigra cell loss. These relationships were confirmed by assessing the nuclear expression of cell cycle repressor P 16 INK 4 a which was decreased in both tangle-bearing neurons and tangle-free neurons, and negatively associated with the increase in aneuploidy. Importantly, the reduction in nuclear P 16 INK 4 a occurred in controls with high tau burden, showing that the loss of nuclear P 16 INK 4 a occurs prior to the induction of aneuploidy. Overall the data suggest that reduced nuclear expression of P 16 INK 4 a predisposes neurons to aneuploidy and neurodegeneration. Further identification of the mechanisms involved are required, and the early events precipitating a reduction in nuclear P 16 INK 4 a need to be determined...|$|E

40|$|In their {{extensive}} {{analysis of}} the effects of segmental aneuploidy on development to the adult stage, Lindsley and Sandler et al. (1972) identified salivary chromosome region 83 D-E as apparently uniquely dose-sensitive. Neither the hypoploid nor <b>hyperploid</b> classes appeared to survive to the adult stage, although segmental hyperploidy of all other regions of the genome is compatible with normal or quasi-normal development. In the present investigation, this genetic behavior is shown to be a concomitant of region 83 D-E itself, and independent of the particular Y-autosome translocations utilized to generate aneuploid classes. Newly induced chromosomal duplications including 83 D-E are recovered by their ability to complement the corresponding deficiency; these aberrations indicate that the phenomenon depends on genetic dosage per se and is independent of linkage relationships. Further tests involving the generation of large numbers of aneuploid zygotes support the conclusion that these individuals very rarely and possibly never survive to the adult stage. Finally, crosses yielding hypertriploid females and intersexes indicate that these aneuploids often survive and, in the former case, are fertile. No viable hypotriploid female or intersex was recovered...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of aneuploidy {{by physical}} and chemical agents using different test systems was evaluated. The effect of X-rays, caffeine, acetaldehyde, ethanol, diethylstilbestrol, propionaldehyde, and chloral hydrate was studied by chromosome counting in Chinese hamster embryonic diploid cells. Aneugenic ability of cadmium chloride, cadmium sulfate, potassium dichromate, chromium chloride, nickel chloride, and nickel sulfate was assessed by means of anaphase-telophase analysis in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Chromosome counting in human fibroblasts (MRC- 5 cell line) was employed to evaluate the effect of cacodilic acid, cadmium chloride, cadmium sulfate, and potassium dichromate. Finally, the induction of kinetochore-positive and kinetochore negative micronuclei by cadmium chloride, cadmium sulfate, potassium dichromate, chromium chloride, and nickel chloride was studied using CREST antibodies. When the effect of different agents was determined by chromosome counting, an increase of hypoploid but not of <b>hyperploid</b> cells was observed. Anaphase-telophase analysis showed that metal salts increased the frequency of lagging chromosomes. This finding has been confirmed by the increment of kinetochore-positive micronuclei using CREST antibodies. Therefore, chromosome loss could be considered as {{the main cause of}} induced aneuploidy...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{hypoploid}} {{for specific}} segments {{of each of}} the maize (Zea mays L.) chromosomes were generated using 24 different B-A translocations. Plants carrying each of the B-A translocations were crossed as male parents to inbreds, and sibling progeny hypoploid or not hypoploid for specific chromosomal segments were recovered. Genomic DNAs from the parents, hypoploid progeny, and nonhypoploid (euploid or <b>hyperploid)</b> progeny for each of these B-A translocations were digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoresed in agarose gels, blotted onto reusable nylon membranes, and probed with nick-translated, cloned DNA fragments which had been mapped previously by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to the chromosome involved in the B-A translocation. The chromosomal segment on our RFLP map which was uncovered by each of the - B-A translocations was determined. This work unequivocally identified the short and long arms of each chromosome on this map, and it also identified the region on each chromosome which contains the centromere. Because the breakpoints of the B-A translocations were previously known on the cytological and the conventional genetic maps, this study also allowed this RFLP map to be more highly correlated with these maps...|$|E
40|$|Honey {{has long}} been used in {{medicine}} for different purposes. Only recently, however, its antioxidant property and preventive effects against different diseases, such as cancer, have been highlighted. Chrysin (5, 7 -dihydroxyflavone) is a natural flavone commonly found in acacia honey. It has previously {{been shown to be}} an anti-tumor agent. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative role of honey or chrysin on human (A 375) and murine (B 16 -F 1) melanoma cell lines. The results of the 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the trypan blue exclusion test showed that both the tested compounds were able to induce an antiproliferative effect on melanoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that cytotoxicity induced by honey or chrysin was mediated by G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest and induction of <b>hyperploid</b> progression. Our results suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of honey are due mainly to the presence of chrysin. Chrysin may therefore be considered a potential candidate for both cancer prevention and treatment. Further investigation is needed to validate the contribution of chrysin in tumor therapy in vivo.

40|$|The alcohol dehydrogenase- 1 (Adh) locus in maize {{has been}} {{positioned}} relative to thirteen reciprocal translocations that have breakpoints {{in the long}} arm of chromosome 1 (1 L). The methods of Gopinath and Burnham (1956) to produce interstitial segmental trisomy with overlapping translocations and of Rakha and Robertson (1970) to produce compound B-A translocations were coupled with the co-dominant nature of the ADH isozymes to allow the cytological placement. The results of several crosses are consistent with Adh being {{in the region of}} 0. 80 – 0. 90 of 1 L. ——The duplication that results from the overlap of translocations 1 – 3 (5267) and 1 – 3 (5242) and that includes Adh was studied with respect to meiotic segregation and pollen transmission. When heterozygous with normal chromosomes, a low level of recombination within the duplicated regions is detectable and the duplication and normals are recovered with equal frequencies through the female. In the pollen, the <b>hyperploid</b> grains cannot compete equally with the euploids in achieving fertilization. ——The use of co-dominant heteromultimeric isozymes as genetic markers {{for the development of a}} series of interstitial segmental trisomics in maize is discussed...|$|E
