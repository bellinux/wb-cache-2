Casual viewers will most likely glean {{the same sense of}} the superstar's life as one might from a magazine feature. But for serious fans of the fiercely private superstar, this remains a window into her life." [...] The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney said, [...] "this is less a documentary portrait than a micromanaged video diary exploring the R superstar's relationship with her laptop. The HBO film will be candy to her fan base; just don't expect startling insights into the woman behind the talent." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote that Life Is But a Dream [...] "is a carefully filtered snapshot of an artist who has enough power to become maker of her own myth." [...] Writing for Zap2it, Geoff Berkshire called it a [...] "vanity project and calculated act of <b>image</b> <b>control.</b> The only thing revealed by the film -- co-directed, co-written and co-executive produced by Beyoncé herself -- is a narcissistic inability to give up that desire for control." [...] Television critic Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times gave a negative review for the film, writing, [...] " [...] is as contrived as , but probably for good reason it is neither daring nor entirely truthful. It's an infomercial, not just about Beyoncé's talent onstage but her authenticity behind the scenes. She is a people-pleasing diva and she wants to keep it that way." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{two approaches}} {{used to control}} a 2 -axis servomechanism by gesture recognition. For both approaches, the adopted control philosophy was: In the system’s learning phase, the <b>control</b> <b>images</b> are acquired by a generic webcam and associated to the desired orders. On the other hand, in the working phase, each <b>control</b> <b>image</b> is acquired, by the same webcam and, by comparison with the stored orders images, the desired order is recognized and processed by the servomechanism in quasi real time. In this paper, the used servomechanism and both implemented approaches are described, and are indicated some advantages and weakness of each one. Two examples of <b>images</b> <b>control</b> sets are also presented, and some conclusions and future works are addressed...|$|R

Both algorithms involve a blurring preprocessing and a biased binarization.
