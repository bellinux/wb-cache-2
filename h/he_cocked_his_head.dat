6000|$|Once more {{he spread}} his black wings and flew down to the egg. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{to one side and}} looked at it. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to the other side and looked at it. He walked all around it, chuckling and saying to himself, [...] "Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty and all mine, mine, mine, mine! Pretty, pretty, and all mine!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and eyed me aslant, the {{suspicion}} {{in his eyes}} confirming {{the existence of the}} mystery I scented.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought and}} he thought {{and he thought}} and he thought, and little by little a plan worked out in his little black head. Then he chuckled. He chuckled right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so he chuckled again. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|Ovid's eyes {{followed}} her compassionately. [...] "Poor wretch!" [...] he thought. [...] "What an infernal temper, {{and how hard}} she tries to control it!" [...] He joined Carmina, with a new delight in being near her again. Zo was still in ecstasies over the Piping Crow. [...] "Oh, the jolly little chap! Look how <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head!</b> <b>He</b> mocks me when I whistle. Buy him," [...] cried Zo, tugging at Ovid's coat tails in the excitement that possessed her; [...] "buy him, and let me take him home with me!" ...|$|R
5000|$|A. O. Scott, in {{his review}} for The New York Times, had {{problems}} with Phoenix's performance: [...] "Even though his singing voice doesn't match the original - how could it? - he is most convincing in concert, when his shoulders tighten and <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side. Otherwise, he seems stuck {{in the kind of}} off-the-rack psychological straitjacket in which Hollywood likes to confine troubled geniuses". In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "A lot of credit for Phoenix's performance has to go to Mangold, who has always been good at finding the bleak melodrama in taciturn souls ... If Mangold's new movie has a problem, it's that he and co-screenwriter Gill Dennis sometimes walk the lines of the inspirational biography too rigorously".|$|R
60|$|Then Wang heard, {{much more}} faint, a voice {{he had never}} heard before--a novel {{impression}} which <b>he</b> acknowledged by <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly to one side.|$|R
60|$|To {{this the}} Beggar listened with his {{knuckles}} resting against his hips, and when Robin had ended <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{on one side}} and thrust his tongue into his cheek.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and looked}} at it with his right eye. Then he hopped round to the other side, {{and looked at}} it with his left eye. With either optic it seemed equally desirable.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and purred, [...] "Well, I {{guess if}} I cashed in on all my {{securities}} and farm-holdings and my interests in iron on the Mesaba and in Northern timber and cut-over lands, I could push two million dollars pretty close, and I've made every cent {{of it by}} hard work and having the sense to not go out and spend every----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had one {{objection}} to Moosu," [...] <b>he</b> began, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> meditatively--"one objection, and only one. He was an Indian from {{over on the}} edge of the Chippewyan country, but the trouble was, he'd picked up a smattering of the Scriptures. Been campmate a season with a renegade French Canadian who'd studied for the church. Moosu'd never seen applied Christianity, and <b>his</b> <b>head</b> was crammed with miracles, battles, and dispensations, and what not he didn't understand. Otherwise he was a good sort, and a handy man on trail or over a fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What did {{you have}} to do with it?' <b>he</b> asked, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in what I always thought a most impudent manner. Do you know, he puts on more airs and graces than a peacock, simply because he's the only bird that has a red vest to go with a brown coat? Of course I told him the whole story, though there wasn't any need for me to say that I'd been frightened nearly out of my wits, and before I'd {{finished}} Mr. Crow called the meeting to order.|$|R
6000|$|And he did. He arose a victor. There was no uneasiness, {{but rather}} {{all the social}} polish of Mrs. Arty's at its best, in his manner, as he crossed to Mrs. Ebbitt's chair and asked: [...] "How is Mr. Ebbitt to-night? Pretty rheumatic?" [...] Miss Proudfoot offered him a lime tablet, and he {{accepted}} it judicially. [...] "I believe these tablets are just {{about as good as}} Park & Tilford's," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Say, Dunk, I'll match you to see who rushes a growler of beer. Tom'll be here pretty soon--store ought to be closed by now. We'll have some ready for him." ...|$|R
60|$|When his {{companion}} had disappeared the major proceeded {{to lay out}} all his notes upon the table, overlapping each other, but still so arranged that every separate one was visible. He then built in the centre ten little golden columns in a circle, each consisting of ten sovereigns, until the whole presented {{the appearance of a}} metallic Stonehenge upon a plain of bank notes. This done, <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side, like a fat and very ruddy turkey, and contemplated his little arrangement with much pride and satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|Alvina went downstairs. Mr. May was {{listening}} to Max, who was telling in German all about the White Prisoner scene. Mr. May had spent his boyhood in a German school. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side, and, laying his hand on Max's arm, entertained him in odd German. The others were silent. Ciccio made no pretence of listening, but smoked and stared at his own feet. Louis and Geoffrey half understood, so Louis nodded {{with a look of}} deep comprehension, whilst Geoffrey uttered short, snappy [...] "Ja!--Ja!--Doch!--Eben!" [...] rather irrelevant.|$|E
60|$|In {{his small}} cage of {{darkness}} Lawford shuddered {{and raised a}} furtive head. He stood up and peered eagerly and strangely from side to side. He stayed quite still, listening as raptly as some wandering night-beast to the indiscriminate stir and echoings of the darkness. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> above his shoulder and listened again, then turned upon the soundless grass towards the hill. He felt not the faintest astonishment or strangeness in his solitude here; only a little chilled, and physically uneasy; and yet in this vast darkness a faint spiritual exaltation seemed to hover.|$|E
6000|$|He was basking {{at the top}} of {{the water}} one hot day in July, {{catching}} duns and feeding the trout, when he saw a new sort, a dark gray little fellow with a brown head. He was a very little fellow indeed: but he made the most of himself, as people ought to do. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> up <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up <b>his</b> wings, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up <b>his</b> tail, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up the two whisks at his tail-end, and, in short, he looked the cockiest little man of all little men. And so he proved to be; for instead of getting away, he hopped upon Tom's finger, and sat there as bold as nine tailors; and he cried out in the tiniest, shrillest, squeakiest little voice you ever heard, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Constable," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> hat to {{one side}} the better to scratch <b>his</b> bald <b>head,</b> [...] "there are strange people in this region." ...|$|R
60|$|With this hurried adjuration, <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> blunderbuss, {{and stood}} on the offensive.|$|R
60|$|It {{was only}} half rock he held in his hand. The other half was virgin gold. He dropped it into his pan and {{examined}} another piece. Little yellow was to be seen, but with his strong fingers he crumbled the rotten quartz away till both hands were filled with glowing yellow. He rubbed the dirt away from fragment after fragment, tossing them into the gold-pan. It was a treasure-hole. So much had the quartz rotted away that there was less of it than there was of gold. Now and again he found a piece to which no rock clung--a piece that was all gold. A chunk, where the pick had laid open {{the heart of the}} gold, glittered like a handful of yellow jewels, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at it and slowly turned it around and over to observe the rich play of the light upon it.|$|E
60|$|The {{scheme to}} be put before them was really Peter's, but Solomon {{did most of the}} talking, because he soon became {{irritable}} if other people talked. He began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nest-building, and this put them into good-humour at once, as it was meant to do; for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests. Other birds, said Solomon, omitted to line their nests with mud, and as a result they did not hold water. Here <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> as if he had used an unanswerable argument; but, unfortunately, a Mrs. Finch had come to the meeting uninvited, and she squeaked out, 'We don't build nests to hold water, but to hold eggs,' and then the thrushes stopped cheering, and Solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water.|$|E
60|$|Wang {{immediately}} {{appeared in}} front, and, squatting on his heels, began to potter mysteriously about some plants {{at the foot}} of the veranda. When Heyst and the girl came out again, the Chinaman had gone in his peculiar manner, which suggested vanishing out of existence rather than out of sight, a process of evaporation rather than of movement. They descended the steps, looking at each other, and started off smartly across the cleared ground; but they were not ten yards away when, without perceptible stir or sound, Wang materialized inside the empty room. The Chinaman stood still with roaming eyes, examining the walls as if for signs, for inscriptions; exploring the floor as if for pitfalls, for dropped coins. Then <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly at the profile of Heyst's father, pen in hand above a white sheet of paper on a crimson tablecloth; and, moving forward noiselessly, began to clear away the breakfast things.|$|E
60|$|Dick Four <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> critically, {{and squinted}} down a large red nose.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> {{nose in the}} air loftily {{and stepped}} across the narrow field-borders with great dignity.|$|R
60|$|Naismith, a youngish man of thirty, with glasses, smiled sheepishly and <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at <b>his</b> companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum {{has learned}} to sit upon my finger, and eat his sugar and water out of a {{teaspoon}} with most Christian-like decorum. He has but one weakness--he will occasionally jump into the spoon and sit in his sugar and water, and then appear to wonder where it goes to. His plumage is in rather a drabbled state, owing to these performances. I have sketched him as he sat to-day on a bit of Spiraea which I brought in for him. When absorbed in reflection, he sits with his bill straight up in the air, as I have drawn him. Mr. A- reads Macaulay to us, and {{you should see the}} wise air with which, perched on Jenny's thumb, <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> now one side and then the other, apparently listening with most critical attention. His confidence in us seems unbounded: he lets us stroke his head, smooth his feathers, without a flutter; and is never better pleased than when sitting, as he has been doing all this while, on my hand, turning up his bill, and watching my face with great edification.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{that was}} a very fine thing to say; but before an hour had gone by the Fiddler's head began to hum and buzz like a beehive. [...] "I don't believe," [...] said he, [...] "there would be a grain of harm in my peeping inside that door; all the same, I will not do it. I will just go down and peep through the key-hole." [...] So off he went to do as he said; but there was no key-hole to that door, either. [...] "Why, look!" [...] says he, [...] "it is just like the door at the rich man's house over yonder; I wonder if it is the same inside as outside," [...] and {{he opened the door and}} peeped in. Yes; there was the long passage and the spark of light at the far end, as though the sun were shining. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side and listened. [...] "Yes," [...] said he, [...] "I think I hear the water rushing, but I am not sure; I will just go a little further in and listen," [...] and so he entered and closed the door behind him. Well, he went on and on until--pop! there he was out at the farther end, and before he knew what he was about he had stepped out upon the sea-shore, just as he had done before.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I first {{begun to}} {{understand}} jay language correctly, {{there was a}} little incident happened here. Seven years ago, the last man in this region but me moved away. There stands his house--been empty ever since; a log house, with a plank roof--just one big room, and no more; no ceiling--nothing between the rafters and the floor. Well, one Sunday morning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin, with my cat, taking the sun, and looking at the blue hills, and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees, and thinking of the home away yonder in the states, that I hadn't heard from in thirteen years, when a bluejay lit on that house, with an acorn in his mouth, and says, 'Hello, I reckon I've struck something.' When he spoke, the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof, of course, but he didn't care; his mind was all on the thing he had struck. It was a knot-hole in the roof. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side, shut one eye and put the other one to the hole, like a possum looking down a jug; then he glanced up with his bright eyes, gave a wink or two with his wings--which signifies gratification, you understand--and says, 'It looks like a hole, it's located like a hole--blamed if I don't believe it IS a hole!' ...|$|E
60|$|Pat Hawe <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side, like a vulture {{about to}} strike with his beak, and cunningly eyed Madeline.|$|R
6000|$|... "More likely buffaloes," [...] whispered Harold, as <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> {{rifle and}} {{advanced}} quickly with Kambira, who carried a short spear or javelin.|$|R
60|$|Mr. May {{looked down}} in the mouth. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> blue eyes at her, miserable and frightened. Failure began to frighten him abjectly.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{looked just}} like what he is--a big Cat with a short tail," [...] replied Jumper. [...] "Just {{to look at him}} any one would know he was own cousin to Black Pussy. He had a round head, rather long legs, and was about twice as big as Black Pussy. His feet looked big, even for him. On the tips of his ears were a few long black hairs. His coat was {{yellowish}} to reddish-brown, with dark spots on it. His chin and throat were white, and underneath he was white spotted with black. There were spots all down his legs. He didn't have enough of a tail to call it a tail. It was whitish on the under side and had black stripes on the upper side, and all the time he kept twitching it just the way Black Pussy twitches her tail when she is out hunting. All of a sudden he opened his mouth and gave such a yell that it is a wonder I didn't jump out of my skin. It frightened me so that I couldn't have moved if I had wanted to, which was a lucky thing for me. The instant he yelled <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side and listened. That yell must have wakened somebody and caused them to move, for Yowler turned suddenly and crept swiftly and without a sound out of sight. A minute later I heard a jump, and then I heard a fluttering. I think he caught one of the Grouse family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{down and}} took another look; he glances up {{perfectly}} joyful, this time; winks his wings and his tail both, and says, 'Oh, no, this ain't no fat thing, I reckon! If I ain't in luck! --Why it's a perfectly elegant hole!' So he flew down and got that acorn, and fetched it up and dropped it in, and was just tilting his head back, with the heavenliest smile on his face, {{when all of a}} sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor, and the queerest look of surprise took its place. Then he says, 'Why, I didn't hear it fall!' He cocked his eye at the hole again, and took a long look; raised up and shook his head; stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side; shook his head again. He studied a while, then he just went into the Details--walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass. No use. Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute, and finally says, 'Well, it's too many for ME, that's certain; must be a mighty long hole; however, I ain't got no time to fool around here, I got to [...] "tend to business"; I reckon it's all right--chance it, anyway.' ...|$|E
60|$|He made {{a certain}} move {{of his hand}} and the canine {{suddenly}} sat upon <b>his</b> haunches and <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo! look there! what a monster!" [...] shouted Fred, as <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> musket and sprang forward. [...] "What'll you do, Tom, you've no gun?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Are sinners! Strange! The bee that blunders [...] Against me {{goes off}} with a laugh. A {{squirrel}} <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on the fence, and [...] wonders ...|$|R
6000|$|Hawe was spitefully {{ejecting}} a wad {{of tobacco}} from his mouth and swearing in an undertone about [...] "white-livered Greasers." [...] <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> red eye speculatively at Stewart.|$|R
