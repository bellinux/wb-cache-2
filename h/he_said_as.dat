He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
25|$|Kuldip Nayar, Shastri's media advisor from 1960 to 1964, recalls that, {{during the}} Quit India Movement, his {{daughter}} was ill and he was released on parole from jail. However, he could not save her life because doctors had prescribed costly drugs. Later on in 1963, on {{the day when he}} was dropped from the cabinet, he was sitting in his home in the dark, without a light. When asked about the reason, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> he no longer is a minister, all expenses will have to be paid by himself and that as a MP and minister he didn't earn enough to save for time of need.|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{his debut}} album, [...] Usher lost his voice. Usher {{was going through}} puberty and having a {{difficult}} time adjusting his voice. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his recording on hold thinking about dropping him from the label. Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and L.A. Reid did. From this point Reid didn't {{know what to do}} with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with Puff Daddy to attend what Reid called [...] "Flavor Camp". Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone, he expressed it as the [...] "Hardest days" [...] of his life. [...] "I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> he lived at Puff's house in Scarsdale, he noticed that [...] "There was always girls around".|$|E

500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E

2500|$|Delaware deputy {{attorneys}} Steven P. Wood and Peggy J. Hageman, who prosecuted Red Dog, {{tried and}} failed to find a motive. [...] According to Wood, attributing Red Dog's behavior to his upbringing is too easy: [...] "There is no denying the privation Native Americans are subjected to on reservations, but the simple fact is there are hundreds of thousands of Native Americans raised in those conditions, and precious few become multiple murders", <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> well as that his killings were [...] "essentially motiveless".|$|E
2500|$|D. Subbarao, {{governor}} of the Reserve Bank of India, emphasized during a quarterly review of India's monetary policy that the lives of Indians depend {{on the performance of}} the monsoon. His own career prospects, his emotional well-being, and the performance of his monetary policy are all [...] "a hostage" [...] to the monsoon, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> is the case for most Indians. Additionally, farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities. This crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city life.|$|E

[...] His muse did not fail him as he improvised, borrowing a term from frog hunting. [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> he made a fist with his thumb extended straight up. And with that the first hand sign in the Southwest Conference came into being. Interestingly, the [...] "Hook 'em Horns" [...] cheer was also invented by a UT cheerleader prior to the November 12, 1955 UT-TCU game. TCU wound up winning both of these historic games.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, David and {{his twin}} brother (Brian) alleged that Money forced the twins to rehearse sexual acts {{involving}} [...] "thrusting movements", with David playing the bottom role. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> a child, Money forced him go [...] "down on all fours" [...] with his brother, Brian Reimer, [...] "up behind his butt" [...] with [...] "his crotch against" [...] his [...] "buttocks", and that Money forced David {{to have his}} [...] "legs spread" [...] with Brian on top. Money also forced the children to take their [...] "clothes off" [...] and engage in [...] "genital inspections". On at [...] "least one occasion", Money reportedly took photographs of the two children doing these activities. Money's rationale for these various treatments was his belief that [...] "childhood 'sexual rehearsal play'" [...] was important for a [...] "healthy adult gender identity".|$|E
2500|$|The Foreign Ministry of Georgia {{announced}} {{readiness to}} negotiate a ceasefire and said that it had warned Russian diplomatic representative to Georgia. However, Russians claimed Georgian forces were not retreating, but merely regrouping. Georgian official stated that its forces were forced to retreat from South Ossetia. Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed receiving the offer, but said that [...] "the Georgian side has not stopped military actions in South Ossetia, Georgian troops continued shelling." [...] That day, the withdrawal of some Georgian troops was confirmed by deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, Colonel General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> many Russian troops {{would be sent to}} South Ossetia [...] "as the situation may require," [...] but they would not enter Georgia. Russian deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin ruled out peace talks with Georgia until the latter withdrew from South Ossetia and signed a legally binding pact against {{the use of force against}} South Ossetia and Abkhazia.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of his final Academy {{graduation}} performance, Jackman {{received a phone call}} offering him a role on Correlli: [...] "I was technically unemployed for thirteen seconds." [...] Correlli, devised by Australian actress Denise Roberts, was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman's first major professional job, and where he met his future wife Deborra-Lee Furness. [...] "Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> the show lasted only one season. After Correlli Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne. In 1996, Jackman played Gaston in the local Walt Disney production of Beauty and the Beast, and Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard. During his stage musical career in Melbourne, he starred in the 1998 Midsumma festival cabaret production Summa Cabaret. He also hosted Melbourne's Carols by Candlelight and Sydney's Carols in the Domain. Jackman's early film works include Erskineville Kings and Paperback Hero (1999), and his television work includes Law of the Land, Halifax f.p., Blue Heelers, and Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River.|$|E
2500|$|DeLonge's early guitar {{tone was}} {{described}} as [...] "clean to crisply overdriven." [...] During those years, he tended to use Fender Custom Shop Stratocasters (and still occasionally uses in studio recordings), and his own Fender Tom DeLonge Statocaster, with Seymour Duncan Invader pickups, Ernie Ball strings, Dunlop tortex picks, and a Whirlwind Selector A/B/Y box. The Mesa/Boogie Triple Rectifier was key to DeLonge's early sound; he employed them to create a distorted sound. [...] "A Mesa/Boogie is like a nuke: you plug it in and it fills up every piece of the sonic spectrum," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>As</b> his sound gradually grew cleaner, he grew away from the Mesa/Boogies. DeLonge employed the Marshall JCM900 amps {{for his work on}} Dude Ranch, in which he improved his guitar tone. In a September 1999 Guitar Player article, DeLonge outlined his intentions: [...] "I'm the kind of guitarist that wants the biggest, fattest, loudest, sound he can get." [...] As such, he refrained from toying with his guitar equipment for several years. [...] "I was just into punk-rock. I thought we were cooler than every other band. I thought punk was way cooler and we knew something other people didn’t know. Now I look and think, 'Fuck, there was a lot I didn't know!'" [...] he later remarked.|$|E
