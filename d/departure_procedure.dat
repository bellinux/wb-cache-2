40|$|In this study, {{a genetic}} {{optimization}} algorithm {{is applied to}} the design of environmentally friendly aircraft departure trajectories. The environmental optimization has been primarily focused on noise abatement and local NOx emissions, whilst taking fuel burn into account as an economical criterion. In support of this study, a novel parameterization approach has been conceived for discretizing the lateral and vertical flight profiles, which reduces the need to include nonlinear side constraints in the multiparameter optimization problem formulation, while still permitting to comply with the complex set of operational requirements pertaining to departure procedures. The resulting formulation avoids infeasible solutions and hence significantly reduces the number of model evaluations required in the genetic optimization process. The efficiency of the developed approach is demonstrated in a case study involving the design of a noise abatement <b>departure</b> <b>procedure</b> at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in The Netherlands.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an aircraft noise prediction simulation that incorporates actual weather in flight dynamics and noise propagation. The rapid prototyping simulation environment NOIse SIMulator (NOISIM) includes a sound propagation model {{based on a}} ray tracing algorithm that incorporates atmospheric and ground effects. The simulator uses standard weather profiles, terminal aircraft radar data and flight simu-lator data as input. NOISIM allows users to explore {{a wide array of}} flight procedures and weather conditions to determine the flight procedure that minimizes the noise impact in communities around airports. Two main applications of this tool are pre-sented in this thesis: the design of a weather-specific noise abatement procedure and a statistical study of the effect of weather on average noise contours. The first case study explores the magnitude of the weather effects on the noise impact of a Boeing 767 in communities near Boston Logan Airport during takeoff. It also illustrates how the noise impact can be significantly reduced by changing the <b>departure</b> <b>procedure</b> to capitalize on changes in the weather.

40|$|Typically {{air traffic}} {{controller}} manages departure traffic gradually in the airport airspace neighborhoods, providing clearances for the access to higher altitudes determined by conditions of traffic flow mix. This air traffic management implies the realization of several level-offs at each departure which suppose an increase of the fuel consumption firstly and as result the rise of overall cost of operation. Furthermore, not only operational costs are affected but both noise and pollutants emissions are increased, eco-friendly departure procedures requires a special heed because a new international range of equirements desire to abate the environmental impact due to aircraft operations. In order to avoid this inefficient <b>departure</b> <b>procedure,</b> continuous climb operations (CCOs) are defined as novel procedures which will ease the pilot departure perform. CCO is the ideal path an aircraft might fly {{in the absence of}} any ATC issues. The aim of this work is to analyze different CCOs techniques and evaluate the feasibility of implement them in a real scenario. A review of diverse CCOs based on different concepts of operation is presented, as minimizing fuel consumption, noise impact, constant climb speed,etc., as well as the definition of the requirements a CCO must fulfill which shape the feasible solution space. Lastly, Palma ATM environment is presented as case study of the viability of implementing CCO procedures among real requirements and expected drawbacks...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a 4 D Trajectories Generator and Guidance system. 4 D trajectory {{is a concept}} that will improve the capacity, efficiency and safety of airspace. First a 4 D trajectories synthetizer design is proposed. A flight plan composed by a set of waypoints, aircraft dynamics model and a set of limits and constraints are assembled into an optimal control problem. Optimal solution is found by making use of an optimal control solver which uses pseudo spectral parametrization together with a generic nonlinear programming solver. A 4 D Trajectories generator is implemented as a stand-alone application and combined with a graphic user interface to give rise to 4 D Trajectories Research Software (4 DT RS) capable to generate, compare and test optimal trajectories. A basic Tracking & Guidance system with proportional navigation concept is developed. The system is implemented as a complementary module for the 4 D trajectories research software. Simulation tests have been carried out to demonstrate the functionalities and capabilities of the 4 DT RS software and guidance system. Tests cases are based on fuel and time optimization on a high-traffic commercial route. A standard <b>departure</b> <b>procedure</b> is optimized {{in order to reduce the}} noise perceived by village’s population situated near airport. The tracking & guidance module is tested with a commercial flight simulator for demonstrating the performance of the optimal trajectories generated by the 4 DT RS software...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{reductions}} in environmental impact and operating costs are achievable when both aircraft configuration and operation are considered simultaneously {{at the early}} stages of aircraft design. The challenges with combining these disciplines are that the design space becomes larger, and each design evaluation requires coupled analyses. This paper presents a methodology in which a low-speed aerodynamic model and a trajectory simulation are integrated to study trades between aircraft performance, environmental impact, and cost. Four studies are conducted using this method to illustrate ways to reduce the environmental impacts of future airplanes in a future air-traffic system. First, a study of the <b>departure</b> <b>procedure</b> for the Boeing 747 - 200 shows that significant benefits are possible by modifying the current procedures without changing the aircraft. For instance, from the start of takeoff roll to 10, 000 feet the following are mutually achievable: a 37 % reduction in climb time, a 26 % reduction in fuel consumption, a 26 % reduction in 55 EPNdB noise exposure area, and a 2. 6 % reduction in operating costs. A second example analyzes trades between noise and operating cost and considers current noise taxation schemes. Then, the sensitivity of the takeoff and approach noise certification procedures are presented to show it is possible to simultaneously evaluate both configuration and operational changes. The results of these studies are that takeoff noise is insensitive to small configuration changes, but procedural modifications can have a significant impact. For approach, the noise can be significantly reduced through either configuration or procedural changes...|$|E

It has stronger existence as it has been preferred as transportation mode for supporting their activity that lead to bus system development. It can be seen in new buses that are operated recently with better design and facility. Terminal as central of transportation service provider seems exist in complicated system and un-safe condition that lead to un-comfortable for the passengers. This project entitled “Interior Design of Gajah Mulia Sejahtera (GMS) Bus Agent in Surakarta is limited in 800 - 1000 m 2. It will be located on JalanJendral Ahmad Yani. It is purposed to create „Safe and Comfortable‟ thematic atmosphere inthe interior design. It is applying airport system as design approach for problem solving and presenting corporate branding (GMS) in its interior design. In creating „safe and comfortable‟ interior atmosphere, the design refers to airport system. For security issue, the design is implementing security section, goods inspection with X-Ray and metal detector and CCTV installation in some crucial points. For complicated and noisy issue, the design is arranged in separated departure and arrival circulation, information in strategic spot and clear signage. Airport system that is applied in bus agent design can be seen in 2 approaches; departure and arrival procedures. <b>Departure</b> <b>procedure</b> is implemented in drop zone placement, security check point and boarding area as private waiting room. Arrival procedure is implemented in baggage claim, arrival hall and pick up zone. Both procedures have different and separated access and circulation. Corporate existence in interior design is applied in 2 approaches. Firstly, the design uses the color of corporate branding which are white, orange and blue. Those specific colors of GMS are applied in room constructing elements; wall, floor and ceiling, that fit with each functionality. Secondly, the design uses the character of bus furniture as inspiration for furniture and interior design. Keywords: bus agent, GMS, airport system approach, safe and comfortabl...|$|E
