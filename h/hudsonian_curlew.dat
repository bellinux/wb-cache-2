50|$|The refuge {{is one of}} the few {{scattered}} {{remnants of}} wetland habitats that still exist on Oahu and {{is one of the}} most productive waterbird wetlands for resident and migratory species such as the kioea (bristle-thighed curlew, Numenius tahitiensis) and akekeke (ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres). A total of 119 bird species have been documented on the refuge since its inception. Unusual vagrant birds include the northern harrier, peregrine falcon, black-tailed godwit, <b>Hudsonian</b> godwit, <b>curlew</b> sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and snowy egret. There are no native mammals, reptiles, or amphibians.|$|R
50|$|Eskimo curlews {{are small}} curlews, about 30 centimeters in length. Adults have long dark greyish legs {{and a long}} bill curved {{slightly}} downward. The upperparts are mottled brown and the underparts are light brown. They show cinnamon wing linings in flight. They are similar in appearance to the <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>curlew,</b> the American subspecies of the whimbrel, but smaller in size.|$|E
50|$|Non-endemic landbirds and {{shorebirds}} occur {{mostly as}} vagrants {{or use the}} island as a stopover during migration; the northern mockingbird became established in the late 20th century. Among those that are recorded not infrequently are great blue heron, <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>curlew,</b> spotted sandpiper and wandering tattler. Unlike the situation on smaller and more isolated Clarión, wind-blown or vagrant birds seem to constititute {{the bulk of the}} recorded species, including brown pelican, osprey, peregrine falcon, semipalmated plover, willet, sanderling, belted kingfisher and buff-bellied pipit. It may be that this puzzling observation is due to the presence of the red-tailed hawks and cats, which has at least made the local Urosaurus more wary than its relative on Clarión, and might deter passing birds from stopping on Socorro.|$|E

Wayne in South Carolina including the Sooty Shearwater, the Harlequin Duck, the Snow Goose, the Blue Goose, the Egret, the Yellow-crowned Night Heron, the <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Curlew,</b> the Turnstone, the Pigeon Hawk, the Crested Flycatcher, the Bronzed Grackle, the Carolina Grackle, the Ipswich Sparrow, Leconte’s Sparrow, the Mountain Solitary Vireo, Bachman’s Warbler, the Magnolia Warbler, the Black-throated Green Warbler, and the Connecticut Warbler...|$|E
