5|$|Diphenhydramine, a first-generation H1 {{receptor}} antagonist {{or medicine}} that combats the H1 receptor that {{is associated with}} many allergic reactions, {{has been found to be}} the most potent antihistamine for this particular disease. Patients prescribed 50 milligrams four times per <b>day</b> <b>have</b> been able to sustain normal exposure to the sun without suffering a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per <b>day</b> <b>have</b> an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, {{which in some}} cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{there have}} been 50 {{different}} championship teams, and 75 individual champions with the tag teams of Cesaro and Sheamus, Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel, and MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) holding the most reigns at 3; in addition, Cesaro, Eddie Guerrero, John Morrison, Kofi Kingston, Rey Mysterio, and The Miz hold the most reigns individually at four. The New <b>Day</b> <b>have</b> the longest reign at 483 days, while John Cena and The Miz have the shortest reign as a team at roughly 15 minutes, due to The Corre invoking their rematch clause immediately after losing the title. René Duprée is the youngest champion at age 20, while Billy Gunn is the oldest champion at age 50.|$|E
50|$|The <b>day</b> <b>has</b> been {{celebrated as}} the Independence Day of Belarus by the Belarusian {{independence}} movement {{since the early}} 1920s. The <b>day</b> <b>has</b> been widely celebrated by the Belarusian diaspora.|$|R

5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per <b>day</b> <b>have</b> a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one <b>day</b> <b>have</b> the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E

25|$|A {{diet that}} {{includes}} {{large amounts of}} carotene, fiber, and vitamins with low amounts of fat—specifically, a diet with non-starchy vegetables (e.g. broccoli and onions)—may be protective, though research is still ongoing in this area.
