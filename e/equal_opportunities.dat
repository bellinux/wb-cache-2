40|$|The {{research}} project {{reported in this}} thesis concerned the business case for <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> in the workplace. The project comprised three distinct but related studies: 1. Study I was a qualitative investigation into which variables employees perceived {{to be associated with}} <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> in the workplace. The over-arching fmding was that participants had a low awareness of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and perceived general fairness (organisational egalitarianism) to be more important than <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> per se. Job attitude outcome variables ofjob satisfaction, organisational commitment, intention to leave and perceived performance were proposed. 2. Study 2 qualitatively explored the issues associated with the business case for <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> as perceived by equality practitioners. Results detailed perceptions of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> climate, employer motivations and the problems associated with translating <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> policy into practice. 3. Study 3 sought to quantitatively measure the impact of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and organisational egalitarianism on the job attitude outcome variables identified by studies I and 2. A questionnaire, the Social Atmosphere at Work Survey, was constructed and piloted to measure the perceived <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> climate, the outcome variables and an individual difference construct, equity sensitivity. Results indicated that <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> significantly contributed to job satisfaction, organisational commitment, intention to leave and perceived workgroup, effectiveness. Organisational egalitarianism however proved a stronger predictor of these outcome variables than perceived <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> level, as suggested by the qualitative results. Equity sensitivity did not significantly moderate any of these relationships...|$|R
40|$|<b>Equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> offices {{have been}} {{described}} as agencies of organisational change, and the term ‘cultural change’ has been used to describe aspects of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> work. Universities are sites of organisational cultures where <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers have worked in Australia for the past decade. In this time there have been significant changes to higher education, in terms {{of the size of the}} university sector in Australia, and also in terms of funding, governance and management. These changes in universities provided the context for questions about the roles of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers in universities, and how they may have changed. This research investigated the practice of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers in universities by using a grounded theory approach to generate understandings about how this group of university staff may have impacted on university cultures. The study develops links between theories of culture and organisational change that was situated in the practices of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers. The research identified a central conceptual category that was described as ‘picking the pitch’, as the main theme in the work of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers in identifying issues and gaining support for a cultural change agenda. All of the preliminary themes that were identified, and the interactions, the observations and the analysis of culture were prerequisites for ‘picking the pitch’. The thesis uses the research for further reflection and integration of the goals of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity,</b> and the means that were available to <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers to achieve these goals. The interactions of power and influence, and some of the limitations on <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers are discussed. In the thesis the usefulness of the concept of culture to <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers is examined, along with the underpinning theories about the mind of humanity that contributed to their approach to their task. Finally, the thesis discusses the impact of the research for <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> officers, and for the universities in which they worked...|$|R

This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%).

5|$|During {{her maiden}} speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont {{was the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the <b>Equal</b> <b>Opportunities</b> Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 83 Nagle {{was still}} {{pursuing}} gender equality, accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted, Nagle was proposed {{as a member of}} the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later. She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the <b>Equal</b> <b>Opportunities</b> Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. Leonard Pagliero was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, Dog World and Our Dogs, on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on case study {{research}} of employment downsizing and the implications for <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and diversity management conducted in the UK airline industry during 2002 / 2003. Design/methodology/approach – Review of literature on downsizing and <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and diversity management followed by identification of a number of research questions which are answered with reference to secondary analysis of labour market data and interviews with key informants from senior management and line management. Findings – A planned approach to downsizing had been adopted that was strongly influenced by the human resources function in terms of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and diversity management. An adverse impact on different employee groups had been avoided in order to sustain the diversity of the workforce. Research limitations/implications – The research focuses on the management of downsizing and <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and diversity management. It addresses the perceptions of managers involved in developing and implementing policy, but does not examine the perceptions of other employees. Practical implications – There are some reflections on ways in which <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and diversity management policy might adapt to organisational change and downsizing. Originality/value – This paper brings together two scholarly debates on downsizing and <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and diversity management, and provides case study evidence of how an <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> and diversity management agenda is implemented during organisational restructuring and downsizing...|$|R
