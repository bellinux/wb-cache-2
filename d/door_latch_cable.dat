40|$|Physical {{modeling}} is a {{modeling and}} simulation technique that captures the physics and mathematics of a system through high fidelity dynamic models {{which are based on}} equations and symbolic manipulation. In this study, a physical model of a side <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> release mechanism for an automotive application has been developed in Dynamic Modelling Laboratory (Dymola) which is a popular multi-domain object-oriented physical modelling tool. The performance of the developed door lock model is evaluated against measurements from a real vehicle <b>door</b> <b>latch.</b> The variables of the developed physical model of the <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> are parameterized against supplier specification or calculated from standard textbook equations. The model accurately emulates the degree of mobility of the <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> design by investigating the required voltage and timing requirements for the locking/unlocking functions, given a set of parameters within the normal operating range. ...|$|R
