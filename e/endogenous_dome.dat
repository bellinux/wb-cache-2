2500|$|The Black Tusk, {{the oldest}} and most {{striking}} of the three principal volcanoes, is the glacially dissected remains of a stratovolcano that formed between 1.3 and 1.1million years ago. Eruptions produced hornblende andesite lava flows and lithic tuffs. Prolonged erosion destroyed the original cone. The bluffs northwest, southwest and southeast of the main volcanic edifice are remains of this ancestral volcano. Renewed volcanism between 210,000and 170,000years ago produced hypersthene andesite lava flows, which locally terminate with precipitous [...] thick ice-contact margins. This latest eruptive activity culminated with extrusion of an <b>endogenous</b> <b>dome</b> and related lava which form the present [...] high summit spire. Later, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet carved a deep, north-trending U-shaped valley into the eastern flank of this edifice.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. GPS {{data from}} {{stations}} around the Chaitén Volcano show a co-eruptive pattern of inflation and deflation that correlates well with the estimated effusion rate during the 2008 - 2009 eruption. Axisymmetric radial deflation is coeval with periods of fast dome growth and inflation is coeval with periods of mostly <b>endogenous</b> <b>dome</b> growth at lower rates. Non-volcanic basement appears {{to be involved in}} the ground deformation as was inferred previously from InSAR observations. Data are insufficient to conduct full source modeling, but simple models are compatible with those that are based on petrological and geophysical observations. These results suggest a strong coupling between the eruption dynamics and response of the surrounding basement, which was probably conditioned by its structural fabric and crustal tectonics...|$|E
40|$|Lava domes {{comprise}} core, carapace, and clastic talus components. They {{can grow}} endogenously by inflation of a core and/or exogenously with the extrusion of shear bounded lobes and whaleback lobes at the surface. Internal structure is paramount {{in determining the}} extent to which lava dome growth evolves stably, or conversely the propensity for collapse. The more core lava that exists within a dome, in both relative and absolute terms, the more explosive energy is available, both for large pyroclastic flows following collapse and in particular for lateral blast events following very rapid removal of lateral support to the dome. Knowledge of the location of the core lava within the dome is also relevant for hazard assessment purposes. A spreading toe, or lobe of core lava, over a talus substrate may be both relatively unstable and likely to accelerate to more violent activity during the early phases of a retrogressive collapse. Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat has been erupting since 1995 and has produced numerous lava domes that have undergone repeated collapse events. We consider one continuous dome growth period, from August 2005 to May 2006 that resulted in a dome collapse event on 20 th May 2006. The collapse event lasted 3 h, removing the whole dome plus dome remnants from a previous growth period in an unusually violent and rapid collapse event. We use an axisymmetrical computational Finite Element Method model for the growth and evolution of a lava dome. Our model comprises evolving core, carapace and talus components based on axisymmetrical <b>endogenous</b> <b>dome</b> growth, which permits us to model the interface between talus and core. Despite explicitly only modelling axisymmetrical <b>endogenous</b> <b>dome</b> growth our core–talus model simulates many of the observed growth characteristics of the 2005 – 2006 SHV lava dome well. Further, it is possible for our simulations to replicate large-scale exogenous characteristics when a considerable volume of talus has accumulated around the lower flanks of the dome. Model results suggest that dome core can override talus within a growing dome, potentially generating a region of significant weakness and a potential locus for collapse initiation. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Rainfall-triggered collapses of hot lava domes are {{described}} {{relative to the}} fluid overpressurization that accompanies the infiltration of rainfall into the carapace. Similar rainfall-triggered modes of failure are apparent for both hemispherical (endogenous) and lobate (exogenous) domes. Failure modes for these disparate geometries are linked by the necessary incursion of rainfall into the hot dome and the resulting impeded drainage of interior gas pressures – either self-generated by the vaporizing infiltration front, or the impeded drainage of interior pressurized gases. Limit equilibrium models are developed to assess the stability of idealized hemispherical or lobate domes, with driving forces generated by interior gas overpressures. For <b>endogenous</b> <b>domes,</b> shallow failures may develop {{in the absence of}} gas pressurization from the core, but observed deep-seated failures require that the free escape of conduit gases be impeded. For exogenous domes, failure is driven {{to the base of the}} lobe by the desire to maximize overpressures...|$|R
40|$|Whether {{granitic}} magmas can detach and digest {{fragments of}} wallrock or mingle with other magmas depends {{in large part}} on the style of magma emplacement. Many composite plutons grow by relatively small pulses of magma, some of which may reach their solidus before injection of the next pulse. Composite “nested ” plutons may grow as new pulses of magma invade and displace their predecessors, or “sheeted ” plutons may grow as new magma follows contacts between wallrock and older intrusions. Contrary to a common assumption, the innermost parts of a composite intrusion are not necessarily the last to be emplaced or the most fractionated. Emplacement kinematics of some plutons and lava domes are similar. Lava domes grow in two ways. <b>Endogenous</b> <b>domes</b> infl ate as new lava ascends and ponds within a cooler lava crust, and exogenous domes accrete as new lava ascends, breaches the lava crust, and spreads over the exterior. Exogenous growth of sheeted plutons offers less opportunity for magma mingling and mixing, but allows more wallrock assimilation (contamination) than endogenous growth of nested plutons...|$|R

It is one of the tallest monoliths of the world, with a maximum height of 433 m. Peña de Bernal was recently declared Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity Patrimony by United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In spite of being both a natural and cultural monument, little is known about its origin, physical characteristics, and chemical composition. It is a leucocratic-igneous rock intruding marine Mesozoic sedimentary rocks and has been misinterpreted as a pluton of Eocene or older age.

40|$|Modeling {{volcanic}} phenomena {{is complicated}} by free-surfaces often supporting large rheological gradients. Analytical solutions and analogue models provide explanations for fundamental characteristics of lava flows. But more sophisticated models are needed, incorporating improved physics and rheology to capture realistic events. To advance {{our understanding of the}} flow dynamics of highly viscous lava in Peléean lava dome formation, axi-symmetrical Finite Element Method (FEM) models of generic <b>endogenous</b> <b>dome</b> growth have been developed. We use a novel technique, the level-set method, which tracks a moving interface, leaving the mesh unaltered. The model equations are formulated in an Eulerian framework. In this paper we test the quality of this technique in our numerical scheme by considering existing analytical and experimental models of lava dome growth which assume a constant Newtonian viscosity. We then compare our model against analytical solutions for real lava domes extruded on Soufrière, St. Vincent, W. I. in 1979 and Mount St. Helens, USA in October 1980 using an effective viscosity. The level-set method is found to be computationally light and robust enough to model the free-surface of a growing lava dome. Also, by modeling the extruded lava with a constant pressure head this naturally results in a drop in extrusion rate with increasing dome height, which can explain lava dome growth observables more appropriately than when using a fixed extrusion rate. From the modeling point of view, the level-set method will ultimately provide an opportunity to capture more of the physics while benefiting from the numerical robustness of regular grids...|$|E
40|$|The BepiColombo space {{mission is}} one of the European Space Agency’s {{cornerstone}} projects; it is planned for launch in 2013 to study the planet Mercury. One of the imaging instruments of BepiColombo is a STereo Camera (STC), whose main scientific objective is the global stereo mapping of the entire surface of Mercury. STC will permit the generation of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of Mercury’s surface, improving the interpretation of morphological features at different scales and clarifying the stratigraphic relationships between different geological units. To evaluate the effectiveness of the STC-derived DTM for geological purposes, a series of simulations has been performed to find out to what extent the errors expected in the DTM may prevent the correct classification and interpretation of geological features. To meet this objective, Earth analogues (a crater, a lava cone and an <b>endogenous</b> <b>dome)</b> of likely components of the Hermean surface, small enough to be near the detection limit of the STC, were selected and a photorealistic three-dimensional (3 D) model of each feature was generated using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) stereo images. Stereoscopic pairs of synthetic images of each feature were then generated from the 3 D model at different locations along the BepiColombo orbit. For each stereo pair, the corresponding Hermean DTM was computed using image correlation and compared to the reference data to assess the loss of detail and interpretability. Results show that interpretation and quantitative analysis of simple craters morphologies and small volcanic features should be possible all along the periherm orbit arc. At the apoherm only the larger features can be unequivocally distinguished, but they will be reconstructed to a poor approximation...|$|E

40|$|Three {{volcanic}} domes {{and related}} volcanic rocks of Tertiary age are located near Etna, Utah, in Box Elder County. The domes follow a north-south trend and are fault controlled. Flow structure indicates {{a change from}} a less viscous, flow-forming lava which produced an exogenous dome to a more viscous lava which formed <b>endogenous</b> <b>domes.</b> Associated pyroclastic deposits are negligible. The volcanic rocks are composed of porphyritic rhyolite and rhyolitic vitrophyre having phenocrysts of quartz, sanidine, plagioclase and biotite with minor amounts of Fe-Ti oxides, hypersthene, allanite and calcic amphibole. Quartz and sanidine phenocrysts are generally embayed whereas plagioclase phenocrysts are euhedral and extensively zoned. Average whole-rock chemical analyses yield: SiO 2, 77. 13; TiO 2, 0. 12; Al 2 O 3, 11. 01; Fe 2 O 3, 0. 9; FeO, 0. 35; MnO, 0. 02; MgO, 0. 19; CaO, 0. 82; Na 2 O, 2. 93; K 2 O, 4. 99; P 2 O 5, 0. 03; H 2 O+, 1. 17; H 2 O-, 0. 22; total, 99. 94 weight percent. Coexisting Fe-Ti oxide microphenocrysts yield equilibration temperatures ranging from 872 ° to 684 °C while respective log f 0 2 values range from - 13. 5 to - 19. 5. These temperatures are comparable to temperatures obtained using the plagioclase-glass geothermometer at a water pressure of 1 kb. Mineral buffer reactions yield water fugacities with corresponding water pressures up to 4. 9 kb. Assuming water pressure equals total pressure, calculated depths of approximately 18 km are obtained indicating an origin within the crust. High silica values and high alkali to calcium ratios indicate that ix the lavas are chemically similar to bimodal rhyolite-basalt assemblages located {{in other areas of}} the western United States. Small outcrops of basalt, located west of the Etna area, also suggest a bimodal assemblage. Viscosity values (log n) for the south dome range from 7. 05 to 10. 35 suggesting that there was a change from a less viscous to a more viscous lava. Comparisons between hydrous and dry calculations indicate that falling water content as well as decreasing temperature were responsible for the change in viscosity and resulting structural changes...|$|R
30|$|The shallow-inclination {{component}} {{can probably}} {{be attributed to}} tilting associated {{with the development of}} the rhyolite <b>dome.</b> <b>Endogenous</b> growth of lava domes occurs by the subsequent supply of highly viscous magma and facilitates uplifting and tilting of dome materials (Nakada et al., 1995). Tilting occurs to a greater degree at areas proximal to the crater than at distal ones. Therefore, tilting is expected to have taken place more significantly in core AVL 1 (taken 230 m from the source), compared to core AVL 2 (340 m from the source). Because cores AVL 1 and AVL 2 are located slightly to the south of the crater, the sites of the cores are anticipated to be tilted southward due to endogenous growth of the lava dome, which would result in shallowing of the north-directed magnetization that was already acquired.|$|R
40|$|During an {{eruption}} at the Bocca Nuova, {{one of the}} summit craters of Mt. Etna, in October-November 1999 {{a part of the}} crater floor near its WNW rim was uplifted to form a dome-shaped feature that consisted of older lava and pyroclastics filling the crater. This <b>endogenous</b> <b>dome</b> grew rapidly over the crater rim, thus being perched precariously over the steep outer slope of the Bocca Nuova, and near-continuous collapse of its steep flanks generated swiftly moving pyroclastic avalanches {{over a period of several}} hours. These avalanches advanced at speeds of 10 - 20 m s- 1 and extended up to 0. 7 km from their source on top of lavas emplaced immediately before. Their deposits were subsequently covered by lava flows that issued from vents below the front of the dome and from the Bocca Nuova itself. Growth of the dome was caused by the vertical intrusion of magma in the marginal W part of the crater, which deformed and uplifted previously emplaced, still hot and plastically deformable eruptive products filling the crater. The resulting avalanches had all characteristics of pyroclastic flows spawned by collapse of unstable flanks of lava domes, but in this case the magma involved was of mafic (hawaiitic) composition and would have, under normal circumstances, produced fluid lava flows. The formation of the dome and the generation of the pyroclastic avalanches owe their occurrence to the rheological properties of the eruptive products filling the crater, which were transformed into the dome, and to the morphological configuration of the Bocca Nuova and its surroundings. The density contrast between successive erupted products may also have played a role. Although events of this type are to be considered exceptional at Etna, their recurrence might represent a serious hazard to visitors to the summit area...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen years {{worth of}} Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data is {{presented}} {{and used to}} quantitatively assess processes occurring at Bezymianny. This andesitic volcano is one of Kamchatka's most dangerous volcanoes with 16 eruptions {{in the last decade}} that have dispersed ash into North Pacific air routes. All known episodes of increased activity for which data were available were detected in band 3 (3. 53 – 3. 93 μm) AVHRR thermal data. Twenty-three peaks {{can be seen in the}} data; nineteen peaks correspond to known explosions, while the remaining three peaks correspond to known phases of dome growth that were not believed to have been accompanied by explosive activity. Start and end dates of extrusive phases defined by the thermal data are presented. Repose times between phases of extrusion vary from four months to just over two and half years with an average of just less than a year. Using rank-order statistics a ‘maximum’ time interval between consecutive explosions of 1288 ± 170 days is determined; this could serve as a cut-off time for declaring the current dome-growth activity over. The calculated cumulative erupted volume (0. 28 km 3) and time-averaged extrusion rate (0. 6 m 3 s − 1) from 1993 to 2008 corresponds to values found at Bezymianny from 1956 to 1976, showing that the satellite-based methodology provides a good way of quantitatively assessing dome growth. Three different types of precursors to explosive behavior have been identified at Bezymianny: (1) values that cluster around the mode of the data set prior to explosion, potentially due to <b>endogenous</b> <b>dome</b> growth, (2) upward trends that commence 15 – 20 days prior to explosion and reach sensor saturation levels are due to significant extrusion, and (3) a gradual upward trend that starts 5 days prior to explosion, probably due to ramping up of extrusion. This work shows that retrospectively analyzing and modeling of a volcano's thermal signal provides increased insight into its characteristic behavior. The methods used in this paper can be used at other dome-building volcanoes around the world. The insights presented here can be used to improve monitoring capabilities to aid in providing early warnings to large explosions at Bezymianny...|$|E

40|$|Subduction zone {{volcanism}} occurs due to partial melting from subducting slabs, {{which generally}} results in high-viscosity magma containing {{a large amount}} of volatiles. Such volcanic eruptions can form a lava dome, from which collapse events are a common and important part of their evolution. Collapse events can have devastating consequences; in the form of block and ash avalanche deposits, pyroclastic ﬂows, surges and the generation of tsunamis if they enter the sea. In addition to this, once a mass of lava dome has been removed during a collapse event, this results in a drop in pressure in the remaining volatile-rich magma, which may then erupt explosively. The internal structure of a lava dome and the extent of the surrounding carapace/talus is unknown, but likely to be critical for hazard assessment, and is the motivation for this research. Presented is a computational model for the growth and evolution of an <b>endogenous</b> lava <b>dome,</b> including an independently deformable talus, using the Finite Element Method. Dome growth is modelled to occur under two time-scales: continuous dome expansion via the addition of new magma into the molten core interior, and relatively instantaneous talus readjustments due to rockfalls and the disintegration of the solid surface. The continuous deformation of the dome is modelled as a ﬂuid with a yield strength in the talus region. While talus deformation is modelled as a granular material that rests at angles below its angle of repose. Both surfaces, dome and core/talus interface, are displaced using the level-set method. The model is axi-symmetric and assumes that solidiﬁcation, and therefore talus growth, occurs due to gas exsolution which promotes crystallisation, rather than from surface cooling, appropriate for intermediate composition lava ﬂows. For {{the purpose of this paper}} we consider and apply the model to the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, but the techniques used are generic, allowing the model to be applied to other dome forming eruptions. The model provides information on the shape of the dome, with the growth and extent of the talus and core found to be predominantly governed by the lava extrusion rate, degree of solidiﬁcation (i. e. a solidus pressure), the friction angle associated with the talus, and lava dome viscosity...|$|R
40|$|Socorro Island is {{the summit}} of a large {{volcanic}} mountain located on the Clarion Fracture Zone in the east Pacific. Two major periods of volcanic activity can be recognized on the island. The first (pre-caldera) period was characterized by eruptions of olivine-poor alkali basalt, followed by quiet effusion of soda rhyolite including varieties transitional to pantellerite. This period of activity terminated {{with the formation of}} a caldera by collapse. A relatively prolonged period of quiescence ended with rifting and down-faulting of the western side of the island along a north-south fracture system, accompanied by violently explosive eruptions of soda rhyolite which built a large tephra cone over the position of the old caldera. The locus of eruptive activity moved outward and downward along tension fractures and old tectonic rifts as the central vents became blocked by domes of dense obsidian. Low level eruptions of viscous soda rhyolite including pantellerite commenced without preliminary explosive eruptions and built numerous <b>endogenous</b> and exogenous <b>domes.</b> Basaltic eruptions were rare and confined to low-level vents. During the growth of the volcano the direction of active rifting appears to have changed from east-west to northwest-southeast to north-south. Little is known of the submarine portion of the volcano, but the topography seems to reflect the three directions of rifting. The oldest submarine lavas are assumed to be basaltic and are probably of late Tertiary age. The eruptive history of Socorro suggests that the underlying magma column became stratified {{toward the end of the}} active period...|$|R
40|$|Andesitic volcanoes {{are notorious}} for their rapid and {{unpredictable}} changes in eruptive style between and during volcanic events, a feature normally attributed to shallow crustal and intra-edifice magmatic processes. Using the example of eruptions during the last 1000 yrs at Mt. Taranaki (the Maero Eruptive Period), deposit sequences were studied to (1) understand lava dome formation and destruction, (2) interpret the causes of rapid shifts from extrusive to explosive eruption styles, and (3) to build a model of crustal magmatic processes that impact on eruption style. A new detailed reconstruction of this period identifies at least 10 eruptive episodes characterised by extrusive, lava dome- and lava flow-producing events and one sub- Plinian eruption. To achieve this, a new evaluation procedure was developed to purge glass datasets of contaminated mineral-glass analyses by using compositional diagrams of mineral incompatible-compatible elements. Along with careful examination of particle textures, this procedure can be broadly applied to build {{a higher degree of}} resolution in any tephrostratigraphic record. Geochemical contrasts show that the products of the latest Mt. Taranaki eruption, the remnant summit dome (Pyramid Dome) was not formed during the Tahurangi eruptive episode but extruded post-AD 1755. Its inferred original maximum volume of 4. 9 × 106 m 3 (DRE) was formed by simultaneous <b>endogenous</b> and exogenous <b>dome</b> growth within days. Magma ascent and extrusion rates are estimated at = 0. 012 ms- 1 and = 6 m 3 s- 1, respectively, based on hornblende textures. Some of the Maero-Period dome effusions were preceded by a vent-clearing phase producing layers of scattered lithic lapilli around the edifice [Newall Ash (a), Mangahume Lapilli, Pyramid Lapilli]. The type of dome failure controlled successive eruptive phases in most instances. The destruction of a pressurised dome either caused instantaneous but short-lived magmatic fragmentation (Newall and Puniho episodes), or triggered a directed blast-explosion (Newall episode), or initiated sustained magmatic fragmentation (Burrell Episode). The transition from dome effusion to a sustained, sub- Plinian eruption during the Burrell Lapilli (AD 1655) episode was caused by unroofing a conduit of stalled magma, vertically segregated into three layers with different degrees of vesiculation and crystallisation. The resultant ejecta range from brown, grey and black coloured vesicular clasts to dense grey lithics. Bulk compositional variation of erupted clasts can be modelled by fractionation of hornblende, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides. Pre-eruption magma ascent for the Maero Period events is assumed to begin at depths of c. 9. 5 km...|$|R

We classified the waveforms of summit earthquakes into high-frequency (HF), medium-frequency (MF), and low-frequency (LF) types on the basis of spectral analysis. Dominant waveform types varied significantly over time: HF was dominant in May 1991, LF from June 1991 until August 1993, MF during September and October 1993, and HF and MF from November 1993. HF and MF events are mainly distributed at depths of 500 - 1100 m above sea level (ASL), just below the lava dome, while LF events are widely distributed at depths from 500 m ASL to the interior of the dome itself. To efficiently detect earthquake families, we conducted a cross-correlation analysis of waveforms. Using the events one-by-one as reference events, we calculated peak correlation coefficients between each reference event and events that occurred within 24 h either side of the reference event. The results show that many earthquake families of all waveform types occurred throughout the growth period of the dome. The durations of most families were less than two weeks and were not related to the intensity of seismic activity. The incidence rate of events within each family reached a peak {{in the middle of the}} respective activity period. The results also suggest that the waveforms in several analyzed families gradually evolved over time. During periods when HF events intensified, several families appeared contemporaneously. In contrast, during periods when LF events intensified, the occurrence pattern of earthquake families was relatively simple: a new family became active only once the activity of the previous family had declined or ceased completely. A possible source mechanism for families of HF events is stick-slip within the stiff rocks surrounding the conduit; however, several different types of source mechanisms should be considered for families of LF events...|$|R
40|$|Four field areas, {{representing}} different tectonic settings, {{have been}} chosen to study eruption and post-eruption processes in rhyolite domes. These are Ngongotaha Dome, {{on the west side}} of Lake Rotorua; Mt Tarawera Volcanic Complex, in the Okataina Caldera Complex; Gebbies Pass, Banks Peninsula; and Mt Somers, South Canterbury. These field areas provide different vertical and horizontal sections through rhyolite dome structures and allow the investigation of internal structures at different levels within a dome. A holistic approach aims to integrate the various physical and chemical processes that have taken place during and after the emplacement of rhyolite domes. An extensive review of these processes forms a substantial part of the thesis and the basis for later investigations in the field and laboratory. A main aspect of the review is the structure of rhyolite melts and glasses and its influence on diffusion rates which in turn determine diffusion-controlled crystallisation processes. Physico-chemical changes at the transition melt-glass are also discussed. Rheological properties of rhyolitic melts have a pronounced effect on flow behaviour and diffusion processes. The influence of temperature, pressure, melt composition, water content (especially), solid particles and vesicles, on the viscosity are outlined, and the various methods for estimating the viscosity of rhyolitic rocks are compared. Crystallisation processes under conditions of a high degree of undercooling are reviewed and parameters which allow one to distinguish between crystallisation from the melt and crystallisation from the glassy state (devitrification) are identified. Both crystallisation processes frequently result in very similar products. Spherulitic growth occurs generally above the glass-transition temperature where growth rates are fastest. Overall growth times are estimated to range from hours to months depending on the spherulite morphology and size. Compositionally, spherulites connect the fields of plagioclase phenocrysts and glass matrix in the An-Ab-Or ternary system. Opening structures, such as lithophysae, 'lip'-structures and spherulites with central voids, form above the glass transition and ideas about their formation are given. In the context of crystallisation, the textural terminology of rhyolitic rocks is critically reviewed and the use of simple textural terms proposed. A wide variety of small-scale flow features in rhyolitic rocks such as foliation, lineation and deformation structures are investigated and their use in inferring local flow directions is evaluated. A strong similarity to analogous features in metamorphic rocks is pointed out. Large-scale extensional and compressional structures in close proximity in dome lobes point to a complex flow behaviour. The occurrence of prominent columnar joints in two field areas, Gebbies Pass and Mt Somers, required a detailed study of this type of jointing process. Existing theories focus on rocks of basaltic nature, but it is shown that same ideas can be applied to silica-rich rocks. Column features, such as their thickness, regularity of cross sections, surface morphology and their overall pattern are used to outline the cooling history and morphology of single lava domes and numerous domes with different spatial and temporal relationships to each other. A review of rhyolite domes outlines common and specific surface and internal structures. The transition from an explosive to an effusive eruption style is investigated and characteristics of <b>endogenous</b> and exogenous <b>dome</b> growths are compared. Ngongotaha and Wahanga Domes are predominantly exogenous in character and comprise between 6 - 11 and 4 - 5 dome lobes, respectively. Dome lobe lengths vary between 350 - 450 m and thicknesses between 200 - 300 m. This length of dome lobes represents the maximum lobe extent of highly viscous lavas after which dome lobes start to pile onto each other. Large rhyolite domes (diameter ≥ 900 m) with slow effusion rates and/or rapid solidification are therefore predominantly exogenous in character. Domes with a small diameter (< 500 m), such as the small dome at Ruawahia <b>Dome,</b> are predominantly <b>endogenous.</b> The results of recent dome growth simulations are applied to domes in the field areas and these allow the estimation of eruption rates and overall extrusion times. The eruption rate of Ngongotaha Dome was in the order of 20 m 3 8 - 1 and its overall emplacement time close to one year (336 days). The extension of a 1 D cooling model to two dimensions allows the study of the overall cooling time of a lava dome. Depending on the dome thickness, the transition of the entire dome to the glassy (solid) state is considerable and is estimated as 22 years for Ngongotaha Dome and 41 years for Wahanga Dome. A combination of the 2 D cooling model with the distribution of certain lithologies allows the estimation of the onset of crystallisation such as defined by the 'nucleation lag' time of spherulite crystallisation. 'Nucleation lag' times of spherulitic growth ranges from 3 - 12 years for the upper obsidian layer (U. OBS) to 15 - 23 years for the central felsitic rhyolite (CRHY) at Ngongotaha Dome. In rhyolite domes, main lithologies are distributed concentrically following the overall outline of the domes rather than individual dome lobes. Their distribution is therefore largely independent of the emplacement mode of the dome but controlled by the cooling history of the dome. In domes with complexly developed lithologies the following main types can be recognised: a carapace breccias (BB), a finely-vesicular pumice (FVP), an upper and lower obsidian layer (U. OBS and L. OBS), a felsitic/poikilitic rhyolite (RHY) and a central rhyolite with abundant opening structures (CRHY). The dome base is characterised by a basal breccia (BB) which frequently interfingers with obsidian bands of the L. OBS layer. Absence of obsidian layers is attributed to insulating effects of thick FVP and BB layers in relatively thick domes. Finally, alteration processes of rhyolites and resulting alteration products are discussed with a major emphasis on the hydration of rhyolitic glasses, formation of perlite and zeolites as well as lunitisation. Detailed studies in the field, involving sampling and measurements of structural elements in combination with the above outlined background, allow the extrusion and emplacement history of the domes to be investigated. They also show that rhyolite domes are highly individual in character and differences between them arise mainly from differences in setting, extrusion rate, dome morphology and cooling history...|$|R
