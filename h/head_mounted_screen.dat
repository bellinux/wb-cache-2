40|$|This paper investigates {{different}} usability testing methods, {{and details}} a final usability testing procedure for the PolyXpress application. Usability testing varies greatly and {{depends on the}} size, scope, and budget of a project. Jakob Nielsen, a usability expert, says usability testing generally involves finding test users, asking the users to perform representative tasks with the design, and observing/documenting what happens. There are three main types of usability testing methods: traditional, discount, and going-out-of-business. The methods range in scale, complexity, and cost. This paper specifically details the unique combination of the three main methods that should {{be used as the}} usability testing procedure for PolyXpress. PolyXpress usability testing should consist of recruiting five to fifteen test users, who are lead by a facilitator reading from a script, and should be documented using a GoPro camera with a <b>Head</b> Strap <b>Mount,</b> <b>screen</b> capture video using Display Recorder, and written notes. This paper also includes a list of recommendations for PolyXpress from preliminary usability testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of direction of gaze (d. o. g.) {{has been used}} for clinical purposes to detect illness, such as nystagmus, unusual fixation movements and many others. It also is used to determine the points of interest in objects. In this study we employ a {{measurement of}} d. o. g. as a computer interface. The interface provides a full keyboard as well as a mouse function. Such an interface is important to computer users with paralysis or in environments where hand-free machine interface is required. The study utilizes the commercially available (ISCAN Model RK 426 TC) headset which consists of an InfraRed (IR) source and an IR camera to sense deflection of the illuminating beam. It also incorporates image processing package that provides the position of the pupil as well as the pupil size. The study shows the ability of implementing a full keyboard, together with some control functions, imaged on a <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> monitor <b>screen.</b> This document is composed of four sections: (1) The Nature of the Equipment; (2) The Calibration Process; (3) Running Process; and (4) Conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of low cost <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> displays (HMDs), prices of HMD-based virtual reality setups dropped considerably. In various application areas personal <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> displays can be utilized {{for groups of}} users to deliver different context sensitive information to individual users. We present a hardware setup that allows attaching 12 or more HMDs to a single PC. Finally we demonstrate how a collaborative, educational, augmented reality application is used by six students wearing HMDs on a single PC simultaneously with interactive framerates.

Augmented Reality is on the one hand a technique to help teaching new construction tasks more visible by augmenting the reality of the user with 3 D or 2 D images shown in the field of vision or to help workers to do work with tools more precisely by showing points where to use a tool. The users can get the information by a <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> display. A newer approach is to get the information beamed by a laser which is also <b>head</b> <b>mounted,</b> to the surface of a component that somebody is working on.

40|$|Currently {{available}} <b>screen</b> and retinal <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> displays have insufficient {{field of}} view to fully exploit many {{virtual and augmented reality}} applications. Screen based displays suffer from weight and size restrictions as the image sources, electronics, and viewing optics need to be <b>head</b> <b>mounted.</b> Retinal displays need only the scanning and optical delivery components to be <b>head</b> <b>mounted,</b> but current retinal displays suffer from a small {{field of view}}. This paper proposes a novel, non-linear, non-paraxial optical design that enables an ultra-wide field of view display using existing small scan angle MOEMS scanners. A model of the design and estimated specifications is presented. The retinal display has an estimated 100 °H by 90 °V field of view at the pupil of each eye. The display will have XVGA resolution, and a 15 - 20 mm exit aperture, and estimated 4 cm eye relief...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we have {{investigated}} the comparative usability among three different viewing configurations of augmented reality (AR) system that uses a desktop monitor instead of a <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> display. In many cases, due to operational or cost reasons, the use of <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> displays may not be viable. Such a configuration is bound to cause usability problems because of the mismatch in the user’s proprioception, scale, hand eye coordination, and the reduced 3 D depth perception. We asked a pool of subjects to carry out an object manipulation task in three different desktop AR set ups. We measured the subject’s task performance and surveyed for the perceived usability and preference. Our results indicated that placing a fixed camera {{in the back of}} the user was the best option for convenience and attaching a camera on the user’s head for task performance. The results should provide a valuable guide for designing desktop augmented reality systems without <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> display...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, there have been {{striking}} developments in wearable computing. Among all the different forms of wearable devices, <b>Head</b> <b>Mounted</b> Displays (HMDs) are deemed the first seamless solution to enabling workers with real time contextual information and allowing companies to integrate with existing back-end systems.
