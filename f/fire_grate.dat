5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the crank axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that <b>fire</b> <b>grate</b> was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
25|$|This {{is mainly}} {{as a result}} of the {{construction}} methods used (flanged joints on the barrels and standard steel pipe for the flue tube). It is also gave bigger water spaces between the inside and outside plates. In consequence, the <b>fire</b> <b>grate</b> must have been considerably smaller than on the original.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, the campsites {{are rather}} {{different}} {{between the two}} wilderness areas. Boundary Waters' campsites have designated fire grates in the fire ring and a small fiberglass latrine. Quetico's campsites are far less used than BWCAW and many are not marked on maps. The sites themselves {{do not have a}} latrine (participants must dig a cat-hole at least 150 feet away from water and camp) nor do they have a <b>fire</b> <b>grate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the cause}} of the fire, the story goes that before going to bed, a lady of the house threw melted grease from the socket of a large {{candlestick}} into a <b>fire</b> <b>grate</b> in a lower storey {{of the house and the}} ensuing flames set alight the unswept chimney flue, the fire rapidly entering the new mansion wing through windows in the garret that had been left open by workmen. The keys had been taken offsite by carpenters and access to control the fire was impossible. Large numbers of people turned out to help, but their assistance was to no avail. Until the death of the earl in 1781 the cause had been carefully concealed and supernatural forces held to blame.|$|E
2500|$|Operationally, the {{locomotive}} didn't fare {{as well as}} was hoped due to its large cylinder size and small <b>fire</b> <b>grate</b> area (one fireman even commented disgustedly, [...] "All Hell couldn't keep steam up in that engine!"). During initial shakedown runs around Sacramento, it was found, for example, that the engine's cylinders, which were originally built with innovative rotary valves, were not working properly. This necessitated casting an all-new set of cylinders with conventional slide valves and a Stephenson valve gear.|$|E

How was it that she had again taken him by the coat, and again looked up into his face with those soft, trusting eyes? Was it a trick with her? Had she ever taken that other man by the coat in the same way, and smitten him also with the battery of her eyes? The loose sleeve of her dressing-gown had fallen back, {{and he could see}} that her arm was round and white, and very fair. Was she conversant with such tricks as these? His mother had called her clever and cunning as a serpent. Was it so? Had his mother seen with eyes clearer than his own, and was he now being {{surrounded}} by the meshes of a false woman's web? He moved away from her quickly, and stood upon the hearth-rug {{with his back to the}} empty <b>fire</b> <b>grate.</b>|$|E

50|$|Though {{there were}} luckily no human fatalities, Yosemite Valley {{suffered}} many damages. Trails and bridges were badly damaged, {{and about half}} of all accommodations were destroyed. Yosemite Lodge, which has its hotel rooms in separate individual buildings, had 189 cabins and 108 hotel rooms badly damaged or destroyed in the flooding, drastically depleting the hotel's capacity. Half of all campsites were destroyed. Trash cans, picnic tables, bearproof storage boxes, and <b>fire</b> <b>grates</b> floated down the river.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConsidering {{the various}} costs of current {{existing}} three biomass firing models in China, the most economically feasible biomass firing model is obtained according to {{discounted cash flow}} (DCF) methodology, which refers to net present value(NPV), payback period (np), internal rate of return(IRR) and discounted fuel price. Due to lower shipping cost and initial investment in equipments the biomass co-firing in PC furnace is better than dedicated biomass <b>firing</b> in <b>grate</b> furnace. And biomass pellet co-firing in existing larger capacity PC furnace is the most economical, followed by co-firing with rebuilt biomass firing device, dedicated biomass <b>firing</b> in <b>grate</b> furnace is the worse. Biomass pellet co-firing in existing larger capacity PC furnace has the highest NPV and IRR {{as well as the}} shortest np. Dedicated biomass <b>firing</b> in <b>grate</b> furnace has the second NPV, the lowest IRR and the longest np with state subsidy, without the state subsidy it is serious deficit. Meanwhile, biomass pellet co-firing in existing larger capacity PC furnace can save discounted fuel costs 25. 9 RMB/ton and 14. 07 RMB/ton in comparison with co-firing in PC furnace with rebuilt biomass firing device and dedicated biomass <b>firing</b> in <b>grate</b> furnace. And the economic benefits of co-firing can be further improved by taking account of the additional environmental benefits and higher boiler efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of NOx-formation in biomass <b>fired</b> <b>grate</b> furnaces requires {{the development of}} numerical models. To represent the variety in scales and physical processes {{playing a role in}} the conversion, newly developed submodels are required. Here, a submodel for the reverse combustion process in the solid fuel layer on the grate is described. The submodel is shown to give good predictions for the velocity of the combustion front {{as well as for the}} spatial profiles of porosity, oxygen mass fraction and temperature. These predictions are essential input for NOx-calculations...|$|R

2500|$|Camp Baker is the river's only put-in (launch) site. It {{consists}} of a [...] facility containing a three-bedroom, seasonally-occupied house for staff, a two-room ranger station, a two-story storage/maintenance building, an informational kiosk, two vault toilets, a parking lot for about 50 vehicles, boat launch ramps, and a camping area with picnic tables and <b>fire</b> <b>grates.</b> Access to the river is highly restricted by geography and private ownership of approximately 80 percent of the both banks. However, limited public access {{is provided by the}} Lewis & Clark National Forest at mid-canyon via Trail #309, Trail #310, Trail #311, and Trail #331. Twenty privately-owned, primitive, seasonally-available roads also provide access at the landowner's discretion.|$|R
40|$|Waste {{incineration}} is {{an important}} part of global waste management concepts. Thermal waste treatment should combine effective mineralisation and the reduction of toxic emissions from the gaseous and solid residues. Incineration systems with <b>firing</b> <b>grate</b> have been developed out of typical power plant technology. It has be stated that the <b>firing</b> <b>grate</b> technology is still a rough tool, which leads to not very stable process conditions. But this is still the most implemented technology. The fundamental problem is the very inhomogeneous waste composition. This work shows, based on fundamental data collected in three years at the waste incineration plant Darmstadt, Germany, how process optimisation with new simulation and analysis tools can work for the primary part of a waste incineration plant. It is pointed out whether the proposed techniques are feasible and whether there is an improvement in emission levels for the plant. It has been noticed, that at normal process conditions, some of the typical process situations cannot be recognised and controlled by the existing controller. The appearance of these typical process situations have such an effect on the overall plant behaviour, that detailed investigations make sense. For the incineration process, an optimal control strategy with complete sensor technique is existing. This strategy has been developed for the plant in Darmstadt. Nevertheless, at this plant in Darmstadt not all of the necessary sensors for an optimal control system are implemented. Therefore a control system has been developed, where early process information, especially from the incoming waste, is used to identify and control typical process situations successfully. (orig.)
