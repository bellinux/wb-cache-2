New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E

They could have made that public interest argument {{at any point in}} the three years. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a Member of Parliament, but they waited until it could sell most newspapers, at the point at which I became well-known and at my most famous." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was mighty glad to {{hear him}} say this, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> nervous when I was {{cruising}} off Porto Rico. Do you know, miss, that those waters are the very deepest in the whole world?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> told," [...] she said, [...] "that Englishmen were so slow! Why, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{known you}} {{scarcely}} {{a quarter of}} an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{sorry for}} Smith. But my own turn has come now. A {{few weeks ago}} Professor Van Dyke, of Princeton, asked this question: ...|$|R

60|$|While {{this terrible}} {{pounding}} {{was going on}} I heard various reports of its effect upon my neighbors. One of them, an agriculturist, with whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> on the best of terms, came with a clouded brow.|$|E
60|$|Before I could {{thank her}} she hastened to the piano. The chair near it, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{accustomed}} to occupy, stood empty. She struck a few chords--then glanced round at me--then looked back again at her music.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not WILL be yours," [...] Herminia {{corrected}} in that silvery {{voice of}} hers. [...] "AM yours already, Alan. I somehow {{feel as if}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> yours. I am yours this moment. You may do what you would with me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, you cast an {{evil eye}} on my play," [...] said Gwendolen, with a turn {{of her head}} and a smile. [...] "I began to lose as soon as you came to look on. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> winning till then." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Penfold smiled. [...] "It {{would have}} been better for me, perhaps, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> so determined, Withers. At any rate I mean to have my own way in this matter. I have not had a real holiday for years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (I {{recollect}} {{that speech}} well. I puzzled over it, {{even at that}} time, excited though I was. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> told that only low, wicked people ever used the word [...] "damn," [...] and I tried to reconcile things, and failed.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, James, {{my heart}} <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in Melbourne. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> yours. <b>I</b> {{thought that it}} was better for you that I should seem to be dead." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'Poor Mr. Coon!' I cried, and I felt mighty sorry, for Bobby and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> good friends, though I {{must admit}} that he has some habits of which I don't approve. 'Do {{you know how he}} {{happened}} to play in such hard luck, Mr. Crow?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I am beautiful," [...] Leslie went on, looking stormily out to sea. [...] "I hate my beauty.

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] I admitted, with a laugh, [...] "it is a {{good deal}} like one of my own. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> struck with that phase of our civilization." ...|$|R

60|$|Several {{months after}} I had {{returned}} home from my last visit, the first of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking {{me to come to}} him at once. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> his favorite among the younger generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.|$|E
60|$|I {{was best}} man. Jack and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> bosom friends, and, {{although}} I had lost my sweetheart, I {{did not intend}} to lose my friend into the bargain.
