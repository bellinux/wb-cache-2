25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. <b>Isocratic</b> <b>elution</b> is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{separation}} of biological molecules such as proteins {{would be better served}} by <b>isocratic</b> <b>elution</b> with an aqueous solvent, resolution of HPLC analysis should be tweaked in the area of stationary phases to elute such analytes that may be sensitive to organic solvents. Kanazawa et al. recognized the possibility of changing the LCST parameter through the addition of different moieties. Kanazawa’s group investigated the reversible changes of PNIPAAm once modifying it with a carboxyl end. It was suggested that the modification leads to faster changes in conformation due to the restrictions introduced by the carboxyl group. They attached the carboxyl-terminated PNIPAAm chains to (aminopropyl)silica and used it as packing material for HPLC analysis of steroids. The separation took place under isocratic conditions using pure water as the mobile phase, and controlled the temperature using a water bath. They were able to shift the LCST from 32 °C to 20 °C by making the solution 1M in NaCl concentration. Of the 5 steroids and benzene, only testosterone could be resolved from the other peaks below the LCST (5 °C, LCST=20 °C in 1M NaCl). Above the LCST (25 °C, LCST=20 °C in 1M NaCl), all of the peaks are well resolved, and there is an increasing trend of retention time versus temperature up to 50 °C.|$|E

The response (dependent variable) in the tree models consisted of the predicted retention factor (log kw) of the solutes, while a set of 266 molecular descriptors was used as explanatory variables in the tree building.

Besides the above mentioned, CART was also able to select hydrogen-bonding and molecular complexity descriptors. Since these variables are expected from QSRR knowledge, it demonstrates the potential of CART as a methodology to understand retention in chromatographic systems. The potential of CART to predict retention and thus occasionally to select an appropriate system for a given mixture was also evaluated.

Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process taking place in the column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a liquid-liquid extraction but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) late, once the mobile phase gets more concentrated in acetonitrile (i.e. in a mobile phase of higher eluting strength).|$|E

40|$|Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent, toxic and {{carcinogenic}} environmental pollutants {{consisting of}} two or more aromatic rings. The estimation of the toxicity of PAHs can be challenging and time-consuming due to the complexity of PAH-mixtures found in the environment, for example at contaminated sites. To solve the problem of a high complexity, PAH-mixtures can be divided into fractions. In the present study, Normal Phase (NP) and Reverse Phase (RP) Liquid Chromatography (LC) methods were evaluated and developed to separate and fractionate 16 U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) priority PAHs. Two stationary and six mobile phases, different column temperatures, flow rates, injection volumes, gradient and <b>isocratic</b> <b>elutions</b> were evaluated in order to achieve the best separation and fractionation. Best separation of PAHs was achieved with the RP-LC method using a phenyl stationary phase and gradient elution with mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and water.

The elution order of fractions was verified by identification and quantification of the PAHs by GC-MS. Fractionation of a soil extract with the developed RP-LC method resulted in successful separation and fractionation of five EPA’s priority PAHs naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene and chrysene, as well as two non-priority PAHs carbazole and 4 H-Cyclopenta[d,e,f]phenanthrene.

This report describes a systematic evaluation of the information-dependant acquisition (IDA) and sample preparation protocols for rapid protein identification from a complex mixture using a CB-ESI source compared with HPLC-ESI (gradient and <b>isocratic</b> <b>elutions).</b> Cytochrome c and a six-protein mixture (11 – 117 kDa) were used to develop an IDA protocol for rapid protein identification and to evaluate the effects of sample preparation protocols.

The chromatographic separations were performed with a reversed-phase C 8 column, except {{in the case of}} morphine, which was separated on a normal phase column. <b>Isocratic</b> and gradient <b>elutions,</b> ion pair technique, and UV detection were employed. Sample pretreatment involved the extensive application of solid-phase extractions and liquid-liquid extractions on solid supports. The specificity and sensitivity enabled the confirmation of morphine, benzoylecgonine, THC-COOH, amphetamine, and methamphetamine, six barbiturates, and nine benzodiazepines screened positive by EMIT in urine...|$|R
40|$|A multi-segment {{gradient}} {{method for}} {{the separation of}} ginsenosides in reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was developed. The retention parameters of 8 ginsenosides (Rg 1, Re, Rf, Rg 2, Rb 1, Rc, Rb 2 and Rd) were obtained on an ODS 2 C 18 column (4. 6 mm x 250 mm) {{from a series of}} <b>isocratic</b> acetonitrile-water <b>elution.</b> It is found that two-parameter retention equation of ginsenosides can't be used to accurately predict the resolution, but the three-parameter retention equation can. The reason is that the retention factor k' decreases fast while the volume fractions of acetonitrile increase in mobile phase, which make the precision of two-parameter retention equation can't satisfy the predicting need of resolution. Based on the three-parameter retention equation, an optimum elution program consisting of three segments was developed. Under the optimized gradient conditions, the retention time and resolution of ginsenosides are in good agreement with the predicted ones. The analysis time of ginsenosides is shortened and the resolution is improved by the method...|$|R
40|$|A rapid, {{specific}} and accurate isocratic HPLC method {{was developed and}} validated for the assay of abacavir sulfate in pharmaceutical dosage forms. The assay involved an <b>isocratic</b> – <b>elution</b> of abacavir sulfate in Grace C 18 column using mobile phase composition consists of (38 : 62 v/v) of methanol and 10 ml of potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate. The wavelength of detection is 255 nm. The method showed good linearity {{in the range of}} 10 - 50. 0 mg/mL. The runtime of the method is 8 mins. The proposed method can be used for routine quality control samples in industry in bulk and in finished dosage forms. In present study, a rapid specific precise and validated HPLC method for the quantitative estimation of abacavir sulfate in pharmaceutical dosage forms has been reported. The developed method can be applied to directly and easily to the analysis of the pharmaceutical tablet preparations. The percentage recoveries were near 100 % for given methods. The method was completely validated and proven to be rugged. The excipients did not interfere in the analysis. The results showed that thi...|$|R
