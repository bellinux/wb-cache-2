50|$|One of Norway's two nuclear {{reactors}} {{is located in}} Halden. The Halden Boiling Water Reactor is a research reactor located 100 m within Månefjell, adjacent to the Saugbrugs paper mill. It is in operation about 50% of the time and, in addition to research data, supplies steam to the mill. The reactor is operated by the Institute for Energy Technology, one of Halden's largest employers, and is the largest experimental facility operated for OECD <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> research. IFE's Man-Technology-Organisation laboratory is IFE's other major facility, and was opened by Norway's crown prince regent in March 2004. This new laboratory building houses the most recent incarnations of the Halden Man-Machine Laboratory (HAMMLAB) and Halden Virtual Reality Centre's (HVRC) VR laboratory. The OECD <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> (established in 1958) {{is one of the}} world's longest running international research collaborations, with 20 countries participating (2005) and the largest international research project in Norway. This ensures a steady influx of international guest scientists to the city. The fact that Norway has no commercial interest in nuclear power ensures that Halden is viewed internationally as a neutral location. In national politics, the reactor is controversial, however locally it has had support from the majority of political parties and the city's population. Some of the largest IT companies in Halden, such as Hand-El Skandinavia (now part of the OM Technology group) and ScandPower, are spin-offs from IFE.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a report}} on the {{evaluation}} of the Swedish participation in the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> 2006 - 2014. The study has consisted in evaluating the types and extent of added value from the Swedish participation in the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project,</b> and to determine what additional added value the participation could supply for the Swedish authority. It can be concluded from the study that the impacts from the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> are extensive and wide ranging, reaching beyond the scope of what has been possible to cover in the evaluation. This limitation is mainly due to the long history and continuity of the collaboration, extending far beyond the scope of the study. The evaluation further concludes that the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> has come to play a systemic role for the nuclear sector in Sweden, supplying significant portions of the data underlying safety oriented research and development within the areas concerned. These impacts have mainly been realized in industry, and are promoted in particular by voluntary, bottom-up coordination and engagement by industry stakeholders. Academia has seen little added value from the Swedish participation in the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project,</b> while the public sector has benefited somewhat, however, its engagement has been limited in comparison with peer countries Finland and Switzerland. The evaluation team recommends that the Swedish stakeholders continue funding the participation in the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project.</b> Additionally, the Swedish authority’s funding of research infrastructures in general should be safeguarded by acknowledging this type of investment in the research strategy. The distinct and fundamental role of research infrastructures in innovation systems is being increasingly recognized, and the participation in the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> is a clear example of the value of such institutions for the continuous expansion of knowledge. Furthermore, the Swedish strategy for benefiting from the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> should be further elaborated, taking into account the possible actions of strengthening coordination, increasing funding to supplementary domestic research, and reviewing the responsibilities of the officials administering the Swedish participation...|$|E

The quantitative evaluation of the results of these simulations in terms of crew performance and Human Error Probabilities (HEPs) is quite a difficult task.

40|$|The LOCA test series IFA- 650 {{conducted}} at the OECD <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> (HRP) has provided unique data {{on the performance of}} fuel rods during LOCA transients. One focus of the current investigations is the performance of the fuel in the ballooning stage of the LOCA transient. In this stage, relocation of fuel material is a possibility, in which case pellet fragments fall down to fill the void introduced by the increased volume of the ballooned cladding. This increases the heat load in that region, further promoting corrosion of the cladding. A special concern in the case of high-burnup fuels is the increasing number of small fuel fragments, which may be expected to cause a higher packing fraction in the ballooned region.     In this work, a novel technique is presented for assessing the average density of the fuel material in the ballooned region of LOCA test rods. The investigation is based on non-destructive gamma emission tomography measurements, using the dedicated instrument recently developed at the HRP in collaboration with Westinghouse (Sweden) and Uppsala University. In this approach, the gamma radiation field surrounding the test rod has been measured with a narrowly collimated HPGe detector. Tomographic reconstruction of the data was performed, providing the radial gamma-ray source distribution within the measured volume, which reveals the fuel fragment distribution. From this, the density of the fuel in the measured volume (i. e., the packing fraction) may be calculated.   The technique has been used to investigate a LOCA test rod of the <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> LOCA series. The LOCA experiment was carried out about one month prior to the gamma tomography examination. The results show that the distribution of the relocated fuel can be imaged using gamma rays from fission products. The reconstructions of the 662 keV rays from 137 Cs and 1596 keV from 140 Ba/La are demonstrated. In addition, the peaks of activation products offer valuable information on the location of the test rig structures, which may be utilized in a quantitative tomographic reconstruction to assess the spatially resolved packing fraction...|$|E

40|$|Computational {{intelligence}} (CI) is {{the study}} of the design of intelligent agents.

40|$|Flight control systems, railway {{interlocking}} systems, {{and nuclear}} reactor protection systems {{are examples of}} safety critical systems from different industrial domains. A safety critical system within any of these domains requires some type of acceptance from a safety authority prior to commissioning. The minimum prerequisite for achieving acceptance is to comply with relevant normative requirements from regulations and standards. Safety standards and guidelines typically define the safety objectives to be met by a system and {{by the process of}} developing the system. In this thesis we present a method and a pattern language called Safe Control Systems (SaCS) for development of conceptual safety designs. By a conceptual safety design we mean an early stage specification of system requirements, system design, and safety case for a safety critical system. The SaCS method consists of: (1) The SaCS process – a process for the systematic application of patterns as development support. (2) The library of SaCS patterns – a collection of patterns providing guidance on effective solutions to different challenges relevant when developing conceptual safety designs. The library is structured into patterns for requirements capture, system design and safety assurance {{in the form of a}} safety case. (3) The SaCS pattern language – a language for defining patterns and for specifying the application of patterns for safety design conceptualisation. The three artefacts are complementary and their integration represents a combined approach to pattern-based development. The patterns in the library represent safety engineering best practices inspired by international safety standards and guidelines. Applying patterns according to the SaCS process supports establishing the evidence that the conceptualisation of systems is being performed according to a suitable process and according to accepted practices. The pattern language supports the specification of patterns and the documentation of their use. The SaCS method has been evaluated in three different studies: (1) Study 1 – a case study on safety design conceptualisation of a nuclear power plant control system; (2) Study 2 – a case study on safety design conceptualisation of a railway interlocking system; (3) Study 3 – an analytic evaluation of the suitability of the SaCS pattern language for its intended task. The experiences and results from the different evaluations indicate that the SaCS method facilitates the development of conceptual safety designs by systematically combining and applying patterns as development support.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} still largely {{unexplored}} issues of redundancy and diversity {{as seen in}} the context of condition monitoring systems, and more specifically in on-line signal validation systems. We believe these aspects should play a more central {{role in the development of}} such systems so that the potential for common cause failures of the models used for condition monitoring is minimised. Accurate monitoring of operating conditions can have a significant impact on the operation of modern plants, with respect to production, accident management and maintenance. Such monitoring is based on a collection of sensors. During plant operation, some sensors may experience anomalies (e. g. drifts or failures), which might convey inaccurate or misleading information about the actual plant state to automated controls and to the operators. A robust monitoring system must be able to detect such anomalies and reconstruct correctly the signals of the failed sensors, as done for example in the PEANO system developed at the OECD <b>Halden</b> <b>Reactor</b> <b>Project</b> [1].
