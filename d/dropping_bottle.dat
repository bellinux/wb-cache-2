Recently (4) a modification of this method was employed to determine boron in thin films of pyro-lyt ical ly deposited borosil icate glass. The details and short discussion of the procedure are presented here.

40|$|How to use {{hematoxylin}} for cytological studies. Background McClintock, Singleton, and Barry found aceto-orcein {{excellent for}} visualizing fine structure of chromosomes at pachytene and other stages (see Barry 1966, 1996). In their squash preparations, however, the cytoplasm was characteristically filled with coarse 'bubbles ' that often obscured observations. Lu and Raju (1970) developed a procedure using hemotoxylin (adapted from Henderson) which stains fungal chromosomes, nucleolus and spindle-pole bodies effectively while leaving the cytoplasm clear and transparent. (Compare photographs in Singleton 1953 and Raju 1980.) Aceto-orcein {{may still be}} preferred for fine details of pachytene chromosome morphology, however. Procedure for examining meiosis and ascus development (From Raju and Newmeyer 1977) Preparation of mordant and stain. A supersaturated mordant solution is made by adding 10 g of ferric acetate to 100 ml of 50 % aqueous propionic acid in a glass-stoppered bottle. The bottle is stored at room temperature (~ 22 º C) and occasionally shaken. After about 2 months, small amounts of the supernatant can be decanted to a <b>dropping</b> <b>bottle</b> for use, leaving {{the rest of the}} contents for further saturation. The mordant keeps well for several years at room temperature. The decanted mordant can be diluted with...|$|E

40|$|Perfect {{preservation}} of cytoplasmic and nuclear detail {{is essential in}} cytology: even transient drying of a smear either before or after fixation is deleterious. This creates a problem for a postal cytodiagnostic service as bottles containing inflammable fixative may not be posted. Various rehydration techniques (Bonime, 1961; Koss and Durfee, 1961) have been tried and found unsatis-factory. Dipping the fixed slide in glycerine (Ayre and Dakin, 1946) is satisfactory but makes handling some-what unpleasant. The fixative detailed below appears {{to solve the problem}} by leaving, after evaporation, a waxy protective film over the smear. Absolute alcohol ' [...] 100 ml. Carbowax (1500) [...] 3 0 g. Glacial acetic acid [...] 0 - 2 ml. (to pH 5 8 - 6 0) If the fixative cannot be collected from the laboratory, the carbowax and acetic acid may be dissolved in 5 - 0 ml. of warm distilled water. This small quantity of base material can be sent through the post and the alcohol added by the receiving clinic. The fixative is applied from a plastic <b>dropping</b> <b>bottle</b> on to the smear immediately it has been made and while it is still wet. The slide is then left on a flat surface, not near heat, for about five or 10 minutes during which time the alcohol will evaporate and a waxy film will be left over the smear. The slide is put in a 4 in. x 1 in. trans-parent plastic bag: several of these then go into a wooden postal slide box of conventional pattern. Slides with a ground area at one end are used in this service: the patient's name can be written in pencil on this area for identification purposes. Over 2, 000 smears have been fixed and posted in this way during the past few months with highly satisfactory results. The method is simple and cheap and there is no danger of contamination between slides. We are indebted to many medical and lay members of the North Western branch of the Family Planning Association for cooperation in developing this technique...|$|E
