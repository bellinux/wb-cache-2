The second objective is to assess by observing how many children eat the <b>protein</b> <b>foods</b> in the school canteens. A comparation of the menus of three selected school canteens was the third goal.

In this article he puts forward several recommendations for the prevention and control of staphylococcus food poisoning. Staphylococcus bacterium is commonly found in nature and the organisms are widespread among healthy persons, being present on the skin, in the throat and in the nasal passages. In the majority of the outbreaks occurring in England and Wales due to the enterotoxin, the incriminated vehicle has been a protein foodstuff (meat), which has been cooked the day previous to its being consumed. There appears to be only one effective way of controlling this type of food poisoning and that is to prevent pathogenic staphylococci from producing the enterotoxin in cooked <b>protein</b> <b>foods.</b> In this regard, guidance in treating stored food, including the maximum temperatures at which to keep cold or hot cooked <b>protein</b> <b>foods</b> is provided.

40|$|Background: A {{phenylalanine}} (Phe) restricted dietary {{management is}} required in phenylketonuria (PKU) to maintain good metabolic control. Nevertheless, five different models of dietary regimes, which differ in their accuracy of Phe documentation, are used. To investigate {{the effect of the}} dietary regime on metabolic control, a multicenter evaluation was performed. Patients/Methods: 149 patients (max. 800  mg Phe-intake/day; 108 children aged 1 – 9  years and 41 adolescents aged 10 – 15  years) could be included. They were separated according to age and dietary regime, revealed by a questionnaire on dietary habits. Dietary regimes vary from daily strict calculation of all Phe-intake (group 1) to a rather loose regime only estimating Phe-intake and including high <b>protein</b> <b>food</b> (group 5). Data were analyzed with respect to metabolic control (Phe-concentrations, Phe-concentrations above upper recommended limit during 6  months before the interview), Phe-intake (mg/day) and age (years). Results: Median Phe-concentrations in children did not differ significantly among diet groups (group 1 : 161; 2 : 229, 3 : 236, 4 : 249, 5 : 288  μmol/l, p =  0. 175). However, exact daily Phe calculation led to significantly lower percentage of Phe concentrations above the upper recommended limit (group 1 : 17, 2 : 50, 3 : 42, 4 : 50, 5 : 75 %, p =  0. 035). All included patients showed good to acceptable metabolic control. Patients on the dietary regime with the least accuracy, consuming also high <b>protein</b> <b>foods,</b> showed the poorest metabolic control. Median Phe concentrations of all other groups remained within recommended ranges, including from groups not calculating special low <b>protein</b> <b>foods,</b> fruit and vegetables and using a simplified system of recording Phe-intake. In adolescents no significant differences among diet groups were revealed. Conclusion: Exact calculation of Phe content of all food is not necessary to achieve good metabolic control in children and adolescents with PKU. Excluding special low <b>protein</b> <b>food,</b> as well as fruit and vegetables from calculation of Phe-intake has no impact on metabolic control. However including <b>protein</b> rich <b>food</b> into the diet and simply estimating all Phe-intake appears insufficient. The simplification of dietary regime may be helpful in enhancing acceptability and feasibility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} has documented a negative association between maternal report of child food neophobia and reported frequency of consumption of fruit, vegetables, and meat. This study aimed to establish whether neophobia {{is associated with}} lower intake of these food types in naturalistic mealtime situations. Methods One hundred and nine parents of 4 – 5 year olds completed questionnaires which included a six-item version of the Child Food Neophobia Scale (CFNS). The children {{took part in a}} series of 3 test lunch meals at weekly intervals at school at which they were presented with: chicken, cheese, bread, cheese crackers, chocolate biscuits, grapes and tomatoes or carrot sticks. Food items served to each child were weighed before and after the meal to assess total intake of items in four categories: Fruit and vegetables, <b>Protein</b> <b>foods,</b> Starchy foods and Snack foods. Pearson Product Moment Correlations and independent t tests were performed to examine associations between scores on the CFNS and consumption during lunches. Results Neophobia was associated with lower consumption of fruit and vegetables, <b>protein</b> <b>foods</b> and total calories, but there was no association with intake of starch or snack foods. Conclusion These results support previous research that has suggested that neophobia impacts differentially on consumption of different food types. Specifically it appears that children who score highly on the CFNS eat less fruit, vegetables and <b>protein</b> <b>foods</b> than their less neophobic peers. Attempts to increase intake of fruit, vegetables and protein might usefully incorporate strategies known to reduce the neophobic response. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the consumption of proteinous food in Remo division of Ogun State, Nigeria. Primary data were obtained in a cross-section survey of 120 randomly selected households drawn {{by a combination of}} a multi-stage random sampling and stratified random sampling techniques. Descriptive statistics and ordinary least square (OLS) regression techniques were employed for data analysis. The descriptive statistics of the socio-economic characteristics of proteinous food consumers show that majority (56. 7 %) of the household heads are about 40 years old, most (73 %) of the households’ heads are males, of which about 68 % are married. A high percentage of the households heads are well educated with mean household size of 4 and mean monthly income of N 15, 000. 00. The per capita expenditures on the two classes of proteinous source of foods indicate that the mean per capita expenditure (N 1266. 11) on animal <b>protein</b> source <b>food</b> (APSF) is greater than the per capita expenditures (N 239. 12) on plant <b>protein</b> source <b>food</b> (PPSF). The results show that animal protein and plant protein consumption accounted for N 5, 064. 43 and N 956. 48 of the household monthly disposable income respectively, representing 41 % and 7. 8 % of household monthly disposable income of the household. With respect to the determinants of plant <b>protein</b> source <b>food</b> (APSF) and plant <b>protein</b> <b>food</b> consumption, the linear regression model was chosen as the lead equations on the basis of high R 2, the conformity of the signs of the coefficients with apriori expectations. The R 2 for animal <b>protein</b> source <b>food</b> (APSF) consumption is 0. 80 indicating that 80 % of the variations in APSF consumption is due to the influence of the explanatory variables while that plant <b>protein</b> source <b>food</b> consumption is rather low (29 %).
