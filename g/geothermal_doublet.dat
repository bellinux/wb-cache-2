One of the main initiators of geothermal energy production in the Netherlands is the Delft Geothermal Project (DAP). Furthermore DAP supports the realization of geothermal projects with technical advice and research, mostly done by students of the TU Delft. This report is one example of this effort. The Distributed Fiber-Optic Temperature-Sensing (DTS) technique represents a new physical approach for temperature measurements in the geosciences and environmental sciences. It is based on optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR). DTS is a promising new technology, continuously measuring the temperature profile along the whole length of the glass fiber in the borehole. Profiling the whole well is an improvement compared with the conventional methods, because it is also showing temperature losses within the well. Knowing more about these losses within the system is essential to design strategies to increase the cost effectiveness.

In addition, the shape of the subsidence pattern gives information about the subsurface parameters like the elastic profile.

40|$|Understanding the {{emergence}} of renewable energy technologies is recently put central in research since the need to influence innovation towards more sustainable directions is high on political agendas. Where many studies focus principally on cost developments for deployment potentials of renewable energy technologies, this research focuses primarily on supply constraints of renewable energy technologies {{in order to determine}} their physical deployment over time. This supply-based perspective provided insight in the prominent factors of market upscale processes and thereby revealed prospected deployment bottlenecks over time. This research determines the deployment potential of deep geothermal and offshore wind energy in the Netherlands for the period 2010 - 2020. The analysis shows - supposing that the Dutch government and the deep geothermal industry take all required precautionary measures in 2011 - that approximately 400 deep <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets</b> and approximately 1700 offshore wind turbines may be realized in 2020. The results of the deployment potentials show that the projection by the Dutch Energy Research Centre of 11 PJ in 2020 is quasi-ambitious and that the target of the Dutch government of 6000 MW in 2020 is very ambitious. It shows furthermore that the mandatory EU renewable energy target of 14 % of the final energy use in the Netherlands in 2020 can be attained much earlier if the proposed actions in this report are undertaken by the Dutch government as well as the deep geothermal and offshore wind industry. It shows subsequently that the Dutch renewable energy target of 20 % of the primary energy use in the Netherlands in 2020 can merely be attained if the proposed actions in this report are undertaken by the Dutch government as well as the deep geothermal and offshore wind industry. Innovation system analyses provide insights about inducement and blocking mechanisms and provide detailed recommendations for policy. These outcomes are however often predominantly based on on qualitative assessments. Deployment potential assessments provide insights in possible market upscale bottlenecks and may strengthen the policy recommendation outcomes of innovation system analyses with quantitative arguments.

40|$|The {{conception}} {{of this project}} supported by ADEME funds has emerged following {{the context of the}} renewal of geothermal exploitation in the Dogger aquifer. Indeed many new projects of doublets or rehabilitation of existing operations have been carried out or are currently under investigation. In particularly in the west of the Val-de-Marne department where there is an increasing number of geothermal operations in a limited space. As a consequence of this fast development, {{there is a need to}} increase the reliability and to reduce uncertainties of the models used to predict the operation lifetime and the emergence of the "thermal breakthrough". One uncertainty of these models is the hydraulic interference between the different doublets. The project includes two stages. The first stage consisted of the design and the achievement of the hydraulic test which was carried out in September 2013. The test included 5 <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets</b> (Cachan 1 and 2, Chevilly-Larue, l'Haÿ-Les-Roses and Fresnes) located south-west of Paris in Val-de-Marne department. The test was conducted during approximately 4 days including a period of installation/uninstallation of the wells equipment and taking into accounts the constraints of operators. The hydraulic test was carried out as followed: 1. All the five doublets were stopped during a period of 36 hours for stabilizing pressure in the tested area. 2. L'Haÿ-Les-Roses doublet has produced (both producer and injector) for a period of 54 hours and pressure interferences were measured during this period at the other wells. 3. L'Haÿ-Les-Roses doublet has then been stopped for a period of 6 hours during which the recompression of the reservoir has been followed. All the wells were equipped with pressure and temperature sensors at the well head. Three injector wells (Cachan 2, Chevilly-Larue and Fresnes) were also equipped with pressure and temperature sensors at the shoe of the well casing. The second stage under development consists of the interpretation of the interference test which will allow improving the local knowledge of the Dogger aquifer in the targeted area of the Val-de-Marne. This interpretation will include the transmissivity field between doublets and aquifer storage capacity. The program OUAIP developed at BRGM and dedicated to the interpretation and simulation of pumping tests will be used for this application. The interpreted data will be compared to the transmissivity field actually used in the models and based on geostatistical methods and local well transmissivity data (build-up pressure at production well). According to the results, these new data will be integrated into a numerical reservoir model that will be calibrated on pressure field in order to validate the field velocity and consequently heat transfer calculation. The calibrated model will allow increasing the reliability of the development of the "cold bubbles" in this sector densely exploited and helping decision makers for a sustainable development of the Dogger aquifer. This project is a first of its kind on deep geothermal operations. Following the expected results, the hydraulic test could be replicated in other sectors with high geothermal development (e. g. Seine-Saint-Denis department) ...|$|R
30|$|Our scaling {{forensic}} approach {{highlights the}} critical interaction {{of natural and}} technical (operational) conditions with regard to an increased carbonate scaling and steel corrosion potential and associated problematic scale-fragment development. The exploitation of Upper Jurassic carbonate aquifer H 2 S-containing Na–Ca–HCO 3 –Cl thermal water (Mayrhofer et al. 2014; Stober 2014; Dussel et al. 2016; Goldbrunner and Vasvari 2016) entails a significant hydrogeochemical potential for both carbonate scaling and steel corrosion. This natural environmental potential consists in the initial versus disturbed dissolved carbonate equilibria leading to carbonate scaling and several corrosive constituents (H 2 S, CO 2, Cl−, H 2) in combination with high temperatures and high flow rates (component supply) effecting steel deterioration. Evaluating the source of H 2 S delivered with the regional thermal waters, thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) at sufficiently high temperatures (100 – 140  °C) and in association with various organic materials was discussed (Mayrhofer et al. 2014). These redox reactions would {{also contribute to the}} dissolved (inorganic) carbon budget, although the high aqueous solution (δ 13 CDIC = − 0.2 ‰ VPDB; Seibt 2010) and high calcite scale (δ 13 C = − 1.5 to − 0.5 ‰ VPDB; this study) stable carbon isotopic compositions argue against a major organic contribution with regard to dissolved carbonate species and potential carbonate precipitation. Based on the available hydrochemical data and calculations performed, it further seems possible that the scaling problems encountered at the study sites are partially the result of physicochemical conditions associated with a deep fault zone. This is supported by prominently high aqueous solution pCO 2 values, high water temperatures, and eventually other (e.g., sulfur isotopic) indicators. Fault zones are considered a primary target of productive geothermal wells in the region although being difficult to constrain spatially (Wolfgramm et al. 2009; Stober 2014; Dussel et al. 2016; Goldbrunner and Vasvari 2016, Przybycin et al. 2017). Deep faults delivering abundant CO 2 might further be associated with hypogenic karstification, i.e., providing an efficient mechanism for aquifer host rock dissolution and potential secondary carbonate precipitation. In essence, fault zones could entail favorable (high discharge and high temperature) as well as unfavorable (chemical constituents such as CO 2) production conditions. Considering the technical (operational) potential of the two studied <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets</b> with regard to carbonate scaling and corrosion in the production wells, the selection of materials in contact with the thermal fluid is likely of major importance. The occurrence of metal sulfide corrosion layers favoring scale-fragment development and probably being a partial source of the dark scale coloring should diminish when more corrosion resistant (alloyed or coated surface) steels are used. A major effect of corrosion layers enhancing carbonate precipitation in contrast to plastic coatings reducing the overall scale thicknesses was supported by observations and simulations of a recent study (Wanner et al. 2017). We are aware, however, that the application of specific materials might not always be viable due to other circumstances (e.g., costs, abrasive effects, temperature resistance). In order to avoid accumulation and critical cementation of scale-fragments, these should be filtered/removed timely and near the heat exchanger surface or other obstacles during water flow. Thermal water production cessations and restarts most likely {{have a significant effect on}} scale-fragment mobilization, i.e., causing additional mechanical stress from pressure and temperature changes, increased (micro)turbulences, and probably elevated (abrasive) particle concentrations. To summarize, scaling forensics can help to better understand the site-specific favorable and unfavorable physicochemical processes determining scaling and/or corrosion of affected geothermal power plants.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the {{feasibility}} of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> in the former Barendrecht gas field is investigated. The aim of this work is to stay {{as closely as possible}} to the original well configuration. An IMPEXS model for the movement of the cold-water and thermal front is built to calculate the possible potential of the field. Wellbore heat losses and pump capacity were taken into account to evaluate the exergy (useful energy) created by the <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet.</b> The results obtained by the model show that the amount of injected cold-water and consequently the amount of heat extraction from the gas field is very sensitive to the permeability of the field and the viscosity of the fluid. Inclusion of heat gain from over- and under-burden in the numerical model causes the thermal front to move slower. Since {{the feasibility}} of the project is predominantly dependent on the duration of the saturation of the field, this effect will not improve {{the feasibility of}} the project. Because only gas at a low pressure is still present in the reservoir, the field has to be saturated with cold water before production of hot water can be started. This process takes around 30 years. After that, a production rate of 5 m 3 /hr can be established. The temperature of the production would be 69. 7 °C initially and becomes 64 °C after 500 years. When taking into account a pump that uses 100 KW to pump the water out of the formation, an exergy of 200 KW can be established. Because of the large saturation time and the limited exergy compared to other sustainable energy sources it is concluded that this project is not feasible.

40|$|The Dutch Government {{is aiming}} for a CO 2 neutral energy supply in 2050; this {{requires}} a transition from using energy from fossil fuels to using renewable energy sources. Decline in oil production in the Netherlands occurs in an epoch with an increased interest in geothermal heat production as an alternative source of energy. In the present study it is investigated how oil production from stranded fields (fields abandoned when field development was considered not to be profitable), especially those with heavy oil, can add value to a geothermal project when thermally-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with injection of hot water from a geothermal reservoir into an oil reservoir and coproduction of oil and geothermal energy is considered. The main {{focus is on the}} oil reservoir, while productivity and temperature of the geothermal source is assumed to be constant. In order to determine the feasibility of such project, a geological model for an oil reservoir was constructed, taking the Moerkapelle field as a case study, so that reservoir simulations can be performed on it and results in terms of oil production, heat production, total energy production and economics can be obtained and analyzed. Geological modelling (structural and stratigraphic) and reservoir simulation are developed in three different stages, every time making the model more complex (i. e. heterogeneity due to structural and sedimentary features). Project feasibility was calculated in terms of the percentage of reduction on the required subsidy for a geothermal project (required subsidy is the one that makes the NPV of a geothermal project to be zero under a pre-royalty pre-tax framework). For a homogeneous reservoir the reduction in required subsidy for a single <b>doublet</b> <b>geothermal</b> project can reach 85 % and complete subsidy independence can be achieved when scaling up the project to 3 or more doublets. However, for heterogeneous reservoirs, the subsidy reduction for a single <b>doublet</b> <b>geothermal</b> project would not be higher than 52 % in the most optimistic case and, when all the realizations are taken into account, there is no added value from the synergy but still an average reduction in the NPV of 13 %. Scaling up the project to 3 or more doublets generates an average reduction of 31 % in the required subsidy with a maximum reduction of 73 % in the most optimistic case. <br/...|$|R

For this purpose detailed fluvial facies architecture models are created utilizing a process-based facies modelling approach. These models and reservoir properties {{are based on a}} geological dataset of the Lower Cretaceous Nieuwerkerk Formation in the West Netherlands Basin (WNB). Results of the sensitivity analysis show that a 10 % variation in well spacing from a 1000 m base case scenario could vary the NPV by 10 %. The minimal required well spacing is dependent on the reservoir thickness, flow rate and the allowed production temperature drop. The simulations results show that the theoretical advantage of a reduction in well spacing could be balanced by a poor well connectivity between the wells because of the characteristic of fluvial reservoir architecture.

40|$|The city of The Hague {{intends to}} use {{geothermal}} energy to heat approx. 4000 houses in a planned {{urban development area}} called The Hague South-West. This paper describes the application of advanced seismic interpretation workflows to help positioning a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> consisting of one injector - and one producer well. An existing 3 D seismic data volume was reprocessed and inverted to acoustic impedance. The main objectives {{of the study were}} to predict the thickness of the target Rijswijk and Delft sandstones and to visualize faults and fractures that might act as permeability barriers between injector and producer. The inverted acoustic impedance volume revealed several layers of low and high impedances in and around the targeted sandstones in which lateral stratigraphic variations are observed. To visualize faults and fractures the seismic data were first filtered using two dip-steered filters Next a similarity volume and a neural network generated Fault Cube were produced and highlighted major and minor fault systems at target levels. The study results were used to assist in picking the optimal locations for the doublet. The lack of impedance contrasts and available well data prevented further quantitative work like predicting thickness and porosity of the target sandstones...|$|E
40|$|In the {{production}} well of a low-enthalpy <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> hot water is pumped from reservoirs at about 50 - 1007 deg;C. After {{passing through a}} heat exchanger, the cold water is re-injected at about 20 - 357 deg;C in the injection well into the reservoir, which initially has the same temperature as the produced water. Under some circumstances, this {{may lead to the}} initiation of thermal fractures around the injection well, an effect known from water injection in oil wells. This will increase the productivity index (PI), thereby also increasing the efficiency and profitability of the doublet. Using a simple analytical approach, we studied whether thermal fractures are theoretically expected under typical reservoir and injection conditions. From data at high temporal resolution of two geothermal doublets were studied {{over a longer period of}} injection to check if the development of a thermal fracture is observed The conclusion that can be drawn from the calculations is that cold fractures hardly develop under the assumed conditions. However, the uncertainty on the pressure estimation necessary for the fracture calculation is relatively large. Possible fracture development is very sensitive to value of the minimum horizontal stress and lowering by 10 % allows the initiation of fractures in both doublets...|$|E
40|$|Required {{distance}} between doublet systems in low enthalpy geothermal heat exploitation {{is often not}} fully elucidated. The required distance aims to prevent negative interference influencing the utilisation efficiency of doublet systems. Currently production licence areas are often issued based on the expected extent of the reinjected cold water plume on the moment of thermal breakthrough. The production temperature, however, may not immediately drop to non-economic values after this moment. Consequently, heat production could continue increasing {{the extent of the}} cold water plume. Furthermore, the area influenced by pressure because of injection and production spreads beyond the cold water plume extent, influencing not only the productivity of adjacent doublet systems but also the shape of cold water plumes. This affects doublet life time, especially if adjacent doublets have different production rates. In this modelling based study a multi parameter analysis is carried out to derive dimensionless relations between basic doublet design parameters and required doublet distance. These parameters include the spacing between injector and producer of the same doublet, different production rates, aquifer thickness and minimal required production temperature. The results of this study can be used to minimize negative interference or optimise positive interference aiming at improving <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> deployment efficiency. </p...|$|E
40|$|We present two running {{applications}} of direct use of low temperature geothermal resources for {{heating and cooling}} of public buildings, recently realized in the Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) Region - Northeastern Italy - with public fundings. The Grado Geothermal Pilot Project was an ambitious challenge, initiated in 2002 and completed in early 2015, aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and sustainability of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> on the Grado Island (GO), in the northern Adriatic coastal area, by: i) characterizing the geothermal carbonate reservoir of the Grado area, ii) estimating its heat potential, iii) drilling a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet,</b> with one production and one re - injection well. The project had a total cost of 5 million € and included two phases. The 1 st phase, completed in 2008, confirmed {{the existence of a}} low temperature geothermal reservoir within the buried carbonate platform, assessed its geothermal potential and verified the feasibility of the district heating plant in Grado. Seismic and gravity surveys were completed to locate the first exploratory well. Grado - 1 borehole was drilled down to 1110 m, into a terrigenous cover and a Paleogene - Mesozoic carbonate basement high. The 2 nd phase (2012 - 2015) included further geophysical prospecting to extend reservoir investigations and to locate the second borehole. Grado - 2 was drilled in 2014, at about one km distance to the East of Grado - 1, down to 1200 m. By December 2014, two km of district heating distribution network was deployed and the first two public buildings were connected. We focus here mainly on the geophysical and well data and on the pumping tests that were acquired before, during and after the drilling of the two wells. The data set allowed the characterization of the reservoir and the assessment of its geothermal potential. Some of the main results are: the identification of major fault systems and production areas, the comprehension of the hydraulic circulation systems, the assessment of the geochemical facies of waters and of their sustainable utilization. The Grado reservoir is a confined fractured aquifer hosting anoxic fossil seawaters with temperatures up to 49 °C in Grado - 2 (7 °C higher than Grado - 1), pressure of 250 kPa at wellhead and spontaneous artesian outflow of about 100 t/h. Pumping test results indicate a sustainable water production up to 140 t/h. The circulating system is a complex network of permeable vugs and highly trasmissive karst-fractured discontinuities, interested by several fault systems driven by Alpine and Dinaric deformation phases. Interference pumping tests proved the hydraulic connectivity between wells, but, due to the poor system recharge, the hydraulic sustainability of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> must be guaranteed by re - injection. The initial functioning of the district heating plant, envisaging a geothermal heating of several connected public buildings during cold seasons (up to about 3 MW(th) heating load), will allow a significant economical saving of the order of 80 000 – 100 000 €/yr. Nevertheless, the geothermal reserve affords to foster other relevant uses besides the district heating. Several future perspectives of development are suggested for Grado geothermal potential; 3 D thermo - fluid dynamic numerical modelling will optimize the system production and manage the sustainability of the geothermal plant. The existing cooling system of the ice rink of Pontebba town (UD), located close to the Austrian border, was totally renovated in late summer 2012 : a open loop heat pump system using groundwater thermal energy was realized and functions both for the ice production and maintenance, and for the heating and hot water needs of the ice stadium. Two ammonia heat pumps (350 kW each) were installed, supported by two production water wells (32 m deep) and one re - injection water well (30 m deep), drilled into the alluvial deposits of the Fella River. A total production rate of up to 200 t/h could be achieved from the shallow unconfined aquifer, with an average temperature of about 8. 5 - 9. 0 °C. Numerical modelling of groundwater flow supported the assessment of the production and re - injection rates, as well as the evaluation and the minimization of the impacts on the groundwater resource during the plant management in various hydraulic regimes.

40|$|International audienceWell {{and surface}} {{equipments}} (exchangers, filters) clogging {{is a major}} issue that affects many geothermal doublets in shallow aquifers (open-loop groundwater heat pump). In the case of wells, injection wells in particular, clogging of screens, porosity of gravel pack filters, and more widely the pores of the aquifer lead to severe losses in hydraulic performance in a long run. These clogging processes involve complex interactions between abiotic chemical processes (precipitation of carbonate minerals; iron and manganese oxides), physical processes (mobilisation and precipitation of particles) and biological processes (mineral precipitation linked to bacterial metabolism or biofouling). Each of these processes is well known and documented individually. However, prediction of clogging phenomena using a global approach that could integrate parameters related to operating conditions (temperature, pressure, flow rate [...] .) as well as water chemical, physical, and biological characteristics is a scientific challenge. Except for carbonates species, the small temperature variation (< 15 °C) induced by <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> operation {{seems to have a}} limited effect on the concentration of the major chemical components of groundwater but does impact redox equilibria. The main impact on hydrochemical characteristics and equilibrium states of the groundwater induced by geothermal doublets operating at injection temperatures below 30 °C is related to mixing of waters with different chemical facies (Bonte et al, 2013; Possemiers et al, 2016). From a biological point of view, the microbial communities responsible for clogging are highly sensitive to temperature variations, redox variations, and operating conditions (Vetter et al, 2012). Redox equilibria and their influence on biochemical reactivity are very sensitive to very small changes in physico-chemical parameters. Such variations might occur on surface or in-depth installations due to the impact of pumping and/or injection. The impact of mixing of waters with different chemical compositions on biochemical reactions in a context of heterogeneous geological environments is a research question debated over recent years. We present the initial results of a research project carried out jointly by Antea Group and the Geosciences Rennes laboratory, launched in April 2015 aiming at studying the origin of clogging problems and analyzing the effects of preventive and curative treatments. In this framework, field investigations of geothermal doublets are performed to evaluate and identify the possible origins of clogging phenomena. For selected doublets, a real-time monitoring of operating conditions and water physico-chemical characteristics is performed. In addition, chemical and bacteriological analyzes are carried out on deposits and water samples. The first challenge is linked to the selection of the most relevant geochemical and hydrogeological tools to characterise clogging of geothermal doublets under operation. The second issue is related to the characterisation and simulation of biogeochemical reactions induced by the operation of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet.</b> In this context, the evaluation of reaction mechanisms and controlling parameters is critical to assess the clogging risk of an installation and to select the appropriate preventive or curative solutions...|$|E
40|$|Huge {{amounts of}} heat {{are stored in}} {{sedimentary}} aquifers in the Dutch subsurface. The amount of heat would be sufficient to provide our national heat demand for decades without any greenhouse gas emissions. Exploitation {{of this type of}} resource started some 10 years ago in the Netherlands. In 2016, 16 <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> systems had been installed that produce geothermal heat, and each year 2 to 3 new systems are realised. A doublet system consists of a production well that extracts hot formation water from kilometer deep aquifers. After the heat is extracted from the water in heat exchangers, the cooled water is reinjected into the same aquifer at approximately 1 to 1. 5 km distance from the production well. Most of the current Dutch doublet systems provide heat for the horticulture sector. These systems have an average net energy production of approximately 10 MWth and therefore hundreds of additional systems are required to significant amounts of our heat consumption with geothermal energy. This PhD thesis investigated doublet system design and deployment strategies to optimise exploitation and increase the possible number of doublet systems exploiting the same aquifer. Based on detailed geological models, subsurface flow simulations are used to evaluate parameters such as required injector-producer distance, the preferred orientation of a well pair with respect to geological trends and required doublet distance to avoid negative interference. Based on the results, regional doublet deployment strategies can be developed to make optimal use of geothermal heat from sedimentary resources. Petroleum EngineeringApplied Geolog...|$|E
40|$|The {{lifetime}} of geothermal projects mainly {{depends on the}} thermal breakthrough (thermal breakthrough occurs when a cold water front reaches the producer). Currently, geothermal-energy production is marginally economical because of its uncertainties and risks associated with the subsurface such as lifetime, flow rate, temperature. Lifetime of a geothermal reservoir plays the most {{important role in the}} use of geothermal energy because it mainly determines whether or not geothermal-energy production is economically viable. Through optimization of the well positions from one or more geothermal doublets in a homogeneous or heterogeneous reservoir, the profitability of the project, which is largely dependent on the time of compositional breakthrough, temperature breakthrough and the rate of temperature decline, can be improved. This thesis studies optimization of the well positions such that the Net Present Value (NPV) of a project is maximized in a 2 D geothermal reservoir for the selected heterogeneity structure. For this purpose an automated, gradient-based optimization method is used. The approach is based on the concept to surround the wells, whose locations have to be optimized, by so-called pseudo-wells. The reservoir simulations are performed using the Finite Element Method in the program COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 2 a. The major features of the simulation results are discussed in detail. The compositional front moves faster than the thermal front (the ratio of these two is the thermal retardation factor). Breakthrough of water with altered composition will therefore occur at an early stage in the doublet lifetime. Reservoir heterogeneities influence the time at which thermal and compositional breakthrough occur and also determine the rate at which temperature and composition decline after breakthrough. The temperature and compositional decline curves after breakthrough are generally steeper in a homogeneous reservoir than in a heterogeneous reservoir. Therefore, the thermal breakthrough does not necessarily mean the end of the {{lifetime of}} a doublet. It is also shown that the effect of heterogeneities on the thermal retardation factor is small. Three successful optimization sequences in two different reservoirs are described in this thesis. It is shown that, from an economical standpoint, is makes little sense to assume a doublet lifetime of more than 30 years. Furthermore, the effectiveness at which a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> is able to deplete a reservoir (recovery factor) and profitability of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> are closely interlinked. However, a higher recovery factor {{does not necessarily mean that}} the doublet is more profitable and vice versa. There exists an optimum well spacing for doublets positioned in homogeneous reservoirs, such that additional gain of later breakthrough (when placing the production well further away from the injector) is negated by the loss in pressure support of the injection well. This optimum well spacing is found to be an important factor, influencing the profitability in homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs. In addition, it is found that the optimum well spacing of a doublet for greenhouse heating is the same as the optimum well spacing of a doublet for spatial heating. The heat production from an aquifer can be maximized through the usage of multiple doublet layouts. It is found that, even in a heterogeneous reservoir, it is best to use a checkers-board well arrangement, which is more effective than a tramrail well arrangement.
