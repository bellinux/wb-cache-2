5|$|Some conversations, due {{to their}} private nature, were fictionalized; Ottaviani makes up Marsh's lobby to Congress and what {{happened}} during his meeting with President Grant, and P.T. Barnum never told off Marsh {{the way he did}} in the novel. Ottaviani also wove the story Marsh tells about the Mastodon from several <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legend.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (<b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same structure).|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album cover. The original image {{was taken in}} black-and-white, and Heiden experimented {{with a variety of}} treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule).|$|E

5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. <b>Different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades was {{announced}} on July 15, 2008, at the 2008 E3 conference, and released on November 16, 2008. Executive Producer David Nathanielsz {{stated that the}} short time between releases was to help give DS players the same depth of content as available to the console players of Guitar Hero. Additionally, Vicarious Visions incorporated the ability to share songs between <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game through the wi-fi capabilities of the DS in order to expand the number of potential songs to more than 50.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, eight DVD compilations, {{in regular}} and special editions, were {{released}} containing three episodes each, between June 23, 2006, and January 25, 2007. The regular and special editions {{are similar in}} content, but the special editions are packaged in jacket sleeve, and contain an original booklet which includes additional merchandise such as portable plates and straps. The special edition includes <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening and closing themes, and deleted scenes. Media Blasters released five English-subtitled DVDs of Strawberry Panic between March 4, 2007 and November 11, 2008. The English-subtitled DVDs contain five episodes, except for its first release, which contains six. The series premiered on Toku in the United States on December 31, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, {{waiting for}} Comic-Con tickets {{to go on}} sale online. After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} be able to attend, especially as they had spent so much time on their costumes, intending to go as <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{events were}} set down and {{distributed}} {{due to the}} excitement around the trial and the public demand for entertainments based on the murder, making it hard for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment. Good official records exist from the trial, and the best record of the events surrounding the case is {{generally considered to be}} that of James Curtis, a journalist who spent time with Corder and two weeks in Polstead interviewing those concerned. He was apparently so connected with the case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of the accused man drew a likeness of Curtis instead of Corder.|$|E
5|$|Stone Temple Pilots was {{released}} worldwide {{over a period}} of a week. Several foreign markets released the album on May21, including Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands.

In 2011 the album was re-released as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, featuring a remastered version of the album along with various other material.|$|E
5|$|The Mahavira's teachings were {{gradually}} lost after around 300BC, {{according to}} the Jain tradition, when a severe famine in the Magadha region of ancient India caused a scattering of the Jain monks. Thereafter, attempts were made by Jain monks to gather again, co-recite the canon, and re-establish it in its entirety. These efforts identified differences between recitations of the Mahavira's teachings, and {{an attempt was made}} in the 5thcentury AD to reconcile the differences. However, the reconciliation efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions continuing with their own incomplete, somewhat <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were written down in palm leaf manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|The company sells {{slightly}} <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sandwich between international markets, using {{white meat}} chicken breast {{in some regions}} while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E

5|$|Cú Roí, {{again in}} disguise, joins the Ulstermen on {{a raid on}} Inis Fer Falga (probably the Isle of Man), in return for his choice of the spoils. They steal treasure, and abduct Blathnát, {{daughter}} of the island's king, who loves Cú Chulainn. But when Cú Roí is asked to choose his share, he chooses Blathnát. Cú Chulainn tries to stop him taking her, but Cú Roí cuts his hair and drives him into the ground up to his armpits before escaping, taking Blathnát with him. Like other heroes such as the Biblical Samson, Duryodhana in the Mahabharata and the Welsh Llew Llaw Gyffes, Cú Roí can only be killed in certain contrived circumstances, which vary in <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. Blathnat discovers how to kill him and betrays him to Cú Chulainn, who does the deed. However, Ferchertne, Cú Roí's poet, enraged at the betrayal of his lord, grabs Blathnát and leaps off a cliff, killing her and himself.|$|E
5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} what he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E
