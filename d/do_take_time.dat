50|$|This type of sensor is not {{extremely}} {{expensive and}} can be installed at pipeline pressure (in-situ). Water molecules <b>do</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> to enter and exit the pores, so some wet-up and dry down delays will be observed, especially after a slug. Contaminants and corrosives may damage and clog the pores causing a “drift” in the calibration, but the sensor heads can be refurbished or replaced and will perform better in very clean gas streams. As with the piezoelectric and electrolytic sensors, the sensor is susceptible to interference from glycol and methanol, the calibration will drift as the sensor’s surface becomes inactive due to damage or blockage, so the calibration is reliable only {{at the beginning of}} the sensor’s life.|$|E

Some <b>do</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> off to raise the family's children, so that their partners can put more time into the congregation. Others may find ways to involve themselves on a volunteer basis in the congregation, such as by playing musical accompaniment when their partners lead services. Still other partnerships involve two rabbis or a rabbi and a cantor, and if a congregation hires a couple with this pairing of skills it is understood that they will earn two salaries, not the one traditionally received by the rabbi and his rebbetzin.|$|E

Regressions based on panel data for 28 three-digit manufacturing industries show that productivity growth is insensitive to tariff reduction.

This research study describes the attitudes and intentions of 121 Thai English as a Foreign Language (EFL) university students towards a playful, competitive smart phone application, its ease of use and perceived benefits to learning. Results of a cross-sectional examination through a paper-based, 4 -page questionnaire seem to indicate general acceptance, widespread use and an altogether positive attitude to the software.

40|$|Abstract Background The Australian {{state of}} Victoria, with 5. 2 million residents, {{enforced}} home quarantine during a H 1 N 1 pandemic in 2009. The strategy was targeted at school children. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the extent to which parents’ access to paid sick leave or paid carer’s leave was associated with (a) <b>time</b> <b>taken</b> off work to care for quarantined children, (b) household finances, and (c) compliance with quarantine recommendations. Methods We conducted an online and telephone survey of households recruited through 33 schools (85 % of eligible schools), received 314 responses (27 %), and analysed the subsample of 133 households in which all resident parents were employed. Results In 52 % of households, parents <b>took</b> <b>time</b> off work to care for quarantined children. Households in which no resident parent had access to leave appeared to be less likely to <b>take</b> <b>time</b> off work (42 % vs 58 %, p= 0. 08) although this difference had only borderline significance. Among parents who <b>did</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> off work, those in households without access to leave were more likely to lose pay (73 % vs 21 %, p Conclusions Future pandemic plans should consider the economic costs borne by households and options for compensating quarantined families for income losses. </p...|$|R
