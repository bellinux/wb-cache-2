40|$|In modern society, {{education}} {{has become a}} major element of stratification and differen tiation. This paper examines how educational differences across and within <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> affect the content of the relationship, thereby focusing on proximity and contact between parents and adult children and between siblings. Hypotheses are developed about why education should matter, using theoretical arguments about preferences and constraints. The hypotheses are tested using a large new survey on <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study. <b>Family</b> <b>relationships</b> are pooled into one dataset which is analyzed using multilevel regression. The results show sharp but nonlinear educational effects on proximity and distance, although most of the educational effect on contact is indirect, via distance. Educational differences within <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> lead to greater distances and less contact, confirming the classic mobility thesis, but the effects are generally weak and the effects on contact are indirect. Implications of the findings for the different theoretical perspectives on <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the bidirectional relationships of adolescents' and maternal mood, and the moderating effect by gender and perceived <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> on these relationships. Data were obtained from 626 adolescent-mother dyads and follow-up data were collected one year later from a subset. Adolescents reported their depressive symptoms, and their mothers reported their negative affect. Adolescents described their perception of <b>family</b> <b>relationships.</b> Maternal negative affect and adolescents' depressive symptoms were significantly correlated at baseline. This association was moderated by gender and <b>family</b> <b>relationships.</b> The association was stronger in mother-daughter compared to mother-son dyads. In <b>families</b> where <b>relationships</b> were reported to be poor, adolescent depressive symptoms were uniformly high, regardless of maternal negative affect. However, in <b>families</b> where <b>relationships</b> were good, maternal negative affect was associated with higher adolescents' depressive symptoms. In longitudinal analyses, adolescents' mood at baseline was found to relate to maternal negative affect at follow-up. <b>Family</b> <b>relationships</b> at baseline were also associated with adolescents' depressive symptoms at follow-up. However, there was no prediction from maternal negative affect at baseline to adolescents' depressive symptoms at follow-up.

40|$|AbstractThe {{subject of}} {{the paper is the}} {{correlation}} between <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> and competent parenting, perceived from a systemic perspective. The aim of the research was to determine which <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> are perceived as the most functional by the students, when the parents are presented with a permissive, authoritative, authoritarian, inconsistent, or indifferent educational style. We assumed that students assess, most positively, the <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> where the parents are permissive. Our expectations, that the permissive style will be estimated as an indicator of the most functional <b>relationships</b> in one <b>family,</b> were {{based on the results of}} the research conducted by McGillicuddy-De Lisi, De Lisi (2007), and on the characteristics of the adolescent phase which our respondents are a part of. We used the following research instruments: Index of Family Relations (IFR, Hudson 1982) and five vignettes in which the educational style of parents was described (authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, inconsistent and indifferent). The examinees were 316 male and 268 female students. The results showed that the participants estimated most positively, the story about a family in which both parents apply the authoritative educational style, and then a situation in which the father applies the permissive and inconsistent educational style, whereas, when the mother is in question, inconsistency comes before permissiveness. When both parents apply authoritarian and indifferent educational style, <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> are estimated as significantly negative, especially in the case where the indifferent education style is applied by both parents. This finding is not in accordance with our expectations, but it agrees with the Circumplex model of <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> and the expectations that the authoritative educational style relies on functional <b>family</b> <b>relationships,</b> in other words that the functionality of <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> affects competent parenting. Students’ perceptions of <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> and competent parenting are very important for their adequate parenting in the future...|$|R

Methods: The present research was a descriptive-correlational {{study carried out on}} 546 adolescents of Lorestan province’s high school in school year 2014 - 2015. The samples were selected through multiple cluster sampling method. Participants responded to demographic characteristics, addiction potential, depression, <b>family</b> <b>relationships,</b> and self-efficacy questionnaires. Data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple linear regression. Results: In this study, depression, <b>family</b> <b>relationships,</b> and self-efficacy was significantly correlated with addiction potential (p< 0 / 01). Multiple regression analysis indicated that depression, <b>family</b> <b>relationships,</b> and self-efficacy significantly predicted 37. 2 %, 2 %, and 2. 1 % of addiction potential variance, respectively (p< 0. 0001). Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that depression, <b>family</b> <b>relationships,</b> and self-efficacy are important in the prediction of addiction potential, so that these factors can explain the high degree of variability of addiction potential among adolescents...|$|R

25|$|The genealogical {{position}} of Huni {{in the family}} line of ruling kings, during {{the time when the}} 3rd dynasty ended and the 4th started, is highly disputed. Contemporary and later documents often mention Huni and his follower Snefru in the same sentence, always in direct succession. Therefore, Egyptologists and historians believe that Huni might have even been related to Snefru. A key figure in this case is queen Meresankh I, the royal mother of Snefru. She definitely bore the title of a queen, but no contemporary source connects her name with the title of a daughter or wife of Huni. This circumstance raises doubts in the <b>family</b> <b>relationship</b> between Huni and Snefru. Today most scholars prefer to believe the historian Manetho, who claims in his Aegyptiacae that with the inthronisation of Snefru a different royal house gained power over Egypt and a new dynasty had begun.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{longitudinal}} panel {{study was to examine}} the relationship of importance of <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> to <b>family</b> functioning and parental sense of competence during the transition to parenting a newborn infant. A family ecosystem theoretical framework was used to guide this family-related research. Importance of <b>family</b> <b>relationships,</b> <b>family</b> functioning, and parental sense of competence were measured with self-report structured questionnaires. A secondary data analysis was performed on data collected from 114 consecutively recruited couples at 24 to 34 weeks prenatally and at four and eight months postpartum. Data were analyzed at both individual and relational levels. Repeated measures analyses of variance and paired t-test analyses provided evidence that a significant decline in satisfaction with family functioning occurred for mothers and fathers from the prenatal to the four month postpartum test period, with mothers reporting a greater decline than fathers. Importance of <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> did not change across time for mothers and remained greater at each test period than for fathers. In contrast, fathers reported an increase in the importance they attributed to <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> prenatally to four months postpartum. Multiple regression analysis showed that for fathers, both family functioning and importance of <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> helped to predict parental sense of competence at four months postpartum. For mothers, family functioning, but not importance of <b>family</b> <b>relationships,</b> predicted parental sense of competence at four months. Importance appeared to have different meanings for mothers and fathers. Mothers appeared to attribute more importance to <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> when expectations of family functioning were not being met. An increase in importance reported by fathers was related to greater satisfaction with family functioning and sense of parental competence, possibly suggesting greater father involvement. These findings increase our understanding of family functioning and the differences in the importance that husbands and wives/partners attribute to <b>family</b> <b>relationships</b> prenatally to eight months postpartum. This knowledge can contribute to strategies for identifying problems that can be addressed through family-based interventions. ...|$|R
