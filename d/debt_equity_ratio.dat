Data analysis was done through a correlation analysis, a regression analysis and a hypothesis testing. Theory: The Modigliani-Miller theory of capital structure with taxes states that companies with a high <b>debt</b> to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> has a higher value. One of the risks {{with a high level of}} debt could be that during a financial downturn companies have more difficulty realizing capital and are thus more likely to go bankrupt. Conclusions: The study shows results that are contrary to the Modigliani-Miller's theory; all the correlation analyses between <b>debt</b> to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> and market value are negative. The strongest negative correlation can be found in the measurements at the end of 2009 when the impact of the recession is noted in the companies' financial reports.

30|$|The {{influence}} of <b>debt</b> to <b>equity</b> <b>ratio</b> and <b>equity</b> <b>ratio</b> is obvious because the factors of <b>debt</b> and <b>equity</b> {{have been included}} in the calculation of WACC. The <b>equity</b> <b>ratio</b> showed a positive influence on WACC, meaning that the more LSPs are funded by equity, the higher their CoC. Consequently, the <b>debt</b> to <b>equity</b> <b>ratio</b> had a negative influence on WACC, which implies that CoC decreases when LSPs strengthen their debt funding (up to a certain point). Because all analyzed LSPs show a relatively high <b>equity</b> <b>ratio</b> (Table  1), they could take advantage of better credit conditions (while interest payments are tax exempt), which would lead to lower CoC [64]. This result supports Modigliani and Miller’s [65] classic theorem on cost of capital. An “optimal” <b>debt</b> to <b>equity</b> <b>ratio</b> minimizes a company’s CoC, but CoC also increases if the <b>equity</b> <b>ratio</b> exceeds a specific barrier.|$|R
