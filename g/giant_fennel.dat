5000|$|The Latin name Ferula derives in {{part from}} Ferule which is a schoolmaster's rod, such as a cane, stick, or flat piece of wood, used in {{punishing}} children. A ferula called narthex (or <b>Giant</b> <b>fennel),</b> which shares the galbanum-like scent, has long, straight and sturdy hollow stalks, which are segmented like bamboo. They were used as torches in antiquity and it is with such a torch that, according to Greek mythology, Prometheus, who deceived his father stealing some of his fire, brought fire to humanity. [...] Bacchae were described using the bamboo-like stalks as weapons.Such rods were also used for walking sticks, splints, for stirring boiling liquids, and for corporal punishment. Some of the mythology may have transferred to the related galbanum which {{was referred to as}} the sacred “mother resin.” Galbanum was highly treasured as a sacred substance by the ancient Egyptians. The “green” incense of Egyptian antiquity {{is believed to have been}} galbanum. Galbanum resin has a very intense green scent accompanied by a turpentine odor. The initial notes are a very bitter, acrid, and peculiar scent [...] followed by a complex green, spicy, woody, balsamlike fragrance. When diluted the scent of galbanum has variously been described as reminiscent of pine (due to the pinene and limonene content), evergreen, green bamboo, parsley, green apples, musk, or simply intense green. The oil has a pine like topnote which is less pronounced in the odor of the resinoid. The latter, in turn, has a more woody balsamic, conifer resinous character. Galbanum is frequently adulterated with pine oil.|$|E
40|$|Ferula communis L. {{plants were}} {{collected}} {{all over the}} island of Sardinia (Italy) with the object of determining their poisonousness through UV microscopy examinations of the vittae fluorescence of fresh samples.

The results evidenced a positive correlation between the microscopical evaluation of the vittae fluorescence intensity and the presence of the chemical compounds responsible of the poisonousness of Ferula communis. These data suggest the employment of UV microscopy as a rapid tool to distinguish “poisonous” and “non-poisonous” <b>giant</b> <b>fennel</b> quite easily, complementing the chemical analysis of the latex.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Vitamin K are {{essential}} molecules {{involved in the}} post-transcriptional activation of some proteins called protein vitamin K dependent (PVKD). The best know PVKD are the four involved in the coagulation cascade: factor II, VII, IX and X. In mammals, vitamin K has two origins: foods and a recycling system lead by an enzyme called Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC 1). Some natural molecules are able to inhibit VKOR, which may involve coagulopathy by lack of PVKD. The most famous natural inhibitor is dicoumarol {{which is responsible for}} the “sweet clover disease”. Dicoumarol is produced by fermentation from coumarin contained in clover hay. More recently, ferulenol produced by <b>giant</b> <b>fennel</b> (Ferula communis) {{has been described as a}} VKORC 1 inhibitor [1]. <b>Giant</b> <b>fennel</b> is a common Apiaceae of the Mediterranean Basin. Many cases of intoxication by <b>giant</b> <b>fennel</b> has been reported. Nevertheless, few information are present on the excretion in milk of ferulenol and dicoumarol. Animals and material and methods: Thirty-six suckler-bovines, coming from Corsica in an area with <b>giant</b> <b>fennel,</b> were blood sampled. Precisely, there were 27 adults, 5 unweaned calves (1 - 3 weeks) and 4 weaned calves (3 - 6 months). Samples were analysed with LC-MS-MS according to the method developed by Fourrel et al. [2]. Results and discussion: Results are presented in figure 1. In adult bovine only one sample is negative to the ferulenol analysis that confirms the exposure of bovine to <b>giant</b> <b>fennel</b> and its anticoagulant compound. The majority of blood samples (25 / 27) are positive to dicoumarol. This element raises the question on the quality of conservation of hay which is given. The most interesting results concern the unweaned calves. They are almost all positive to ferulenol (4 / 5) and negative to dicoumarol (5 / 5). As they do not begin to graze the only source of exposure to ferulenol is the milk. Weaned calves are positive to ferulenol (4 / 4) and to dicoumarol (3 / 4). This study seems to show that ferulenol is excreted in milk. The difference between both molecules might be explained by their pharmacokinetic properties or by different transporter[3]. More studies are necessary to characterise ferulenol pharmacokinetics. This new element raises many questions on the consequences of these excretion. Currently, no intoxication has been reported in unweaned calves which is consistent with the weak level of ferulenol in their blood (median: 1. 1 ng/mL). Further investigations are necessary to assess the possible importance of this exposure on animals and the impact of the excretion on the milk destined to human use. Conclusion: Cows exposed to ferulenol after eating <b>giant</b> <b>fennel</b> can excrete ferulenol in milk which can conduct to an exposure of unweaned calves. References: 1.

40|$|The {{enantiomer}} of (+) -allohedycaryol, a germacrane alcohol {{isolated from}} <b>giant</b> <b>fennel</b> (Ferula communis L.), has been synthesized, thereby elucidating the relative and absolute stereochemistry {{of the natural}} product.

In a number of steps 5 was converted into the mesylate 4 with a regio- and stereoselective epoxidation as the key step. A Marshall fragmentation of 4 was used to prepare the trans,trans-cyclodeca- 1, 6 -diene ring present in allohedycaryol. The conformation of synthetic (-) -allohedycaryol was elucidated via photochemical conversion into a bourbonane system. The synthesis of (-) -allohedycaryol also showed that natural (+) -allohedycaryol has the opposite absolute stereochemistry to that normally found in higher plants. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>fennel</b> (Ferula communis L.) from Sardinia is {{characterized}} by two chemotypes with different biological activities. One chemotype is poisonous, due to prenylcoumarins, and responsible for ferulosis, which mainly affects sheep and goats, cattle, and horses; the other chemotype is nonpoisonous and contains daucane esters.

HS-SPME with CAR/PDMS/DVB in combination with GC-MS has also been found to be a successful, fully automated one-step method for rapid and unequivocal discrimination of the two chemotypes, using aristolene and allohedycaryol as markers of the poisonous and nonpoisonous chemotypes, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>fennel</b> Ferula communis L. is a circum-Mediterranean complex {{characterized}} by a great morphological variability, and comprising several species and subspecies.

40|$|Ferula communis L., subsp. communis, namely <b>giant</b> <b>fennel,</b> has {{extensively}} {{been used}} in traditional medicine {{for a wide range}} of ailments. Fresh plant materials, crude extracts and isolated components of F. communis showed a wide spectrum of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties including antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, and cytotoxic activities. The present paper, reviews the traditional uses, botany, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of F. communis in order to reveal its therapeutic potential and future research opportunities. A bibliographic literature search was conducted in different scientific databases and search engines including Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Pubmed, SciFinder, and Web of science. Phytochemical studies have led to the isolation of different compounds such as sesquiterpenes from F. communis. This plant has two different chemotypes, the poisonous and non-poisonous chemotypes. Each chemotype is endowed with various constituents and different activities. The poisonous chemotype exhibits anticoagulant and cytotoxic activities with sesquiterpene coumarins as major constituents, while the non-poisonous one exhibits estrogenic and cytotoxic effects with daucane sesquiterpene esters as the main compounds. In addition, although various pharmacological properties have been reported for F. communis, anti-microbial activities of the plant have been investigated in most studies. Studies revealed that F. communis exhibits different biological activities, and contains various bioactive compounds. Although, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities are the two main pharmacological effects of this plant, further studies should focus on the mechanisms underlying these actions, as well as on those biological activities that have been reported traditionally...|$|E
