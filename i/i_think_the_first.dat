500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Brian Lowry of Variety said: [...] "Despite a pedigree that includes Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz {{and many of}} that program's stars, Sit Down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode B, saying: [...] "I'm staying optimistic that the characters {{are going to get}} fleshed out in upcoming episodes, because this is obviously going to be a character-based ensemble comedy." [...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this should continue to be a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you." [...] She concluded, saying: [...] "In all, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time you watch Sit Down, Shut Up, it's really easy to blow it off as another animated show that's trying too hard. However, it's actually worth sticking around and watching a couple of episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. Fickett wrote that [...] "Hot Girl" [...] helped to establish {{what type of}} character Michael would eventually become in the subsequent seasons, noting the character's [...] "deep and desperate loneliness" [...] which would eventually become a main conceit in the series. He concluded that the episode ended with a [...] "classic Office moment"—Michael realizing that Jim will be giving Katy a ride home—that [...] "captures the desperation and loneliness of [...] – and {{does a great job}} of setting the stage for the show's terrific second season." [...] Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B but described it as [...] "the weakest of the first season." [...] Alli noted that the episode was largely the [...] "play on the same joke," [...] featuring Michael and Dwight [...] "making idiots of themselves over Katy." [...] However, she did positively compare the American version of the show to the British version, stating, [...] "All things considered, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> season is very underrated owing to unnecessary comparisons to the British version," [...] but concluded that the episode was [...] "its weak moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011, Representative Michele Bachmann told {{conservative}} {{radio host}} Jeff Katz on his program, [...] "I'll {{tell you one}} thing, if I was ever {{to run for president}} of the United States, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> thing I would do in the first debate is offer my birth certificate, so we can get that off the table." [...] Previously on Good Morning America, when asked about President Obama's origins, she replied, [...] "Well, that isn't for me to state. That's for the president to state." ...|$|E

2500|$|The restiveness of {{the volcano}} also stimulated the tourism {{industry}} of the province. Up to 2,400 tourists per day arrived {{in the area in}} the two weeks after the volcano started erupting on December 14, filling local hotels, compared to a more modest average of 200 in the days prior. However it was reported that some tourists lured by local [...] "guides" [...] ignored government warnings not to venture into the [...] danger zone. [...] "It's a big problem. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> violation of the zero casualty (record) will be a dead tourist," [...] said Salceda.|$|E

50|$|Alice, <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> in a trilogy {{of comic}} novels written by Susan Juby. It was first {{published}} in 2000. It is set in Smithers, British Columbia and describes the struggle of a young woman, Alice Macleod, as she matures.|$|R
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{woman to}} play a marshal in a movie western. Roger would often cast against type in those days. I could never resist a plum role like a lady marshal in a genre that would never have {{considered}} such a gender reversal like that before. However, working with Roger was always an adventure and this film was no exception.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{to recover}} my senses.

She answered with a rising and falling of the voice that was just above a whisper, as soft and cooing {{as the voice of}} a pigeon: ...|$|R

60|$|The anachronic {{mixture in}} this Arruntius of the Roman republican, to whom Tiberius must have {{appeared}} {{as much a}} tyrant as Sejanus, with his James-and-Charles-the-First zeal for legitimacy of descent in this passage, is amusing. Of our great names Milton was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> who could properly be called a republican. My recollections of Buchanan's works are too faint to enable me to judge whether the historian is not a fair exception.|$|E
60|$|And criticism--what {{place is}} that to have in our culture? Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> duty of an art critic is to hold his tongue at all times, and upon all subjects: C'est une grande avantage de n'avoir rien fait, mais il ne faut pas en abuser.|$|R

60|$|After this {{we passed}} several great rivers, and two dreadful deserts, {{one of which}} we were sixteen days passing over, and which, as I said, was to be called No Man's Land; and on the 13th of April {{we came to the}} frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> city, or town, or fortress, {{whatever}} it might be called, that belonged to the czar of Muscovy, was called Argun, being {{on the west side of}} the river Argun.|$|E

6000|$|I {{remember}} {{very well}} {{the day when}} the strange, and surely monstrous, suspicion first made my head tingle. We had been blown, the three of us, to my rooms by a gust of rain; it was also, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time Paterson had entered them. [...] "Take the sofa, Mr. Paterson," [...] I said, as I drew a chair nearer to the fire, and for the moment my eyes were off him. Then I saw that, before sitting down on the sofa, he was spreading the day's paper over it. [...] "Whatever makes you do that?" [...] I asked, and he started like one bewildered by the question, then went white and pushed the paper aside.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, sir," [...] Maraton replied swiftly. [...] "I've wandered a little from my point. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> thing <b>I</b> {{said to you}} was that this strike, if it took place, would be like the pinprick on an elephant's hide.

6000|$|I {{can bring}} to my memory--here, with no means of {{reference}} at hand--only two papers of yours that have been unsuccessful at [...] "Household Words." [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> was called [...] "The Brook." [...] It appeared to me to break down upon a confusion that pervaded it, between a Coroner's Inquest and a Trial. I have a general recollection of the mingling of the two, as to facts and forms {{that should have been}} kept apart, in some inextricable manner that was beyond my powers of disentanglement. The second was about a wife's writing a Novel and keeping the secret from her husband until it was done. I did not think the incident of sufficient force to justify the length of the narrative. But there is nothing fatal in either of these mischances.|$|E
60|$|The man {{through the}} wall smokes {{each of these three}} pipes nightly, {{beginning}} with the brier. Thus he does not like a hot pipe. Some will hold that he ought to finish with the brier, as it is his favorite, but I am not of that opinion. Undoubtedly, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pipe is the sweetest; indeed, I feel bound to make a statement here. I have an uneasy feeling that I never did justice to meerschaums, and for this reason: I only smoked them after my brier was hot, so that I never gave them a fair chance. If I had begun the day with a meerschaum, might it not have shown itself in a new light? That is a point I shall never be able to decide now, but I often think of it, and I leave the verdict to others.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. From all which I gather, that, {{though as}} to {{the matter of the}} law, both as to its being given the first time and the second, it binds the unbeliever under the pains of eternal damnation (if he close not with Christ by faith); yet {{as to the}} manner of its giving at these two times, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> doth more principally intend its force as a {{covenant}} of works, not at all respecting the Lord Jesus; but this second time not (at least in the manner of its being given) respecting such a covenant, but rather as a rule or directory to those who already are found in the clift of the rock Christ; for the saint himself, though he be without law to God, as it is considered the first or old covenant, yet even he is not without law to him as considered under grace; not without law to God, but under the law to Christ.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not think," [...] Aynesworth answered, [...] "that {{there is}} any {{happiness}} in life {{for the man who}} lives entirely apart from his fellow creatures.

60|$|On {{the subject}} of the {{prevalent}} opinion of Swiss cupidity, I have very little to say: the practice of taking service as mercenaries in other countries, has probably given rise to the charge. As is usually the case in countries where the means of obtaining a livelihood are not easy, the Swiss strike me as being more influenced by money than most of their neighbours, though scarcely more so than the common classes of France. To a man who gains but twenty in a day, a sou is of more account than to him who gains forty. I presume this is the whole amount of the matter. I shall not deny, however, that the honorarium was usually more in view, in a transaction with a Swiss, than in a transaction with a Frenchman, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> the most to be depended on. Notwithstanding one or two instances of roguery that I have encountered, I would as soon depend on a Swiss, a clear bargain having been made, as on any other man I know.|$|E
60|$|Two {{days after}} {{we came to}} the city of Naun, or Naum; we thanked the {{governor}} for his care of us, and collected to the value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested one day. This is a garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do, the Muscovites having abandoned that part of the country, which lies from this city west for about two hundred miles, as desolate and unfit for use; and more especially being so very remote, and so difficult to send troops thither for its defence; for we were yet above two thousand miles from Muscovy properly so called. After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful deserts; one of which we were sixteen days passing over; and on the 13th of April {{we came to the}} frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> town or fortress, whichever it may he called, that belonged to the Czar, was called Arguna, being {{on the west side of}} the river Arguna.|$|E
60|$|But {{the plants}} which would strike a {{botanist}} most, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time {{he found himself}} on a tropic burn-side, are the peppers, groves of tall herbs some ten feet high or more, utterly unlike any European plants I have ever seen. Some {219a} have round leaves, peltate, that is, with the footstalk springing from inside the circumference, like a one-sided umbrella. They catch the eye at once, from the great size of their leaves, each a full foot across; but they are hardly as odd and foreign-looking as the more abundant forms of peppers, {219b} usually so soft and green that they look as if you might make them into salad, stalks and all, yet with a quaint stiffness and primness, given by the regular jointing of their knotted stalks, and the regular tiling of their pointed, drooping, strong-nerved leaves, which are usually, {{to add to the}} odd look of the plant, all crooked, one side of the base (and that in each species always the same side) being much larger than the other, so that the whole head of the bush seems to have got a twist from right to left, or left to right. Nothing can look more unlike than they to the climbing true peppers, or even to the creeping pepper-weeds, which abound in all waste land. But their rat-tails of small green flowers prove them to be peppers nevertheless.|$|E
