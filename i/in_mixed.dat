5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus hondensis grow scattered or in groups under conifers or <b>in</b> <b>mixed</b> forests.

5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common <b>in</b> <b>mixed</b> hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ravenelii is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms mutualistic associations with shrubs and trees. Mushrooms grow {{on the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups <b>in</b> <b>mixed</b> coniferous and deciduous forests. Although the specific tree associations preferred by A.ravenelii are unknown, in general, Amanita from section Lepidella tend to associate with diploxylon pine (that is, pines in subgenus Pinus), oak, and hickory.|$|E

It may feasibly occur on Vancouver Island in British Columbia though this has never been confirmed. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships and is found in association with coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), as well as hazel (Corylus spp.). In Oregon and Washington, it may also be associated with the Garry oak (Quercus garryana).|$|E
