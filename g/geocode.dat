5|$|At present, Romania {{is divided}} into 41 {{counties}} and one municipality (Bucharest); these are assigned as the NUTS-3 <b>geocode</b> statistical subdivision scheme of Romania within the European Union. Each of the counties is further divided into cities (some of which have municipality status) and communes. The prefect and his administration have executive prerogatives within the county limits, while limited legislative powers are assigned to a County Council elected every four years during local elections. The territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication in {{the separation of powers}} on the government.|$|E

30|$|Several {{studies have}} offered a {{comparative}} analysis of various free or subscription-based <b>geocoding</b> services. For example, Karimi et al. [13] have evaluated the matching rate of <b>geocoded</b> addresses using web-based <b>geocoding</b> services, including Virtual Earth, Google Maps, Geocoder.us, MapQuest, and Yahoo Maps. In contrast, Swift {{and his team}} members [18] assessed seven commercial <b>geocoding</b> services and one open-source <b>geocoding</b> service—Centrus, Geolytics, ERSI Address Locator, Geocoder.us, Google Earth, Google Maps API, and the Yahoo API and USC <b>Geocoding</b> Platforms, respectively—to match accurately <b>geocoded</b> addresses. The authors selected 50 addresses for this purpose and found that only 42 % of samples matched their reference data, 54 % of addresses matched parcel centroids, and only 4 % addresses matched USPS ZIP code centroids [18]. All the <b>geocoding</b> tools tested produced varying results, indicating that analysts should indeed take care when <b>geocoding</b> physical locations, especially when doing so for purposes of location-based analysis, and should take that same care when selecting <b>geocoding</b> tools in the first place.|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of Internet-based mapping and geospatial analysis has caused {{an increase in the}} demand for online <b>geocoding</b> services. Although such services provide convenience, low (or free) cost and immediate solutions, their characteristics, sometimes, overshadow the expectation of producing quality of <b>geocoded</b> results. In recent years, several <b>geocoding</b> techniques have emerged, including rooftop <b>geocoding,</b> but they have yet to receive much attention in the literature. This paper examines and compares the quality of online rooftop and street <b>geocoding</b> services based on match rates and positional accuracy. Six <b>geocoding</b> services by five providers (i. e., Microsoft Virtual Earth, Google, Geocoder. us, MapQuest, and Yahoo!) were evaluated using addresses in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Results of the comparison indicate that rooftop <b>geocoding</b> produces slightly lower match rates but significantly higher positional accuracy than street <b>geocoding.</b> The hybrid service, which combines the two techniques, produces match rates as high as other street <b>geocoding</b> services but improves in positional accuracy close to the level of rooftop <b>geocoding.</b> <b>Geocoding</b> services employing reference databases with similar quality trend to produce compatible match rates and positional accuracy. This paper examines the sensitivity of different address types on <b>geocoding</b> quality. The results reveal that both rooftop and street <b>geocoding</b> produce high match rates and high accuracy for residential addresses. However, positional accuracies of agricultural and industrial address types are not very reliable due to the small sample sizes. With these, it is recommended to use online rooftop <b>geocoding</b> services if high positional accuracy is the priority, use street <b>geocoding</b> if high match rate is the priority, and use the hybrid approach if both high match rates and high positional accuracy are required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Geocoding</b> methods vary among spatial {{epidemiology}} studies. Errors in the <b>geocoding</b> {{process and}} differential match rates may reduce study validity. We compared two <b>geocoding</b> methods using 8, 157 Washington State addresses. The multi-stage <b>geocoding</b> method {{implemented by the}} state health department used a sequence of local and national reference files. The single-stage method used a single national reference file. For each address <b>geocoded</b> by both methods, we measured the distance between the locations assigned by each method. Area-level characteristics were collected from census data, and modeled as predictors of the discordance between <b>geocoded</b> address coordinates. Results The multi-stage method had a higher match rate than the single-stage method: 99 % versus 95 %. Of 7, 686 addresses were <b>geocoded</b> by both methods, 96 % were <b>geocoded</b> to the same census tract by both methods and 98 % were <b>geocoded</b> to locations within 1 km of each other by the two methods. The distance between <b>geocoded</b> coordinates for the same address was higher in sparsely populated and low poverty areas, and counties with local reference files. Conclusion The multi-stage <b>geocoding</b> method had a higher match rate than the single-stage method. An examination of differences in the location assigned to the same address suggested that study results may be most sensitive to the choice of <b>geocoding</b> method in sparsely populated or low-poverty areas. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the accuracy of <b>geocoding</b> for public health databases. METHODS: A test file of 70 addresses, 50 of which involved errors, was generated, and the file was <b>geocoded</b> to the census tract and block group levels by 4 commercial <b>geocoding</b> firms. Also, the "real world" accuracy of the best-performing firm was evaluated. RESULTS: Accuracy rates in regard to <b>geocoding</b> of the test file ranged from 44 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 32 %, 56 %) to 84 % (95 % CI = 73 %, 92 %).

40|$|<b>Geocoding</b> {{has been}} a widely used {{technology}} in daily life and scientific research {{for at least four}} decades. Especially in scientific research, <b>geocoding</b> {{has been used as a}} generator of spatial data for further analysis. These uses have made it extremely important that <b>geocoding</b> results be as accurate as possible. Existing global-weighting approaches to <b>geocoding</b> assume spatial stationarity of addressing systems and address data characteristic distributions across space, resulting in heuristics and approaches that apply global parameters to produce <b>geocodes</b> for addresses in all regions. However, different regions in the United States (US) have different values and densities of address attributes, which increases the error of standard algorithms that assume global parameters and calculation weights. Region-based dynamic weighting can be used in probabilistic <b>geocoding</b> approaches to stabilize and reduce incorrect match probability assignments that are due to place-specific naming conventions which vary region-to-region across the US. This study tested the spatial accuracy and time efficiency of a region-based dynamic weighting probabilistic <b>geocoding</b> system, as compared to a set of manually corrected <b>geocoding</b> results within Los Angeles City. The results of this study show that the region-based dynamic weighting probabilistic method improves the spatial accuracy of <b>geocoding</b> results and has a moderate influence on the time efficiency of the <b>geocoding</b> system...|$|R
