500|$|By the 1st century AD, the Parthian nobility {{had assumed}} great power and {{influence}} in the succession and deposition of Arsacid kings. Some of the nobility functioned as court advisers to the king, as well as holy priests. Strabo, in his Geographica, preserved a claim by the Greek philosopher and historian Poseidonius that the Council of Parthia consisted of noble kinsmen and magi, two groups from which [...] "the kings were appointed." [...] Of the great noble Parthian families listed {{at the beginning of}} the Sasanian period, only two are explicitly mentioned in earlier Parthian documents: the House of Suren and the House of Karen. The historian Plutarch noted that members of the Suren family, the first among the nobility, were given the privilege of crowning each new Arsacid King of Kings during their coronations. Later on, some of the Parthian kings would claim Achaemenid descent. This has recently been corroborated via the possibility of an inherited disease (neurofibromatosis) demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of <b>familial</b> <b>disease</b> on ancient coinage.|$|E

40|$|The {{asymptomatic}} {{phase of}} <b>familial</b> Alzheimer’s <b>disease</b> caused by E 280 A mutation in presenilin- 1 gene {{is characterized by}} intact performance in traditional neuropsychological tasks including memory, language, and executive functions. However, asymptomatic mutation carriers are already impaired in tasks that require visual short-term memory binding. Meanwhile, neuropathological changes in white matter integrity take place {{during the course of}} <b>familial</b> Alzheimer’s <b>disease.</b> We investigated whether the behavioural short-term memory binding deficits are accompanied by changes in white matter integrity in asymptomatic and clinical phases of <b>familial</b> Alzheimer’s <b>disease.</b> Three groups - asymptomatic carriers of presenilin- 1 gene mutation, <b>familial</b> Alzheimer’s <b>disease</b> patients, and healthy controls - underwent an assessment consisting of a neuropsychological test battery, two visual short-term memory binding tasks, and diffusion tensor imaging. Group comparisons indicated changes in white matter integrity in <b>familial</b> Alzheimer’s <b>disease</b> patients and to smaller extent already in asymptomatic carriers. Higher performance in visual shape-colour binding task was related to higher white matter integrity in frontal areas, and higher performance in visual colour-colour binding task was related to higher white matter integrity in frontal and parietal areas. Thus, we demonstrate the early changes in white matter integrity already in asymptomatic phase of <b>familial</b> Alzheimer’s <b>disease.</b> These changes become more widespread {{in the course of the}} disease. In addition, impaired performance in visual short-term memory binding tasks is accompanied by changes in white matter integrity which might implicate loss of connectivity.

40|$|Objectives: In 2007, a novel {{pathogenic}} {{genetic mutation}} associated with early onset <b>familial</b> Alzheimer <b>disease</b> was identified {{in a large}} First Nation family living in communities across British Columbia, Canada. Building on a community-based participatory study {{with members of the}} Nation, we sought to explore the impact and interplay of medicalization with the Nation’s knowledge and approaches to wellness in relation to early onset <b>familial</b> Alzheimer <b>disease.</b> Methods: We performed a secondary content analysis of focus group discussions and interviews with 48 members of the Nation between 2012 and 2013. The analysis focused specifically on geneticization, medicalization, and traditional knowledge of early onset <b>familial</b> Alzheimer <b>disease,</b> as these themes were prominent in the primary analysis. Results: We found that while biomedical explanations of disease permeate the knowledge and understanding of early onset <b>familial</b> Alzheimer <b>disease,</b> traditional concepts about wellness are upheld simultaneously. Conclusion: The analysis brings the theoretical framework of “two-eyed seeing” to the case of early onset <b>familial</b> Alzheimer <b>disease</b> for which the contributions of different ways of knowing are embraced, and in which traditional and western ways complement each other on the path of maintaining wellness in the face of progressive neurologic disease...|$|R
