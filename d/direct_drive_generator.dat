40|$|The {{trend in}} wind energy is towards large {{offshore}} wind farms. This trend {{has led to}} the demand for high reliability and large single unit wind turbines. Different energy conversion topologies such as multiple stage geared generators, single stage geared <b>generators</b> and gearless (<b>direct</b> <b>drive)</b> <b>generators</b> have been coupled to the wind turbine in the last decades. <b>Direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> based on permanent magnet technology have a high efficiency, less components and lower speeds that can translate to high energy yield and less maintenance demand. However, the mass of such <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> can be significantly higher than of other geared generators.

The experimental results were compared with the corresponding case simulations on the designed generator.

40|$|Small scale wind {{turbines}} (less than 20 kW) are typically designed and manufactured by relatively small mechanical engineering companies. One component that causes particular problems is the electrical generator as suitable generators {{are not always}} readily available. In the case of mains-connected turbines the manufacturer is sometimes forced down the route of using a gearbox and standard 4 -pole induction machine. For smaller machines the manufacturer is inevitably looking at a specially built machine.

These systems are often expensive and unreliable, and can introduce considerable power losses reducing {{the efficiency of the}} device. This study investigates the application of a direct drive contra-rotating generator (DD-CRG), originally designed for the tidal energy industry, to a generic point absorber wave energy converter. The contra-rotation of the generator facilitates lower torque and higher speed inputs compared to a conventional <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>generator,</b> reducing the size, weight and cost of the power take-off system.

Furthermore the wave energy application enabled optimisation of the generator design to increase the generator speed and further reduce the applied torque. This led to a significant reduction in the levelised cost of energy of at least 20 % compared to using a conventional hydraulic drivetrain in the same device.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{permanent}} magnet "direct drive" electrical {{generators for wind turbines}} with large power output. A variety of such generator topologies is reviewed, tested and optimised {{in an attempt}} to increase their potential as commercial concepts for the wind industry. Direct drive electrical generators offer a reliable alternative to gearbox drivetrains. This novel technology reduces energy loses thus allowing more energy to be yield from the wind and decreases the maintenance cost at the same time. A fundamental issue for these generators is their large size which makes them difficult to manufacture, transport and assembly. A number of structural designs have been suggested in the literature in an attempt to minimise this attribute. A set of design tools are set out in an attempt to investigate the structural stiffness of the different permanent magnet <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>generator</b> topologies against a number of structural stresses that apply to such wind turbine energy converters. Optimisation techniques, both analytical and structural, are also developed for minimising the total mass of a variety of "directly driven" machines with power output of 5 MW or greater. Conventional and promising generator designs are modelled and optimised with the use of these optimisation techniques. The topologies under examination are then compared in terms of structural mass, stiffness and cost. As the number of wind turbine manufactures who adopt the direct drive concept increases, it is important to outline the unique characteristics of the different topologies and increase their manufacturing potential. Discussions and conclusions will provide an indication of the design solutions that could help decrease the mass and cost of such machines...|$|E

40|$|The {{transverse}} flux {{permanent magnet}} generator offers high power density in terms of active mass. Two configurations of this machine topology (referred to as TFPM- 1 and TFPM- 2) are described, and optimised electromagnetic designs are presented. <b>Direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> require a significant support structure, {{which is designed to}} minimise the deflection into the air gap due to inherent electromagnetic attraction forces.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} study mainly {{considers the}} Wind Energy resource {{and focuses on}} the electromagnetic aspects of generators for direct drive solutions in this field. Despite the strong employing by many constructor of geared technology in Wind Turbines Generators, a transmission/gear box reduces both, eciency and reliability: the losses due to the transmission potentially compromise the sustainability of the electromechanical system. A better solution is the multipolar low speed direct drive train. Permanent magnet machines offer compactness {{and the absence of}} brushes with respect to traditional machines. Material in the armature can be saved using fractional slot windings. This type of machine exhibits many advantages such as short end windings, high slot fill factor, high efficiency and power density together with electrical redundancy, which allows the modularization of the active part and fault-tolerance capabilities. However, space harmonics of the magneto-motive force (MMF) in fractional slot windings lead to considerable rotor losses. The computation of these losses according to standard procedures (e. g. Steinmetz equation or models for massive body within homogeneous field) is not satisfactory. The MMF harmonics move asynchronously with respect to the rotor, inducing currents in any conductive rotor parts, e. g. the metallic iron yoke which supports the magnetic poles and the rare earth permanent magnets (PMs), acting on their working temperature which is strictly related to the performance of PMs. The reduction of the residual ux density causes a decrease both in the back electromotive force (EMF) and in the electromagnetic torque. The reduction of the magnetic eld increases the risk of an irreversible demagnetization of the PMs. The MMF space harmonic amplitude and frequency depend on the particular combination of number of slots and poles. The amount of such losses increases dramatically with the size of the machine becoming a crucial aspect in the design of a large diameter (v 2 - 3 m) multipolar direct drive generators with PMs. A proper selection of the winding of the machine,fixing the number of slot and poles represents an improvement in the sustainability of the electromechanical conversion process: losses are limited and a higher eciency is achieved. If efficiency is better even less active material is wasted. This part of the doctoral study has been accomplished at the Electric Drives Laboratory at the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Padova during a partnership with Leitwind A. G. (in Sterzing, Italy), which operates in the Wind Energy Market. The aim is to design a large diameter generator (v 4 m), which will be employed in the prototype of a 3 MW wind turbine. The will of Leitwind to implement a method to predict rotor losses in large machines with permanent magnet and fractional slot windings is the key basic point to be solved. The existing LW 15 C generator for LTW 77 (1. 5 MW rated power) wind turbine is analyzed by means of analytical relations and finite elements: it represents the starting point of this study. A method to calculate rotor losses due to the high harmonic contents of the fractional slot winding is applied. Such estimated losses are then compared with the results of experimental test benches with "full-scale" prototypes. The same study is then repeated on SFA motor (500 kW rated), employed in ropeways transport in Leitner A. G. plants. Both Leitner and Leitwind belong to the Leitner Technologies Group. Test bench results are finally compared with the values from the analysis. Starting from both the experience on LW 15 C generator and SFA motor the design of LW 30 A prototype generator for Leitwind 3 MW wind turbine is chosen. Dierent topologies of PM machines with fractional slot winding are then investigated and compared with the switching ux configuration (SFPM), both with rare earths and ferrite PMs. The possibility to integrate a huge magnet quantity in the armature of the SFPM machine and the ux concentration principle can lead to a cost eective solution which must be carefully evaluated without considering the performance of the machine only. The structure of the rotor is robust and simple, like in classical reluctance machines. The robustness against PMs demagnetization is a crucial point to investigate. To extend the scenario of renewable energy, the wave energy resource is brie y overviewed and some topologies for linear <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>generator</b> in this field are investigated. In order to increase the thrust density the possibility of employing a double-sided structure is analyzed. The employing of ferrite PMs is also considered: despite their low energy with respect to rare earth magnets they have a lower impact on environment and human health. The extraction process of ferrite is similar to the iron one, while rare earths must be separated from radio elements. Main contributions of the thesis To the knowledge of the author, the contributions of this thesis for the upcoming researchers in electrical machines for renewable energy eld are: • The application of straight lined model and of the current sheet method to calculate rotor losses in large direct drive permanent magnet machines. The results of the test bench activity on real machines are then described and compared with the prediction. • Selection of number of slots and poles for fractional winding direct drive large generators. • Comparison of the switching ux machine with other well known machine topologies, including demagnetization behavior and ferrite PMs, more sustainable than rare earth ones. • Investigation on dierent linear modules topologies for wave energy, including double side switching ux topology. Outline of the thesis Chapter 1 provides an overview on renewable energy conversion field and presents the company Leitwind A. G. Chapter 2 describes the analysis and modeling of the LW 15 C generator for 1. 5 MW wind turbine. Then a similar study has been performed for the SFA motor for ropeways applications. Both analytical and finite elements model have been developed/implemented and are compared to the results of experimental test bench activities. The same models are applied to the analysis of the new LW 30 A generator. Chapter 3 faces the topic of rotor losses in order to model them with the straight lined model and the current sheet method. The rotor losses computation is considered and described. Predicted values are compared with the test bench ones. Chapter 4 establishes a scaling law for rotor losses in fractional slot PM machines. Chapter 5 provides the selection of the number of slots and poles to design the new LW 30 A generator for 3. 0 MW wind turbine. The validity of the Index of Rotor Losses obtained from the straight lined model is investigated and applied. Chapter 6 describes the comparison of fractional winding machine with a small switching ux permanent magnet machine, both with rare earth and ferrite PMs. The demagnetization behavior of the different machine topologies is analyzed. Chapter 7 considers linear drives for Wave energy conversion with different topologies, including the double side switching flux machin...|$|E
40|$|Variable speed {{generators}} {{are used}} for large turbines, as they can extract more energy with attenu-ated structural stresses and acoustic emissions when compared to fixed speed systems. The doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) with a partially rated rotor side converter is currently the main-stream product in the market. But other topologies exist and new ones are being developed with incentives in cost, performance and reliability. For instance, low speed, <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> <b>generators</b> offer the further benefit of eliminating the gearbox which is undesirable where maintenance of lubrication is difficult. In many <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> systems fully rated converters are required to control the generator and interface to the grid. 2. Why? It is quite easy to obtain high current rating in a power electronic converter. With respect to that, the cost of high voltage rating can however be prohibitively high and in a low voltage system, high current flows through cables of considerable length inducing significant I 2 R loss. Parallel connection of cables reduces the loss but it increases the initial cost as high current cables are expensive and mechanically stiff. Moreover, in order to minimise the component cost, wind farm developers often use step-up transformers that are marginally rated. Reliability of the whole system is reduced...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the work completed under the CRADA between NREL and American Superconductor (AMSC). The CRADA combined NREL and AMSC resources to benchmark high temperature superconducting <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> (HTSDD) <b>generator</b> technology by integrating the technologies into a conceptual wind turbine design, and comparing the design to geared drive and permanent magnet <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> (PMDD) wind turbine configurations. Analysis {{was accomplished by}} upgrading the NREL Wind Turbine Design Cost and Scaling Model to represent geared and PMDD turbines at machine ratings up to 10 MW and then comparing cost and mass figures of AMSC's HTSDD wind turbine designs to theoretical geared and PMDD turbine designs at 3. 1, 6, and 10 MW sizes...|$|R
40|$|Wind power {{penetration}} {{affects the}} dynamics and operational {{performance of a}} conventional power system. This article investigates the stability issues of a power system with the penetration of wind power from a doubly fed induction <b>generator</b> and <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> synchronous <b>generator.</b> An approach to utilize an existing shunt flexible AC transmission system controller, static VAR compensator, for enhancing the small signal stability of a wind connected power system is discussed here. Supplementary stabilizing control for damping oscillatory modes is applied to static VAR compensator and suitable control input has been selected for the best damping performance of the proposed controller...|$|R
