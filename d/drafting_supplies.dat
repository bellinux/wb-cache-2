A high-wing four-seater with a V-tail soon followed, but was abandoned before completion when Schreder tried soaring and was immediately hooked.|$|E

5000|$|A central draught lamp, or Argand lamp, {{works in}} the same manner as the flat wick lamp. The burner is {{equipped}} with a tall glass chimney, of around 12 inches tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly. The burner uses a wick, usually made of cotton, that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick. The tubular wick is then mounted into a [...] "carrier," [...] which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the [...] "central draft" [...] or <b>draft</b> that <b>supplies</b> air to the flame spreader. When the lamp is lit, the central <b>draft</b> tube <b>supplies</b> air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly.|$|R
