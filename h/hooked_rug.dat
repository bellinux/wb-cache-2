50|$|The {{history of}} rugs in America is extensive; however, today <b>hooked</b> <b>rugs</b> and Navajo rugs are synonymous with American rug design.

The design motifs on early American <b>hooked</b> <b>rugs</b> varied, consisting predominantly of geometric patterns, floral designs, landscapes, seascapes and animals.

50|$|Since hooking was a {{craft of}} poverty, rug makers {{put to use}} {{whatever}} materials were available. Antique <b>hooked</b> <b>rugs</b> were created on burlap after 1850 because burlap was free {{as long as one}} used old grain and feed bags. Every and any scrap of fiber that was no longer usable as clothingwas put into rugs. In the United States, yarn was not a fiber of choice if one did not have access to thrums. Yarn was too precious, and had to be saved for knitting and weaving. Instead the tradition of using scraps of fabric evolved. Yarns and other creatively used materials havealways been used for <b>hooked</b> <b>rugs</b> in the Canadian Maritimes. The well-known Cheticamp <b>hooked</b> <b>rugs</b> used finely spun yarns and the highly collectible Grenfell mats were meticulously hooked with recycled jerseys. Everything from cotton T-shirts to nylon stockings were cut and used.|$|R
