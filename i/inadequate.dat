5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is caused}} by <b>inadequate</b> {{function}} of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), <b>inadequate</b> stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism), or <b>inadequate</b> release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inadequate</b> {{infrastructure}} and services.|$|E
5|$|Historical and {{epidemiological}} data are <b>inadequate</b> {{to identify the}} pandemic's geographic origin. It was implicated in the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inadequate</b> {{financing}} {{options for}} renewable energy projects, including insufficient access to affordable financing for project developers, entrepreneurs and consumers.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition-related {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} caused by malnutrition due to an improper or <b>inadequate</b> diet.|$|E
5|$|The {{first officer}} took only <b>inadequate</b> {{measures}} {{to prevent or}} recover from the spiral dive.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach {{announced}} {{the findings of}} the DOJ investigation in Cleveland on December 4, 2014. After reviewing nearly 600 use-of-force incidents from 2010 to 2013 and conducting thousands of interviews, the investigators found systemic patterns insufficient accountability mechanisms, <b>inadequate</b> training, ineffective policies, and <b>inadequate</b> community engagement.|$|E
5|$|A postwar {{review of}} <b>inadequate</b> housing {{led to the}} {{clearance}} and redevelopment of {{areas of the city}} in a postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was <b>inadequate,</b> leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|Another {{clinical}} {{and public health}} concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and <b>inadequate</b> packaging. A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.|$|E
5|$|Artisanal {{fishermen}} and gatherers of marine organisms in {{less developed countries}} may expose themselves to relatively high risk using diving equipment {{if they do not}} understand the physiological hazards, particularly if they use <b>inadequate</b> equipment.|$|E
5|$|Atypical {{development}} of fearfulness, with a constitutional tendency either to excessive or <b>inadequate</b> fear reactions, {{might be necessary}} before an infant is vulnerable {{to the effects of}} poor attachment experiences.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{initially}} {{played in}} the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities <b>inadequate</b> for a club with growing membership.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were <b>inadequate,</b> {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as <b>inadequate.</b> A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{a single}} road closure (resulting from a gas leak {{on a side}} road in Wandsworth) caused severe {{congestion}} along the entire South Circular. A representative from Scotland Yard's Central Communications complex said the <b>inadequate</b> design of the road was indicative of several single points of failure in the London road network.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Scalia {{states that}} the {{original}} military tribunal was not shown to be <b>inadequate.</b> Regarding {{the application of the}} Suspension Clause of the Constitution, Scalia points to Johnson v. Eisentrager.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} historians tend to {{summarise}} {{the issue by}} saying that the agreement assigned Vilnius to Lithuania and Polish attack violated it. However, Piotr Łossowski argued that such summaries are <b>inadequate</b> and misleading.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s it was {{recognised}} that {{conservation of}} historic buildings was <b>inadequate,</b> leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 {{the city was}} selected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inadequate</b> {{and poorly}} {{maintained}} fire-fighting and rescue systems {{both on the}} vessel and on the jetty: Gulf and Total were held jointly to blame for this. A combination of human failings and financial constraints was the immediate cause.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inadequate</b> {{workforce}} {{skills and}} training, which includes {{lack of adequate}} scientific, technical, and manufacturing skills required for renewable energy production; lack of reliable installation, maintenance, and inspection services; and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{military}} and civil defenses {{were unable to}} stop the Allied attacks. The number of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was <b>inadequate,</b> {{and most of these}} aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, <b>inadequate</b> pilot training, and a lack of coordination between units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to firebombing attacks, the firefighting services lacked training and equipment, and few air raid shelters were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{dysfunction}} typically develops 1–2days {{after the}} initial muscle damage. If supportive treatment is <b>inadequate</b> to manage this, renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required. RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys are unable to function normally and is required until kidney function is regained.|$|E
5|$|Manila is {{designated}} as the country's pioneer of medical tourism, expecting it to generate $1 billion in revenue annually. However, lack of progressive health system, <b>inadequate</b> infrastructure and the unstable political environment are seen as hindrances for its growth.|$|E
5|$|Much like in {{its early}} days, the bridge still carries a lot of traffic related to the fruit {{production}} industry, especially during picking and harvesting seasons. Bridge lifts are timed to try and avoid traffic delays. Some in the local community consider that {{the capacity of the}} bridge is <b>inadequate</b> and impedes commercial activity.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, the {{defendants}} {{were informed that}} they would have to finish preparing their defense by July 9. They announced a hunger strike in response, saying that two working days was <b>inadequate</b> time to finish preparing their trial defense. On July 21, the court extended their pre-trial detention by a further six months.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium 239, with a 24,000 year half life, {{will persist}} in the {{environment}} {{hundreds of thousands of}} years. The DOE's assessment of the Central Operating Unit indicates that the long-term risk to citizens living outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats is negligible, but citizen organizations state that the remediation of the site was <b>inadequate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{isotopes}} undergo radioactive decay, {{which produces}} decay heat. Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass. The decay heat is usually listed as watt/kilogram, or milliwatt/gram. In larger pieces of plutonium (e.g. a weapon pit) and <b>inadequate</b> heat removal the resulting self-heating may be significant. All isotopes produce weak gamma radiation on decay.|$|E
5|$|Power {{was sentenced}} to eight to twelve {{years in prison for}} the bank robbery, and five years and a $10,000 fine for the National Guard armory crimes. Additionally, judge Robert Banks of Suffolk County Superior Court imposed a {{probation}} condition that Power could not profit from her crime. Banks remarked that the sentence negotiated was <b>inadequate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Raelians deride {{the current}} state-system as <b>inadequate</b> {{for dealing with}} {{contemporary}} global issues that are typical of Globalisation, such as Environmentalism, Social Justice, Human Rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, Geniocracy proposes a different economic model called Humanitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Responding to {{increased}} visitation and traffic congestion, the National Park Service implemented a voluntary, summer-only, in-park shuttle system in June 2000. In 2004, reconstruction {{began on the}} aging and <b>inadequate</b> road system in the park.|$|E
5|$|Service to America became Good Turn for America in 2004 and {{expanded}} {{to address the}} problems of hunger, homelessness, and <b>inadequate</b> housing and poor health in conjunction with the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, and other organizations.|$|E
5|$|Several Weiquan {{lawyers have}} {{advocated}} {{for the rights}} of individual citizens whose land and homes were taken with <b>inadequate</b> compensation, including Shanghai lawyer Zheng Enchong. Ni Yulan, a Beijing lawyer, was herself left homeless by forced eviction, and became an outspoken advocate for victims before being sentenced to two years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Szigeti quickly {{showed a}} talent for the violin. Several years later, his father took him to Budapest to receive proper {{training}} at the conservatory. After a brief stint with an <b>inadequate</b> teacher, Szigeti auditioned at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music and was admitted directly into the class of Jenő Hubay, without the usual delays and formalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} founded in 1848, but a local hall was used for {{services}} until a wooden church was built in 1849. The wooden structure eventually proved <b>inadequate</b> and a larger church designed by Peabody and Stearns was built of local fieldstone at the current location between 1897 and 1898.|$|E
5|$|The club {{originally}} {{played at}} Newmarket Road {{before moving to}} The Nest. When The Nest was deemed <b>inadequate</b> for the size of crowds it was attracting, the Carrow Road ground, named after the road on which it is located, was purpose-built by Norwich City in just 82 days and opened on 31 August 1935.|$|E
5|$|The large {{population}} in Antananarivo {{and the high}} density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and residential waste is <b>inadequate.</b> Waste water is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhausts, residential coal-burning stoves and other sources is worsening. While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain <b>inadequate</b> and are not distributed according to population density, worsening access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city. Antananarivo {{is one of the}} two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.|$|E
5|$|The two daily round-trips were branded Turboliner, {{replacing}} the individual names Abraham Lincoln and Prairie State. Amtrak repeated this {{experiment with the}} Detroit and Milwaukee corridors. Track conditions limited the new trainsets to , but they were clean, comfortable, quiet and reliable. In the first year, the Chicago–St. Louis running time dropped from 5.5 to 5 hours. The Federal Railroad Administration refused a request from Amtrak to raise the speed limit to , citing <b>inadequate</b> signalling along the route. The new trains {{had fallen out of}} favor by the end of 1974: food service was <b>inadequate,</b> and the five-car fixed consist could not handle demand. Amfleet coaches and new conventional diesels replaced both of the Turboliner trainsets in 1975.|$|E
