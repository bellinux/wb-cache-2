40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} {{a more precise}} analytical model for calculating salient pole synchronous machine (SPSM) inductances in case of general eccentricity including static, dynamic and mixed eccentricities. The developed method {{is based on the}} modified winding function approach (MWFA) which accurately considers variable air gap function and leads to pure analytical expressions of inductances. Available analytical techniques, based on MWFA, approximate the air gap function and simplify the geometrical model of SPSM, whereas, in this study, the influence of the openings between the rotor salient poles has been taken into account by using an effective form of rotor pole shoes. Using this technique, flux <b>fringing</b> <b>effect</b> is considered. By taking into account machine geometry, type of windings connection and flux <b>fringing</b> <b>effect,</b> this method is able to model most of the important features of an eccentric SPSM. The developed analytical expressions can calculate time varying inductances of SPSMs with any eccentricity type and degree in the frame of a single program. Simulation results for static eccentricity are compared with experimental tests on a laboratory generator to verify accuracy of the proposed model. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, color {{filters are}} applied onto the {{monochrome}} liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCOS) microdisplays {{to produce a}} new breed of color filter LCOS (CF-LCOS) microdisplays. The processing of color filters is compatible with silicon very-large-scale-integrated (VLSI) fabrication. The color filters are also used in liquid crystal display (LCD) for color. It is advantageous to leverage on both the silicon VLSI and LCD infrastructures for this novel but practical CF-LCOS microdisplay. The color filter process on silicon was developed in this dissertation research to achieve 3 μm resolution, 1000 Å flatness and 0. 1 μm alignment accuracy with the pixel array. Mechanical rubbing and photoalignment technology were explored and compared for the LC cell assembly. Important optical and electrical parameters of color filters were extracted to establish an electro-optical model of the CF-LCOS microdisplays for device simulation. Thermal, chemical and light stability characterizations were performed to ensure the stability of color filters and the CF-LCOS microdisplays. A three-dimensional (3 D) optical modeling was further developed to study <b>fringing</b> field <b>effect</b> in small color pixels of the CF-LCOS microdisplays. The simulation results were verified with the experimental ones. With this 3 D optical analysis as a tool, the color <b>fringing</b> <b>effect</b> was analyzed with different display structures. Minimizations of the <b>fringing</b> field <b>effect</b> through pixel arrangement, rubbing direction and LC mode could lead to a CF-LCOS microdisplay of good 63 % NTSC color, 300 : 1 contrast and 23 % optical reflectance.

A nonlinear dynamic model considering midplane stretching, electrostatic force, and electrical field <b>fringing</b> <b>effects</b> is developed. Firstly, we study the static {{responses of the}} optimized microbeams under DC polarization voltage. The generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM) is used. Secondly, the dynamic responses of the shape optimized microbeams driven by DC and AC voltages are investigated using GDQM in conjunction with Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method.

This analysis will be helpful in the optimal design of MEMS actuators.

40|$|Cogging in {{a linear}} machine can be {{described}} as a variation in the magnetic forces as the machine travels along its linear uis. This effect can have a severe impact on the overall precision and even stability of the linear uis. In this paper an analytical method to predict the cogging forces in Linear Induction Moton (LIMs) is presented. An aecurate estimation of cogging is useful during the LIM design stage to help millimize this performance limiting factor. One common method used to predict cogging torques in rotary induction moton is the tooth overlap method. Due to the complexity of slot <b>fringing</b> <b>effects</b> in slotted cores, and the fact that <b>fringing</b> <b>effects</b> significantly influence the accuracy of this method, many researchers alJo use Carter and Green coefficients to increase accuracy. However, this approach does not accurately translate to the linear motor case.

For final validation of the industrial design with respect to heat inleaks between large surfaces at different temperatures, a full-scale test cryostat has been constructed. The facility reproduces the same pattern of temperature levels as the LHC dipole cryostat, avoiding the heat inleaks from local components like supports and feedthroughs and carefully minimizing <b>fringe</b> <b>effects</b> due to the truncated geometry of the facility with respect to the LHC cryostats serial layout.
