50|$|The Bathurst 250 is {{an annual}} motor racing event, {{currently}} {{held for the}} Dunlop Supercars Development Series at the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia. The race supports the Bathurst 1000 which the Supercars Championship (parent series) has run since 1963. The Bathurst of the series is a single-race event, held over an <b>endurance</b> <b>distance</b> of 250 kilometres (160 miles), and allowing for optional driver changes. Which was a first for the series.|$|E
50|$|The 2014 Dunlop Series was a motor racing {{competition}} for V8 Supercars. It was the fifteenth {{running of the}} V8 Supercar Development Series, a support series to the International V8 Supercars Championship. The 2014 season featured a new format for the Dunlop Series weekends. Each round of the series - {{with the exception of}} Bathurst - featured two forty-minute races, rather than a range of two-race and three-race weekends. The Bathurst round was a single-race event, held over an <b>endurance</b> <b>distance</b> of 250 km, and allowing for optional driver changes.|$|E

50|$|AS.1s {{were used}} {{successfully}} {{in a number}} of competitions and record-breaking events. In August 1929, they participated in the Challenge 1929 international contest, and in January 1930, an AS.1 piloted by Renato Donati with mechanic Gino Capannini was used to set <b>endurance,</b> <b>distance,</b> and altitude records in its class, respectively 29 h 4 min 14 s, 2,746.2 km (1,706.4 mi) and 6,782 m (22,251 ft). On 28 December 1932, Furio Niclot and Mariano Lanciani used a 127 kW (170 hp) CNA C-7, 9-cylinder radial engined example to set the seaplane altitude record in its class at 7,362 m (24,154 ft). Swapping wheels for pontoons, the same aircraft went on to set the equivalent landplane record two days later at 9,282 m (30,453 ft). Long-distance feats included flights from Rome to Mogadishu and Vercelli to Tokyo (both by Francis Lombardi and Gino Capannini) and an aerial circumnavigation of Africa by Francis Lombardi, Count Lodovico Mazzotti, and Mario Rasini) who covered 27,600 km (17,150 mi) in 54 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{plan for}} the flight was {{conceived}} by the Air Service's Assistant Chief, Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell in 1923. The Air Service since 1919 had been regularly establishing <b>endurance,</b> <b>distance,</b> altitude and speed records in airplanes to promote favorable publicity and {{public support for the}} funding of the U.S. Army War Department's Major Project Number 4, the Lassiter {{plan for the}} expansion of the Air Service. The year before Lt. James H. Doolittle had flown a DH-4 from Florida to San Diego in a single calendar day, making just one stop in Texas for fuel. Mitchell wanted to not only improve on both the time and distance involved, but to have the stunt highly publicized by having it takeoff and land during daylight at major urban centers. The military purpose of the flight would be to demonstrate the utility of rapidly moving air units {{from one side of the}} nation to the other, a capability that the Army and Navy did not possess.|$|E

50|$|With {{a robust}} {{motorsports}} division, Honda had significant development resources {{at its disposal}} and made extensive use of them. Respected Japanese Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima, for example, was involved with Honda in the NSX's early on track development at Suzuka race circuit, where he performed many <b>endurance</b> <b>distance</b> duties related to chassis tuning. Brazilian Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna, for whom Honda had powered all three of his world championship-winning Formula One race cars {{before his death in}} 1994, was considered Honda's main innovator in convincing the company to stiffen the NSX chassis further after initially testing the car at Honda's Suzuka GP circuit in Japan. Senna further helped refine the original NSX's suspension tuning and handling spending a whole day test driving prototypes and reporting his findings to Honda engineers after each of the day's five testing sessions. Senna also tested the NSX at the Nurburgring and other tracks. The suspension development program was far-ranging and took place at the Tochigi Proving Grounds, the Suzuka circuit, the 179-turn Nurburgring Course in Germany, HPCC, and Honda's newest test track in Takasu, Hokkaido. Honda automobile dealer Bobby Rahal (two-time CART PPG Cup and 1986 Indianapolis 500 champion) also participated in the car's development.|$|E

40|$|URL]   The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of a whole body vibration training program on knee extensor isokinetic peak torque, average power, and functional tests in the physically active elderly. Forty-seven subjects, who participated in a training program for the elderly, were recruited. The subjects were divided into two groups: whole body vibration group (WBV) (n= 24, 70. 7 ± 5. 8 years, 62. 7 ± 12. 3 kg and 155. 9 ± 8. 0 cm) and control group (n= 23. 70. 0 ± 5. 7 years, 65. 3 ± 10. 7 kg and 157. 9 ± 6. 6 cm). The WBS group underwent whole body vibration exercise and their regular training program for 13 weeks, 2 times per week, whereas the control group performed the regular training program only. Whole body vibration training was not effective in increasing isokinetic peak torque, average power, or performance in the functional tests. On the other hand, the regular training program was effective in increasing elbow flexor strength <b>endurance,</b> <b>distance</b> covered in the 6 -min walk test, and speed in the timed up and go test. The results suggest that vibration training is not effective in modifying functionality or muscle strength and power in the physically active elderly...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the feasibility and {{effect of a}} functional physical training program on aerobic endurance and walking ability of children with cerebral palsy. METHODS: Thirteen children (8 - 13 years, Gross Motor Function Classification System level I or II, with normal intelligence or mild retardation) participated in this study. A functional physical training program addressing aerobic <b>endurance,</b> walking <b>distance,</b> walking velocity, and ambulation, consisted of a circuit with 4 stations and lasted 30 minutes twice weekly for 9 weeks. The Bruce, 6 -minute-run test, Timed Up and Down Stairs Test, and Ambulation Questionnaire were administered 2 weeks before the start, immediately after, and 11 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: Significant improvement in aerobic <b>endurance,</b> walking <b>distance,</b> and ambulation were observed immediately after the intervention. Maximum treadmill time had improved significantly at 11 weeks. CONCLUSION: A functional physical training improves the aerobic endurance and the functional walking ability of children with cerebral palsy...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{although}} sport sociologists {{have addressed}} the call ‘to bring the body back in’ to theorisations of sport and physical cultures, to date the ‘promise of phenomenology’ remains largely unfulfilled with regard to sporting embodiment and distance running specifically. Relatively few accounts are grounded in the ‘flesh’ of the lived sporting body, and phenomenology offers a powerful framework for such analysis. In our presentation, we employ a form of ‘phenomenological sociology’ in order to explore the lived meaning and experience of <b>endurance</b> in <b>distance</b> running and more specifically in training for distance running. Distance running cannot be accomplished, we argue, without substantial suffering and stoicism; an enduring mind and body are requisite. Drawing on two of our research projects on distance running, we seek here to ‘bring to life’ the sensuous ‘flesh’ of the running-body, and illustrate the talk with rich data, focusing upon the lived experience of endurance...|$|R
40|$|A dry-land winter {{training}} programme for dinghy-sailors is described. Individual elements include circuit training, specific exercises for muscle strength and <b>endurance,</b> and <b>distance</b> running. Ten international-class sailors followed a progressive regimen {{of this type}} for 14 weeks after completion of the 1973 season. Excess weight and skinfold thicknesses were reduced, while muscle strength, endurance and anaerobic capacity increased. Aerobic power remained substantially unchanged, although a smaller oxygen debt was incurred in reaching maximum effort. Team members were enthusiastic about the benefits gained from the training, commenting on their greater tolerance of the hiking position and all proposed to continue or to increase their efforts during subsequent winters. Racing results during 1974 were also an improvement on the 1973 record. However, {{it was difficult to}} link physiological gains to improvements in the relative rankings of individual competitors under either light or high wind conditions; the main factor changing relative standings seems to have been the additional year of competitive experiences in younger team members...|$|R
