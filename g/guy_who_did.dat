500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Webb revealed that the band wanted a [...] "performance video" [...] and {{that they wanted to}} go back to their [...] "rock roots". When asked the concept behind the video, Webb said: [...] "They provided the sound and I provided the lights. A whole lot of lights. We used the same <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the lighting setup for Lenny Kravitz's 'Are You Gonna Go My Way?' and Coldplay's 'Speed of Sound.' But it's also rough around the edges — we used a bunch of different processes when developing the film." [...] He also concluded with, [...] "...it's a big performance video. But it's them performing inside of this wind-tunnel of light. It's a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a lot of camera tricks. There's a big light wall, streaks of light, xenon lighting effects and strobe lights. [...] But it's all wrapped around this very simple performance environment".|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{compared}} the storyline {{to the five}} stages of grief, a theory introduced by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. Alex Panisch of Out opined that the first five tracks [...] "document the five stages of a relationship turning sour: good times, doubt, breaking up, coping, and still being hung up". Critics also noted that, unlike other artists' break up records, the singer admits in Truth Serum {{that she was the}} person who made a mistake that ended the relationship. Panisch commented that; [...] "When female artists sing about breakups [...] they almost overwhelmingly write themselves in the position of the wronged party and their songs are about recovering and strengthening from the experience. [...] Tove Lo flips the script on this narrative". Shanon Carlin of Radio.com stated that the singer [...] "doesn't try and capitalize off her heartbreak by writing a female empowerment anthem that shames the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> her wrong. No, on this album, Lo is not an innocent. It's actually quite the opposite".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Spielberg told {{film critic}} Joe Leydon that [...] "People pretend {{to think they}} know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". [...] "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of {{sweetening}} and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all the stuff in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've {{done a lot of}} movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say he was the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of}} all this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E
500|$|Upset that Cleveland {{left the}} quartet {{to move to}} Stoolbend, Virginia, Peter, Quagmire and Joe decide to {{interview}} potential friends to fill the vacancy, and are approached by a fellow bar patron named Jerome. After impressing the group with his dart skills, they decide to let Jerome join as their new fourth member. Later, when Peter introduces Jerome to Lois, she reveals that the two used to date. Peter grows jealous and, {{in a fit of}} drunken rage, throws a bottle through the window of Jerome's home, inadvertently causing a fire and burning down his house. Jerome, unaware of the fact that Peter was the vandal who burned down his house, later told Lois [...] "When I find the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it, I'm gonna rip his arms off and do his wife in front of him!" [...] The next morning, Peter discovers that Lois has invited Jerome to live with them. As time goes on, Peter cannot contain his jealousy and eventually appears to dress {{as a member of the}} Ku Klux Klan, though it is immediately revealed that Peter's intention is to dress as a ghost carrying a torch, kicking Jerome out. During an argument, Lois reveals that Jerome had bought Peter a gift, and he goes on to apologize to Jerome for being so insensitive. Jerome forgives him and he remains friends with Peter, but admits to having had sex with Meg, to which Peter indifferently responds.|$|E
500|$|He {{appeared}} in numerous other {{films in the}} late 1990s, including Heat (1995), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), Celebrity (1998) and worked opposite Gwyneth Paltrow, as Walter Plane, in the 1998 adaptation of Great Expectations. He played photographer Victor [...] "Animal" [...] Palotti in Godzilla (1998). Godzilla was one of Azaria's first starring roles in a blockbuster film. Its five-month shoot was the longest of his career to date, but he considered it {{a good chance to}} boost his profile. He noted, [...] "I'm so used to melding into every character I play. Even people in the business think the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> Birdcage, Quiz Show and Great Expectations are three different actors—which in a way makes me proud, but in another way is very frustrating. It's the curse and blessing of the character actor". The shoot's physical challenges, and the film's critical failure, led Azaria to later describe it as [...] "tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one you definitely chalk up and say, 'That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time'." [...] In 1999, he starred in the drama Mystery, Alaska as Charles Danner, and the comedy superhero film Mystery Men, as the faux-British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja. Other film roles included Hector Gorgonzolas in America's Sweethearts (2001), Claude in Along Came Polly (2004), and the young Patches O'Houlihan in [...] (2004), the latter two with Ben Stiller. For his role of Claude, a French scuba instructor, in Along Came Polly, Azaria donned a wig and worked out extensively to get into the physical shape the part required.|$|E

"The <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> {{the artwork}} {{for the first}} record, Jacob Escobedo, {{came up with that}} concept for the artwork , and in that moment we began talking about retro-futurism: so if you were to {{go back and look at}} the science fiction books {{released}} in the fifties and just how fascinating it is to see what people thought about the future. And for us, that kind of became like a theme. Brian's got all of this ancient gear - synthesisers from the time that synthesisers were being made - and they were incredibly futuristic at that time. And then as we got more into it ... the whole aesthetic started to evolve from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born William Breitbard in Babylon, New York, Williams {{graduated}} from Babylon Senior High School and attended Syracuse University {{for one year}} before dropping out. [...] In 1944, he {{was hired as a}} staff announcer at WAAT in Newark, New Jersey while visiting a friend at the station. [...] According to Williams [...] "the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the all-night show had just been fired for being bombed on the air." [...] Six weeks later, a staffer at WNEW heard Williams on the air and invited him to apply for a job at the station. [...] He was hired at WNEW and worked several time slots before being fired by station manager Bernice Judis in 1947. [...] An article in the New York Daily News suggested that Williams was fired for his aggressive tactics with management in his role as shop steward; however, WNEW's official story was that he was fired after Judis caught him one evening in the studio with his feet propped on the desk clad in bright red socks. [...] She was apparently horrified by his lack of style.|$|E
2500|$|Cornell {{said that}} [...] "Hands All Over" [...] {{is about how}} humans defile the environment, and that [...] "Full on Kevin's Mom" [...] is about [...] "a {{friend of mine who}} slept with another friend of mine's mom. The <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it said to us, 'Yeah, full on Kevin's mom'." [...] The lyrics of [...] "I Awake" [...] were {{originally}} part of a note written by Yamamoto's then girlfriend Kate McDonald. In the late 1990s, an urban legend circulated on internet message boards which stated that Yamamoto, after writing the music, wrote some lyrics on the back side of McDonald's note. When Yamamoto gave the paper containing these lyrics to Cornell, Cornell looked at {{the wrong side of the}} sheet and believed McDonald's note was the lyrics to Yamamoto's song. There was less material on the album intended as humorous compared with Ultramega OK. However, the song [...] "Big Dumb Sex" [...] was written as a parody of glam metal bands, who often metaphorically addressed sexual intercourse in their lyrics. The song, with its many uses of [...] "fuck", was the reason the album gained a Parental Advisory sticker upon release.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{controversy}} artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: [...] "As the guy who recorded the record I have to say I found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all." [...] Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can’t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions." [...] Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that [...] "Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums.
