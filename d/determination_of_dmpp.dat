However, the inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> on nitrification is variable {{and the importance of}} the soil microbial community composition to the variability is poorly understood. In this study, nine soils were collected across three land uses to investigate the impact <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> on nitrification and associated dynamics of ammonia oxidizers in a 28 -day microcosm incubation.

DMPP had higher efficacy in neutral and alkaline wheat and vegetable soils, compared with pasture soils. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that soil pH was the most influential factor explaining the community composition of AOB and AOA in the collected soils. However, neither ammonium nitrate nor DMPP addition had a significant effect on the community composition of AOB or AOA during the incubation indicated by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination.

40|$|UNLABELLED: The {{nitrification}} inhibitor 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) {{is a powerful}} tool {{that can be used}} to promote nitrogen (N) use efficiency and reduce N losses from agricultural systems by slowing nitrification. Mounting evidence has confirmed the functional importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in nitrification and N 2 O production; however, their responses to DMPP amendment and the microbial mechanisms underlying the variable efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> across different soils remain largely unknown. Here we compared the impacts <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> on nitrification and the dynamics of ammonia oxidizers between an acidic pasture soil and an alkaline vegetable soil using a (15) N tracing and (13) CO 2 -DNA-stable-isotope probing (SIP) technique. The results showed that DMPP significantly inhibited nitrification and N 2 O production in the vegetable soil only, and the transient inhibition was coupled with a significant decrease in AOB abundance. No significant effects on the community structure of ammonia oxidizers or the abundances of total bacteria and denitrifiers were observed in either soil. The (15) N tracing experiment revealed that autotrophic nitrification was the predominant form of nitrification in both soils. The (13) CO 2 -DNA-SIP results indicated the involvement of AOB in active nitrification in both soils, but DMPP inhibited the assimilation of (13) CO 2 into AOB only in the vegetable soil. Our findings provide evidence that DMPP could effectively inhibit nitrification through impeding the abundance and metabolic activity of AOB in the alkaline vegetable soil but not in the acidic pasture soil, possibly due to the low AOB abundance or the adsorption <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> by organic matter. IMPORTANCE: The combination of the (15) N tracing model and (13) CO 2 -DNA-SIP technique provides important evidence that the {{nitrification inhibitor}} DMPP could effectively inhibit nitrification and nitrous oxide emission in an alkaline soil through influencing the abundance and metabolic activity of AOB. In contrast, DMPP amendment has no significant effect on nitrification or nitrifiers in an acidic soil, potentially owing to the low abundance of AOB and the possible adsorption <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> by organic matter.

The inhibitor was applied at 0. 35 to 17. 5 mg kg - 1 soil in different experiments and the incubation carried out at 25 �C for variable lengths of time depending upon the nature of experiment.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> added to ammonium sulphate (AS+DMPP), compared to ammonium sulphate (AS) and calcium-potassium nitrate (CPN), in fertigation of bearing orange trees grown outdoors in drainage lysimeters. Fertilizers were 15 N-labeled to trace N through soil-plant-drainage system. Soil was sampled monthly from April to December and trees were destructively harvested in December. In trees fertilized with AS+DMPP, increased biomass was observed with a more profuse development of root system and higher fruit yield. Fertilizer 15 N uptake significantly increased with DMPP addition. In AS+DMPP amended soils, increased values of - 15 N and lower -N concentrations were recorded from April to June as evidence of the inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> on the nitrification process during this period.

40|$|Combined {{application}} of plant residues and N fertilisers strongly affect soil mineral N dynamics and N 2 O emissions {{depending on the}} quality of the plant residues, their application methods and other management strategies. We investigated the effect of combined {{application of}} two vegetable plant residues (cauliflower and sweet corn) and 15 N fertiliser on N dynamics and N 2 O emission in a glasshouse pot study. The experiment was conducted under two residue management practices (soil incorporation vs surface mulching) over 98 days with growing basil (Ocimum basilicum) plants. We also assessed the efficacy of applying the nitrification inhibitor, 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to the plant residues, for reducing N loss and mitigating N 2 O emissions. Application of plant residues, both on the soil surface or into soil, resulted in net N mineralisation and increased cumulative N 2 O emission compared with the application of N fertiliser alone. Soil surface mulching of sweet corn decreased total and residue-induced cumulative N 2 O emission compared with the incorporation method, while it showed opposite effect on N 2 O emissions from cauliflower residue. The application <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> with sweet corn residue reduced total, residue- and fertiliser-induced N 2 O emissions; however its application with cauliflower residue did not show any mitigating effect on the N 2 O emissions. The residue application methods and the use <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> did not significantly affect 15 N recovery by the basil plants. In contrast, soil incorporation of these residues doubled the microbial immobilisation of applied 15 N into soil organic matter. Linear regression analysis of N 2 O emission during the experimental period indicated that in the treatments without DMPP application, soil NO 3 - -N concentration was the most important factor in controlling the magnitude of N 2 O emissions, while the application <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> changed the dominant regulating factor from NO 3 - -N to NH 4 + -N concentration...|$|R

This intensification is forecast to occur mostly in subtropical regions, where warm and humid conditions can promote high N 2 O losses from cropped soils. To secure high crop production without exacerbating N 2 O emissions, new nitrogen (N) fertiliser management strategies are necessary. This one-year study evaluated the efficacy of a nitrification inhibitor (3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate—DMPP) and different N fertiliser rates to reduce N 2 O emissions in a wheat–maize rotation in subtropical Australia. Annual N 2 O emissions were monitored using a fully automated greenhouse gas measuring system. Four treatments were fertilized with different rates of urea, including a control (40 kg-N ha− 1 year− 1), a conventional N fertiliser rate adjusted on estimated residual soil N (120 kg-N ha− 1 year− 1), a conventional N fertiliser rate (240 kg-N ha− 1 year− 1) and a conventional N fertiliser rate (240 kg-N ha− 1 year− 1) with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) applied at top dressing. The maize season {{was by far the}} main contributor to annual N 2 O emissions due to the high soil moisture and temperature conditions, as well as the elevated N rates applied. Annual N 2 O emissions in the four treatments amounted to 0. 49, 0. 84, 2. 02 and 0. 74 kg N 2 O–N ha− 1 year− 1, respectively, and corresponded to emission factors of 0. 29 %, 0. 39 %, 0. 69 % and 0. 16 % of total N applied. Halving the annual conventional N fertiliser rate in the adjusted N treatment led to N 2 O emissions comparable to the DMPP treatment but extensively penalised maize yield. The application <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> produced a significant reduction in N 2 O emissions only in the maize season. The use <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> with urea at the conventional N rate reduced annual N 2 O emissions by more than 60 % but did not affect crop yields. The results of this study indicate that: (i) future strategies aimed at securing subtropical {{cereal production}} without increasing N 2 O emissions should focus on the fertilisation of the summer crop; (ii) adjusting conventional N fertiliser rates on estimated residual soil N is an effective practice to reduce N 2 O emissions but can lead to substantial yield losses if the residual soil N is not assessed correctly; (iii) the application <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> is a feasible strategy to reduce annual N 2 O emissions from sub-tropical wheat–maize rotations. However, at the N rates tested in this study DMPP urea did not increase crop yields, making it impossible to recoup extra costs associated with this fertiliser. The findings of this study will support farmers and policy makers to define effective fertilisation strategies to reduce N 2 O emissions from subtropical cereal cropping systems while maintaining high crop productivity. More research is needed to assess the use <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> urea in terms of reducing conventional N fertiliser rates and subsequently enable a decrease of fertilisation costs and a further abatement of fertiliser-induced N 2 O emissions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{application}} of organic and inorganic fertilizers to soil {{can result in}} increased gaseous emissions, such as NH 3, N 2 O, CO 2, and CH 4, as well as nitrate leaching, contributing to climate warming and ground and surface water pollution, particularly in regions with hot climates, where high temperatures and high soil nitrification rates often occur. The use of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) {{has been shown to}} effectively decrease nitrogen (N) losses from the soil-plant system. Materials and methods Non-disruptive laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to assess the extent to which temperature (20 and 30 degrees C) and nutrient source (mineral and organic fertilizers) influence the rate of carbon (C) - and N-related microbial processes in soil in response to the NI 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Furthermore, short-term changes in the ability of microbes to degrade C substrates were evaluated in disruptive soil microcosms using microbial community-level physiological profiling and the abundance of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene as a measure of total bacterial population size. Results and discussion DMPP reduced net nitrification after 2 and 4 weeks of incubation at 30 and 20 degrees C by an average of 78. 3 and 84. 5 %, respectively, and with similar dynamics for mineral or organic fertilization. The addition of labile organic matter with cattle effluent led to a rapid increase in C mineralization that was significantly reduced by DMPP at both temperatures, whereas no changes could be detected after the addition of mineral fertilizer. The culturable heterotrophic microorganisms showed metabolic diversification in the oxidation of C sources, with organic fertilizer playing {{a major role in the}} substrate utilization patterns during the first week of incubation and the DMPP effects prevailing from day 14 until day 28. Furthermore, the copy number of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene was reduced by the application <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> and organic fertilizer after 28 days. Conclusions Our results show the marked efficiency <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> as an NI at elevated temperatures of incubation and when associated with both mineral and organic fertilization, providing support for its use as a tool to mitigate N losses in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, we also observed impaired C respiration rates and bacterial abundances, as well as shifts in communitylevel physiological profiles in soil, possibly indicating a short-term effect <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> and organic fertilizers on non-target Crelated processes and microorganisms...|$|R

As a consequence of this, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions have increased significantly. Nowadays, the challenge is to mitigate these emissions in order to reduce global warming. Addition of nitrification inhibitors (NI) to fertilizers can reduce the losses of N 2 O to the atmosphere, but field studies have shown that their efficiency varies depending greatly on the environmental conditions. Soil water content and temperature are key factors controlling N 2 O emissions from soils and they seem to be also key parameters responsible for the variation in nitrification inhibitors efficiency. We present a laboratory study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the nitrification inhibitor 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazol phosphate (DMPP) at three different temperatures (10, 15 and 20 °C) and three soil water contents (40 %, 60 % and 80 % of WFPS) on N 2 O emissions following the application of 1. 2 mg N kg - 1 dry soil (equivalent to 140 kg N ha - 1). Also the CO 2 and CH 4 emissions were followed to see the possible side effects <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> on the overall microbial activities. Nitrogen was applied either as ammonium sulfate nitrate (ASN) or as ENTEC 26 (ASN + <b>DMPP).</b> The application <b>of</b> ENTEC 26 was effective reducing N 2 O losses up to the levels of an unfertilized control treatment in all conditions. Nevertheless, the percentage of reduction induced by DMPP in the ENTEC treatment with respect to the ASN varied from 3 % to 45 % depending on temperature and soil water content conditions. At 40 % of WFPS, when nitrification {{is expected to be the}} main process producing N 2 O, the increase of N 2 O emissions in ASN together with temperature provoked an increase in DMPP efficiency reducing these emissions from 17 % up to 42 %. Contrarily, at 80 % of WFPS, when denitrification is expected to be the main source of N 2 O, emissions after ASN application decreased with temperature, which induced a decrease from 45 % to 23 % in the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> reducing N 2 O losses. Overall, the results obtained in this study suggest that DMPP performance regarding N 2 O emissions reduction would be the best in cold and wet conditions.

40|$|The receptors {{involved}} in the pressor and tachycardic effects of catecholamines applied systemically or released from sympathetic nerve endings were compared. Intravenously administered (-) -epinephrine activated alpha- 1, alpha- 2, beta- 1 and beta- 2 adrenoceptors as demonstrated in pithed rats, using the alpha- 1 sympatholytic drug prazosin, the alpha- 2 adrenoceptor blocking substance rauwolscine, the beta- 1 and beta- 2 sympatholytic agent(-) -propranolol, the predominantly beta- 1 adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol and the selective beta- 2 adrenoceptor blocking agent ICI 118, 551 as tools. (-) -Norepinephrine given i. v. {{proved to be an}} alpha- 1, alpha- 2 and beta- 1 adrenoceptor agonist. 1, 1 -Dimethyl- 4 -phenylpiperazine iodide (DMPP) releases catecholamines from noradrenergic neurons and the adrenal medulla. The i. v. injection <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> into pithed rats caused an increase in diastolic pressure and heart rate by this indirect effect, which has been confirmed by pretreatment with reserpine and removal of the adrenals. After bilateral adrenalectomy, there occurred a release of mainly norepinephrine, only from the neurons. Catecholamines liberated by DMPP activated alpha- 1 and beta- 1 receptors and, at high doses <b>of</b> <b>DMPP,</b> alpha- 2 and beta- 2 adrenoceptors as well. Removal of both adrenal glands abolished the alpha- 2 and beta- 2 adrenoceptor-mediated effects. (-) -Norepinephrine released from neurons stimulated alpha- 1 and beta- 1 adrenoceptors only, although after i. v. administration of this catecholamine alpha- 2 adrenoceptors were also activated. There was no indication for a beta- 2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation by neuronally released catecholamines. A beta- 2 adrenoceptor-mediated effect, however, could be demonstrated by i. v. injection of (-) -epinephrine. The results {{can be explained by the}} presence of predominantly alpha- 1 and beta- 1 adrenoceptors in the postganglionic sympathetic synapses and an extrasynaptic location of alpha- 2 and beta- 2 adrenoceptors. The extrasynaptic receptors are possibly controlled by epinephrine from the adrenals...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{piperazine}} derivatives, obtained by hybridization of N 1 -acetyl-N 4 -dimethyl-piperazinium iodide (1, ADMP) and N 1 -phenyl-N 4 -dimethyl-piperazinium iodide (3, <b>DMPP)</b> or <b>of</b> the corresponding tertiary bases (2, 4) with arecoline (5) and arecolone (6) or by isosteric substitution of the phenyl ring <b>of</b> <b>DMPP,</b> has been synthesized. Hybridization afforded compounds that, both as tertiary bases and as iodomethylates, have no {{affinity for the}} nicotinic receptor. On the contrary, isosteric substitution gave compounds that maintain affinity for the receptor; among them, two tertiary bases (37, 38), show affinity in the nanomolar range for the nicotinic receptor. The pharmacological profile of these isomeric compounds is quite interesting as they present differences in their peripheral and central effects, suggesting that they interact with different subtypes of the nicotinic receptor...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} nitrification inhibitor 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and fungicide iprodione on net nitrification rates and abundances of functional genes related to nitrification and denitrification in an agricultural soil. Single DMPP application or repeated iprodione applications decreased net nitrification rates in the test soil. However, when the DMPP and iprodione were applied together, they could generate antagonistic effects on the inhibitions of net nitrification rates. Repeated iprodione applications reduced ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria (AOA and AOB) amoA gene abundances, while DMPP application decreased AOB amoA gene abundances only. The abundances of narG and nirK genes were negatively affected by repeated iprodione applications. Our results demonstrated that combined applications <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> and iprodione could generate antagonistic effects on the inhibitions of net nitrification rates and discrepant impacts on the abundances of functional genes related to soil denitrification...|$|R
40|$|Phenthonium (Phen), a {{quaternary}} analog of hyoscyamine, is a blocker of muscarinic {{activity and}} an allosteric blocker of alpha(1) 2 beta gamma epsilon nicotinic receptors. Specifically, Phenthonium increases the spontaneous release of acetylcholine at the motor endplate without depolarizing the muscle or inhibiting cholinesterase activity. This paper compares Phenthonium's effects on sympathetic transmission and on ganglionic nicotinic receptor activation. Neurotransmitter release and twitch {{of the rat}} vas deferens were induced either by electrical stimulation or by 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -phenylpiperazine (<b>DMPP)</b> activation <b>of</b> nicotinic receptors. Contractions independent of transmitter release were induced by noradrenaline and adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP). Phenthonium inhibited transmitter release and depressed twitch without changing the responsiveness to noradrenaline or ATP. Twitch depression did not occur after K(+) -channel blockade with 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) or charybdotoxin. DMPP had a similar effect, but high concentrations induced contraction of non-stimulated organs. Incubation of Phenthonium inhibited further DMPP twitch depression and non-competitively depressed the contractile responses elicited by DMPP. Furthermore, mecamylamine, but neither methyllycaconitine nor atropine, blocked the contraction elicited by DMPP. Phenthonium and DMPP are K(+) -channel openers that primarily inhibit sympathetic transmission. Contraction induced by DMPP was probably mediated by neuronal nicotinic receptor other than the alpha 7 subtype. the blockade <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> contractile response was unrelated to Phenthonium's antimuscarinic or K(+) -channel opening activities. Since Phenthonium's quaternary chemical structure limits its membrane diffusion, the non-competitive inhibition <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> excitatory responses should be linked to allosteric interaction with neuronal nicotinic receptors that putatively qualify Phenthonium as a novel modulator of cholinergic synapses.

40|$|The {{application}} of nitrification inhibitors {{is a technique}} to reduce the nitrate concentration on leachates that delay ammonium oxidation by reducing the activity of ammonium oxidizing bacteria in soils. Two experiments were carried out in order to estimate the influence <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> on the population of ammonium oxidization bacteria under in vitro conditions. In both experiments, three treatments were established. The treatments were the following: a) ammonium oxidization bacteria established in a growing media without fertilizers, b) ammonium oxidization bacteria established in a growing media with Urea, and c) ammonium oxidization bacteria established in a growing media with DMPP. Results obtained showed that {{the population of the}} ammonia oxidizing bacteria diminished in the DMPP treatment as compared with the urea and control treatments. In conclusion, DMMP influences on ammonium oxidization bacteria activity being a useful tool in fertilizers strategies to reduce the contamination by nitrates in groundwater...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{nitrification}} inhibitors, {{in combination}} with ammonium based fertilisers, has been promoted recently as an effective method to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from fertilised agricultural fields, whilst increasing yield and nitrogen use efficiency. However, to date no data {{is available on the}} use of nitrification inhibitors in sub-tropical vegetable systems. A field experiment investigated the effect of the nitrification inhibitor 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on N 2 O emissions and yield from lettuce production in sub-tropical Australia. Soil N 2 O fluxes were monitored continuously over 120 days with a fully automated system. Measurements were taken from three subplots for each treatment within a randomized complete blocks design. Cumulative N 2 O emissions over the 120 day observation period amounted to 191, 93 and 46 g-N ha - 1 in the conventional fertiliser (CONV), the DMPP treatment and the zero fertiliser (0 N) respectively.

In this cold and dry area, growers traditionally apply large amounts of N with no experimental knowledge. An ‘Arbequina’ hedgerow and ‘Picual’ vase orchards were fertilized with two N-doses applied to the soil in spring with or without the nitrification inhibitor (DMPP). Vegetative growth, fruit and oil characteristics were evaluated. These variables were affected by the N-treatment during the 3 rd year. The lowest N-application increased vegetative growth, while when N-leaf composition was higher than 2 %, fruit dry weight, oil content and oil phenol content were reduced. ‘Picual’ did not respond to N-applications. The effect <b>of</b> <b>DMPP</b> on growth or production was not consistent and a lower phenolic content was obtained for ‘Arbequina’.
