The contestant must answer enough questions to stay ahead of the chaser on the gameboard; otherwise they lose their winnings for that round.

2500|$|Temptation was an Australian {{game show}} which premiered on the Nine Network on 30 May 2005. Hosted by Ed Phillips and Livinia Nixon, {{the show was}} a remake of Sale of the Century, which aired on Nine in the same {{timeslot}} {{for more than twenty}} years between 1980 and 2001. Temptation had the same <b>general</b> <b>format</b> of its predecessor, but with several new features and a de-emphasis on the [...] "shopping" [...] aspects of the endgame. The show ran until 30 November 2007, when it was placed on hiatus by the network following strong competition from game show Deal or No Deal on the rival Seven Network; during the hiatus, Nine filled the timeslot with episodes of the American sitcom Two and a Half Men. When Ed Phillips made an appearance on The NRL Footy Show he announced [...] "maybe summer" [...] would be the return of the show. This statement was accurate, as Temptation returned for a shortened fourth series from 1 December 2008 with unaired episodes which were recorded during 2008. During that time, Ed Phillips was dumped by the Nine Network after his contract expired in November, and Temptation never returned to the schedule. After 23 January 2009, when the show's final episode aired, all Temptation websites were removed, and Two and a Half Men returned to Channel Nine's 7:00pm schedule.|$|E

40|$|Scalable {{similarity}} {{search is}} the core of many large scale learning or data mining applications. Recently, many research results demonstrate that one promising approach is creating compact and efficient hash codes that preserve data similarity. By efficient, we refer to the low correlation (and thus low redundancy) among generated codes. However, most existing hash methods are designed only for vector data. In this paper, we develop a new hashing algorithm to create efficient codes for large scale data of <b>general</b> <b>formats</b> with any kernel function, including kernels on vectors, graphs, sequences, sets and so on. Starting with the idea analogous to spectral hashing, novel formulations and solutions are proposed such that a kernel based hash function can be explicitly represented and optimized, and directly applied to compute compact hash codes for new samples of <b>general</b> <b>formats.</b> Moreover, we incorporate efficient techniques, such as Nyström approximation, to further reduce time and space complexity for indexing and search, making our algorithm scalable to huge data sets. Another important advantage of our method is the ability to handle diverse types of similarities according to actual task requirements, including both feature similarities and semantic similarities like label consistency. We evaluate our method using both vector and non-vector data sets at a large scale up to 1 million samples. Our comprehensive results show the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches for all the tasks, with a significant gain for most tasks...|$|R
