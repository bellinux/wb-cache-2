5|$|In Russia, {{blackcurrant}} leaves may be {{used for}} flavouring tea or preserves, such as salted cucumbers, and berries for home winemaking.

The berries may be <b>infused</b> in a similar manner. In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown end up in Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{research}} has been done to test the In vitro antibacterial activities of sirsak leaf (Annona muricata L.) <b>infuse</b> toward Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 to analyze its thin layer chromatography profile. This research done to observe the antibacterial activity from sirsak leaf <b>infuse.</b> Method: A test on the antibacterial activity was done by using liquid dilution method. The concentration <b>infuse</b> in sterile destilate water using to test the antibacterial activity toward S. aureus were 100 %, 95 %, 90 %, 85 %, 80 %, and 75 % w/v, while toward E. coli were 100 %, 90 %, 80 %, 70 %, 60 %, and 50 % w/v. To detect Chemical contains of the sirsak leaf <b>infuse</b> were identified using Screening method of Phytochemistry and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Result: The result showed that the Minimum Bacterial Concentration (MBC) of sirsak leaf <b>infuse</b> S. aureus were 85 % w/v, while E. coli could not be show antibacterial activity until 100 % w/v concentration. The Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) could not be identified by the liquid dilution because the mixture were turbid and the colour is dark brown. Screening method of Phytochemistry use tube-test and Thin Layer Chromatography showed that the <b>infuse</b> contain flavonoid, poliphenol, and alkaloid. Conclusion: <b>Infuse</b> of sirsak leaf (Annona muricata L.) has antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 profil <b>infuse.</b> Thin Layer Chromatography showed that the <b>infuse</b> contain flavonoid, poliphenol, and alkaloid.

5|$|Western artists often <b>infused</b> Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their {{depictions of the}} dogs of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds.

In this paper, we present <b>Infuse,</b> a time division multiple access (TDMA) based reliable data dissemination protocol. <b>Infuse</b> takes two input parameters: (i) the choice of the recovery algorithm (from one of two presented in this paper) to deal with unexpected channel errors (e. g., message corruption, varying signal strength), and (ii) whether a sensor should listen only to a subset of its neighbors {{to reduce the amount of}} active radio time. Based on these parameters, we obtain four possible versions of <b>Infuse.</b> We compare the performance of these versions to assist a designer in selecting the appropriate version based on the network characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate <b>Infuse</b> in the context of network programming...|$|R
