25|$|The port to the Qt4 {{series was}} {{expected}} to enable KDE 4 to use less memory and be noticeably faster than KDE 3. The KDE libraries themselves have also been made more efficient. However, tests reveal that KDE 4.4 has the highest memory utilization on default Ubuntu installations when compared to GNOME 2.29, Xfce 4.6, and LXDE 0.5. Qt4 is available under the LGPL for Mac OS X and Windows, which allows KDE 4 to run on those platforms. The ports to both platforms are in an early state. , KDE Software compilation 4 on Mac OS X is considered beta, while on Windows {{it is not in}} the final state, so applications can be unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day</b> use yet. Both ports are trying to use as little divergent code as possible to make the applications function almost identically on all platforms. During Summer of Code 2007 an icon cache was created to decrease application start-up times for use in KDE 4. Improvements were varied – Kfind, an application which used several hundred icons, started up in {{about a quarter of the}} time it took previously. Other applications and a full KDE session started up a little over a second faster.|$|E

Citizens in a community expect the same level of satisfaction from their government, as they receive in a customer service-oriented job.
