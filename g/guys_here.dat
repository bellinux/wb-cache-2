500|$|Oppong's {{performances}} {{helped him}} get an NCAA scholarship into Eastern Kentucky. Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations. He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few <b>guys</b> <b>here</b> who I knew and as soon as we came in August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] is a comical Halloween episode {{which was}} filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. [...] After {{shooting}} for two days, director T.J. Scott went to producer Robert Tapert and asked permission {{to alter the}} episode's artistic style to stylised rock video horror. [...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay <b>guys,</b> <b>here</b> we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!" [...] Ultimately, Scott felt that [...] "if you pull it too far out of context and try to take it seriously, it's a bit too rock video at times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cork manager Conor Counihan {{expressed}} his feelings {{in the press}} room: [...] "Relief, {{at the end of}} the day. It's fantastic for the lads, each and every one of them. I spoke to them and we have 30 good <b>guys</b> <b>here,</b> but there are a lot of guys down the years who for one reason or another we had to move on from and those guys are part of this. And the last 20 years, we were landed with a fantastic group of players. They made it hard for themselves, but that makes it all the sweeter". Cork captain Graham Canty also {{expressed his}} feelings at a press conference: [...] "Ah. It feels all right now. It is humbling being captain of this bunch of players. I don't understand why I am in here, just because I am captain". Canty offered his sympathies to Down captain Benny Coulter for the loss he had suffered.|$|E
5000|$|Manx has a wife, Najma Manx, and {{together}} they have one son, Hector Oswald Manx. In a 2002 interview, in their house on Saltspring Island, Manx talked about the stresses of leaving {{his wife and son}} when on touring. “This <b>guy</b> <b>here,</b> he doesn’t care who I’m opening for,” Harry said. “He just wants me home once in a while. It gets tough sometimes. We need to keep that connection all the time. We talk on the phone every day. You should see our phone bill." ...|$|R

5000|$|Bill Geddie, who {{originally}} served as co-executive producer, {{was the lone}} recurring male persona, sometimes shown as stepping out from behind camera {{to interact with the}} hosts. In an interview with Broadcasting & Cable he stated: [...] "I'm not an on-air personality and I think anybody who's seen me realizes that. But early on, the network thought it would be kind of fun to see there's this <b>guy</b> <b>here</b> in charge, but if you watch the show, you see that generally speaking I'm a side player and I'm basically there to get a laugh." ...|$|R
2500|$|The year {{spent in}} Detroit was a {{difficult}} time for Kahlo. Although she had enjoyed visiting San Francisco and New York City, she disliked aspects of American society, which she regarded as colonialist, {{as well as most}} Americans, whom she found [...] "boring". She disliked having to socialize with capitalists such as Henry and Edsel Ford, and was angered that many of the hotels in Detroit refused to accept Jewish guests. In a letter to a friend, she wrote that [...] "although I am very interested in all the industrial and mechanical development of the United States", she felt [...] "a bit of a rage against all the rich <b>guys</b> <b>here,</b> since I have seen thousands of people in the most terrible misery without anything to eat and with no place to sleep, that is what has most impressed me here, it is terrifying to see the rich having parties day and night whiles thousands and thousands of people are dying of hunger." [...] Kahlo's time in Detroit was also complicated by a pregnancy. Her doctor agreed to perform an abortion, but the medication used was ineffective. Kahlo was deeply ambivalent about having a child and had already undergone an abortion earlier in the marriage. Following the failed abortion, she reluctantly agreed to continue with the pregnancy, but miscarried in July, which caused a serious hemorrhage that required her being hospitalized for two weeks. Less than three months later, her mother died from complications of surgery in Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good <b>guys</b> <b>here.</b> [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Prince, talk sense." [...] Mr. Scobell's {{voice was}} almost tearful. [...] "It's you who don't understand. Do, {{for the love}} of Mike, come down off the roof and talk sense. Do you suppose that these <b>guys</b> <b>here</b> will stand for this? Not on your life. Not for a minute. See here. I'm not blaming you. I know you don't know what you're saying. But listen here. You must cut out this kind of thing. You mustn't get these ideas in your head. You stick to your job, and don't butt in on other folks'. Do you know how long you'd stay Prince of this joint if you started in to monkey with my Casino? Just about long enough to let you pack a collar-stud and a {{toothbrush}} into your grip. And after that there wouldn't be any more Prince, sonnie. You stick to your job and I'll stick to mine. You're a mighty good Prince for all that's required of you. You're ornamental, and you've got get-up in you. You just keep right on being a good boy, and don't start trying stunts off your own beat, and you'll do fine. Don't forget that I'm the big noise here. I'm old Grayback from 'way back in Mervo. See! I've only to twiddle my fingers and there'll be a revolution and you for the Down-and-Out Club. Don't you forget it, sonnie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Ventura and Norton {{continued}} to argue over the government's handling of illegal immigration. During the debate, Ventura told Norton to not [...] "put words in my mouth". Norton defended doing so by saying Ventura {{was doing the}} same, to which Ventura said [...] "Bye, guys" [...] and prepared to exit the studio. When Norton asked Ventura why he was leaving, Ventura said, [...] "No, I'm not. There's a fucking <b>guy</b> <b>here</b> telling me I've got a schedule, asshole," [...] Norton replied, [...] "You're using dirty language, asshole." [...] Further tension ensued, with Norton making various insults and accusations of physical intimidation.|$|R

I'll bet he takes nine-tenths of his kale from women and children, and he's an honored citizen.

5000|$|When {{asked in}} a Vox {{interview}} about Russian military policy in Crimea and Ukraine, Stein answered, [...] "These are highly questionable situations. Why are we — Russia used to own Ukraine. Ukraine was historically a part of Russia for quite some period of time, {{and we all know}} there was this conversation with Victoria Nuland about planning the coup and who was going to take over... Let’s just stop pretending there are good <b>guys</b> <b>here</b> and bad <b>guys</b> <b>here.</b> These are complicated situations. Yeah, Russia is doing lots of human rights abuse, but you know what? So are we." [...] When asked by Politico if she thought that Putin was an [...] "incipient despot", Stein answered, [...] "To some extent, yes, but there could be a whole lot worse... when we needlessly provoke him and endanger him and surround him with war games--you know, this is sort of the Cuban Missile Crisis on steroids, what we are doing to Russia right now, and I don't {{think this is a good}} idea." ...|$|E
5000|$|Horwitz hit {{his first}} major league home run on June 2, 2008, off New York Mets {{starting}} pitcher Óliver Pérez. He was mobbed in the dugout afterward.

[...] "Unbelievable," [...] Horwitz said of his Major League experience. [...] "It’s extraordinary, surreal. It’s an out-of-body experience. I’m really enjoying being here. How could you complain?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Guy</b> paused <b>here,</b> but Mr Denham did not speak. The {{kindness}} of the unexpected and certainly unmerited invitation, put, as it was, in tones which expressed great earnestness and regard, took him aback. He felt ill at ease, and his wonted self-possession forsook him. Probably {{much of this}} was owing to physical weakness.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think the}} {{question}} is, imagine if these <b>guys</b> lost from <b>here,</b> what an upset that would be. They’ve almost got it in the bag, so, that’s my motivation." ...|$|R

5000|$|Also on September 16, BK Racing sidelined Ryan Truex and put Travis Kvapil in the No. 83 car. This was a {{decision}} made quietly and wasn't announced till Friday, September 19. No reason was given as to why this happened and the team has not announced the immediate future beyond this weekend. “I didn’t have anything going on this weekend,” Kvapil said. “We had talked about doing something with the 93. These are my <b>guys</b> <b>here.</b> I had been with them {{for the last two}} years and feel I had a hand in building this team.

5000|$|George H. Smyth {{was born}} in Ardglass in 1968. His father was a talented water-colourist. Before {{entering}} art college, he had produced art work for Irish rock band Therapy?. Introduced by a mutual friend to the drummer, Fyfe Ewing, a connection was made and the band chose George to design the cover of their debut, self-financed single and two subsequent albums. He has fond memories of this period, [...] "That was a great time being involved with those <b>guys.</b> <b>Here</b> were three very talented, angry young musicians who wanted to make music that sounded like nothing else around at that time." [...] Their attitude reflected George's own and the resulting images are as loud as the music! ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for Best Editing and Best Film score at the 2011 German Film Awards. It was awarded the Special Jury Award at the 43rd Sitges Film Festival. About.com awarded the film with 4 stars and named it the best vampire film of the year. New York Times gave a negative review and called the film neither romantic or chilling. Twitchfilm.com praised the visuals and effects but was most enthusiastic about the lead characters. He compared that unlike films like Lesbian Vampire Killers, the film explored Louise's lesbian desire from a romantic and humanist perspective. The reviewer concluded by writing [...] "There are no bad <b>guys</b> <b>here,</b> just misunderstood ones, so the way Lena concludes this is strange and unsettling. I really wanted {{to spend more time}} with this group, the film only touches upon what they have been through and feel, but regardless I highly recommend this." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critics praised Matt Lucas's {{portrayal}} of Mr. Toad.

C. Fields," [...] wrote Bellafante. David Knox wrote that [...] "Lucas’ performance positively swamps this treatment of the classic story".|$|R

He is not afraid to test the barriers a little bit, he is not afraid to say, hey, you don't quite do it like this and to look at how the players are really really playing...the mark of a good teacher is someone who listens and evolves with the game and leads that evolution and you have that <b>guy</b> <b>here</b> today.
