40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{innovative}} approach is presented for joining two sheets with an <b>extruded</b> <b>profile</b> all made by AA 6082 -T 6 aluminum alloy. The tested configuration is the T-joint and the innovation {{presented in this}} paper is the use of a specially design appendix of the <b>extruded</b> <b>profile</b> as filler material during the friction welding. In particular three configurations were analyzed: without appendix, with I appendix and with T appendix. In the experiments, several process parameters and PIN shapes were investigated in order to determine optimal processing conditions able to produce an effective sound weld. Specimens were extracted from the joint and tensile tests were performed along the sheet direction thus allowing a comparison of the welded sections respect to the base material. It was found that the appendixes of the <b>extrude</b> <b>profile</b> are able to effectively fill the distance between the sheets and, in particular with the T shape, a gap up to 1, 7 mm on the retreating side was successfully welded...|$|R

50|$|In general, stiffer {{and lighter}} designs can be {{achieved}} with Aluminium alloy than is feasible with steels. For instance, consider the bending of a thin-walled tube: the {{second moment of area}} is inversely related to the stress in the tube wall, i.e. stresses are lower for larger values. The second moment of area is proportional to the cube of the radius times the wall thickness, thus increasing the radius (and weight) by 26% will lead to a halving of the wall stress. For this reason, bicycle frames made of aluminium alloys make use of larger tube diameters than steel or titanium in order to yield the desired stiffness and strength. In automotive engineering, cars made of aluminium alloys employ space frames made of <b>extruded</b> <b>profiles</b> to ensure rigidity. This represents a radical change from the common approach for current steel car design, which depend on the body shells for stiffness, known as unibody design.|$|E

In this study, <b>extruded</b> <b>profiles</b> of AA 6082 have been examined. Seven different alloys with increasing content of Mn have been subjected to three homogenisation procedures. The purpose of the different homogenisation procedures was to obtain different densities of dispersoids, while still maintaining the same level of elements in solid solution. The study have examined the effect of Mn and homogenisation procedure on grain structure, strength and corrosion behaviour. Results from this study showed that the density of dispersoids greatly affect the final grain structure after extrusion. Homogenisation variants that contained a high density of dispersoids showed low degree of recrystallisation. Increasing amount of Mn also contributed to a lower degree of recrystallisation. In as extruded condition variants with a high density of dipersoids were harder than variants with lower density, despite equal chemistry and elements in solid solution. At peak strength, increased content of Mn led to a reduction in strength. </p...|$|E
