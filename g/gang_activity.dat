5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place {{about five years}} before , in midwinter Gotham City.

However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and <b>gang</b> <b>activity</b> in the city.|$|E
