In this paper we investigate both alternatives in combination with the two general paradigms FATI and FITA to process rule bases.

Given a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> <b>set</b> F 0 the evaluation of this input by a fuzzy rule can be interpreted as the fuzzy image of F 0 under this relation.

The main problems in multi-sensor systems are how to select sensors, model the sensors, and combine the data;This dissertation proposes a new data fusion method based on fuzzy set methods. The expected output membership function (EOMF) method uses the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> <b>set</b> and the expected fuzzy output. This method uses the intersections of the fuzzy inputs with the expected fuzzy output {{in order to}} find relationships between the given inputs and the estimate of the output. The EOMF method creates a fuzzy confidence distance measurement by assessing the 2 ̆ 2 fusability 2 ̆ 2 of the data. The fusability measure is used for finding the best position of the EOMF and the best estimate of the system output. Adaptive methods can help deal with occasional bad measurements and set the EOMF to the proper width. The EOMF method can be used for both homogeneous and heterogeneous sensors, which give redundant, cooperative or complementary information. In addition, the EOMF method is robust {{in the sense that it}} can eliminate sensor measurements that are outliers. The EOMF method compares favorably with other methods of data fusion such as the weighted average method. An example from the control of automated vehicles shows the effectiveness of the adaptive EOMF method, compared to the fixed EOMF method and the weighted average method in the presence of Gaussian and impulsive noise. This method can also be applied to nondestructive evaluation (NDE) images from heterogeneous sensors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A fuzzy {{controller}} uses either Zadeh or product fuzzy AND operator, {{with the former}} being more frequently used than the latter. We have recently published a novel technique for deriving analytical input–output relation for the {{fuzzy controller}}s that use Zadeh AND operator and arbitrary trapezoidal <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> including triangular ones as special cases. In this paper, we have developed a general technique based on that technique to cover arbitrary types of <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets.</b> Moreover, we have es-tablished some necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize general relationship between shape of <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> and shape of input space divisions, an important and integral issue because analytical relationship differs in different regions of input space. The new technique and the shape relations are applicable to any type of fuzzy controllers (e. g., Mamdani type or Takagi–Sugeno type). The analytical structures that we have derived provide an unprecedented opportunity to insightfully and rigorously examine the advantages and shortcomings of different design choices available for various components of the fuzzy controllers. We have focused on type selection for <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> of Mamdani fuzzy controllers. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the fuzzy controllers using trapezoidal fuzzy sets may be understood (and possibly analyzed and designed) more sensibly and easily {{in the context of}} conventional control theory than the fuzzy controllers using any other types of fuzzy sets. Our proposition is that trape-zoidal fuzzy sets should be the first choice and used most of time. Possible implication for automatic learning of <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> via neural networks or genetic algorithms is briefly discussed.

Moreover, there exist no theoretical methods for rigorously judging model stability and validity. I attempt to provide solutions to these issues for a general class of fuzzy models. They use arbitrary continuous <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> arbitrary fuzzy rules, arbitrary inference methods, Zadeh or product fuzzy logic AND operator, singleton output fuzzy sets, and the centroid defuzzifier. I first show that the fuzzy models belong to the NARX (nonlinear autoregressive with the extra input) model structure, {{which is one of the}} most important and widely used structures in classical modeling. I then divide the NARX model structure into three nonlinear types and investigate how the settings of the fuzzy model compo-nents, especially <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> dictate the relations between the fuzzy models and these types. I have found that the fuzzy models become type- 2 models if and only if the <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> are linear or piecewise linear (e. g., trapezoidal or triangular), becoming type 3 if and only if at least one <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> is nonlinear. I have also developed an algorithm to transfer type- 2 fuzzy models into type- 1 models as far as their input–output relationships are concerned, which have some important properties not shared by the type- 2 models. Furthermore, a necessary and suf-ficient condition has been derived for a part of the general fuzzy models to be linear ARX models. I have established a necessary and sufficient condition for judging local stability of type- 1 and type- 2 fuzzy models. It can be used for model validation and control system design.

However, using singleton fuzzification assumes that the input data (i. e., measurements) are precise with no uncertainty associated with them.

The fuzzy controllers use T-S fuzzy rules with linear consequent, the generalized <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> Zadeh fuzzy logic and operators, and the generalized defuzzifier. The fuzzy controllers are proved to be nonlinear proportional-integral (PI) controllers with variable gains. The fuzzy rules are discovered automatically and the design parameters in the <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> and the linear rule consequent are optimized simultaneously by the VDNA-EA. The VDNA-EA uses the VDNA encoding method that stemmed from the structure of the VDNA to encode the design parameters of the fuzzy controllers. We use the frameshift decoding method of the VDNA to decode the DNA chromosome into the design parameters of the fuzzy controllers. In addition, the gene transfer operation and bacterial mutation operation inspired by a microbial evolution phenom-enon are introduced into the VDNA-EA. Moreover, frameshift mutation operations based on the DNA genetic operations are used in the VDNA-EA to add and delete adaptively fuzzy rules. Our encoding method can significantly shorten the code length of the DNA chromosomes and improve the encoding efficiency. The length of the chromosome is variable and it is easy to insert and delete parts of the chromosome. It is suitable for complex knowledge representation and is easy for the genetic operations at gene level to be introduced into the VDNA-EA. We show how to implement the new method to self-learn a T-S fuzzy controller in the control of a nonlinear system. The fuzzy controller can be constructed automatically by the VDNA-EA.
