40|$|This paper {{studies the}} minimum {{switching}} control {{problem for a}} system of coupled double integrators with on-off input signals, {{in the presence of}} a constant disturbance term. This type of problem is rel-evant to a variety of applications in which the number of transitions of on-off actuators must be minimized, in order to prevent actuator wear. Two solutions are presented in terms of steady state limit cy-cles. The first one provides an analytic upper bound to the maximum number of transitions per input signal. The second solution exploits the relative phases of the trajectories of the state variables, thus pro-viding a less conservative upper bound. Additionally, a control law is presented, which steers the system in finite time to the previously <b>derived</b> <b>limit</b> cycles. The proposed techniques are demonstrated on a spacecraft attitude control application. ...|$|E

We present the empirically <b>derived</b> <b>limit</b> surface for directional adhesive pads and illustrate its application to controlling the forces at the feet of a robot climbing on arbitrary slopes, including overhanging surfaces. For the directional adhesive patches that we have developed, the limit surface is convex, which permits efficient computation of the desired internal and external forces among the feet to maximize a safety margin with respect to disturbance forces on the robot. The limit surface also intersects the origin in force space, which enables efficient climbing without wasting energy in attaching and detaching the feet. These insights are applied to an experimental climbing platform demonstrating the proper use of directional adhesion and mimicking the climbing behavior seen in geckos. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a Partial Spectrum Reuse (PSR) scheme, namely “β-PSR”, to improve spectrum efficiency of two-tier heterogeneous cellular networks, {{in which each}} micro Base Station (BS) occupies a uniform portion β of the whole system spectrum randomly and independently. We analyze the optimal PSR factor β to minimize service outage probability, which is not in an explicit form. Then a closed-form limit of the PSR factor is derived when {{the ratio of the}} user data rate requirement over the system bandwidth is approaching zero. This limit is an explicit function of the traffic intensity, the macro/micro BS density and their transmit power. Our numerical results also show that for most current rate requirements, the optimal PSR factor is well approximated by our <b>derived</b> <b>limit.</b> This motivates the design of an adaptive PSR scheme with near-optimal performance, which only depends on statistical network information. 1 I...|$|E

40|$|This paper extends certain {{characterizations}} of nullhomotopic maps between p-compact groups to maps with target the p-completed classifying {{space of a}} connected Kac-Moody group and source the classifying space of either a p-compact group or a connected Kac-Moody group. A well known inductive principle for p-compact groups is applied to obtain general, mapping space level results. An arithmetic fiber square computation shows that a null map from the classifying space of a connected compact Lie group to the classifying space of a connected topological Kac-Moody group can be detected by restricting to the maximal torus. Null maps between the classifying spaces of connected topological Kac-Moody groups cannot, in general, be detected by restricting to the maximal torus due to the nonvanishing of an explicit abelian group of obstructions described here.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the benefits of}} exploiting the a priori information about {{the structure of the}} multipath channel on the performance of channel estimation for multiple-input multiple-output–orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first approach this problem {{from the point of view}} of estimation theory by computing a lower bound on the estimation error and studying its properties. Then, based on the insight obtained from the analysis, efficient channel estimators are designed that perform close to the <b>derived</b> <b>limit.</b> The proposed channel estimators compute the long-term features of the multipath channel model through a subspace tracking algorithm by identifying the invariant (over multiple OFDM symbols) space/time modes of the channel (modal analysis). On the other hand, the fast-varying fading amplitudes are tracked by using least-squares techniques that exploit temporal correlation of the fading process (modal filtering). The analytic treatment is complemented by thorough numerical investigation in order to validate the performance of the proposed techniques. MIMO-OFDM with bit-interleaved coded modulation and MIMO-turbo equalization is selected as a benchmark for performance evaluation in terms of bit-error rate.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the Ph. D {{academic}} job market. Based on the Gale and Shapley algorithm, we analyse whether a social planner can improve market efficiency by truncation, i. e., exogenously imposing {{a limit on}} the number of possible applications. Using simulations, we derive the optimal truncation level which balances the trade-off between being unmatched and gaining a better match in the aggregate. When graduates apply to their most preferred positions, we find that aggregate efficiency can be improved by limiting the number of applications. In particular, the limit can be considerable if the graduates' preferences over the positions are not very correlated. The <b>derived</b> <b>limit</b> is still the best one when graduates respond strategically (applying to universities which are at least individually most preferred at the expenses of those most preferred commonly) in a conservative sense: given the strategic behaviour of the graduates, the market efficiency can be further improved by choosing an even lower limit {{on the number of}} applications.
