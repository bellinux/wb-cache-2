25|$|Immediately {{investigations}} {{were started}} by the French authorities in Quimper. Several explanations were advanced to explain the capsizing including a fishing accident, collision with a surface ship, rock or wreck, {{the presence of a}} sandbank, and an accident involving a submarine. In June 2004 the ship was raised for forensic examinations. The <b>fish</b> <b>hold</b> showed a compression due to the water pressure. In the absence of evidence of any ramming, the hypothesis of a collision with a surface ship could be abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Seawater in {{a fishing}} port was electrolyzed to induce {{hypochlorite}} up to approximately 1 mg/L for {{the reduction of}} viable bacterial count because disinfection of seawater {{is important for the}} prevention and control of hazards in seafoods. The number of viable bacteria in a <b>fish</b> <b>holding</b> tank was lowered from 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5 mg/L to 10 ^ 0 - 10 ^ 1 mg/L after electrolization of seawater and the low level of viable bacterial count was kept for at least 3 hours. The reduction rate of chlorine concentration of the electrolyzed seawater in the <b>fish</b> <b>holding</b> tank was reduced by the addition of ice and by covering with a thermal insulating sheet. However, the chlorine concentration decreased when fish were put into the <b>fish</b> <b>holding</b> tank. In a fisher-boat tank, viable bacterial count remained less than 100 CFU/mL for at least 60 minutes when ice was present. It was also shown that electrolyzed seawater was useful for disinfection of deck or fishing equipment...|$|R

25|$|Modern {{trawlers}} {{store the}} fish they catch {{in some form}} of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the <b>fish</b> <b>hold.</b> In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, {{the more likely it is}} to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted. Factory trawlers may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.|$|E
25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the <b>fish</b> <b>hold</b> amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E

2500|$|Wet fish {{trawlers}} are trawlers {{where the}} fish is kept in the hold in a fresh/wet condition, in boxes covered with ice or with ice in the <b>fish</b> <b>hold.</b> They must operate in areas close to their landing place, and the time such a vessel can spend fishing is limited.|$|E
2500|$|Side {{trawlers}} {{have the}} trawl deployed {{over the side}} with the trawl warps passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and another aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the <b>fish</b> <b>hold</b> amidships, and the transversal trawl winch forward of the superstructure. A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, Ross Tiger is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used {{for a longer period}} than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums.|$|E
6000|$|... "On a {{beautiful}} morning in September 1810 I started with Sir Walter from Ashiestiel. We began nearly under {{the ruins of}} Elibank, and in sight of the 'Hanging Tree.' I only had a rod, but Sir Walter walked by my side, now quoting Izaak Walton, as, 'Fish me this stream by inches,' and now delighting me with a profusion of Border stories. After the capture of numerous fine trout, I hooked something greater and unseen, which powerfully ran out my line. Sir Walter got {{into a state of}} great excitement, exclaiming, 'It's a fish! It's a <b>fish!</b> <b>Hold</b> up your rod! Give him line!' and so on. The rod, which belonged to one of his boys, broke, and put us both into great alarm; but I contrived, by ascending the steep bank and holding down the rod, still to give play to the reel, till, after a good quarter of an hour's struggle, a trout, for so it turned out to be, was conducted round a little peninsula. Sir Walter jumped into the water, seized him, and threw him out on the grass. Tom Purdie came up a little time after, and was certainly rather discomposed at my success. 'It will be some sea brute,' he observed; but he became satisfied that it was a fine river-trout, and such as, he afterwards admitted, had not been killed in Tweed for twenty years; and when I moved down the water, he went, as Sir Walter afterwards observed, and gave it a kick on the head, exclaiming, 'To be ta'en by the like o' him frae Lunnon!'" ...|$|E
