500|$|Later, Doug Herzog from Comedy Central saw the Jesus vs. Santa {{short and}} {{considered}} {{it to be}} [...] "literally the funniest thing 'd ever seen," [...] and requested Parker and Stone to develop a show for his network.

[...] The network's executives were receptive to the idea, which {{would be one of the}} main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel. The first episode of the series, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", debuted on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997, while Mr. Hankey debuted a few months later in the ninth episode, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".|$|E
500|$|Although the Mr. Hankey {{short film}} was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related {{animated}} short films called The Spirit of Christmas, {{which served as}} precursors to the South Park series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived {{the idea of a}} South Park-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it [...] "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden, then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, [...] "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, [...] "One thing we have to know before we really go any further: how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> talking poo?"

It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This {{turned out to be a}} Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E

[...] MEMRI cut out {{the first part of the}} reply and combined it with the answer to the next question, which, Whitaker claimed, made [...] "Arabs look more anti-semitic than they are". Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies as both questions referred to the same subject. [...] Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: [...] "it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake... You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have missed, you have failed to answer."

2500|$|The {{trial began}} on 14 April 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with Rowling testifying {{on day one}} and Vander Ark testifying on day two. During her testimony, Rowling reiterated her claim that the Lexicon {{contained}} minimal commentary and merely recycled her writing, adding nothing other than [...] "facetious asides and etymologies of the easiest kind." [...] Rowling referred to the Lexicon as [...] "wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work", and criticized it as [...] "sloppy" [...] and characterized by [...] "very little research". In sometimes emotional testimony, Rowling recalled beginning the Potter books when she was an impoverished 25-year-old single mother, nearly coming to tears when saying, [...] "These characters continue to mean {{so much to me}} {{over a long period of}} time.

In writing the song, Luckinbill said he was [...] "thinking of the character's viewpoint, from J.T. to Colleen. If he were going to write her a song, what would he write? And these words came out.

The questionnaires survey was used to abstract the satisfaction data relevant to the study question.

To get clear responses, all of these questions have the following possible responses without setting an “undecided” or “don’t know” option: strongly satisfied, satisfied, dissatisfied, strongly dissatisfied.

40|$|Purpose: Anti-VegF {{therapy for}} the {{treatment}} of neovascular AMD has clear clinical and quality of life benefits, as shown in numerous well conducted studies. It is now being implemented in many healthcare systems. However, treatment often involves multiple assessments and intravitreal drug injections, usually {{over an extended period of}} time. How do patients view this process, particularly at the outset, and how does their actual experience affect their views? Methods: Fifteen patients (mean age 76 y; 6 males) were recruited and interviewed using the Biographical Narrative Interview Method (BNIM) before or just after treatment was commenced. At the end of the BNIM interview, a VFQ 25 was also completed. Nine patients were interviewed several months later after they had received at least the loading dose of three injections. A semi-structured interview technique was used and the MacTSQ (a specific treatment satisfaction questionnaire, in which patients score their most recent treatment episode) administered. Interview data was subjected to thematic analysis, and VFQ 25 and MacTSQ data scored and collated in accordance with published procedures. Results: The intersubject mean (±SD) VFQ 25 General Health and General Vision scores were 57 ± 29 and 61 ± 26 respectively; Near Activities scored 65 ± 32. In BNIM interviews almost all patients said that they had known relatively little about what treatment would entail other than that it required injections into their eye. They reported considerable apprehension pre-treatment. However, post-treatment interview data demonstrated that this apprehension was defused by actual treatment experience. None experienced serious adverse events, and few reported experiencing serious discomfort. Where this did occur, it did not discourage patients from continuing with treatment. These reports were complemented by the Mac TSQ data. The mean overall score was 65 ± 5 / 72 (a higher score indicates greater satisfaction). Item 6 specifically asks "How apprehensive <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> your most recent treatment?". The mean score was 5. 2 ± 1. 1 / 6 (where 6 ="Not apprehensive at all"). Many patients compared their treatment favourably to dental treatment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients are, in general, very happy with their treatment experience, returning high scores on the MacTSQ. Better information provision at the outset of their treatment journey may be of value in defusing further the apprehension that they reported in initial interviews...|$|R
