5000|$|The facts {{varied between}} the {{individual}} appeals, but the common theme in each of them was that an Event of Default (as defined) had occurred under an ISDA Master Agreement, but the <b>Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> (as defined) was [...] "in the money", {{in the sense that}} if the open positions were all to be terminated, the non-Defaulting Party would have had to pay over considerable sums to the <b>Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> to close out the various positions. However, in each case the relevant Master Agreements had not provided for automatic early termination upon an Event of Default.

5000|$|To {{ensure that}} undue {{hardship}} is not {{imposed on the}} <b>defaulting</b> <b>party</b> ... the defaulting party's liability is limited in terms of broad principles of causation and remoteness, to (a) those damages that flow naturally and generally {{from the kind of}} breach of contract in question and which the law presumes the parties contemplated as a probable result of the breach, and (b) those damages that, although caused by the breach of contract, are ordinarily regarded in law as being too remote to be recoverable unless, in the special circumstances attending the conclusion of the contract, the parties actually or presumptively contemplated that they would probably result from its breach.|$|E

Their purpose, if they are positive-interest or expectation damages, is to place the innocent party in the position he would have occupied had the contract been properly performed (though the <b>defaulting</b> <b>party</b> is not liable for special consequences he could not have contemplated when he entered into the contract). Negative-interest or reliance damages aim to place the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied had he not entered into the contract at all.

Even if a given sanction does not constitute a legal impediment justifying the <b>defaulting</b> <b>party’s</b> exemption from liability, the risk of penalty that this party would incur if it were to perform the contract in breach of the sanction may justify an adaptation of the contract.

5000|$|In Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc it {{was argued}} that certain {{provisions}} in standard form ISDA Master Agreement might offend against the rule; specifically {{that if an}} Event of Default (as defined) suspended {{the right of the}} <b>Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> to receive payment indefinitely, then that would mean that if the Non-Defaulting Party went into liquidation, the operating effect of the provision was to deprive the company's creditors of assets as a consequence of it going into liquidation.

5000|$|It {{has been}} remarked that the CISG expresses a practice-based, {{flexible}} and [...] "relational" [...] character.

40|$|The {{adversarial}} system is lauded {{for determining the}} truth of claims, safeguarding procedural rights, and supporting the efficient direction of resources toward the most relevant and contested issues in a dispute. If a case proceeded to judgment with participation from only one party, it would raise concerns of justice, efficiency, accuracy, and the public interest. And yet, in a tribunal of steadily growing importance for intellectual property disputes—the International Trade Commission (ITC or Commission) —certain cases proceed {{without the benefit of}} participation from adverse <b>parties.</b> Following the <b>default</b> of named <b>parties,</b> administrative law judges determine the scope and validity of patent claims without the benefit of arguments from interested parties. The effects of these determinations are not limited to the <b>defaulting</b> <b>parties,</b> but applied widely through the in rem relief of general exclusion orders, enforced at the border to keep infringing goods out of the country. A separate form of exclusion follows in infringement determinations made by U. S. Customs and Border Protection and appeals therefrom. Those determinations proceed without participation from interested patent holders. This article identifies and turns scholarly attention to the phenomenon of adjudicating patents absent adversaries, arguing that it is both inefficient and ineffective to construe patent claims without the guiding context of a controversy. Absent adversaries, the public interests that are reliant on robust adversarial participation in patent disputes go unrepresented. This article explores possible solutions and suggests delaying time-intensive adjudication until interested adversaries are present. It further recommends placing continuing jurisdiction with the ITC to adjudicate disputes currently decided by Customs...|$|R
5000|$|In {{one of the}} cojoined appeals it {{was argued}} that if an Event of Default {{suspended}} {{the right of the}} <b>Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> to receive payment indefinitely, then that would be a breach of the anti-deprivation rule. [...] Because in this case the Event of Default was one party going into liquidation, that meant that the operating effect of the provision was to deprive the company's creditors of assets as a consequence of it going into liquidation. The Court referred to the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd 2011 UKSC 38 and held that relevant test was to consider each transaction on its merits to see whether the shift in interests complained of could be justified as a genuine and justifiable commercial response to the consequences of insolvency. The Court of Appeal held that [...] "If this is the touchstone then {{it is difficult to see}} how Section 2(a)(iii) of the Master Agreement can be said to offend against the anti-deprivation principle. ...

5000|$|In their {{decision}} in Makdessi the Supreme Court reviewed the historical {{origins of the}} rule against penalty clauses in contracts. [...] The law originated {{in the fifteenth century}} in relation to [...] "defeasible bonds" [...] (sometimes called penal bonds) which were a contractual promise to pay money, which might be discharged if certain obligations were performed (and if the obligations were not performed, then the payment terms under the bond could be enforced). [...] However the courts of equity regarded these as what they really were - security for performance of the underlying obligation - and were prepared to restrain enforcement of such bonds where the <b>defaulting</b> <b>party</b> paid any damages due at common law. [...] In time the courts of common law began to mirror this approach and stay any proceedings on such bonds where the defendant gave an undertaking to pay damages together with interest and costs. The position of the common law courts was adopted and codified in the Administration of Justice Act 1696 and later the Administration of Justice Act 1705. Accordingly, procedurally relief in relation to such bonds was thereafter administered entirely by the common law courts without intervention by the courts of equity. However, the courts of equity began to develop concurrent remedies for relief from forfeiture. With the decline of the use of defeasible bonds the procedural mechanics became increasingly applied to liquidated damages clauses.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} describe contractual dispute resolution by mediation in situations where a defaulting supplier is near insolvent. While each party has internal constraints, and if alternate performances are available, such as more costly alternative goods, the proposed approach allows the mediator to find an optimal solution. The notion of optimality is presented as adherence to the initial contract, therefore optimising a value function for the non <b>defaulting</b> <b>party.</b> The proposed model includes describing the evolution over time of each party's perceived constraints using a phasor like approach with a modulation to the core constraints phasing out of the real part and phasing in the imaginary part of complex numbers. The offers related to alternative performances by the <b>defaulting</b> <b>party</b> are modelled by a Gompertz function, being an exponential learning curve of the supplier {{in regards to the}} reaction to its offers, limited by another exponential function when approaching its internal constraints. Furthermore, the model takes into account the discount associated to the delay in the delivery time of the alternative performances. Comment: 21 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|The current default {{judgment}} {{system is}} filled with problems. Default judgments are routinely set aside based upon the party’s “excusable neglect” for failing to timely answer. In such cases, the defaulting party’s negligence is essentially condoned because the non-defaulting party is not properly compensated for the delay and the <b>defaulting</b> <b>party</b> is not adequately reprimanded. Even after obtaining a default judgment, the nondefaulting party may have its victory disappear if a motion to set aside is filed shortly thereafter. On the other hand, some parties involved in litigation are ambushed with a default based on improper service. By sitting on the judgment without giving notice or attempting to collect, the nondefaulting party can even manipulate the one-year cutoff date in Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the arguments {{that can be made}} in the motion to set aside.
