Brain death was confirmed in 77 % on the basis of absent supratentorial and infratentorial uptake. Where brain death was not confirmed, a normal scan was seen in 30 %, the remainder showing patchy reduced infratentorial and/or supratentorial uptake. All patients with the scintigraphic appearance of brain death subsequently died. Even when brain death could not be confirmed, 11 of 13 patients died soon afterwards. Two patients with normal brain scintigraphy regained consciousness and survived for an extended period. When brain death was not confirmed by scintigraphy, elapsed time to certification of death was longer (44. 7 vs. 7 h) and organ donation was less common even when a subsequent clinical diagnosis was made. The results indicate that patient prognosis remains poor regardless of the findings on (99 m) Tc-labelled <b>exametazime</b> scintigraphy, but that the scan result influences the elapsed time to withdrawal of therapy or organ donation, providing a significant cost benefit, and occasionally a long-term survivor is seen...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{guideline}} is to assist nuclear medicine practitioners in recommending, performing, interpreting, and reporting the results of 111 In-labeled leukocyte (111 In-leukocyte) scintigraphy. II. Background Information and Definitions 111 In-leukocyte scintigraphy is a diagnostic imaging test that displays the distribution of radiolabeled leukocytes in the body. Regional, whole-body, planar, and/or SPECT scintigrams of specific anatomic regions are obtained for suspected infection/inflammation. In osteomyelitis, regional or whole-body bone scintigraphy {{may be used in}} conjunction with 111 Inleukocyte scintigraphy to detect sites of abnormal bone remodeling. Bone marrow scintigraphy using 99 m Tc-sulfur colloid can be a useful adjunct to assess marrow distribution at suspected osteomyelitis sites, particularly when the site is adjacent to orthopedic hardware and the neuropathic joint. Gallium scintigraphy is usually preferred in patients with (a) neutropenia or (b) nonsuppurative or lymphocytemediated infections. 99 m Tc-HMPAO (<b>exametazime)</b> labeled leukocyte scintigraphy is a frequently used option for acute infections, particularly in pediatric patients. ...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{hyperglycaemia}} and recurrent severe hypoglycaemia {{have both}} been implicated as causing cerebral damage in patients with diabetes. Although cognitive dysfunction and intellectual impairment have been demonstrated in patients with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia, structural correlates have not been described, {{and it is not}} known whether specific functional changes occur in the brains of affected patients. Regional cerebral blood flow was estimated by SPECT with 99 mTechnetium <b>Exametazime</b> in 20 patients with IDDM. Ten patients had never experienced severe hypoglycaemia and 10 had a history of recurrent severe hypoglycaemia. Patient results were compared with 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. We observed differences between the two patient groups and the control group. Tracer uptake was greater in diabetic patients in the superior pre-frontal cortex. This effect was particularly pronounced in the group who had a history of previous severe hypoglycaemia. Patients with a history of recurrent hypoglycaemia also had a relative reduction in tracer uptake to the calcarine cortex. This suggests an alteration in the pattern of baseline regional cerebral blood flow in diabetic patients with frontal excess and relative posterior reduction in cerebral blood flow...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{patients}} with Alzheimer-type dementia and nine age-matched normal controls were examined with SPECT, using split-dose 99 mTc-labelled <b>exametazime.</b> The baseline condition involved {{repetition of the}} word 'yes' or 'no'. The activation condition involved recognition (indicated by a 'yes' or 'no') of words from a previously learned list presented along with distractor words. Patients who performed this task successfully were selected, and {{efforts were made to}} match the {{patients with}} controls according to their performance on the task, although this was not fully achieved. Uptake of 99 mTc-exametazime was estimated at baseline and during the word-recognition task for predetermined regions of interest drawn from a standard neuroanatomical atlas. The baseline task appeared to normalise tracer uptake for frontal, temporal and parietal cortex in the patient group. However, during the recognition task, controls but not patients showed activation effects. These were most prominent in dorsolateral frontal cortex and adjacent anterior cingulate cortex. Among patients, successful performance was correlated with activation of dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortex on the left side. The results confirm the central role of frontal mechanisms in a recognition memory task. The study highlights some of the difficulties of using cognitive challenge tests in clinical groups...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{evaluated}} the clinical interpretations of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using a {{cerebral blood flow}} and a dopamine transporter tracer in patients with chronic mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). The goal was to determine how these two different scan might be used and compared {{to each other in}} this patient population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Twenty-five patients with persistent symptoms after a mild TBI underwent SPECT with both (99 m) Tc <b>exametazime</b> to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and (123) I ioflupane to measure dopamine transporter (DAT) binding. The scans were interpreted by two expert readers blinded to any case information and were assessed for abnormal findings in comparison to 10 controls for each type of scan. Qualitative CBF scores for each cortical and subcortical region along with DAT binding scores for the striatum were compared to each other across subjects and to controls. In addition, symptoms were compared to brain scan findings. TBI patients had an average of 6 brain regions with abnormal perfusion compared to controls who had an average of 2 abnormal regions (p CONCLUSIONS: Overall, both scans detected abnormalities in brain function, but appear to reflect different types of physiological processes associated with chronic mild TBI symptoms.

40|$|Hyperdensity in {{the middle}} {{cerebral}} artery (MCA) or posterior cerebral artery (PCA) on non-contrast head CT, suggests {{the presence of a}} thrombus inside these vessels, {{often referred to as the}} "MCA sign" or "PCA sign" respectively. These two signs are classically associated with strokes secondary to cardiovascular etiologies and are only infrequently reported with other types of stroke. Whereas stroke is a recognized complication of pneumococcal meningitis hyperdense large vessel sign (in this case a combination of MCA and PCA) has not been previously reported. We report a case of rapidly progressive pneumococcal meningitis that presented as acute stroke involving large vessels in the vicinity of the circle of Willis in a patient with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in remission for 6 years. This patient had received a week of high dose steroids before admission. Head CT scan on admission showed the presence of hyperdense MCA and PCA signs. The patient rapidly deteriorated and a follow-up head CT revealed diffuse brain edema and increased density in the basal cisterns without evidence of sub arachnoid hemorrhage. Tc 99 m <b>exametazime</b> brain flow scan showed no intracerebral blood flow both supra and infratentorially. Steptococcus pneumoniae, NHL cells and high-dose steroid use can upregulate tissue factor synthesis and may have led to a hypercoagulable state via activation of the extrinsic pathway in the large intracerbral arteries...|$|E
40|$|White {{blood cell}} (WBC) {{scintigraphy}} {{is considered the}} nuclear medicine imaging gold standard for diagnosing osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. Recent papers {{have suggested that the}} use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT produces similar diagnostic accuracy, but clear interpretation criteria have not yet been established. Our aim was to evaluate the role of sequential 18 F-FDG PET/CT in patients with a high suspicion of osteomyelitis to define objective interpretation criteria to be compared with WBC scintigraphy. Methods: Thirteen patients whom clinicians considered positive for osteomyelitis (7 with ulcers, 6 with exposed bone) were enrolled. The patients underwent 99 mTc- <b>exametazime</b> WBC scintigraphy with acquisition times of 30 min, 3 h, and 20 h and sequential 18 F-FDG PET/CT with acquisition times of 10 min, 1 h, and 2 h. A biopsy or tissue culture was performed for final diagnosis. Several interpretation criteria (qualitative and quantitative) were tested. Results: At final biopsy, 7 patients had osteomyelitis, 2 had soft-tissue infection without osteomyelitis, and 4 had no infection. The best interpretation criterion for osteomyelitis with WBC scintigraphy was a target-to-background (T/B) ratio greater than 2. 0 at 20 h and increasing with time. A T/B ratio greater than 2. 0 at 20 h but stable or decreasing with time was suggestive of soft-tissue infection. A T/B ratio of no more than 2. 0 at 20 h excluded an infection. Thus, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for osteomyelitis were 86 %, 100 %, 100 %, 86 %, and 92 %, respectively. For 18 F-FDG PET/CT, the best interpretation criterion for osteomyelitis was a maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) greater than 2. 0 at 1 and 2 h and increasing with time. A SUVmax greater than 2. 0 after 1 and 2 h but stable or decreasing with time was suggestive of a soft-tissue infection. An SUVmax less than 2. 0 excluded an infection. 18 F-FDG PET at 10 min was not useful. Using these criteria, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for osteomyelitis were 43 %, 67 %, 60 %, 50 %, and 54 %, respectively. Combining visual assessment of PET at 1 h and CT was best for differentiating between osteomyelitis and soft-tissue infection, with a diagnostic accuracy of 62 %. Conclusion: 18 F-FDG PET/CT, even with sequential imaging, has a low diagnostic accuracy for osteomyelitis and cannot replace WBC scintigraphy in patients with diabetic foot.
