25|$|Irradiation {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xc): The crosslinking of polyethylene is {{also possible}} by a downstream radiation source (usually a <b>electron</b> <b>accelerator,</b> occasionally a isotopic radiator). PE products are crosslinked below the crystalline melting point by splitting off hydrogen atoms. β-radiation possesses a penetration depth of 10 mm, ɣ-radiation 100mm. Thereby the interior or specific areas can be excluded from the crosslinking. However, due to high capital and operating costs radiation crosslinking plays only a minor role compared with the peroxide crosslinking. In contrast to peroxide crosslinking, the process is {{carried out in the}} solid state. Thereby, the cross-linking takes place primarily in the amorphous regions, while the crystallinity remains largely intact.|$|E
2500|$|Livingston was the {{chairman}} of the Accelerator Project at Brookhaven National Laboratory, director of the Cambridge <b>Electron</b> <b>Accelerator,</b> a member of the National Academy of Sciences, [...] a professor of physics at MIT, and a recipient of the Enrico Fermi Award from the United States Department of Energy.

2500|$|Livingston {{was unable}} to stay at Brookhaven to see the Cosmotron project {{completed}} because he faced losing his tenure at MIT, and elected to return there in 1948. At MIT he taught classes, and participated in a 1950 experiment by the Los Alamos National Laboratory to investigate the lifetimes of short-lived fission products. He still thought about accelerators, though, and in 1952, along with Ernest Courant, Hartland Snyder and J. Blewett at Brookhaven, developed strong focusing, [...] the principle that the net effect on a particle beam of charged particles passing through alternating field gradients {{is to make the}} beam converge. [...] The advantages of strong focusing were then quickly realised, and deployed on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, which achieved 33 GeV in 1960. A plan to build a synchrotron at MIT and Harvard also came to fruition under Livingston's leadership, resulting in the Cambridge <b>Electron</b> <b>Accelerator</b> (CEA), which became operational in 1962. The CEA exploded on July 6, 1965, injuring eight people, one of them fatally.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: To {{gain insight}} into the current {{practice}} of quality control (QC) of medical <b>electron</b> <b>accelerators</b> and to reduce possible variations in test frequencies and test procedures. Materials and methods: An extensive questionnaire on QC procedures of medical <b>electron</b> <b>accelerators</b> was distributed and completed by all (21) radiotherapy institutions in The Netherlands. The questions were related to safety systems, mechanical parameters, beam profiles, beam energy, absolute dosimetry, wedge filters, the dose monitor system and radiation leakage. Results: The data of the questionnaire were compared with recommendations given in national and international reports on QC of <b>electron</b> <b>accelerators.</b> Large variations in time spent on QC exist, especially for accelerators having dual energy photon beams and several electron beam energies. This diversity is mainly {{due to differences in}} philosophy with regard to QC and the differences in resources and machine time available. Furthermore, large variations in test frequencies and test methodologies were observed. The staffing level involved in the QC measurements was evaluated and compared with recent recommendations provided by EFOMP-ESTRO. Conclusions: From these recommendations and the results of the questionnaire, a set of minimum guidelines for a QC programme could be formulated and implemented in all radiotherapy institutions in The Netherlands...|$|R
