5|$|In September 1972, 5,667 {{students}} {{entered the}} new state university, the largest opening day enrollment at the time. Previously, Miami had been the largest {{city in the country}} lacking a public baccalaureate-granting institution. Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> Junior College (now Miami-Dade College). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the University of Miami and <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school. It would be 9 years before lower-division classes were added.|$|E
5|$|On January 18, 1977, the <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> Commission {{approved}} {{a law that}} would outlaw {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public services. Commissioner Ruth Shack proposed the bill on December 7, 1976 at the request of a gay lobbying organization, named the <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays, that was less than a year old. The group was headed by three gay activists: Jack Campbell, an owner of 40gay bathhouses across the United States, political and gay activist Bob Basker, and Bob Kunst, a local publicist and enthusiast of the Human Potential Movement.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> vote, Fort Lauderdale, Gainesville, and Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas, all {{rejected}} ordinances to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development overturned its own rules they had set {{earlier in the year}} to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing. Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15years had been fired. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the very liberal Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights ordinances.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Florida, {{damage was}} mostly limited to moderate wind gusts; in Miami-Dade County, gusty winds knocked out several traffic lights along U.S. 1, the only route {{to and from}} the Florida Keys.

5|$|The storm struck Florida in {{the midst}} of 1992 presidential {{election}} campaign. A poll conducted by CBS News in September showed that 65% of <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> residents approved of Bush's handling of the disaster, while 61% of residents approved statewide. Despite the support of Bush's response and his proposal to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, he benefited little politically and trailed 48%â€“42% against Bill Clinton in another poll taken in September. Additionally, 75% of voters in <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> and 82% of Floridians overall stated that the president's actions in response to Andrew would not impact their vote in November. Bush went on to carry the state of Florida, but by a margin of only 1.89%. The hurricane also impacted Governor Chiles politically. The state's response to the storm was perceived as poor, sinking Chiles' approval rating to 22%, while his disapproval rating rose to 76%. However, Chiles was able to recover prior to the 1994 gubernatorial election.|$|E
5|$|Until 1939 {{the only}} {{access to the}} area (and much of <b>Dade</b> <b>County,</b> Georgia) was through Tennessee or Alabama.

The Civilian Conservation Corps did much of the early work to construct the state park and access roads.|$|E
5|$|As modern {{communities}} continued {{growing in}} and around Miami, developers looked to southern <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> for new projects. The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. Beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted {{the construction of a}} causeway to the mainland. One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the Overseas Highway at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north. At the same time, pressure built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida. This led to competing priorities between those who wished to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development. On December 6, 1960, 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of Islandia on Elliott Key. The town was incorporated to encourage <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> to improve access to Elliott Key in particular, which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach. The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers.|$|E

50|$|The Miami accent {{developed}} amongst second- or third-generation Miamians, particularly {{young adults}} whose first language was English, but were bilingual. Since World War II, Miami's population has grown rapidly every decade, {{due in part}} to the post-war baby boom. In 1950, the US Census stated that <b>Dade</b> <b>County's</b> population was 495,084. Beginning with rapid international immigration and the Cuban exodus of the late 1950s, Miami's population has drastically grown every decade since then. Many of these immigrants began to inhabit the urban industrial area around Downtown Miami. By 1970, the US Census stated that <b>Dade</b> <b>County's</b> population was 1,267,792. By 2000, the population reached 2,253,362. Growing up in Miami's urban center, second-, third-, and fourth-generation Miamians of the immigration wave of the 1960s and 1970s, developed the Miami accent. It is now the customary dialect of many citizens in the Miami metropolitan area.|$|R
5|$|Deprived of a {{rationale}} for existence by the national monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> state attorney's office, headed by Janet Reno. In 1990 Reno's office determined after investigation {{that all of the}} town's elections were invalid, since the elections were restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|Jim Foster, {{then the}} most {{powerful}} political organizer in San Francisco, went to Miami to assist gay activists there as election day neared, and a nationwide boycott of orange juice was organized.

5|$|In 1947, a {{delegation}} from <b>Dade</b> <b>County</b> prompted the Florida State Legislature {{to support the}} development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the State Board of Conservation, which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time. The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in St. Petersburg. In 1953, the School's classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed the Institute of Marine Science in 1961, it became part of the University of Miami's School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences.|$|E
5|$|After Antietam, Ewing {{was placed}} on sick leave because of chronic dysentery, and was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General on November 29, 1862. He transferred West and served throughout the campaign before Vicksburg, leading the assaults made by General Sherman; and upon its fall was placed in command of a division in the XVI Corps. At Chattanooga, he was given command of the 4th Division of the XV Corps, which formed the advance of Sherman's army and carried Missionary Ridge. Prior to the Battle of Chattanooga, Ewing's command led a diversionary raid {{that resulted in the}} destruction of the Empire State Iron Works in <b>Dade</b> <b>County,</b> Georgia, which was being refurbished to increase the South's manufacturing capability. Sherman considered Ewing his most reliable division commander.|$|E
50|$|Nine months later, when singer Anita Bryant began {{a crusade}} to repeal <b>Dade</b> <b>County's</b> {{ordinance}} banning discrimination against homosexuals, Rogers responded by announcing {{on the air}} that he was homosexual on December 17, 1976. Although Bryant's campaign to repeal the ordinance was successful, Rogers' admission did nothing to hurt his radio career; indeed, his ratings steadily increased with every Arbitron period. Richard Casper hired Rogers away from WKAT in March 1978 to work at WNWS beginning in April 1978.|$|R

A state court overturned the ban [...] in 2010, in In re Gill.|$|R
