5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|The LAP flap is a flap {{from the}} dorsal lumbar area {{extending}} to the lateral {{edge of the}} rectus abdominis muscle which consists of fat, skin and one paravertebral perforator from the lumbar vessels. The lumbar vessels travel through the <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> muscles or between the <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> muscle and quadratus lumborum muscle. Preoperatively, the perforators are located using a hand held doppler. The vessels are cut {{at the beginning of}} the vasa lumbales.|$|E
25|$|The {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{accounts for}} 80–90% of scoliosis cases. Its pathogenesis is unknown. However, {{changes in the}} vestibular system, a lateral shift of the hand representation and abnormal variability of <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> motor map location in the motor cortex {{may be involved in}} this disease. Besides, idiopathic scoliosis being more frequent in certain families, it is suspected to be transmitted via autosomal dominant inheritance. Estrogens could also play a crucial part in the progression of idiopathic scoliosis through their roles in bone formation, growth, maturation and turnover. Finally, collagen, intervertebral disc and muscle abnormalities have been suggested as the cause in idiopathic scoliosis, although these are perhaps results rather than causes.|$|E
25|$|A golf stroke uses muscles on core (especially <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> {{muscles and}} latissimus dorsi muscle when turning), hamstring, shoulder, and wrist. Stronger muscles on wrist can prevent wrists from being twisted at swings, while {{stronger}} shoulders increase the turning force. Weak wrists can also deliver the impacts to elbows and even neck {{and lead to}} injury of them. (When a muscle contracts, it pulls equally from both ends and, to have movement at only {{one end of the}} muscle, other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which {{the other end of the}} muscle is attached.) Golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles.|$|E

2500|$|Scoliotic adolescents, at {{the apex}} vertebra, have a higher muscle {{activity}} (as measured by surface electromyography) on the convex side than on the concave side in sitting or standing conditions. Because in scoliotic people wearing a brace, the muscle activity of the <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> muscles decreased on the convex side when walking with the brace [...] and because after spinal arthrodesis surgery, idiopathic scoliotic people showed {{a significant decrease in}} paravertebral muscle activity on the convex side but not on the concave side, the muscular asymmetry in idiopathic scoliosis is thought to be a biomechanical consequence of the scoliotic curvature rather than its cause.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{longitudinal}} osteofibrous canal {{on either side}} of the spine there is a group of muscles called the <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> which is subdivided into a lateral superficial and a medial deep tract. [...] In the lateral tract, the iliocostalis lumborum and longissimus thoracis originates on the back of the sacrum and the posterior part of the iliac crest. Contracting these muscles bilaterally extends the spine and unilaterally contraction bends the spine to the same side. [...] The medial tract has a [...] "straight" [...] (interspinales, intertransversarii, and spinalis) and an [...] "oblique" [...] (multifidus and semispinalis) component, both of which stretch between vertebral processes; the former acts similar to the muscles of the lateral tract, while the latter function unilaterally as spine extensors and bilaterally as spine rotators. In the medial tract, the multifidi originates on the sacrum.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{links between}} human spinal morphology, bipedality, and {{scoliosis}} which suggest an evolutionary {{basis for the}} condition. Scoliosis has not been found in chimpanzees or gorillas. Thus, it has been hypothesized that scoliosis may actually be related to humans’ morphological differences from these apes. Other apes have a shorter and less mobile lower spine than humans. Some of the lumbar vertebrae in Pan are [...] "captured", meaning that they are held fast between the ilium bones of the pelvis. Compared to humans, Old World monkeys have far larger <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> muscles, which are the muscles which hold the spine steady. These factors make the lumbar spine of most primates less flexible and {{far less likely to}} deviate than those of humans. While this may explicitly relate only to lumbar scolioses, it is possible that small imbalances in the lumbar spine could precipitate thoracic problems as well.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> ( [...] ) or spinal {{erectors}} {{is a set}} {{of muscles}} that straighten and rotate the back.|$|E
50|$|The <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> is {{not just}} one muscle, but a bundle of muscles and tendons. It is paired and runs more or less vertically. It extends {{throughout}} the lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions, and lies in the groove {{to the side of}} the vertebral column. The <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> is covered in the lumbar and thoracic regions by the thoracolumbar fascia, and in the cervical region by the nuchal ligament.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscles of}} the trunk {{stabilize}} the body before, during, and after impact with the ball during the kick (Major muscles involved; rectus abdominis, psoas major, and <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> muscles). The spider Crawl is a dynamic compound exercise that works mainly the core muscles such as rectus abdominis, <b>erector</b> <b>spinae,</b> and external obliques {{as well as the}} pectoralis major, anterior deltoids, and triceps. The spider crawl exercise aids in improving coordination by contra-laterally activating and coordinating the upper body with the lower body muscles. Moreover, crunches help to strengthen the rectus abdominis muscle and variations of planks engage the <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> and deeper back extensor muscles that aid in improving balance and posture. The superman exercise strengthens the lower back and improves flexibility in the lumbar region.|$|E
5000|$|The middle {{back support}} muscles (<b>erector</b> <b>spinae,</b> rhomboids, middle and lower {{trapezius}} fibres, etc.) become stretched out and weak.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{to muscle}} {{activity}} are also observed with high heeled shoes, mostly affecting the tibialis anterior and <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> muscles. The increase in plantar flexion {{of the foot}} causes the EMG amplitude of tibialis anterior to increase. The high heels also lead to {{a decrease in the}} lumbar flexion angle due to a compensatory mechanism to prevent one from falling forward. This arching of the back causes the <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> to increase its activity.|$|E
50|$|The LAP flap is a flap {{from the}} dorsal lumbar area {{extending}} to the lateral {{edge of the}} rectus abdominis muscle which consists of fat, skin and one paravertebral perforator from the lumbar vessels.

Preoperatively, the perforators are located using a hand held doppler. The vessels are cut {{at the beginning of}} the vasa lumbales.|$|E
50|$|The good-morning is a weight-lifting exercise. It {{is known}} as a good morning because of the {{movement}} in the <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> which resembles the rise out of bed to stretch. The <b>erector</b> <b>spinae</b> muscles of the lower back work isometrically to keep the spine in an extended position while the hamstrings and gluteus maximus work isotonically to perform hip extension. Other muscles are involved in stabilizing weight on the back and maintaining balance.|$|E
