2500|$|In June 2013, Marvel {{announced}} The Fearless Defenders #10 (October 2013) would {{tie into}} the Infinity crossover event. Bunn said, [...] "The main Infinity crossover {{will be in}} Fearless Defenders #10. They're here on Earth facing the threat of Thanos’ forces trying to raze the city of New York... At the same time though, {{not only are they}} going to be dealing with Thanos’ forces, they're going to be dealing with the ever-present Caroline Le Fay who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to no good during this event and it's all going to center around this new character who'll be surfacing in the issue, a new super-powered individual." [...] Bunn also revealed that The Fearless Defenders #10 will be a dance issue explaining, [...] "I’m not sure how many dance comic books are out there anyway, but definitely not dance super hero comics. I’ve tried to do different things with the book from the beginning and this issue will definitely live up to that ideal." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Harriet, [...] "I haven't, but I {{know the}} {{symptoms}} {{and you certainly}} haven't got one of them. Whenever Harold isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> for dinner or for the evening you're always relieved. Possibly you don't realize it yourself, but you show it to any one who knows you." ...|$|E

She {{sits on the}} arm of his chair, so openly to wheedle {{him that}} it is not worth his while to smile. Her voice is tremulous; she is a woman who can conceal nothing. 'You will be nice to him--to-night--won't you, John?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound it!" [...] Hawtry exclaimed furiously, as he {{regained his}} feet, to the Spaniard. [...] "Why didn't {{you say what}} you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to? Starting the ship ahead at full speed without notice! I believe I've broken some of my ribs. Don't you laugh too soon, Jack. It will be your turn next." ...|$|E
6000|$|That night, Nigel gave {{a dinner}} party on Maggie's account at the fashionable London hotel of the moment. Invitations had been sent out by telephone, by hurried notes, {{in one or two}} cases were {{delivered}} by word of mouth. On the whole, the acceptances, considering the season was in full swing, were a little remarkable. Every one was anxious to come, because, as one of her girl friends put it, no one ever knew what Maggie was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to next. One of the few refusals came from Prince Shan, and even he made use of compromise: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> snowed <b>up</b> here {{we ought}} to try for some game," [...] said Chet. [...] "Maybe I can stir up some rabbits, or something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a regular}} {{windfall}} {{for us that}} the old schoolhouse <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shut <b>up</b> next Wednesday," [...] said Snap. [...] "Just think of two months of loafing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; not by me. You {{and young}} Grundle {{together}} {{are in a}} conspiracy {{to get rid of}} me. I <b>am</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shut <b>up</b> a whole year before my time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, please stop, Mr. Haverley," [...] {{interrupted}} Dora. [...] "I am {{so glad to}} {{have her}} act so freely and unconventionally with me, {{as if we had}} always been friends. It makes me feel almost as if we had known each other always, and it does not make the slightest difference to me. Miriam wanted to give me another room, but I implored her to let me sleep with her in that splendid high-posted bedstead, and so all that I {{have to do is to}} slip up to her room, and, if I can possibly help it, I shall not waken her. In the morning I do not believe she will remember a thing about having gone to bed without me. So good-night, Mr. Haverley. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> very early, and you shall see what a breakfast the new cook will give you. I will light this candle, for no doubt poor Miriam has put out her lamp, if she did not depend entirely on the moonlight. By the way, Mr. Haverley," [...] she said, turning toward him, [...] "is there anything I can do to help you in shutting up the house? You know I am maid of all work as well as cook. Perhaps I should go down and see if the kitchen fire is safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next six}} weeks went on tranquilly at Merle Park {{without a word}} spoken about Hamel. Sir Thomas, {{who was in the}} country as little as possible, showed his scorn to his {{son-in-law}} simply by the paucity of his words, speaking to him, when he did speak to him, with a deliberate courtesy which Mr. Traffick perfectly understood. It was that dangerous serenity which so often presages a storm. [...] "There is something <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> with your father," [...] he said to Augusta. Augusta replied that she had never seen her father so civil before. [...] "It would be a great convenience," [...] continued the Member of Parliament, [...] "if he could be made to hold his tongue till Parliament meets; but I'm afraid that's too good to expect." [...] In other respects things were comfortable at Merle Park, though they were not always comfortable up in London. Tom, as the reader knows, was misbehaving himself sadly at the Mountaineers. This was the period of unlimited champagne, and of almost total absence from Lombard Street. It was seldom that Sir Thomas could get hold of his son, and when he did that broken-hearted youth would reply to his expostulations simply by asserting that if his father would induce Ayala to marry him everything should go straight in Lombard Street. Then came the final blow. Tom was of course expected at Merle Park on Christmas Eve, but did not make his appearance either then or on Christmas Day. Christmas fell on a Wednesday, and it was intended that the family should remain in the country till the following Monday. On the Thursday Sir Thomas went up to town to make inquiries respecting his heir, as to whom Lady Tringle had then become absolutely unhappy. In London he heard the disastrous truth. Tom, in his sportive mood, had caused serious inconvenience to a most respectable policeman, and was destined to remain another week {{in the hands of the}} Philistines. Then, for a time, all the other Tringle troubles were buried and forgotten in this great trouble respecting Tom. Lady Tringle was unable to leave her room during the period of incarceration. Mr. Traffick promised to have the victim liberated by the direct interference of the Secretary of State, but failed to get anything of the kind accomplished. The girls were completely cowed by the enormity of the misfortune; so that Tom's name was hardly mentioned except in sad and confidential whispers. But of all the sufferers Sir Thomas suffered the most. To him it was a positive disgrace, weighing down every moment of his life. At Travers and Treason he could not hold up his head boldly and open his mouth loudly as had always been his wont. At Travers and Treason there was not a clerk who did not know that [...] "the governor" [...] was an altered man since this misfortune had happened to the hope of the firm. What passed between Sir Thomas and his son on the occasion has already been told in a previous chapter. That Sir Thomas, on the whole, behaved with indulgence must be acknowledged; but he felt that his son must in truth absent himself from Lombard Street for a time.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was adamant}} that Pratt saved Carlton {{when he became}} club {{president}} during 2007:He didnt only save Carlton with his money. I dont think money {{had much to do}} with it. ... The club was losing its soul there for a long time. He got it back on track. Now its <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to the people at Carlton now to keep it going.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> full <b>up,</b> but I'll put down your name and {{you can come back}} in the morning," [...] he remarked. [...] "What do you call yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why do {{you talk}} to me about scruples? I wanted money, and I gave powder in exchange. How could I know that some of your wretched men <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blown <b>up?</b> Scruples! Pah!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{show you}} our house, Eda, {{and to ask}} you to fix on the corner you like best for your own room. The {{partitions}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put <b>up,</b> so we must fix at once." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many opponents {{attempted}} to make religious or moral arguments against the ordinance saying that it would erode the city's moral fabric and that they didn't. {{want their children to}} be exposed to values they didn't agree with. The Reverend William Dulin told the commission that [...] "unless we have the moral courage to stand against the evils that underlie (the amendment), this city is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> against something that (it) will not like." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of {{same-sex}} marriage, {{pointing out that}} marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: [...] "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim {{to love each other}} and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage." ...|$|E
5000|$|In April 2008, Republican {{presidential nominee}} John McCain {{predicted}} that the 2008 presidential election would not follow the red state/blue state pattern, saying, [...] "I'm {{not sure that the}} old red state, blue state scenario that prevailed for the last several elections works. I think most of these states that we have either red or blue are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> for grabs." [...] This eventually proved to be true, although not in McCain's favor, as Barack Obama took many [...] "red" [...] states that had not voted Democratic in many years, including Virginia, North Carolina, and Indiana and almost Missouri, losing it by a 0.2% margin.|$|E
6000|$|... "But Bee," [...] said Fred, [...] "you don't {{mean that}} you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shut <b>up</b> with that horrid Lady Susan all this time? Why don't you stay here, and let her take care of herself?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I say so, {{whatever}} I think. And I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> caught <b>up</b> on the tenter-hooks {{of conscience}} as {{to all my}} meanings, Miss Cotton. I don't know them all. But I'm {{not one of the}} Aliceolaters, you know." ...|$|R
5000|$|Senior vice {{president}} of competition Scott Miller explained that the new rule was meant to improve safety, explaining that [...] "It's more about crashed vehicles and all that is involved with that, from the crew guys to the drivers to dropping more debris on the track, which always happens. So there are exceptions for mechanical failures, those things can be rectified in the garage. That's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to the series director's discretion to make those calls, but it's {{not going to be}} that difficult. These rules severely restrict the ability for cars to return to the race multiple laps down in hopes of gaining minimal points.|$|E
5000|$|Appearing on the BBC's Question Time on 5 July 2012, Lydon {{questioned}} {{the notion of}} a parliamentary inquiry into the banking industry, saying [...] "How on earth is Parliament going to discuss this really when both sides, left and right, are connected to this? This doesn't just go back to Brown, {{this is part of the}} ongoing problem. Mr Diamond comes from Wall Street...hello. Both parties love this idea. They are fiddling with rates. They are affecting the world and everything we used to count on as being dependable and accurate is being discussed by these argumentative chaps. If I nick a motor I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> before the judge, the rozzers. Hello, same thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Christie focused {{much of his}} campaign's {{effort in}} winning the New Hampshire Republican primary, for which a former Governor's Office staff member and {{political}} operative began working in winter 2014. [...] On January 4, 2016 at his campaign headquarters in New Hampshire Christie said [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> here until Wednesday night. We'll take a short break, go back home, deliver the State of the State address the week after next in New Jersey, {{and then come back}} out on the road again". Christie campaigned extensively using a town meeting format, but in polls before the primary slipped and he fell behind. He spent 70 days in the state. In the New Hampshire debate he attacked candidate Marco Rubio. He placed sixth in a field of nine in the New Hampshire primary on February 9.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll eat my breakfast afore they're {{the death}} of me," [...] said he. [...] "I'd do that, if I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strung <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that there gallows as there is over there, {{directly}} afterwards.

6000|$|... "This seems all right," [...] he admitted, glancing around. [...] "Well, {{one part}} of the great work is finished. I have lived for eleven days not quite sure when I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stood <b>up</b> with my back to the light at the Tower. Now it's over." ...|$|R

5000|$|The USO {{also brought}} Hollywood celebrities and {{volunteer}} entertainers {{to perform for}} the troops. According to movie historian Steven Cohan, [...] "most of all ... in taking home on the road, it equated the nation with showbiz. USO camp shows were designed in their export to remind soldiers of home." [...] They did this, he noted, by [...] "nurturing in troops a sense of patriotic identification with America through popular entertainment." [...] An article in Look magazine at the time, stated, [...] "For the little time the show lasts, the men are taken straight to the familiar Main Street that {{is the goal of}} every fighting American far away from home." [...] Maxene Andrews wrote, [...] "The entertainment brought home to the boys. Their home." [...] Actor George Raft stated {{at the beginning of the}} war, [...] "Now it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to us to send to the men here and abroad real, living entertainment, the songs, the dances, and the laughs they had back home." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cliff {{was only}} 21 {{when he wrote}} and {{recorded}} the song in 1969, stating he wrote the song due to the trouble he was having making it as a successful musical artist after originally finding tremendous success in his home of Jamaica beginning at age 14 {{before moving to the}} United Kingdom. Cliff stated, [...] "When I came to the UK, I was still in my teens. I came full of vigor: I’m going to make it, I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> there with the Beatles and the Stones. And it wasn’t really going like that, I was touring clubs, not breaking through. I was struggling, with work, life, my identity, I couldn’t find my place; frustration fueled the song." [...] Regarding the line, [...] "Wandering I am lost, as I travel along the White Cliffs of Dover," [...] Cliff stated, [...] "...that came from the number of times I crossed the channel to the continent. Most of the time it was France but sometimes it was Germany. It was a very frustrating time. I came to England with very big hopes and I saw my hopes fading. And that song came out of that experience." ...|$|E
