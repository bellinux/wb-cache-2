The choice of a first line anti-inflammatory drug, between <b>inhaled</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> and non-steroidal drugs (cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium), has to be made considering their risk–benefit ratio.

At the end of the study there were no statistically significant differences in the mean daily symptom score or the percentage of symptom-free days between the two groups. The mean daily dose of <b>inhaled</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> was similar in the two groups at the start of the study but the algorithms used to adjust the dose of <b>inhaled</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> resulted in an increased use of <b>inhaled</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> in both groups.
