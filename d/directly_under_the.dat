5|$|Damage {{may occur}} <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> site of impact, {{or it may}} occur on the side {{opposite}} the impact (coup and contrecoup injury, respectively). When a moving object impacts the stationary head, coup injuries are typical, while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when the moving head strikes a stationary object.|$|E
5|$|Lugal: {{while in}} Mesopotamia a lugal {{designated}} a king, in Ebla it designated a governor who was <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{authority of the}} capital. The nature of this title as part of Eblaite bureaucracy is ambiguous; each lugal was {{under the authority of}} the grand vizier, and the bearers ruled cities <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> authority of the capital and they all brought goods to be kept in Ebla's storehouses. Pettinato counted 14 different lugals in the Eblaite administrative texts and deduced that the kingdom was divided into fourteen departments; two of them in the capital itself and the remaining twelve spanned the rest of the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|After {{menstruation}} and <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes {{a series of}} changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open {{in response to the}} higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

G-spot amplification is performed by attempting to locate the G-spot and noting measurements for future reference.

The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved {{and the only}} well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E

The antechamber is oriented on the east–west axis and leads west to the king's burial chamber. The burial chamber has the same height and width as the antechamber, but is longer. At the western end of the burial chamber Perring discovered some fragments of an empty and undercorated black basalt sarcophagus which had been originally placed in a slight depression as well as a canopic chest. The chambers are protected from the pyramid weight by a gabled ceiling made of two large Tura limestone blocks, an architecture common to all pyramids of the 5th and 6th dynasties. The chambers are lined with the same material, while the floor pavement was lost to stone robbers.|$|E

5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely {{resented the}} treatment {{they received from}} the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts between local worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups were more active, and were more <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> eye of local law enforcement and the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of Eric Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|On the 42nd Street {{side of the}} Chrysler Building, a {{staircase}} from the street leads <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> building to the New York City Subway station at Grand Central–42nd Street.

The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause crowding, but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway. Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance. Work on the new entrance started in March 1930 and it opened along with the Chrysler Building two months later.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros, made short {{work of the}} unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs {{managed to}} get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before {{dropping}} their torpedoes—close {{enough to be able}} to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed to explode. Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never questioned why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results. The abysmal performance of American torpedoes in the early months of the war became a scandal. Torpedo after torpedo either missed by running <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed to explode.|$|E

5|$|The major set {{of reforms}} that began {{under the rule}} of Isma'il Pasha {{continued}} under the British occupation. Muhammad Mahdi al-'Abbasi, sheikh al-Azhar, had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to the hiring practices of the university as well as to standardize the examinations taken by students. Further efforts to modernize the educational system were made under Hilmi's rule during the British occupation. The mosque's manuscripts were gathered into a centralized library, sanitation for students improved, and a regular system of exams instituted. From 1885, other colleges in Egypt were placed <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> administration of the al-Azhar Mosque.|$|E
