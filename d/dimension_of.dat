In this study, environmental {{sounds and}} neighboring environment were {{measured in the}} Nagasaki City and were analyzed a fractal. Fractal dimensions for environmental sounds were calculated by the power spectrum. Fractal <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the forms were calculated by Box-counting method. Fractal <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the colors were calculated by a fractional Brown function. Fractal dimensions for soils were calculated by the Van Genuchten curve. As the result, fractal <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> environmental sounds generated artificially were bigger than fractal <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> environmental sounds generated naturally. There were correlations among fractal <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> environmental sounds, temperatures, and humidity.

We then empirically explore whether these dimensions receive different weights when explaining the location of FDI depending on its origin by comparing the outward FDI of China and Spain using partial least squares-based structural equations modelling (SEM-PLS). We find that although country distance significantly explains the FDI of both countries, the weights <b>of</b> the three <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> distance depend on the home country context. More specifically, we find that all three <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> distance explain the direction of Spanish investments, whereas only cultural and historical distance significantly explains Chinese outward FDI.
