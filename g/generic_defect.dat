5000|$|Margaret Archer {{argues that}} much social theory {{suffers from the}} <b>generic</b> <b>defect</b> of {{conflation}} where, due to a reluctance or inability to theorize emergent relationships between social phenomena, causal autonomy is denied {{to one side of}} the relation. This can take the form of autonomy being denied to agency with causal efficacy only granted to structure (downwards conflation). Alternatively it can take the form of autonomy being denied to structure with causal efficacy only granted to agency (upwards conflation). Finally it may take the form of central conflation where structure and agency are seen as being co-constitutive i.e. structure is reproduced through agency which is simultaneously constrained and enabled by structure. The most prominent example of central conflation is the structuration theory of Anthony Giddens. While not objecting to this approach on philosophical grounds, Archer does object to it on analytical grounds: by conflating structure and agency into unspecified movements of co-constitution, central conflationary approaches preclude the possibility of sociological exploration of the relative influence of each aspect.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Laplacian Abelian gauge on the sphere S 4 {{in the background}} of a single ‘t Hooft instanton. To this end we solve the eigenvalue problem of the covariant Laplace operator in the adjoint representation. The ground state wave function serves as an auxiliary Higgs field. We find that the ground state is always degenerate and has nodes. Upon diagonalisation, these zeros induce toplogical defects in the gauge potentials. The nature of the defects crucially depends on the order of the zeros. For first-order zeros one obtains magnetic monopoles. The <b>generic</b> <b>defects,</b> however, arise from zeros of second order and are pointlike. Their topological invariant is the Hopf index S 3 → S 2.

40|$|Chiral and helical domain {{walls are}} <b>generic</b> <b>defects</b> of topological spin-triplet superconductors. We study {{theoretically}} the magnetic and transport properties of superconducting singlet-triplet-singlet heterostructure {{as a function}} of the phase difference between the singlet leads in the presence of chiral and helical domains inside the spin-triplet region. The local inversion symmetry breaking at the singlet-triplet interface allows the emergence of a static phase-controlled magnetization and generally yields both spin and charge currents flowing along the edges. The parity of the domain wall number affects the relative orientation of the interface moments and currents, while in some cases the domain walls themselves contribute to spin and charge transport. We demonstrate that singlet-triplet heterostructures are a generic prototype to generate and control nondissipative spin and charge effects, putting them in a broader class of systems exhibiting spin-Hall, anomalous Hall effects and similar phenomena. Features of the electron transport and magnetic effects at the interfaces can be employed to assess the presence of domains in chiral/helical superconductors...|$|R

It is not necessary for this shift to be "out of phase". We also show which factors {{are responsible for the}} absence of secondary oscillations found for cosmic strings.

40|$|Computer {{modeling}} of the 32 -GHz traveling-wave tube (TWT) for the Cassini Mission {{was conducted to}} explain the anomaly observed in the spectrum analysis {{of one of the}} flight-model tubes. The analysis indicated that the effect, manifested as a weak signal in the neighborhood of 35 GHz, was an intermodulation product of the 32 -GHz drive signal with a 66. 9 -GHz oscillation induced by coupling to the second harmonic'signal. The oscillation occurred only at low- radiofrequency (RF) drive power levels that are not expected during the Cassini Mission. The conclusion was that the anomaly was caused by a <b>generic</b> <b>defect</b> inadvertently incorporated in the geometric design of the slow-wave circuit and that it would not change as the TWT aged. The most probable effect of aging on tube performance would be a reduction in the electron beam current.

40|$|Objective: Systematic {{software}} defect documentation {{is an essential}} part of software development process models as a means of early identification of patterns in defect inflow. Such documentation, however, may often be a tedious task requiring analysis work in addition to what is necessary to resolve the issue. Furthermore, <b>generic</b> <b>defect</b> documentation approaches often have a strong focus on source-code aspects making them unsuitable for development contexts with supplier-side implementation. To increase documentation efficiency in a development context with limited access to source-code, adapted schemes are needed. In this paper a light-weight defect classification scheme adapted to automotive software development is presented. Method: A case study was conducted at Volvo Car Corporation to adapt the IEEE Std. 1044 for the development of embedded automotive safety features. Results: The results consist of a detailed description of a defect classification scheme that complies with the IEEE Std. 1044. The main adaptations to the scheme consisted of raising the level of abstraction of the captured data items, shifting the focus from source-code to other artefacts and activities, and by conforming to the terminology of the company. Conclusions: We conclude that the IEEE Std. 1044 can be successfully adapted to a development context where source-code is not the main development artefact. Furthermore, initial evaluation showed that the adapted classification scheme captures what is currently tacit knowledge and has the potential of revealing patterns in the defects detected in different project phases. As a result we are currently in the process of incorporating the classification scheme into the company’s defect reporting system...|$|E

The underlying mechanism of this IgA 1 O-glycosylation abnormality is poorly understood, but recent evidence argues against a <b>generic</b> <b>defect</b> in B cell glycosyltransferases, suggesting {{that only a}} subpopulation of IgA 1 -committed B cells are affected. For investigation of whether the site of antigen encounter influences IgA 1 O-glycosylation, the O-glycosylation of serum IgA 1 antibodies against a systemic antigen, tetanus toxoid (TT), and a mucosal antigen, Helicobacter pylori (HP), was studied in patients with IgAN and control subjects. Serum IgA 1 was purified from cohorts of patients with IgAN and control subjects with HP infection and after systemic TT immunization. The IgA 1 samples were applied to HP- and TT-coated immunoplates to immobilize specific antibodies, and IgA 1 O-glycosylation profiles were assessed by binding of the O-glycan–specific lectin Vicia villosa using a modified ELISA technique. Although total serum IgA 1 had raised lectin binding in IgAN, the O-glycosylation of the specific IgA 1 antibodies to TT and HP did not differ between patients and control subjects. In both groups, IgA 1 anti-HP had higher lectin binding than IgA 1 anti-TT. This study demonstrates that IgA 1 O-glycosylation normally varies in different immune responses and that patients produce {{the full spectrum of}} IgA 1 O-glycoforms. IgA 1 with high lectin binding was produced in response to mucosal HP infection in all subjects. The raised circulating level of this type of IgA 1 in IgAN {{is likely to be a}} consequence of abnormal systemic responses to mucosally encountered antigens rather than a fundamental defect in B cell O-glycosylation pathways...|$|E

If the singlet and triplet components of the superconducting order parameter are of comparable magnitude, the superconducting state breaks spontaneously the bulk time-reversal symmetry locally near the twin boundary. By self-consistently evaluating the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations and the gap functions we find two distinct phases: First, time-reversal symmetry breaking enhances the spin currents but does not lead to chiral supercurrents.

40|$|While {{numerous}} studies have strived to identify <b>generic</b> <b>defect</b> causes, analysis of the complex mechanisms acting among these causes, in which the most influential patterns are identified, is lacking. To address this deficiency, this research aims to develop the analytical understanding of the complex mechanisms of defect generation so as to identify and quantify defects most influential root causes, and accordingly develop effective defect prevention strategies. In order to trace these mechanisms this thesis initially presents a classification protocol that categorizes the defective acts (i. e., errors and violations) that are directly linked to the occurrence of a defect. Knowing these direct causes provides a platform for thoroughly tracking construction defects to their root causes. Following this basis, the thesis develops a methodology that utilizes Fault Trees and risk Importance Measures (IMs) to identify the high frequency (i. e., most common) and the high magnitude (i. e., most likely to cause defects) root causes. The thesis further develops a complementary methodology that utilizes Social Network Analysis (SNA) to formulate the interrelationships between these root causes, and identify the high pathogenicity (i. e., most likely to case defects through intermediaries) causes based on their position within the network of sequential events leading to defects. Both methodologies were tested on four residential projects in Dubai, which confirmed their applicability as effective tools for their intended purposes. Thence, perceptions of 106 industry professionals on a questionnaire survey were collected and analyzed using the aforementioned methods to demonstrate the methods applicability upon larger datasets, while identifying the most influential root causes in terms of frequency, magnitude and pathogenicity. The mechanics and sequence of events associated with these causes are discussed and graphically visualized using SNA. From this, practical defect management recommendations are provided. The identified causal patterns were further validated using a different methodological approach; namely, Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN). This validation procedure highlighted {{the benefit of the}} joint utility of SNA and BBN. In essence, this thesis contributes to knowledge in the area of construction engineering and management by proposing methodological approaches that is targeted to providing both mathematical and visualization analyses needed to better understand the complex mechanisms of defect generation...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis reinforces the notion of how powerful evolutionary search methodologies, specifically those inspired by the genetic algorithm (GA), are when applied to search out the chemical and/or configurational spaces {{of a number of}} chemical systems. Researchers in the field often sell the capability of GA search techniques to operate without constraints but, as is demonstrated in this thesis, sometimes the use of constraints can not only streamline computational costs but open up new avenues to explore in materials design. As a starting point, this work first focuses on developing effective methodologies that map out nitrogen's high-pressure potential energy surface (PES) such that polymeric nitrogen, a relatively new material with a potentially promising outlook in future high-energy density materials applications,&sup 1; could be explored. High pressure nitrogen (> 30 GPa) is an ideal candidate to explore theoretically since conclusive experimental characterizations are often beyond the reach of current laboratory technologies. &sup 2; Theoretical and experimental assessments of polymorphism in high-pressure nitrogen {{have been reported in the}} recent literature,&sup 3; and, upon the inception of this thesis, much of its potential energy surface remained unmapped. Using both established and novel search methodologies on nitrogen's high-pressure potential energy landscape, with GA-inspired methodologies included among them, a number of previously unreported allotropes of molecular and non-molecular nitrogen at high pressures are reported which relate well with experimental studies. The second focal point of this thesis is to present a general methodology capable of mapping <b>generic</b> <b>defect</b> associations in doped metal oxides. Doped metal oxides have many applications as substrates in catalysis, as gas sensors, and as next generation solid electrolytes in solid-oxide fuel cell technologies, just to name a few. The performance of these metal oxide materials can be enhanced (or, more generally, tuned) via doping of the parent oxide with other elements at varying concentrations; however, the optimization of the dopant composition is often performed by trial and error. By introducing appropriate constraints, GA-inspired routines can sample the configurational and chemical spaces of any defects introduced to a native oxide lattice. Thus, genetic algorithms are used herein in two capacities: 1) to find the lowest energy configurations of a specific metal oxide composition and 2) to search a doped metal oxide's chemical space in order to optimize a specific property of interest based on a given 'fitness' metric. This approach is validated by optimizing electronic mobility in doped zinc oxide, which is used in gas sensor technologies, and ionic mobility in Lanthanide doped ceria (LDC), which is used as a solid electrolyte in solid-oxide fuel cell technologies. &sup 1;M.

To obtain competitive edges, manufacturers are optimizing production processes from component manufacturing in job shops, product assembly on a mixed-model assembly lines, to coordination across multiple cells of a factory. Production scheduling {{is critical for}} on-time product delivery, high productivity and low inventory. Effective scheduling has been recognized to be extremely difficult because {{of all kinds of}} factors in different manufacturing levels, and the combinatorial nature of the problems. ^ In this study, scheduling algorithms are developed for the manufacturing from factory level to job shop level. The methods build on previous works on job shop scheduling and focus on the scheduling of factories with multiple cells, mixed-model assembly lines, and job shops with complicate process plan. The objectives are to meet customer demand in a timely fashion with low work-in-process and finished goods inventory. Because of the intrinsic difficulty for finding optimal schedules, near-optimal scheduling methodology will be developed by using the “Lagrangian relaxation” techniques. The critical factor for Lagrangian relaxation is to have “separable” problem formulations in that the objective function and “coupling constraints” should be additive in terms of basic decision variables. Additionally, fast convergence and short computation time are also the key for practical problems. In this study, several <b>generic</b> <b>defects</b> of LR leading to slow algorithm convergence are identified based on geometrical insights, and are overcome by perturbing/changing problem parameters.

If the domain walls are produced during an inflationary era, the network will soon freeze out in comoving coordinates retaining the imprints of the anisotropic regime, even though inflation makes the universe isotropic. Only at late times, when the typical size of the major axis of the domain walls becomes smaller than the Hubble radius, does the network evolve rapidly towards isotropy. Hence, we may hope to see imprints of the anisotropic era if by today the typical size of the major axis of the domain walls is of the order of the Hubble radius, or if the walls re-entered it only very recently. Depending on the mass scale of the domain walls, there is also the possibility that they re-enter at earlier times, but their evolution remains friction-dominated until recently, in which case the signatures of the anisotropic era will be much better preserved.

40|$|We {{present a}} model for typical charged defects in weakly doped Y 1 -xCaxVO 3 perovskites and study how they {{influence}} the magnetic and orbital order. Starting from a multiband Hubbard model, we show that the charge carriers introduced by doping are bound to the Ca defects with large binding energy of about 1 eV at small doping, and give rise to the in-gap absorption band observed in the optical spectroscopy. The central position of a <b>generic</b> Ca <b>defect</b> with eight equidistant vanadium neighbors implies a partly filled defect band and permits activated transport due to Coulomb disorder. We explore the effect of bound charge carriers on {{the dynamics of the}} (yz,zx) orbital and spin degrees of freedom {{in the context of a}} spin-orbital t-J model. After deriving the superexchange interactions around the doped hole, we show that the transition from G-type to C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) order is triggered by the kinetic energy of doped holes via the double-exchange mechanism. The defect states lead to local modification of orbital correlations within ferromagnetic chains along the c axis; some of them contain hole defects, while the charge-orbital coupling suppresses locally (yz,zx) orbital fluctuations in the others. Thereby, Ca defects provide a physical mechanism for spin-orbital dimerization along the ferromagnetic bonds, suggesting that, in the C-AF phase of weakly doped Y 1 -xCaxVO 3, dimerization increases with doping.

In the latter, at intermediate detuning the p-wave resonant interaction generically drives Bose-condensation at a finite momentum, set by a competition between atomic kinetic energy and atom-molecule hybridization.

The active flows generated by defects in the director lead {{to the formation of}} stable vortices, analogous to those seen in confined systems in flat geometries, which generate an effective dynamics for four + 1 / 2 defects that reproduces the tetrahedral to planar oscillations observed in experiments. As the activity is increased and the vortices become stronger, the defects are drawn more tightly into pairs, rotating about antipodal points. We extend this situation to also describe the dynamics of other configurations of defects. For example, two + 1 defects are found to attract or repel according to the local geometric character of the director field around them, while additional pairs of opposite charge defects can give rise to flow states containing more than two vortices.

Fumarate hydratase (FH) is an enzyme of the citrate cycle. Recessive defects in FH lead to infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies, while dominant mutations predispose to tumor formation. Defects in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), the enzyme that precedes FH in the citrate cycle, have also been described. Mutations in SDH subunits SDHB, SDHC and SDHD are associated with tumor predisposition, while mutations in SDHA lead to a characteristic mitochondrial encephalopathy of childhood. Thus, the citrate cycle, via FH and SDH, seems to have essential roles in mitochondrial function, {{as well as in the}} regulation of processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation or death. Tumor predisposition is not a typical feature of mitochondrial energy deficiency diseases. However, defects in citrate cycle enzymes also affect mitochondrial energy metabolism. It is therefore necessary to distinguish what is specific for defects in citrate cycle, and thus possibly associated with the tumor phenotype, from the <b>generic</b> consequences of <b>defects</b> in mitochondrial aerobic metabolism. We used primary fibroblasts from patients with recessive FH defects to study the cellular consequences of FH-deficiency (FH-). Similarly to the tumors observed in FH- patients, these fibroblasts have very low FH activity. The use of primary cells has the advantage that they are diploid, in contrast with the aneuploid tumor cells, thereby enabling the study of the early consequences of FH- in diploid background, before tumorigenesis and aneuploidy. To distinguish the specific consequences of FH- from typical consequences of defects in mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, we used primary fibroblasts from patients with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and from patients with NARP (neuropathy, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa). These diseases also affect mitochondrial aerobic metabolism but are not known to predispose to tumor formation. To study in vivo the systemic consequences of defects in mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, we used a transgenic mouse model of late-onset mitochondrial myopathy. The mouse contains a transgene with an in-frame duplication of a segment of Twinkle, the mitochondrial replicative helicase, whose defects underlie the human disease progressive external ophthalmoplegia. This mouse model replicates the phenotype in the patients, particularly neuronal degeneration, mitochondrial myopathy, and subtle decrease of respiratory chain activity associated with mtDNA deletions. Due to the accumulation of mtDNA deletions, the mouse was named deletor. We first studied the consequences of FH- and of respiratory chain defects for energy metabolism in primary fibroblasts. To further characterize the effects of FH- and respiratory chain malfunction in primary fibroblasts at transcriptional level, we used expression microarrays. In order to understand the in vivo consequences of respiratory chain defects in vivo, we also studied the transcriptional consequences of Twinkle defects in deletor mice skeletal muscle, cerebellum and hippocampus. Fumarate accumulated in the FH- homozygous cells, but not in the compound heterozygous lines. However, virtually all FH- lines lacked cytoplasmic FH. Induction of glycolysis was common to FH-, MELAS and NARP fibroblasts. In deletor muscle glycolysis seemed to be upregulated. This was in contrast with deletor cerebellum and hippocampus, where mitochondrial biogenesis was in progress. Despite sharing a glycolytic pattern in energy metabolism, FH- and respiratory chain defects led to opposite consequences in redox environment. FH- was associated with reduced redox environment, while MELAS and NARP displayed evidences of oxidative stress. The deletor cerebellum had transcriptional induction of antioxidant defenses, suggesting increased production of reactive oxygen species. Since the fibroblasts do not represent the tissues where the tumors appear in FH- patients, we compared the fibroblast array data with the data from FH- leiomyomas and normal myometrium. This allowed the determination of the pathways and networks affected by FH-deficiency in primary cells that are also relevant for myoma formation. A key pathway regulating smooth muscle differentiation, SRF (serum response factor) -FOS-JUNB, was found to be downregulated in FH- cells and in myomas. While in the deletor mouse many pathways were affected in a tissue-specific basis, like FGF 21 induction in the deletor muscle, others were systemic, such as the downregulation of ALAS 2 -linked heme synthesis in all deletor tissues analyzed. However, interestingly, even a tissue-specific response of FGF 21 excretion could elicit a global starvation response. The work presented in this thesis has contributed to a better understanding of mitochondrial stress signalling and of pathways interpreting and transducing it to human pathology. Mitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for transformation of food nutrients into chemical energy. Defects in the mitochondrial machinery of chemical energy production cause a number of diseases, often affecting the nervous system and muscles. Recently, two defects in mitochondria were found to cause cancer. In this work, one cancer-causing defect was studied and compared to defects causing neuromuscular diseases, to identify the mechanisms of cancer formation in those patients, in particular the formation of uterine myomas...|$|R
