25|$|Throughout the interwar period, Arab nationalists bore Germany no ill-will, {{despite its}} earlier {{support for the}} Ottoman Empire. Like many Arab countries, it was {{perceived}} {{as a victim of}} the post-World War I settlement. Hitler himself often spoke of the 'infamy of Versailles'. Unlike France and Great Britain it had not exercised imperial designs on the Middle East, and its past policy of non-intervention was interpreted as a token of good will. While the scholarly consensus is that Husseini's motives for supporting the Axis powers and his alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were deeply inflected by anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist ideology from the outset, some scholars, notably Renzo De Felice, deny that the relationship can be taken to reflect a putative affinity of Arab nationalism with Nazi/Fascist ideology, and that men like Husseini chose them as allies for purely strategic reasons, on the grounds that, as Husseini later wrote in his memoirs, 'the enemy of your enemy is your friend'.Translation: 'I have considered Germany to be a friendly country, because it was not a colonizing country, and it never harmed any Arab or Islamic country, and because it was fighting our colonialist and Zionist enemies, and because the enemy of your enemy is your friend. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> that Germany's victory would definitely save our countries from the danger of Zionism and colonization'.Mudhakkirat al-Hajj Amin al-Husayni, Damascus 1999 p.96. When Husseini eventually met with Hitler and Ribbentrop in 1941, he assured Hitler that 'The Arabs were Germany's natural friends because they had the same enemies... namely the English, the Jews, and the Communists'.|$|E

2500|$|While {{shooting}} {{a movie in}} Arizona, Stewart {{received a phone call}} from Dr. Keagy, his veterinarian, who informed him that Beau was terminally ill, and that Gloria sought his permission to perform euthanasia. Stewart declined to give a reply over the phone, and told Keagy to [...] "keep him alive and I'll be there." [...] Stewart requested several days' leave, which allowed him to spend some time with Beau before granting the doctor permission to euthanize the sick dog. Following the procedure, Stewart sat in his car for ten minutes to clear his eyes of tears. Stewart later remembered:After [...] died there were a lot of nights when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> that I could feel him get into bed beside me and I would reach out and pat his head. The feeling was so real that I wrote a poem about it and how much it hurt to realize that he wasn’t going to be there any more.|$|E

At the funeral of Lev Karpov in 1921, he said: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> that the time will come when science will become all-powerful, that {{it will be able to}} recreate a deceased organism. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> that the time will come when one will be able to use the elements of a person's life to recreate the physical person.
