5|$|Sri Lanka's {{electricity}} demand is currently met by nine thermal power stations, fifteen large hydroelectric power stations, and fifteen wind farms, {{with a smaller}} share from small hydro facilities and other renewables such as solar. Most hydroelectric and thermal/fossil fuel–based power stations {{in the country are}} owned and/or operated by the government via the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), while the renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> consists mostly of privately run plants operating on a power purchase agreement with the CEB.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, China led {{the world}} in {{renewable}} energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. As of 2014, China leads {{the world in}} the production and use of wind power, solar photovoltaic power and smart grid technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity. Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> was developed without subsidies.|$|E
40|$|Within the {{sustainability}} transitions literature, established, mature or incumbent firms have been stereotyped as ‘locked-in’ to socio-technical regimes. However, we believe regimes have been black-boxed, and {{few studies have}} explored incumbents’ responses to transition processes. This article aims to achieve an improved understanding of incumbents in established <b>energy</b> <b>sectors</b> and their extent of involvement in other (niche) <b>energy</b> <b>sectors.</b> To this avail, we analyze data from a first-of-its-kind survey of 133 incumbent firms in Norway's two main <b>energy</b> <b>sectors,</b> namely oil/gas and hydropower. Providing inter-temporal dimensions, our data covers incumbents’ diversification activities beyond their primary sector both in the past (cancelled activities), present (ongoing activity in secondary sectors) and future (ambitions of diversification), and also distinguishes between producers and product/service suppliers. By incorporating insights on firm diversification, our analysis sheds {{new light on the}} complex transformation processes associated with sustainability transitions. Empirical results show considerable heterogeneity in incumbents’ responses to changing selection pressures, which can be explained by recognition that windows of opportunity are opening and some incumbents see potential to leverage their resources and capabilities to capture value in new niche <b>energy</b> <b>sectors</b> in both domestic and international markets...|$|R

5|$|The {{wind power}} {{industry}} set new records in 2014 – more than 50 GW of new capacity was installed. Another record breaking year occurred in 2015, with 22% annual market growth {{resulting in the}} 60 GW mark being passed. In 2015, close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China and India. Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW, taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 432.9 GW, up from 74 GW in 2006. In terms of economic value, the wind <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> {{has become one of}} the important players in the energy markets, with the total investments reaching bn (bn), an increase of 4% over 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E
