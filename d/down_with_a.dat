5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced.

5|$|Batista and Orton {{decided to}} work {{together}} to assault Bryan, and the original referee returned to the match.

As both Bryan and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table, only Batista emerged unscathed. Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a stretcher.

5|$|Despite this form, his Test {{campaign}} started poorly with an ineffective 1/130 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. He {{then broke}} <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> back injury in a match against Kent and looked unlikely to play. With Benaud already sidelined with a shoulder injury, Australia looked severely weakened without their two main bowlers. Despite again complaining about frailties of his body, Davidson vowed {{to play and}} produce a special performance for friend and stand-in captain Neil Harvey in the Second Test at Lord's.|$|E

5|$|Hassett {{struggled}} in two warm-up matches against Tasmania before the Australians left for England, and despite winning both fixtures, {{it was not}} to be a happy tour on the field. In the first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia’s leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> serious knee injury. Hassett {{struggled in}} the opening first-class matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he hit an unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.|$|E

Rooney flees while she calls the police; when they arrive, they arrest her for filing a false report, and contact her mother to collect her. While waiting, she meets a juvenile delinquent, who advises her not to worry so much about Ferris. Mrs. Bueller arrives at the station, upset about having to forgo a house sale, only to find Jeannie kissing the delinquent, infuriating her more.|$|E
5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock them <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tap.|$|E
