40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} {{design of a}} {{synchronous}} frame control strategy for single-phase inverter-based islanded distributed generation (DG) systems. Although, implementation of these regulators requires {{a minimum of two}} independent phases in the system, the required orthogonal phase is generated {{through the use of a}} first order all pass filter (APF). The essence of the proposed control strategy is to use a synchronous reference frame PI (SRFPI) controller to regulate output voltage, together with a simple <b>inner</b> <b>capacitor</b> current regulating loop to stabilize the system and a voltage-feedforward loop to improve the system robustness. A detailed design criterion for the proposed control strategy is presented base on a frequency-response approach. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the proposed method. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Many grid {{connected}} power electronic systems, such as STATCOMs, UPFCs, and distributed generation system inter-faces, use a {{voltage source inverter}} (VSI) connected to the supply network through a filter. This filter, typically a series inductance, acts to reduce the switching harmonics entering the distribution network. An alternative filter is a LCL network, which can achieve reduced levels of harmonic distortion at lower switching frequen-cies and with less inductance, and therefore has potential bene-fits for higher power applications. However, systems incorporating LCL filters require more complex control strategies and are not commonly presented in literature. This paper proposes a robust strategy for regulating the grid current entering a distribution network from a three-phase VSI system connected via a LCL filter. The strategy integrates an outer loop grid current regulator with <b>inner</b> <b>capacitor</b> current regulation to stabilize the system. A synchronous frame PI current regula-tion strategy {{is used for the}} outer grid current control loop. Linear analysis, simulation, and experimental results are used to verify the stability of the control algorithm across a range of operating conditions. Finally, expressions for “harmonic impedance ” of the system are derived to study the effects of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic performance of the system.

40|$|This paper proposes {{an active}} {{front-end}} solution {{to balance the}} dc-link capacitor voltage of the five-level diode clamped inverter. Capacitor voltage balancing is performed by a three-level boost converter connected to the two <b>inner</b> <b>capacitors</b> of a five-level diode-clamped inverter and additional balancing circuits at the other two outer capacitors. The proposed configuration is tested through simulation and experiment for various load power factor conditions at a high modulation index.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} practical implementation of a digital current controller for a three-phase PWM voltage source inverter connected to the grid via an LCL filter to produce a high quality current injected into the grid. A two feedback loops control system is proposed, with an outer grid current loop and an <b>inner</b> filter <b>capacitor</b> current loop. The controller also incorporates a grid voltage feedforward loop {{to compensate for the}} effect of the utility voltage disturbance. The paper also discusses the effect of the sampling and computational time delay both on system stability and current quality. This time delay is shown to reduce the stability of the inner loop. However, it is also shown that it is better, {{from the point of view}} of output current THD quality, to increase the inner loop time delay to a full one sampling period, so that the mains frequency envelope (nearly ripple free) current component is sampled at the peaks and troughs of the PWM, away from the switching instances (and associated noise) of the transistors. To ensure system stability, a capacitor current observer is proposed to compensate for the computational time delay. The design of the capacitor current observer and the controller are discussed. Simulation and practical results are presented to validate the design...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of offshore wind farms, {{the demand for}} high power, high quality transmission system becomes more urgent. Modular Multilevel converter (MMC) based high voltage direct voltage (HVDC) technology provides a promising solution. In the past decade, intense {{research has been done}} on challenges related to the control of MMC, including the outer dynamic control and two <b>inner</b> dynamic controls: <b>capacitor</b> balancing and circulating current suppressing. Many algorithms have been proposed, but an overview of them still lacks. This paper provides a review of most of control strategies for MMC in the literature about all three control purposes with clear classification and detailed explanations. In addition, the traditional proportional-integral (PI) controller based cascade control and model predictive control for AC side current control are compared by simulation in Matlab/Simulink. Different control strategies for capacitor voltage balancing and circulating current eliminating are also tested and compared. Finally, an option of comprehensive control of HVDC system for offshore wind farm is proposed and verified by simulation...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{effective}} regulation methods, static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) has been widespread used to regulate dynamic reactive power and solve dynamic voltage stability problems into power-grid. Through {{the analysis of}} mathematical model, cascaded STATCOM, which is constructed by several cascaded H-bridges, is a nonlinear, multivariable, strongly coupled system. It will make difficulties {{in the design and}} practical application of controller. In this paper, mathematical models of cascaded STATCOM in a -b- c and d-q coordinates are deduced. Based on the theory of internal model control and PI control strategy, the internal decoupling control algorithm is introduced to realize independent control of active current and reactive current. At the same time, decoupling control algorithms are designed and decoupling control models are given and simulated. From the combined circuit topology and control with multi-FPGA, the simulation and experimental platform of cascaded SVG, which use the control algorithms of double-loop control with the current <b>inner</b> loop and <b>capacitor</b> voltage outer loop. Both in a-b-c coordinates and d-q- 0 coordinates, experiment and simulation results show that three-phase current of STATCOM has good tracking performance and control precision, which show the regulator design method and parameters setting are feasible and effective. ...|$|R
40|$|Voltage {{and current}} {{unbalance}} are major problems in distribution networks, {{particularly with the}} integration of distributed generation systems. One way of mitigating these issues is by injecting negative sequence current into the distribution network using a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) which normally also regulates the voltage and power factor. The benefits of modularity and scalability offered by Modular Multilevel Cascaded Converters (MMCC) make them suitable for STATCOM application. A number {{of different types of}} MMCC may be used, classified according to the sub-module circuit topology used. Their performance features and operational ranges for unbalanced load compensation are evaluated and quantified in this research. This thesis investigates the use of both single star and single delta configured five-level Flying Capacitor (FC) converter MMCC based STATCOMs for unbalanced load compensation. A detailed study is carried out to compare this type of sub-module with several other types namely: half bridge, 3 -L H-bridge and 3 -L FC half bridge, and reveals the one best suited to STATCOM operation. With the choice of 5 -L FC H-bridge as the sub-module for STATCOM operation, a detailed investigation is also performed to decide which pulse width modulation technique is the best. This was based on the assessment of total harmonic distortion, power loss, sub-module switch utilization and natural balancing of <b>inner</b> flying <b>capacitors.</b> Two new modulation techniques of swapped-carrier PWM (SC-PWM) along with phase disposed and phase shifted PWM (PS-PWM) are analyzed under these four performance metrics. A novel contribution of this research is {{the development of a new}} space vector modulation technique using an overlapping hexagon technique. This space vector strategy offers benefits of eliminating control complexity and improving waveform quality, unlike the case of multilevel space vector technique. The simulation and experimental results show that this method provides superior performance and is applicable for other MMCC sub-modules. Another contribution is the analysis and quantification of operating ranges of both single star and delta MMCCs in rating the cluster dc-link voltage (star) and current (delta) for unbalanced load compensation. A novel method of extending the operating capabilities of both configurations uses a third harmonic injection method. An experimental investigation validates the operating range extension compared to the pure sinusoidal zero sequence voltage and current injection. Also, the superiority of the single delta configured MMCC for unbalanced loading compensation is validated. ...|$|R
