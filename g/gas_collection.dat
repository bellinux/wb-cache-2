40|$|Objective: We {{report a}} rare case of {{cervical}} necrotising fasciitis arising from poorly managed acute tonsillitis. Case report: A 23 -year-old woman {{presented with a}} two-week history of fever and an eight-day history of painful neck swelling. Nine days before presentation, she had received digital manipulation of her throat by a neighbour, which had worsened her throat pain. There was associated progressive generalised neck swelling, odynophagia, dysphagia and dyspnoea. An X-ray of the neck soft tissue showed multiple <b>gas</b> <b>collections.</b> Conclusion: Cervical necrotising fasciitis is rare and usually odontogenic in origin.

Our patient responded to aggressive daily bedside wound debridements and dressings, appropriate intravenous antibiotics and high-protein nutritional support.

3000|$|Postmortem {{multislice}} {{computed tomography}} (PMCT) {{has become a}} clinical standard and {{has contributed to the}} field of forensic autopsy with promising results. The documentation and analysis of postmortem findings with computed tomography (CT) are investigator independent, objective, and noninvasive and will lead to qualitative improvements in forensic pathologic investigation. CT provides easy storage and transmission of data, thereby facilitating audit and review by others, and it provides images that are more suitable for court presentation than autopsy photographs. Another advantage is the ability to store the imaging data for second opinions, even years after burial (Dirnhofer et al. 2006; Simons et al. 2014; Leth 2015). Previous studies of postmortem investigations of both natural and unnatural death have shown that the diagnostic yield increases, specifically for the detection of fractures, hemorrhage, and <b>gas</b> <b>collections,</b> such as pneumothorax, when PMCT is performed with an autopsy (Westphal et al. 2012; Wichmann et al. 2012 Leth et al. 2013; Rutty et al. 2013; Lo Re et al. 2015) [...].|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Emphysematous {{gastritis}} {{is a rare}} {{condition in}} which gas accumulates in the stomach lining usually due to an infectious source. Case presentation: We present a 16 year old female with viral myocarditis and cardiogenic shock transferred to our hospital on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) who developed emphysematous gastritis. After listing the patient for heart transplant, patient underwent Bi-VAD placement requiring veno-venous ECMO support. Subsequently, she developed worsening abdominal distention. CT of abdomen/pelvis showed the stomach to be diffusely edematous, thick-walled, containing intramural <b>gas</b> <b>collections,</b> consistent with emphysematous gastritis. Patient underwent nonoperative management and two weeks later had complete resolution of the gastritis. Unfortunately, her overall condition deteriorated in the subsequent days and support was withdrawn. Discussion: Management of emphysematous gastritis usually revolves around supportive care, broad spectrum antibiotics and bowel rest. Our patients’ gastritis resolved with non-operative management, albeit, she succumbed to multiorgan failure due to other causes. Conclusion: We believe, this is a unique case of a veno-arterial ECMO causing emphysematous gastritis...|$|R
30|$|As {{illustrated}} in our case, PCI can easily mimic pneumoperitoneum on radiological imaging. Intramural air may appear as radiolucent shadows along the bowel lumen on X-ray [9]. Extensive PCI or ruptured cysts may appear like free air under the diaphragm in an erect chest X-ray. CT being the more sensitive imaging may show circumferential <b>gas</b> <b>collections</b> outside the bowel lumen [1] or reveal life-threatening events related to PCI like bowel ischaemia [11]. Two features of PCI {{have been described}} in the literature—cystic circumferential gas is associated with good prognosis, and linear gas is associated with poor prognosis [2, 11]. CT can also identify co-existing conditions like colitis, perforation, obstruction, and neoplasms. Although CT is deemed {{to be the most}} sensitive imaging modality, PCI can give the same appearance as intra-faecal gas, gas in pseudopolyps, and extra-luminal gas [3]. Ultrasound shows high amplitude gas echoes with acoustic shadowing. Barium study shows protrusion of submucosa causing filling defects in the intestinal lumen. Endoscopically, PCI appears as submucosal cysts with pale or bluish tint. When biopsied, PCI may rapidly deflate with an audible hiss [8].|$|R

40|$|Background: Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} the presence of multiple <b>gas</b> <b>collections</b> in the subserosal or submucosal intestinal wall of the large or small intestine. We report two cases of PCI in the course of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Case Report: A 5 -year-old girl was treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Twenty-four months after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in the course of graft-versus-host disease, she developed subcutaneous emphysema of the right inguinal and pudendal region. PCI was diagnosed based on a CT examination. A 3 -year-old boy was treated for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Fourteen months after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation he presented with an increased severity of intestinal symptoms, including intermittent bleeding from large intestine. PCI was diagnosed based on a CT exam and was confirmed by a colonoscopy. Conclusions: Pneumatosis cystoides interstitialis in the course of chronic graft-versus-host disease has a heterogeneous clinical presentation that does not correlate with results of imaging. CT is a method of choice to diagnose PCI. In patients with PCI, the presence of free air in the peritoneal cavity does not confirm an intestinal perforation...|$|R
