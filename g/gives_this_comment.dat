For a given radial mass density in the cloak the question posed {{is whether the}} remaining two parameters, tangential density and compressibility, are uniquely determined.

With the provisos <b>given</b> in <b>this</b> <b>comment,</b> the results are important since, even if {{in some cases the}} choice of a rigid crystal does not alter dramatically the sorbate motion, the inclusion of lattice vibrations (resulting from LD, or, even better from MD simulations) is essential to provide in general a correct representation of the sorbate dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Milton Friedman {{has been}} taken {{by some to be}} a {{follower}} of the logical positivists and by others a disciple of the philosopher Karl Popper, but until recently not enough has been said by way of support for such claims to make it possible to evaluate their substance. Recently, however, Laurence Boland (1979) has suggested that Friedman should rather be considered an "instrumentalist," meaning by this that for Friedman "theories are convenient and useful ways of (logically) generating what {{have turned out to be}} true (or successful) predictions or conclusions" (pp. 508 - 09) and Boland has given us a substantive analysis of his position. More recently Boland has combined forces with William Frazer (1983) to try to demonstrate that while Friedman is an instrumental thinker, and instrumentalismis a point of view against which Popper has argued vigorously still Friedman's instrumentalismis in some sense compatible with Popper's falsificationist doctrine. These efforts are certainly in the right direction. A major reason there has been so little return on such a vast amount of discussion about Friedman's methodologyi s that t 4 e many participantsin the debate have focussed on one or another aspect of Friedman's formulations without trying to determine what general point of view underlay his approach. Boland has dug deeper, and with Frazer has set out to show one of the fruits of this approach. The effort is therefore to be applauded for what it tries to do. But for reasons that will be <b>given</b> in <b>this</b> <b>comment,</b> Frazer and Boland wind up with a quite distorted picture...|$|R

The value in reviewing and addressing the problems found in anticipatory repudiation are further explored in <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> from a marketing standpoint. <b>This</b> <b>Comment</b> argues that the effects of anticipatory repudiation may devalue relational assets when concepts from exchange orientation are taken into consideration, and relationship marketing suffers from these inherent barriers to communication...|$|R

Second, <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> analyzes courts 2 ̆ 7 treatment of referential works and explains why courts have not encountered participatory works. Next, <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> discusses that while courts have guided authors of referential works regarding how to create a non-infringing work, courts have yet to consider how to protect participatory works. Accordingly, <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> proposes that courts treat participatory works similarly to how they treat parodies under the fair use doctrine because both types of works must borrow from the respective original works to fulfill their respective purposes...|$|R

40|$|For over fifteen years, U. S. {{immigration}} {{authorities and}} courts have grappled {{with the idea}} of domestic violence as a basis for asylum. But in 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) issued a decision indicating that victims of domestic violence may qualify for asylum. <b>This</b> <b>Comment</b> assesses the BIA’s decision and concludes that it is ultimately ineffective. <b>This</b> <b>Comment</b> further suggests that the only practical solution is for Congress to intervene. <b>This</b> <b>Comment</b> first provides a brief historical overview of asylum law to help elucidate the purpose of asylum law. It also provides an in-depth review of the elements needed to establish a successful asylum claim and surveys how previous domestic violence-based claims have fared. Next, <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> examines and appraises various existing proposals for addressing the issue of domestic violence-based asylum. Finally, <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> proposes two possible changes to the refugee definition that would more adequately address the issue of domestic violence-based asylum. <b>This</b> <b>Comment</b> also anticipatorily rebuts the argument that granting asylum to domestic violence victims, as a matter of law, would lead to a drastic increase in this type of asylum application. <b>This</b> <b>Comment</b> concludes that the decision in In re A-R-C-G- does not provide an adequate solution for domestic violence victims seeking asylum. Moreover, {{it is time for the}} United States to amend its refugee definition to explicitly extend protection (via asylum) to domestic violence victims...|$|R

Next, <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> discusses the challenges that same-sex partners and their children were confronted with {{due to the lack}} of legal recognition of their relationships and then delves into counter-arguments to such recognition. Moreover, <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> argues that the legislature took the correct and honorable action in enacting the Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act because it was proper to extended equality to “all persons,” as our constitution promises. Further, <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> argues that the Civil Union Act will strengthen society by allowing same-sex couples and their children to take part in the benefits of a legally recognized union...|$|R

In particular, Part I will discuss the role that the government has had in promoting and regulating marriage and how the treatment of married persons operates to the exclusion of the unmarried. Parts II and III of <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> will provide a history of the joint income tax and joint bankruptcy petition. In Parts IV(A) and IV(B), <b>this</b> <b>Comment</b> will evaluate and critique both the benefits and drawbacks of allowing individuals to file jointly for tax and bankruptcy purposes, and discuss the implications of joint filing.
