5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit their character rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E

25|$|Silver bays are {{bay horse}} {{with at least}} one {{dominant}} silver (Z) allele. Red pigment is unaffected, but black pigment in the short coat is diluted to dark, flat, brown-gray while the longer hairs are diluted to silver.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} to spending time alone. Freedom {{is considered to}} be one of the benefits of solitude; the constraints of others will not have any <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> person who is spending time in solitude, therefore giving the person more latitude in their actions. With increased freedom, a person’s choices are less likely to be affected by exchanges with others.|$|E

One can approximate gravity's <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> monster {{by defining}} a heavy diagonal path; the monster will move horizontally until it reaches a ledge, at which point it will fall until it hits the ground again. Similarly, although monsters lack hit counters, the user can create chains of identical (or successively injured-looking) monsters to approximate the same effect.|$|E

25|$|Although {{telegraphy}} {{itself is}} not generally regarded as mass media, as its communications are, in <b>effect,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> one-to-one basis, the data and information that was transmitted through Porthcurno had both national and international importance. Wars were declared, announcements of deaths of royalty announced – these in turn were relayed to the national and local newspapers {{for the general public}} to absorb. Without telegraphy, there would have been little news in newspapers, and very little national and global content over the radio airwaves.|$|E
25|$|Because a body {{of water}} can have an <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> range of people {{reaching}} far beyond that of the watershed, cooperation between different organizations is necessary to prevent the intrusion of contaminants that can lead to eutrophication. Agencies ranging from state governments to those of water resource management and non-governmental organizations, going as low as the local population, are responsible for preventing eutrophication of water bodies. In the United States, the most well known inter-state effort to prevent eutrophication is the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
25|$|Since {{conscious}} awareness {{has to be}} {{coupled with}} local physical systems, the observer’s physical environment has to interact and can influence the brain. The brain itself must have some physico-chemical processes that affect the states of awareness. If these neural processes can be described and analyzed then some experiments could potentially be created to test whether affecting neural processes can have an <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> quantum system. Speculation {{about the details of}} this awareness-local physical system coupling on a purely theoretical basis could occur, however experimentally searching for them through neurological and psychological studies would be ideal.|$|E

CUNY administrators claimed they did so for other reasons unrelated to the speech. He sued, was awarded damages, and the Second Circuit upheld the verdict in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the Jubilee cycle {{continues}} to {{be of interest to}} modern scholarship, as does the question of the practicality of the legislation, and whether it was ever put into <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nationwide basis. Regarding the {{length of the}} cycle, three significant scholarly studies devoted to the Jubilee and Sabbatical years agree that it was 49 years, while disagreeing somewhat on the interpretation of the other issues involved. These major studies were those of Benedict Zuckermann, Robert North, and Jean-François Lefebvre. The reasons given by these authors to support a 49-year cycle are both textual (examining all relevant Biblical texts) and practical.|$|E
25|$|A {{recurring}} theme {{is that the}} actions of the group may hasten the cataclysm they are trying to avoid, or alter history in undesirable ways. A character who was supposed to live until 2007 dies in the first episode after helping the group. In one episode, Sarah and Angela protect a girl they know will be kidnapped. Although this prevents that individual's kidnapping, the kidnapper takes a different child. Kurt makes a large bet on a football game whose outcome is already known to him, but the pressure of knowing has a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> player instrumental in winning the game, and the team loses.|$|E
