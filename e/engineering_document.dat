40|$|Information {{retrieval}} (IR) is {{a well-established}} {{research and development}} area. Document formats such as SGML (Standard Generalised Mark-up Language) and XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) have become widely used in recent years. Traditional IR systems demonstrate limitations when dealing with such documents, which motivated the emergence of structured document retrieval (SDR) technology intending to overcome these limitations. This paper reviews the work carried out from the inception to the development and application of SDR in <b>engineering</b> <b>document</b> management. The key issues of SDR are discussed {{and the state of}} the art of SDR to improve information access performance has been surveyed. A comparison of selected papers is provided and possible future research directions identified. The paper concludes with the expectation that SDR will make a positive impact on the process of <b>engineering</b> <b>document</b> management from document construction to its delivery in the future, and undoubtedly provide better information retrieval performance in terms of both precision and functionality.

40|$|Research shows, {{that the}} major issue in {{development}} of quality software is precise estimation. Further this estimation depends upon the degree of intricacy inherent in the software i. e. complexity. This paper attempts to empirically demonstrate the proposed complexity {{which is based on}} IEEE Requirement <b>Engineering</b> <b>document.</b> It is said that a high quality SRS is pre requisite for high quality software. Requirement <b>Engineering</b> <b>document</b> (SRS) is a specification for a particular software product, program or set of program that performs some certain functions for a specific environment. The various complexity measure given so far are based on Code and Cognitive metrics value of software, which are code based. So these metrics provide no leverage to the developer of the code. Considering the shortcoming of code based approaches, the proposed approach identifies complexity of software immediately after freezing the requirement in SDLC process. The proposed complexity measure compares well with established complexity measures. Finally the trend can be validated with the result of proposed measure. Ultimately, Requirement based complexity measure can be used to understand the complexity of proposed software much before the actual implementation of design thus saving on cost and manpower wastage.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [75]- 80) A generalized computer-based automated {{documentation system}} which processes <b>engineering</b> <b>documents</b> is extremely desirable. Since document archives is memory intensive, data compression algorithms {{are becoming increasingly}} important A revolutionary technique which separates text from mixed text/graphic documents and succinctly describes graphics has been introduced. This thesis introduces two new main algorithms. The first one focuses on the separation of text from mixed text/graphic documents (Chapter 3). It includes an Edge Expanding Search (EES) algorithm for the searching of character-shaped objects, Neighborhood Checking (NC) algorithm for the checking of the neighborhood of the object, and Touching Character Recognition (TCR) algorithm for {{the identification of the}} character touching on a graphic. The second algorithm relates to the description of graphics (Chapter 4). The performance of these algorithms, both in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency, is evaluated with fifteen mixed text/graphic <b>engineering</b> <b>documents.</b> The superior performance of these algorithms as compared to other techniques as described in Chapter 2 is clear from the evaluation results.
