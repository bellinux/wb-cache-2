25|$|I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, {{to one of}} his long-necked women, {{with their}} piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

500|$|In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an {{exhibition}} in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement {{released by the}} gallery, Dylan said, [...] "I've been around iron all my life <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was a kid. I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf – no way! Because I can imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Swim Good" [...] {{has been}} called an [...] "astonishing suicide song" [...] and that Ocean finds himself dressed in black ('Like I'm ready for a funeral'), tormented by heartbreak and {{on the verge of}} driving his car into the sea. The song is a grim escape fantasy {{describing}} a murder suicide, which [...] "has the singer driving his car to the shore, his trunk 'bleeding' with 'broken hearts'." [...] The hook of the song ends with the refrain of [...] "I feel like a ghost, no Swayze, <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> lost my baby." [...] "Dust" [...] uses books as an extended metaphor for memories and experience, with lines like [...] "so many pages I wrote, wish I could revise 'em / But there's no erasing".|$|E

[...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along class, rather than ideological, lines. [...] Stewart believed that [...] "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it be to get the things we really need in our government" [...] and asserted that [...] "I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men who think the same as I do." ...|$|E
500|$|Mace {{was seen}} as a strong yet very {{feminine}} female character, as she often rescues Lenny in dire situations and shows maternal concern for him. Both characters represent a significant contrast: Mace is the film's hero and moral center, whereas Lenny is the antihero; Mace is black and Lenny is white; and finally, Mace represents the [...] "hard-edged, reality-based" [...] component, while Lenny is dominated by fantasies. This is especially notable when Mace yells to him, [...] "This is your life! Right here! Right now! It's real time, you hear me? Real time, time to get real, not playback!" [...] The film's white characters also tend to be nihilistically concerned with the present, while black characters are generally future revolutionaries. Bigelow considered Strange Days as her most personal film, claiming that [...] "It's a synthesis of all the different tracks I've been exploring, either deliberately or unconsciously, <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> started making art." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} term at Arnold House Waugh found few {{opportunities}} to continue his writing. He was tired {{by the end of}} the day, his interest in The Temple flagged, and from time to time his attention wandered to other subjects; he contemplated a book on Silenus, but he admitted that it [...] "may or may not ... be written". After the Easter holidays he felt more positively about The Temple: [...] "I am making the first chapter a cinema film, and have been writing furiously <b>ever</b> <b>since.</b> <b>I</b> honestly think that it is going to be rather good". He sometimes worked on the book during classes, telling any boys who dared to ask what he was doing that he was writing a history of the Eskimos. By June he felt confident enough to send the first few chapters to his Oxford friend Harold Acton, [...] "asking for criticism and hoping for praise". Earlier that year Waugh had commented warmly on Acton's book of poems, An Indian Ass, [...] "which brought back memories of a life [...] infinitely remote".|$|E

500|$|By {{the second}} half of 1814, {{following}} his long and almost continuous campaigns throughout Europe during the last ten years, the health of General Nansouty badly deteriorated. He was suffering from his wounds, some of which were very recent, but, above all from war fatigue. On his death bed, he is recorded to have said: [...] "I have carefully reflected upon all my action <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was born and in all my life, I have not done anyone wrong." [...] He is also said to have reasserted his Christian faith and to have asked that his son be recommended for the King's protection, as a favour for his services. Just before passing away, he told his son that his heritage would be to follow his example and live an honourable and blameless life. General Count Étienne-Marie-Antoine-Champion de Nansouty died on 12 February 1815 in Paris, leaving behind his wife and their only son. A pension of 6,000 Francs per year was granted to the General's widow by the King of France. His final resting place is at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, division 27. The engraving on his tombstone reads: ...|$|E

The hook of the song ends with the refrain of [...] "I feel like a ghost, no Swayze, <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> lost my baby." [...] Pitchfork described the singing as [...] "heart-battered." [...] The Quietus states that the song [...] "makes you realise the ocean means a lot more to this songwriter than the reference to Ocean's Eleven that he's cited in interviews, he is mysterious and tragic." [...] Yahoo! Music stated that [...] "in his calm, ultra controlled tone, Ocean sings about feeling like he's on his way to a funeral as he drives around town in a black suit, and a body in the trunk." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2012 London Paralympics, Cole {{participated in}} eight events and won six medals. In her first event, the 100m Butterfly S9, she {{finished}} fourth, while South Africa's Natalie du Toit finished first. However, the following night, Cole won the 100m Backstroke S9, winning her first gold medal {{of the games}} in Australian record time. She told the press that it had [...] "been a goal of mine <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was 12 years old to beat Natalie du Toit" [...] who was [...] "kind of like the Michael Phelps of swimming for me, {{she has been a}} great mentor and relaxes me in the marshalling room. She is my biggest hero." [...] Cole won a second gold medal in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay 34 pts, this time in World Record time. In the 400m Freestyle S9, she was again beaten by du Toit, who finished first, while Cole took bronze. Cole won a second bronze in the 50m Freestyle S9, in which du Toit finished seventh, and then gold in the 100m Freestyle S9, in which du Toit finished third. Cole capped off the games, surprising even herself with a fourth gold medal, in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay 34 pts, again in Australian record time.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Opeth {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} the new track, [...] "The Throat of Winter", which {{appeared on the}} digital EP soundtrack of the video game, God of War III. Åkerfeldt described the song as [...] "odd" [...] and [...] "not very metal." [...] To celebrate their 20th anniversary, Opeth performed a six-show, worldwide tour called Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology, from March 30 through April 9, 2010. Blackwater Park was performed in its entirety, along with several songs never before performed. The concert of April 5, 2010, at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England was filmed for a DVD and live album package titled In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall. The set was released on September 21, 2010, in 2-DVD and 2-DVD/3-CD configurations. For the DVD the concert was split into two sets. The first set consists of the entire Blackwater Park album, while the second set contains one song from every album excluding Blackwater Park, in chronological order representing the twenty years of [...] "evolution" [...] in their music. Åkerfeldt stated, [...] "I can't believe it, but, fuck, we're celebrating 20 years. I've been in this band <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was 16. It's insane." [...] A special edition of Blackwater Park was released in March 2010 {{to coincide with the}} tour.|$|E
500|$|Wisden viewed Hutton, with Jack Hobbs, as [...] "one of the {{two most}} {{accomplished}} professional batsmen to have played for his country", and following the Second World War, critics regarded him as the best batsman in the world. In October 2010, he was chosen as part of the ESPNCricinfo All-time World XI, a team selected by a panel of respected commentators and cricket writers to represent the greatest cricketers of all time. As part of the same process, he was also chosen in England's greatest team. The official Yorkshire history describes him as [...] "technically and aesthetically the best batsman to play for Yorkshire". E. W. Swanton believed that if Hobbs was the greatest professional batsman, Hutton, along with Hammond and Compton, came next. Hutton was more cautious than these others. Following the lead of Herbert Sutcliffe, he saw the role of an opening batsman as defensive. The basis of his game was a good defensive technique, although he was able to accelerate and play attacking shots when the situation demanded. Cricket historian David Frith believes that [...] "there was an apparent touch of genius about his batsmanship", and Alan Gibson described Hutton's off drive as [...] "the glory of the game." [...] He was particularly effective on difficult batting pitches. Of the next generation of England batsmen, Peter May tried to adopt Hutton's mental approach to both batting and captaincy, while Colin Cowdrey later said [...] "I had tried to model myself on Len Hutton <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> started playing serious cricket." [...] Statistically, Hutton stands near the highest achievers. When he retired, only two men had scored more than his 6,971 Test runs; his average of 56.67 is seventh highest of those who played at least fifty Test matches, as of 2016, while only Sutcliffe has a higher average among openers who scored over 4,000 runs. He also displayed consistency; his annual average only fell below 50 three times, he averaged over 50 each year from 1947 to 1954 and scored 20 or more in 90 of his 138 innings.|$|E
