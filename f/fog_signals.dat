Late that evening, a two-coach staff train pulled out of Brill, accompanied by a band bearing a white flag and playing Auld Lang Syne. The train stopped at each station, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed.|$|E

The bridge predated {{the construction of the}} Severn Tunnel, a dozen miles or so downstream, by seven years. The opening ceremony for the bridge took place on 17 October 1879; nearly four hundred dignitaries travelled in twenty-three first class carriages across the bridge and back again, with <b>fog</b> <b>signals</b> exploding on each of the spans during the return trip. A banquet followed at the Pleasure Grounds near Sharpness station.|$|E

2500|$|Fog signal building: the {{original}} fog signal building {{was destroyed in}} a storm in 1935. [...] The building was replaced with a brick structure in 1937. [...] It was used to house steam boilers, clock timing apparatus, radio equipment, diesel generators, and equipment to operate 3 large diaphone horns until 1982. [...] The Coast Guard replaced the diaphone horns with an electronic fog horn in 1983 that sounded from the light tower. [...] The Coast Guard stopped <b>fog</b> <b>signals</b> from Whitefish Point in 1995. [...] The GLSHS abandoned their 1996 plans to demolish the fog signal building and started restoration of {{the exterior of the}} building in 2002.

40|$|To {{solve the}} problem that dynamic Allan {{variance}} (DAVAR) with fixed length of window cannot meet the identification accuracy requirement of fiber optic gyro (<b>FOG)</b> <b>signal</b> over all time domains, a dynamic Allan variance analysis method with time-variant window length based on fuzzy control is proposed. According to the characteristic of <b>FOG</b> <b>signal,</b> a fuzzy controller with the inputs {{of the first and}} second derivatives of <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> is designed to estimate the window length of the DAVAR. Then the Allan variances of the signals during the time-variant window are simulated to obtain the DAVAR of the <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> to describe the dynamic characteristic of the time-varying <b>FOG</b> <b>signal.</b> Additionally, a performance evaluation index of the algorithm based on radar chart is proposed. Experiment results show that, compared with different fixed window lengths DAVAR methods, the change of <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> with time can be identified effectively and the evaluation index of performance can be enhanced by 30 % at least by the DAVAR method with time-variant window length based on fuzzy control...|$|R

2500|$|By 4:00 am {{the dense}} fog off Whitefish Point caused Captain W.G. Rogers of the Cowle to check to half speed and blow <b>fog</b> <b>signals</b> at {{intervals}} {{of less than}} a minute. [...] The Scott suddenly loomed up full speed ahead broadside to the Cowle. [...] Captain McArthur of the Scott rang the chadburn for reverse and ordered, [...] "Hard left, hard left!" [...] It was too late and the Scott rammed the Cowle, cutting her almost in two. [...] The mate of the Scott blew her whistle, and when the Scott's engine found the reverse that was ordered before impact, the Scott's bow pulled from the massive hole in the Cowle. [...] The Cowle listed and began to founder. [...] A line was thrown from the Scott's bow to {{the deck of the}} sinking Cowle. [...] Three sailors scrambled hand over hand onto the Scott while other sailors ran for the rail and leaped into the lake in effort {{to get away from the}} suction of the sinking ship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—According {{to the bad}} {{influence}} of fiber optic gyro(FOG) signal random drift in inertia stabilized platform system, {{the properties of the}} <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> random drift are detected with the Allan variance method. By the relation between the Allan variance of signal noise and power spectrum density (PSD), the sources of some kinds of noise and its properties are analyzed and calculated using fitting algorithm in the least square method (LSM). The result of testing and statistic analyzing for <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> indicate that the Allan variance means is successful in separating and estimating the main random error source of <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> noise...|$|R
