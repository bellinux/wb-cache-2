5|$|In 1964 Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused {{as part of}} {{the post-war}} slum {{clearances}} in Manchester, to 16Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley. Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12Wardle Brook Avenue. Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to Saddleworth Moor to collect peat, something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble. She remained unharmed; living only a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.|$|E
5|$|Isa ibn Musa, the Caliph's nephew, {{was sent}} against Medina with 4,000 men, but Muhammad refused {{to abandon the}} holy city and insisted on meeting the Abbasid attack there. In the meantime, he imitated the actions of Muhammad, like {{restoring}} the famous ditch around the city. Muhammad's supporters nevertheless began deserting him. When Isa appeared before the city, he waited {{a few days before}} the ditch and repeatedly offered amnesty. Then his troops laid a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> over the ditch and entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762. Muhammad's corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to the Caliph.|$|E

Typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency.|$|R
25|$|Two doors per {{carriage}} per side. Being significantly wider {{they were}} theorised {{to be slightly}} more efficient in loading and unloading passengers, although this is disputed by some sources, who believe the <b>fewer</b> <b>doors</b> lead to longer platform dwell times compared to the three smaller doors in other Melbourne trains.|$|R
25|$|The Hotel Chelsea, New York City's first co-op {{apartment}} complex, {{was built}} at 222 West 23rd Street in 1883. The Emunah Israel synagogue, {{built in the}} 1860s as a Presbyterian church, is located a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> to the west at 236 West 23rd.|$|E
25|$|Jeff Townes and Will Smith were {{introduced}} to each other by chance in 1985. One night, Townes was performing at a house party only a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his hype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally {{made it to the}} party.|$|E
25|$|At first, {{his return}} to Venice was a cordial one {{and he was a}} celebrity. Even the Inquisitors wanted to hear how he had escaped from their prison. Of his three {{bachelor}} patrons, however, only Dandolo was still alive and Casanova was invited back to live with him. He received a small stipend from Dandolo and hoped to live from his writings, but that was not enough. He reluctantly became a spy again for Venice, paid by piece work, reporting on religion, morals, and commerce, most of it based on gossip and rumor he picked up from social contacts. He was disappointed. No financial opportunities of interest came about and <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> opened for him in society as in the past.|$|E

It was a dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the {{dustiness}} of the 'ouse we tooked the bloomin' boxes from." ...|$|R
25|$|Further to the southwest, Narrow Street, Limehouse's {{historic}} spine, {{which runs}} {{along the back of}} the Thames wharves, boasts one of the few surviving early Georgian terraces in London. Next to the terrace is the historic Grapes pub, rebuilt in 1720 and well-known to Charles Dickens, featuring as the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters in Our Mutual Friend. A <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> along was Booty's Riverside Bar but this closed down in 2012. Almost every building {{on the other side of}} Narrow Street was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, including hundreds of houses, Taylor Walker & Co's Barley Mow Brewery and a school. One notable exception is a former public house, known locally as 'The House They Left Behind', because it was the only Victorian terrace to survive. It still stands today, with the aid of three large supporting pillars.|$|E
500|$|After Elizabeth Craigie's death, {{the entire}} {{property}} was leased by Joseph Emerson Worcester from her heirs; he in turn rented {{the eastern half}} of the house to Longfellow. In 1843, the house was purchased by Nathan Appleton, who gave the house to Longfellow as a gift when Longfellow married Nathan's daughter Frances. He paid $10,000 for the home. Frances wrote to her brother Thomas Gold Appleton on August 30, 1843: [...] "We have decided to let Father purchase this grand old mansion", especially after Longfellow's friend George Washington Greene reminded them [...] "how noble an inheritance this is — where Washington dwelt in every room". Longfellow was proud of the connection to Washington and in 1844 purchased a bust of the home's former occupant, a copy of the sculpture by Jean-Antoine Houdon. [...] Worcester and his wife became tenants under Longfellow in the western half of the house until their new home a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> down was completed that spring. Mrs. Longfellow wrote on May 5, 1844, [...] "Worcester family left us in complete possession , with rooms nicely cleaned, and uncarpeted stairs and entries".|$|E

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of Desiro rolling stock built by Siemens was {{to replace the}} old , , [...] and [...] slam-door trains which were coming {{to the end of}} their useful lives, and which did not meet modern health and safety requirements. The Desiro trains have on-board information systems and full air-conditioning. Their faster acceleration is counterbalanced by the need to dwell longer at each station, since they have <b>fewer</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 40 Class 424 {{electric}} {{multiple units}} were acquired {{especially for the}} Hanover S-Bahn. These differ from the vehicles of class 423, as they have a lower floor height of 80 cm, <b>fewer</b> <b>doors</b> and include toilets. Although delivery began as early as 1998, the class 424 trains were not yet ready {{for the opening of}} the S-Bahn network at the start the Expo 2000 due to technical problems. Deutsche Bahn therefore had to temporarily borrow class 423 rolling stock from the Munich S-Bahn.|$|R
50|$|The S20 {{was one of}} the {{technical}} carryovers to the Nissan brand from Prince technology. The Skyline model - built as a Prince car since the model's inception in the 1950s - received the new engine. The Skyline GT-B in 1969 saw the introduction of the PGC10 GT-R, followed by the KPGC10 GT-R with a shorter wheelbase and 2 <b>fewer</b> <b>doors</b> in 1970. This model would later win a 50 straight touring car victories. For 1972, Nissan introduced the C110 Skyline powered by the L series of engines. A small number of KPGC110 GT-R would be built utilizing the remainder of the S20s.|$|R

[...] He had obtained work in the leather district and having acquired a little experience and a modest capital he launched the firm of H.B. Endicott & Co. [...] The company, which dealt in sheepskins, was headquartered at 27 High Street in Boston, a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> down from {{the offices of the}} later Endicott Johnson Corporation 10 High Street. He became treasurer of the Commonwealth Shoe & Leather Company, and it was through his connection with this firm that he entered the shoe manufacturing business.|$|E
2500|$|Henderson Street {{once had}} its own cinema, [...] at no.91 behind the {{building}} where The Raj Indian restaurant (i) is [...] today. It was listed in the Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directories as the 'Empire Picture House' and was definitely active in the late 1920s and early 1930s, though by the 1950s, it had been closed down and boarded up. In more recent times The Raj restaurant also used part of their premises to show films, though they no longer do so. Just a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> away, however, Sofi's Swedish Bar (vi) now hosts regular film nights in their back room, keeping cinema nights on Henderson Street an option in the present day.|$|E
2500|$|Constance Harker and Marjorie Jarrett {{purchased}} {{the school in}} 1909, and so began their partnership as co-Principals. The two women had met while teaching at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, where Harker was senior English and classics mistress. Following their purchase of the school, they searched for a site in Brisbane that could house the day and boarding schools under one roof, and in 1912, settled on [...] "Erneton" [...] on Wickham Terrace, which was located {{next door to the}} boarders previous residence, [...] "Garth House". A paddock at the rear of Garth House was rented for a netball court. As time went on, space became limited at the new site, and so Athol Place, a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> away on the Terrace was rented for extra Boarders and two primary classes.|$|E
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the Minirail monorail which ran within the perimeters of the Expo Site, the Expo Express used standard railway technology, with two running rails and a third electrified rail identical to those of the Toronto subway. In fact, the trains used were a modified version of the Hawker Siddeley H-series used by the Toronto Transit Commission with one <b>fewer</b> <b>door</b> on each side, and streamlined ends. Consequently, unlike Montreal's Metro with rubber tires, the Expo Express used traditional steel-wheeled trains. The Expo Express also featured fully air conditioned passengers cars, whereas Montreal's Metro does not.|$|R

2500|$|Admiral John Fisher, {{responsible}} for {{reconstruction of the}} British fleet in the pre-war period, favoured large guns, oil fuel, and speed. Admiral Tirpitz, {{responsible for}} the German fleet, favoured ship survivability and chose to sacrifice some gun size for improved armour. The German battlecruiser [...] had belt armour equivalent in thickness—though not as comprehensive—to the British battleship , significantly better than on the British battlecruisers such as Tiger. German ships had better internal subdivision and had <b>fewer</b> <b>doors</b> and other weak points in their bulkheads, but with the disadvantage that space for crew was greatly reduced. As they were designed only for sorties in the North Sea they {{did not need to}} be as habitable as the British vessels and their crews could live in barracks ashore when in harbour.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{settlement}} {{is known as}} Paleapolis (...) , the Ancient Greek word for [...] "old city", in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century BC, called Neapolis (...) , [...] "new city". Neapolis was erected towards the east and along with it, monumental walls around the whole settlement were built to prevent attacks from foreign threats. Some part of this structure can still {{be seen in the}} Cassaro district. This district was named after the walls themselves; the word Cassaro deriving from the Arab al-qaṣr (castle, stronghold, see also alcázar). Along the walls there were <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> to access and exit the city, suggesting that trade even toward the inner part of the island occurred frequently. Moreover, according to some studies, it may be possible that there were some walls that divided the old city from the new one too. The colony developed around a central street (decumanus), cut perpendicularly by minor streets. This street today has become Corso Vittorio Emanuele.|$|E
2500|$|Keyboard player Peter Bardens lived only a <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> {{away from}} Fleetwood's first home in London, and upon {{hearing of the}} {{proximity}} of an available drummer, Bardens gave Fleetwood his first gig in Bardens' band 'The Cheynes' in July 1963, thus seeding the young drummer's musical career. It would take him from The Cheynes – with whom he supported early gigs by the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds – to stints in The Bo Street Runners, where he replaced original drummer Nigel Hutchinson, who had enjoyed brief television fame on Ready Steady Go!. However by April 1965, when Fleetwood joined the band, it was fading into obscurity. By February 1966 Bardens, who had left the group, called on Fleetwood to join his new band, the 'Peter Bs', which soon expanded to become 'Shotgun Express' (with Rod Stewart). Peter Green, who was a guitarist in the Peter Bs, [...] left to [...] join John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, followed [...] by [...] Fleetwood in April 1967. His [...] new [...] band already featured John McVie.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from having}} a {{significantly}} shorter fuselage and one <b>fewer</b> cabin <b>door</b> per side, the 747SP differs from other 747 variants in having simplified flaps and a taller vertical tail to counteract the decrease in yaw moment-arm from the shortened fuselage. The 747SP uses single-piece flaps on the trailing edges, rather than the smaller triple-slotted flaps of standard 747s.|$|R

50|$|A {{double-ended}} tram has an operator's cab {{and controls}} {{at each end}} of the vehicle, which allows it to easily be driven at full speed in either direction on a continuous segment of track. Typically at the end of a run, the tram's operator will walk from one end of the tram to the other, and then commence the tram route in the other direction. The tram is usually switched to another track by use of crossover points or Y-points. Conversely, a single-ended vehicle needs a method of turning at terminani so that the operator's cab is in the front of the tram for the reverse journey. This usually necessitates a turning loop or triangle. On the other hand, the single cab and controls and <b>fewer</b> <b>door</b> spaces make the tram lighter, increases passenger accommodation (including many more seats) and effects reductions in equipment, weight, first-cost, maintenance cost, and operating expense.|$|R
