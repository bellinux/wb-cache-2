40|$|International audienceDistributed Hash Tables {{provide a}} {{scalable}} way of indexing shared data items in P 2 P systems. The scalability of DHTs mainly {{relies on the}} mechanism by which the system's load is fairly balanced among all participating nodes. This is usually achieved through a uniform hash function that randomly maps data items to nodes in the DHT. While this scheme provides item-balancing guarantees, it fails in balancing the actual load of the system by (1) making the simplifying assumption that all items are equally popular, i. e., they incur the same query-load on their hosting nodes, and (2) assuming that all nodes have comparable capacities. In this paper, we address this issue by considering a more practical characterization of a system's load, and propose a load balancing mechanism {{that takes into account}} data (un) popularity and node heterogeneity. We first redefine the notion of load {{in terms of the number}} of queries per time <b>frame.</b> <b>Load</b> is then balanced by dynamically adjusting the DHT structure so that it best captures node capacities and query-load distributions over data items.

A cyclic external loadgives rise to the early initiation of fatigue cracks, thus reducing their service life. In this paper, the fretting fatigue behaviour of commercially pure titanium flat samples (1. 5 mm thick) is evaluated. A fretting device composed of a <b>frame,</b> <b>load</b> cell, and two screw-mounted cylindrical fretting pads with convex extremities was built and set to a servo-hydraulic testing machine. The fatigue tests were conducted under load control at a frequency of 10 Hz and stress ratio R = 0. 1, with various contact load values applied to the fretting pads. Additional tests under inert environment allowed assessing the role of oxidation on the wear debris formation. The fracture surfaces and fretting scars were analysed via scanning electron microscopy in order to evaluate the surface damage evolutionand {{its effect on the}} fatiguecrack features.

40|$|In this investigation, {{the primary}} {{objective}} was to study the nonlinear behavior of unbraced two-bay concrete frames and {{to determine the extent}} to which ultimate load theory or limit design can be applied to these structures. The frame behavior was investigated analytically by two methods. In the first method the frame stability equation was derived assuming that members of the frame possess an elasto-plastic moment-curvature relationship. This stability analysis was also carried out by another model consisting of a column attached to a linear spring and carrying the total <b>frame</b> <b>load.</b> The second method was through a computer program which took material and geometric nonlinearities of concrete frames into account. A model concrete frame, with a scale factor of approximately one-third was considered. Variable parameters were loading condition, column reinforcement ratio, and beam to column load ratio. For each frame, the gravity loads were increased proportionally until 75 % of the frame ultimate capacity under gravity loads was reached. Then; while these gravity loads were held constant, lateral load was applied and increased to failure. The overall geometry, 21 -in high columns and 84 -in long beam, were kept the same for all of model frames investigated. The computer study and the stability model analysis indicated that all frames remained stable until four plastic hinges (two in each bay) formed, thus producing a combined sway mechanism. Based on the scope of this study, it appears that limit design may be employed for unbraced reinforced concrete structures...|$|E

40|$|The {{process known}} as {{fretting}} fatigue occurs at the contact surface between two components pressed together by a static load and {{is related to the}} simultaneous occurrence of wear, corrosion and fatigue damage. A small-amplitude oscillatory movement leads to friction stresses and surface wear. The oxidation of small fragments of metal (in normal atmospheric conditions) produces oxide debris. A cyclic external load applied to one or both the components gives rise to the early initiation of fatigue cracks. In this paper, the fretting fatigue behavior of commercially pure titanium flat samples (1. 5 mm thick) is evaluated. In order to carry out the experimental work, a fretting device composed by a <b>frame,</b> <b>load</b> cell and screw-mounted fretting pads was built and mounted in a servo-hydraulic testing machine.

The fretting scars were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy. The fatigue life was modeled by the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The results were evaluated in terms of the influence of the fretting phenomenon on the fatigue life of the material, as well as the effects of fretting conditions on the contact load evolution and wear debris formation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the preload and tensile fracture load values of prosthetic retaining screws after long-term use in vivo compared to unused screws (controls). Additionally, the investigation addressed whether the preload and fracture load values of prosthetic retaining screws reported by the manufacturer become altered after long-term use in vivo. Materials and Methods: For preload testing, 10 new screws (controls) from Nobel Biocare (NB) and 73 used retaining screws [58 from NB and 15 from Sterngold (SG) ] were subjected to preload testing. For tensile testing, eight controls from NB and 58 used retaining screws (46 from NB and 12 from SG) were subjected to tensile testing. Used screws for both tests were in service for 18 – 120 months. A custom load <b>frame,</b> <b>load</b> cell, and torque wrench setup were used for preload testing. All 83 prosthetic screws were torqued once to 10 Ncm, and the produced preload value was recorded (N) using an X–Y plotter. Tensile testing was performed on a universal testing machine and the resulting tensile fracture load value was recorded (N). Preload and tensile fracture load values were analyzed with 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests. Results: There was a signiﬁcant difference between preload values for screws from NB and screws from SG (p < 0. 001). The preload values for gold alloy screws from NB decreased as the number of years in service increased. There was a signiﬁcant difference between tensile fracture values for the three groups (gold alloy screws from NB and SG and palladium alloy screws from NB) at p < 0. 001. The tensile fracture values for gold alloy screws from NB and SG decreased as the number of years in service increased. Conclusions: In ﬁxed detachable hybrid prostheses, perhaps as a result of galling, the intended preload values of prosthetic retaining screws may decrease with increased in-service time. The reduction of the fracture load value may be related to the increase of in-service time; however, the actual determination of this relationship is not possible from this study alone.

30|$|In {{accordance}} with the “Implementation Guidelines for Basic Diagnosis of Seismic Performance of Important Cultural Properties (Buildings)” published by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan [10], the roof load per floor area {{in the case of}} “Clay-containing pantile roof” is 2400  N/m 2. Since the floor area of Manzendo Temple, investigated in this study, is 370.75  m 2, the roof load based on the guidelines from the Agency for Cultural Affairs is calculated to be 889.8  kN, which is much smaller than the actual roof load (1601.8  kN). As mentioned above, the eaves in the Manzendo Temple were greatly extended. Moreover, the roof height was considered high and even the weight of the ridge-end tiles was also greater than expected. Because the value calculated using the guidelines from the Agency for Cultural Affairs uses weight per floor area, under these conditions, it is considered that the actual measured value was much greater than the calculated value. Miyamoto et al. [2] also measured the volume of waste from a temple when performing seismic retrofitting on the building architecture according to a seismic diagnosis. According to their research, the roof ridge was at 19.73  m; the roof span was at 20.38  m; the floor area was 306  m 2; the building height was 8.8  m; the roof weight of the temple was 706  kN; the weight of its roof frame was 253  kN. On the other hand, for Manzendo Temple, the roof ridge was at 19.42  m; the roof span was at 19.09  m; the floor area was 370.75  m 2; the height was at 17.94  m; the roof weight was 1601.8  kN; the weight of its roof frame was 816.2  kN. Despite the fact that the dimensions for the roof ridges and roof spans as well as the floor areas in both buildings are substantially similar, the roof heights are significantly different. Due to this, it is impossible to simply compare these buildings. The roof weight and the weight of the roof frame in Manzendo Temple were significantly larger than the temple examined by Miyamoto et al. Comparing the values calculated by dividing the weight by the floor area for both buildings, the roof load and the roof <b>frame</b> <b>load</b> of the temple examined by Miyamoto et al. are 2.31 and 0.83  kN/m 2, respectively, whereas those are 3.46 and 2.20  kN/m 2, respectively, in the case of Manzendo Temple. The roof load and the roof frame weight of Manzendo Temple were 1.5 times and 2.7 times those of the temple measured by Miyamoto et al. From the above result, {{especially in the case of}} the temple architecture whose roof shape has infinite variety, it is understood that the roof load can vary greatly between buildings. Since the roof load affects the stress state of the members below, this finding is, therefore, important.|$|E

40|$|The {{most highly}} loaded frames {{of the newly}} {{developed}} Airbus A 400 M transport aircraft have glass reinforced aluminium laminate (Glare) straps attached to them to increase their resistance to fatigue damage. These straps were designed using static strength requirements for the frame. Basic justification was done in two steps. Firstly, the <b>frame</b> <b>load</b> was divided between frame and flange {{on the basis of}} in-plane stiffness of these parts. Secondly, a fatigue analysis was performed on the strap using an empirical model for fatigue of Glare laminates under tension. This report contains a thorough explanation of the development of a code which can be used to analyse the fatigue crack initiation and propagation characteristics of the combination of frame flange and Glare strap at once under variable amplitude loading. The choice was made for a modular implementation of a combination of analytical models. This allows the programme to analyse a large variety of cases and allows it to be adapted easily in the case it is decided to continue its development. The fatigue crack initiation model works in three stages. First, it computes the highest stress cycle occurring in the metal sheets of the laminate, second, it corrects this cycle to match the available SN-data, and third, it finds the corresponding cycles to initiation using the nearest matching SN-curve. Fatigue crack growth calculations are based on an analytical model which applies displacement compatibility at the delamination boundary, to solve for the crack tip stress intensity and subsequently calculate crack- and delamination growth characteristics. These displacements originate from four phenomena. One, the crack opens due to far-field stress in the metal layers. Two, there is also a crack opening effect because of the release of residual stress due to crack- and delamination growth. Three, crack closing occurs due to the bridging effect of the fibre layers. Four, the fibre layers elongate and deform due to the bridging load they sustain. The influence of variable amplitude loading on the laminate is taken into account by implementing the Wheeler yield zone model. Correct working of the code was verified by assessing whether the modules produced results equal to the codes they were based upon. The parts of the code that were made from scratch were verified by checking whether these parts reacted to input parameter changes in a way that matched expectations. Validation with a variety of test results proved that all the modules and combinations thereof produce results which corresponded to the experiments. The code that was developed for the research described in this report was used to evaluate Airbus' method of justification of their design of the Glare reinforced frame. It was shown that the method of justification is unconservative, which is likely due to the assumption that the load through the flange is redistributed to the strap. A study on ways to improve the design of the Glare reinforced frame flange showed, that the performance of the Glare-reinforced frame flange could be improved by increasing the amount of fibre layer in the cross section relative to the amount of metal.
