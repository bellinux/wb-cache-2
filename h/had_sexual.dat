5|$|Isabella {{was only}} 12 {{years old at}} the time of her wedding, young by the {{standards}} of the period, and Edward probably <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> relations with mistresses during their first few years together. During this time Edward fathered an illegitimate son, Adam, who was born possibly as early as 1307. Edward and Isabella's first son, the future Edward III, was born in 1312 amid great celebrations, and three more children followed: John in 1316, Eleanor in 1318 and Joan in 1321.|$|E
5|$|Kinsey and {{his staff}} {{reported}} that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female. Of women who <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> contact with another female, half to two-thirds of them had orgasmed. Single women had the highest prevalence of homosexual activity, followed by women who were widowed, divorced, or separated. The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women; those with previous homosexual experience reported they got married to stop homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in Western {{cultures}} in particular often classify themselves {{as having an}} identity that defines their individual sexuality, {{as well as their}} membership to a group that shares common traits. Women in many cultures throughout history have <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> relations with other women, but they rarely were designated as {{part of a group of}} people based on who they had physical relations with. As women have generally been political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{military}} and government conducted many interrogations, asking if women had ever <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> relations {{with another woman}} and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952 homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-three years later, in 1976, sexologist Shere Hite {{published}} {{a report on}} the sexual encounters of 3,019 women who had responded to questionnaires, under the title The Hite Report. Hite's questions differed from Kinsey's, focusing more on how women identified, or what they preferred rather than experience. Respondents to Hite's questions indicated that 8% preferred sex with women and 9% answered that they identified as bisexual or <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> experiences with men and women, though they refused to indicate preference.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Batista's {{government}} held presidential elections, but no politician {{stood against}} him; {{the election was}} widely considered fraudulent. It had allowed some political opposition to be voiced, and Castro's supporters had agitated for an amnesty for the Moncada incident's perpetrators. Some politicians suggested an amnesty would be good publicity, and the Congress and Batista agreed. Backed by the U.S. and major corporations, Batista believed Castro to be no threat, and on May 15, 1955, the prisoners were released. Returning to Havana, Castro gave radio interviews and press conferences; the government closely monitored him, curtailing his activities. Now divorced, Castro <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> affairs with two female supporters, Naty Revuelta and Maria Laborde, each conceiving him a child. Setting about strengthening the MR-26-7, he established an 11-person National Directorate but retained autocratic control, with some dissenters labeling him a caudillo (dictator); he argued that a successful revolution could not be run by committee and required a strong leader.|$|E

Alison explores the tensions her family was under at this time and watches a heated argument between her parents. Medium Alison returns home for vacation with Joan in tow. Helen confesses to Medium Alison her devastation at spending her life in an unfulfilling marriage with Bruce ("Days and Days"). Medium Alison, Joan and Bruce have an unexpectedly pleasant evening around the piano. Bruce asks Alison if she'd like {{to go for a}} drive, and (adult) Alison realizes that Medium Alison is gone; she joins her father in the car, breaking the boundaries of time. On the drive, she and Bruce struggle to express themselves to each other ("Telephone Wire").|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours {{that the two}} were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who {{played a central role}} in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Louise <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> relationships with anyone other than her husband.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward {{had a sexual}} relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E
