40|$|This book {{gives an}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> <b>treatment</b> of quantum field theory, {{appropriate}} to a reader with a first degree in physics and a {{working knowledge of}} special relativity and quantum mechanics. It aims to give the reader some understanding of what QFT is all about, without delving deep into actual calculations of Feynman diagrams or similar. The author serves up a seven‐course menu, which begins with a brief introductory Aperitif. This {{is followed by the}} Hors d'oeuvres, which set the scene with a broad survey of the Universe, its theoretical description, and how the ideas of QFT developed during the last century. In the next course, the Art of Cooking, the author recaps on some basic facts of analytical mechanics, relativity, quantum mechanics and also presents some nutritious “extras” in mathematics (group theory at the elementary level) and in physics (theory of scattering). After these preparations, the reader should have a good appetite for the Entrées ‐ the central par t of the book where the Standard Model is described and explained.   After Trou Normand, the restive pause including human stories about physicists and no formulas, the author serves the Dessert, devoted to supersymmetry (a very beautiful theory that is still awaiting a direct experimental confirmation), to general relativity and to the mystery of quantum gravity. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{bond between}} a fibre and the matrix is very {{important}} for the mechanical behaviour of CFRP. The quality of the fibre/matrix interface will influence the initiation and development of damage. This is certainly true for interlaminar fracture toughness. The present study is focused in the influence of the interface properties on the fracture toughness of CFRP. Carbon fibres with four different wet oxidative surface <b>treatment</b> <b>levels</b> have been investigated The fibres were embedded in a thermoset resin and in a thermoplastic system. Mode I, mode II and mixed-mode tests were performed to determine critical strain-energy release rates. Results show an important increase in the fracture toughness initiation value with increasing fibre surface <b>treatment</b> <b>level.</b> For tests dominated by mode I loading, however, the propagation value can reach a maximum at <b>intermediate</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>levels</b> as a consequence of fibre bridging effects. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Competition {{is known}} to {{decrease}} growth and development rate in tadpoles, but the physiological basis for this phenomenon is poorly understood. We hypothesized that competition results in increased production of stress hormones and that these hormones {{are responsible for the}} suppression of growth and development. To test this hypothesis, we measured whole-body corticosterone content in premetamorphic Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) tadpoles raised at two different population densities and three different food levels. Whole body corticosterone content was elevated in tadpoles subjected to either limited food (at low density) or high density. Within the low and intermediate food treatments, high density reduced tadpole growth and slowed development. Limited food slowed growth and development at all densities. Blocking corticoid synthesis by treating tadpoles with metyrapone (MTP) reversed the growth suppression caused by high density (tested in the <b>intermediate</b> food <b>level</b> <b>treatment)</b> but did not alter the effect of density on development rate. MTP treatment did not alter the depressive effect of limited resources on growth or development. Our results suggest that elevated corticoid biosynthesis mediates the negative effect of increased population density (i. e., increased intraspecific competition) on tadpole growth. J. Exp.

40|$|Carbon fibre surface {{treatments}} {{can affect}} the composite properties in the fibre direction. Two effects {{play an important role}} in the longitudinal tensile strength. First, the carbon fibre surface treatment has some influence on the individual fibre strength. Second, an improved interface strength leads to better load transfer in the composite. Using an elastic-slip model, it is shown that the ineffective length increases dramatically with decreasing degree of surface treatment. It is also shown that, as the debonded length of a broken fibre decreases, the strain in the matrix becomes very high, leading to matrix cracking and additional stress concentrations on the neighbouring fibres. This leads to a maximum strength at <b>intermediate</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>levels.</b> This conclusion is supported by UD tensile tests on [0] 0 carbon/epoxy laminates. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Results of {{adjuvant}} dose intensification {{studies in}} patients with localised breast cancer have raised questions regarding the clinical usefulness of this treatment strategy. Here, we develop and fit a natural history model for the time to clinical tumour recurrence {{as a function of}} the number of involved lymph nodes, and derive plausible predictions of the effects of dose intensification under various conditions. The time to tumour recurrence is assumed to depend on the residual postoperative micrometastatic burden of tumour, the fractional reduction of residual tumour burden (RTB) by treatment, and the rate of regrowth of the RTB to a clinically detectable size. It is assumed that a proportion of micrometastatic tumours are unresponsive to adjuvant chemotherapy even at maximal dose intensity. Data fitted included the San Antonio Cancer Institute (SACI) database of untreated patients, and CALGB # 9082, a study comparing a highly intensive and moderately intensity adjuvant regimen {{in patients with}} 10 + positive axillary nodes. The proportion of tumours unresponsive to maximally intensive adjuvant treatment is estimated to be 48 % (29 – 67 %). The estimated log kill for intermediate-dose therapy from CALGB # 9082 was 6. 5 logs, compared with 9 logs or greater for high-dose therapy. The model is consistent with a modest but nonnegligible advantage of dose intensification compared with standard therapies in patients with sensitive tumours who have 10 + positive axillary nodes, and suggests that much of this clinical benefit could be achieved using <b>intermediate</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>treatment</b> intensification. The model further suggests that, in patients with fewer than 10 involved axillary nodes, any advantage of treatment intensification over standard therapy would be much reduced, because in patients with smaller tumour burdens of sensitive tumour, a larger proportion of cures achievable with intensified therapy could be achieved as well with standard therapy...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{many of the}} Member States have {{experienced}} {{dramatic changes in the}} organisation of their <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> governments, while new ways and channels have been established to enhance the interaction between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> and the EU institutions. The conditions for what can be described as multi-level governance are changing, and empowered intermediate-level governments are increasingly putting further and new demands on the functioning and organisation of the European Union and its institutions. In this article an overview is given of how the <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> of government in the Member States has changed and some of the problems connected with this. Furthermore, different types of interaction between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> and the EU institutions are examined. What we see in many Member States today is a situation in which new ways of organising the <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> of government have been introduced with the aim of improving efficiency and democracy, while old ways are maintained. Therefore, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> is becoming increasingly complex. In some unitary states the development is heading in a "federal" direction, whilst federal states seem to be embracing the federal character of government even further. But it is a rather strange type of “federalisation”, since in the same country both the degree of autonomy given to different geographical areas {{and the way in which}} these new intermediate-level governments are organised may differ quite substantially...|$|R
