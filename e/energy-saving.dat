40|$|We {{investigate}} how moral hazard problems can cause sub-optimal investment in energy efficiency, a phe-nomenon {{known as the}} energy efficiency gap. We argue that such problems {{are likely to be}} important for home energy retrofits, where both the seller and the buyer can take hidden actions. The retrofit contractor may cut on the quality of installation to save costs, while the homeowner may rebound, that is, increase her use of energy services when provided with higher energy efficiency. We first formalize the double moral haz-ard problem described above and examine how the resulting energy efficiency gap can be reduced through minimum quality standards or <b>energy-savings</b> insurance. We then calibrate the model to the U. S. home insulation market and quantify the deadweight loss. We find that for a large range of market environments, the welfare gains from undoing moral hazard are substantially larger than the costs of quality audits. They are also about one order of magnitude larger than those from internalizing carbon dioxide externalities asso-ciated with the use of natural gas for space heating. Moral hazard problems are consistent with homeowners investing with implied discount rates in the 15 - 35 % range. Finally, we find that minimum quality standards outperform <b>energy-savings</b> insurance. JEL: D 86,Q 4...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how moral hazard problems can cause sub-optimal investment in energy efficiency, a {{phenomenon known as}} the energy efficiency gap. We focus on contexts where both the quality offered by the energy efficiency provider and {{the behavior of the}} energy user are imperfectly observable. We first formalize under-provision of quality and compare two policy instruments: <b>energy-savings</b> insurance and minimum quality standards. Both instruments are second-best, for different reasons. Insurance induce over-use of energy, thereby requiring incomplete coverage in equilibrium. Standards incur enforcement costs. We then provide empirical evidence of moral hazard in the U. S. home retrofit market. We find that for those measures, the quality of which is deemed hard to observe, realized energy savings are subject to day-of-the-week effects. Specifically, energy savings are significantly lower when those measures were installed on a Friday—a day particularly prone to negative shocks on workers’ productivity—than on any other weekday. The Friday effect explains 65 % of the discrepancy between predicted and realized energy savings, an increasingly documented manifestation of the energy efficiency gap. We finally parameterize a model of the U. S. market for attic insulation and find that the deadweight loss from moral hazard is important over a range of specifications. Minimum quality standards appear more desirable than <b>energy-savings</b> insurance if energy-use externalitiesremain unpriced...|$|R

50|$|Two {{very similar}} {{measurement}} systems {{were created to}} bridge the scotopic and photopic luminous efficiency functions, creating a unified system of photometry.

40|$|Current core {{networks}} {{are composed of}} high-end routers which are connected by high-speed fibers. These optical connections are commonly over provisioned and in low utilization. Many of them are combined together to form bundle links or composite links and the component links {{are referred to as}} sublinks. These physical sublinks could be SONET connections, Ethernet circuits, wavelengths on a fiber, etc and they could be shut down or brought up independently. Selectively shutting down sublinks during low traffic periods could save a large amount of energy while keeping the network topology unchanged. Based on this concept, we propose a local heuristical threshold based method to explore the potential <b>energy-savings</b> in the backbone network by adjusting the number of active sublinks in bundle links. An experiment based on an Internet 2 derived synthetic network was conducted to verify the performance of our method and the results show that 86 % of energy consumed on ports of core routers could be saved when setting 90. 0 % as the link utilization threshold. The experiment also shows that setting 90. 0 % as threshold is safe enough to avoid data loss during extreme traffic increases in this case. Compared to previous proposed ILP (Integer linear programming) based global heuristic algorithms, our local heuristic algorithm can achieve <b>energy-savings</b> close to the optimum and greatly reduce the response time and the risk of data loss...|$|R
