K., from the entire city of Warszawa howeter 15 species had been reported (S t a r ę g a 1963). During the years of 1974 - 1975 while the extensive studies entitled „The fauna of the green areas of Warszawa as indicator of the condition of the en vironment ” had been carried out by the Institute of Zoology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, a new faunal element — Nelima semproni S z a l. has been discovered, a species formerly not reported from Poland. The research covered a variety of the municipal green areas: parks, lawns along the streets, green areas surrounding the settlements, etc. Of the various methods of collecting we will deal herein only with the pit-fall traps because all specimens of N. semproni had been taken tha t way. These traps (<b>glass</b> <b>cylinders</b> <b>4</b> cm. in diameter and 120 c. c. in capacity) were dug into the ground with an aid of an instrument which serves to take soil samples, and filled up to y 3 of their capacity with ethylene glycol as a preser vative. The traps were emptied every fortnight (with small variations). In this way continuity of captures was assured, which in 1974 commenced early in July and continued well into October. The pit-fall traps got arranged in rows, set one meter apart, about 10 - 15 on each green or lawn according to its size. In 1975 the research begun earlier, already in April but retaining th...|$|R

The experimental results led to the following conclusions: (a) the axial dispersion model (PD) is not able to give a satisfactory interpretation of liquid hydrodynamics; (b) the flow map of upflow multiphase reactors is not yet well enough defined, especially for small size packings; (c) the estimate of the pressure drop by correlations in the literature is sufficiently good; (d) solid-liquid contacting effectiveness is higher, on average, than in trickle-bed reactors, but it decreases with an increase in gas flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Bioprinting is {{a recent}} {{development}} in tissue engineering, which applies rapid prototyping techniques to generate complex living tissues. Typically, cell-containing hydrogels are dispensed layer-by-layer according to a computer-generated three-dimensional model. The lack of mechanical stability of printed hydrogels hinders the fabrication of high aspect ratio constructs. Here we present submerged bioprinting, a novel technique for freeform fabrication of hydrogels in liquid fluorocarbon. The high buoyant density of fluorocarbons supports soft hydrogels by float-ing. Hydrogel constructs of up to 30 -mm height were generated. Using 3 % (w/v) agarose as the hydrogel and disposable syringe needles as nozzles, the printer produced features down to 570 -lm diameter with a lateral dis-pensing accuracy of 89 lm. We printed thin-walled hydrogel <b>cylinders</b> measuring <b>4.</b> <b>8</b> mm in height, with an inner diameter of* 2. 9 mm and a minimal wall thickness of* 650 lm.

Cells grew vigorously and formed clonal colonies within the 7 -day culture pe-riod.
