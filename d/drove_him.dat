5|$|Ecgric's successor, Anna, {{acted as}} a {{challenge}} to the increasing power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> from his kingdom and into exile. Anna was strong enough to offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E
5|$|Foliot took an {{interest}} in the Dorset monastery of Cerne Abbey, which in 1145 received the Prior of Gloucester Abbey, Bernard, as abbot. Bernard was an active reformer, and Foliot supported Bernard's efforts, but the monks objected to the new abbot, and <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> out of the monastery. Both abbot and monks appealed to the papacy, which supported the abbot. Although Matilda wrote to Foliot, and interceded on behalf of the monks, Foliot pointed out that he was unable to disobey a papal command.|$|E

5|$|Spencer reached Fort Hamilton {{around the}} same time that Colonel William S. Hamilton arrived with a large group of Menominee who had volunteered against the Sauk and Fox. Afraid that the fort had also been attacked, Spencer retreated back into the woods. He avoided the fort for between six and nine days, when hunger finally <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> into the open where he {{realized}} his mistake.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and I (2003), a {{documentary}} by Danish director Anders Høgsbro Østergaard based on Numa Sadoul's 1971 interview with Hergé, includes restored {{portions of the}} interview that Hergé had heavily edited and rewritten in Sadoul's book. With full access to the audio recordings, the filmmaker explored the personal issues that the author had while he was creating Tintin in Tibet and how they <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> to create what is now regarded as his most personal adventure.|$|E
5|$|A few holdouts {{remained}} for a time. The island of Monemvasia refused to surrender {{and it was}} first ruled {{for a short time}} by an Aragonese corsair. When the population <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> out they obtained the consent of Thomas to place themselves under the Pope's protection before the end of 1460. The Mani Peninsula, on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of the local clans and then that area came under Venice's rule. The very last holdout was Salmeniko, in the Morea's northwest. Graitzas Palaiologos was the military commander there, stationed at Salmeniko Castle. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} with 33 laps to go. Busch <b>drove</b> by <b>him</b> on the backstretch to {{take the}} lead with 32 laps to go and drove on to score the victory.|$|R
6000|$|And {{during this}} same time Art began to call him-- [...] Pictures began to appeal to him. [...] Statues beckoned to him. [...] Music maddened him, [...] and any form of Recitation or Elocution <b>drove</b> [...] <b>him</b> beside himself.|$|R
60|$|But {{he did so}} at last, {{and went}} a little way to call up Holroyd. Then {{he went back to}} hail the cuberta. He ailed her again, and so she <b>drove</b> past <b>him.</b> Santa Rosa stood out clearly as her name.|$|R
5|$|Although he {{had given}} {{sanctuary}} to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> out, Malcolm was not {{directly involved in the}} ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at the battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} during the 590s, Rædwald married a woman whose name is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which {{is typical of the}} East Saxon dynasty. It has been {{suggested}} that Rædwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald's stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 297. Logano shot {{ahead of}} Kenseth {{to take the}} lead. Kenseth <b>drove</b> by <b>him</b> the next lap to retake the lead. Debris on the backstretch brought out the sixth caution of the race with 26 laps to go.|$|R
50|$|This was Dale Earnhardt's only career road course {{victory in}} Winston Cup competition. Coming {{to the white}} flag, Mark Martin hit oil and Earnhardt <b>drove</b> by <b>him,</b> took the lead and held off Martin for the victory (Martin had {{dominated}} the race).|$|R
60|$|A cab <b>drove</b> past <b>him,</b> {{and stopped}} {{before the house}} which he had just left. He looked behind, with a sudden feeling of almost passionate jealousy. It was Rochester, who had driven by him unseen, and who was now {{mounting}} the steps to her house.|$|R
5|$|Born in Sydney on 7 November 1944, Windle {{grew up in}} {{the eastern}} Sydney suburb of Waverley. Windle and his sister Norma learnt to swim at nearby Bronte Beach. His family later {{relocated}} to Bexley North, and he swam for his school team at Marist College Kogarah. Windle was coached by Frank Guthrie at the Enfield pool from the age of 12. After a fortnight of training, he entered the district age group championships and won a place in the top three. From then on, he began training {{three or four times a}} week, and his father <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> to Enfield for morning training. By the age of 15, he was training every day.|$|E
5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> against the wall. The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{the last}} charge went blindly, [...] And all too lost for fear: [...] The Danes closed round, a roaring ring, [...] And twenty clubs rose o'er the King, [...] Four Danes hewed at him, halloing, [...] And Ogier of the Stone and Sling [...] <b>Drove</b> at <b>him</b> with a spear.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the native}} Egyptian rulers {{installed}} by Esarhaddon {{were unable to}} retain full control of the whole country for long. Two years later, Taharqa returned from Nubia and seized control of a section of southern Egypt {{as far north as}} Memphis. Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa; however, he fell ill and died in his capital, Nineveh, before he left Assyria. His successor, Ashurbanipal, sent an Assyrian general named Sha-Nabu-shu with a small, but well trained army, which conclusively defeated Taharqa at Memphis and once more <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> from Egypt. Taharqa died in Nubia two years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 he was {{appointed}} the marriage registrar at the sharia court in Haifa by the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem, a role {{that allowed him to}} tour the northern villages, whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives. According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam was:An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at {{the ways in which the}} old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> eventually to take up arms and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the first 20 years of Ecgberht's reign, but {{it is thought that}} he was able to {{maintain}} the independence of Wessex against the kingdom of Mercia, which at that time dominated the other southern English kingdoms. In 825 Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia, ended Mercia's supremacy at the Battle of Ellandun, and proceeded to take control of the Mercian dependencies in southeastern England. In 829 he defeated Wiglaf of Mercia and <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> out of his kingdom, temporarily ruling Mercia directly. Later that year Ecgberht received the submission of the Northumbrian king at Dore. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle subsequently described Ecgberht as a bretwalda or 'wide-ruler' of Anglo-Saxon lands.|$|E

6000|$|He {{stopped as}} if it were {{unnecessary}} to go on, and the elder daughter said: [...] "He is on one of his sprees again.

5|$|Narayan {{performed}} in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received in both countries. His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall, Mumbai, {{was cut short}} when an impatient audience, waiting for performances by famous artists, <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> from the stage. Narayan pondered giving up the sarangi and becoming a singer. He later regained confidence, performed solo for smaller crowds, and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956. He has since performed at the major music festivals of India. Narayan later gave up accompaniment; this decision carried a financial risk because interest in solo sarangi was not yet substantial.|$|E
5|$|Philo of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was insane, but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait {{that came through}} experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him {{to think he was}} a god. Philo of Alexandria reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports he was given a magic potion that <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> insane.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} made on a {{production}} budget of about $15 million and shot {{in various parts of}} Los Angeles, California, beginning on September 25, 2010. Locations were picked by Refn while Gosling <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> around the city at night. At the director's request, Los Angeles was picked as the shooting location due to budget constraints. Refn moved into a plush Los Angeles home and insisted that the cast members and screenwriter Amini move in with him. They would work on the script and film all day, then watch films, edit or drive at night. Refn asked that the editing suite be placed in his home as well. With a shooting script of 81 pages, Refn and Gosling continued to trim down dialog during filming.|$|E

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 26 laps to go. After racing side-by-side {{for five}} laps, Keselowski powered by {{him on the}} outside on the backstretch {{to take back the}} lead with 21 laps to go. Busch <b>drove</b> underneath <b>him</b> exiting turn 4 to retake the lead with 19 laps to go. Keselowski <b>drove</b> underneath <b>him</b> in turn 2 to retake the lead with 16 laps to go. The fourth caution of the race flew with 12 laps to go for a single-car wreck in turn 1 involving Tony Stewart. “Casey Mears was watching and gave me plenty of room to get up there,” Stewart said. “So I figured it was better if I got to the top. Then three or four laps later I got loose into (Turn) 1, so I hadn’t been loose all day there. When I did, I over-corrected and got into the fence.” ...|$|R
