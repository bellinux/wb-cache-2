Syftet med forskningsstudien har varit att utforska hur revisorn upplever att välbefinnande inverkas av <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> strategin. Genom att titta på olika områden inom <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> strategin, externa och interna, ville vi utforska vilka områden inom <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> strategin som inverkar på revisorns välbefinnande. Därav blev vår forskningsfråga: ”Hur upplever revisorn att byråns <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> strategi inverkar på välbefinnandet?”. För att besvara syftet och frågeställningen intervjuades totalt fem revisorer från små till stora revisionsbyråer. Resultatet visade att respondenterna upplever att välbefinnande till stor del inverkades av <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> strategin. Slutsaten blir därmed att de interna områdena inom <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> strategin inverkar mest på revisorns välbefinnande.

This thesis first presents relevant literature on <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> and describes methodology used for the research. The empirical part {{of this study was}} conducted in March and April 2014. The first part of the research consisted of three in-depth interviews with three organizations from the IT-industry in Norway, varying in size and field of expertise. After that a questionnaire was distributed to 251 organizations within the Norwegian IT-industry to further investigate how <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> is viewed. The thesis then presents the findings from the in-depth interviews and the questionnaire, and discusses those in accordance to the research question and following sub questions. In the conclusion, the thesis argues that the lack of accurate measuring tools makes measuring <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> in financial terms close to non-existent in the Norwegian IT-industry.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} how <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> in an {{organization}} in Korea is understood and constructed by its employees. Three focal research questions are raised: (1) ‘how do employees understand <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> {{in the context of}} an organization in Korea?’(2) ‘which actors are the most influential in the employees’ perceptions of <b>employer</b> <b>branding?</b> and why?’ and (3) ‘how does the organization mediate societal logics and employees’ perceptions as a sensegiver?’ Drawing on a social constructionist approach though semi-structured interviews with employees and managers of a Korean organization, ‘growth obsession’ and ‘immanent individualism’ are identified as contradictory dimensions in employees’ perceptions of <b>employer</b> <b>branding.</b> The coexistence of these contradictory dimensions is understood in terms of contending logics of growth and individualism at the societal level. Employees’ growth obsession shows how deeply employees’ perceptions of <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> are embedded in the dominant logic of growth. Immanent individualism reflects the coexistence of the growth logic and the alternative logic of individualism, and suggests employees’ agentive capacity in making sense of their organization’s <b>employer</b> <b>branding.</b> This thesis also points out that the organization’s role as a sensegiver is limited, in contrast to the assumption, dominant in the existing literature, of <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> as an employer-driven strategy. The main theoretical contributions of the thesis lie in extending <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> literature by illuminating it from the perspective of contending logics. This approach shows how employees’ perceptions of <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> are tightly coupled with societal logics, and suggests considering the possibility of employees’ agency in enacting or rejecting the implications of these logics. Despite limitations in terms of generalizability, a rich and deep-rooted understanding of <b>employer</b> <b>branding,</b> situated in the context of the organization in Korea, is expected to provide a springboard for a more contextualized approach to <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> both in the academic area and in practice...|$|R

40|$|<b>Employer</b> <b>branding</b> is a {{strategic}} activity {{that has grown}} in popularity {{over the past two}} decades. Much {{progress has been made in}} investigating aspects of employer branding; however, many facets of the process, as it has been conceptualised in the research literature, remain empirically unexplored. The aim of this thesis is to get a deeper, more grounded understanding of <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> based on an investigation of <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> processes in practice. Four papers are presented, each providing a new perspective. In the first paper, industry experts&# 146; perceptions of the characteristics of successful and unsuccessful <b>employer</b> <b>brands</b> are used to arrive at a typology of <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> success. The typology is managerially relevant, providing a means by which firms may assess their <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> success qualitatively and quantitatively (based on metrics commonly used in practice). Further, theoretical contributions are made by establishing <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> as a context distinct from corporate and consumer branding, and by providing a basis for assessing variance between <b>employer</b> <b>brands.</b> In the second and third papers, the mechanisms that shape and perpetuate <b>employer</b> <b>brands</b> are explored. Individual (employee) and firm-related mechanisms drawn from the literature are empirically validated in the second paper using qualitative within-case analysis of four <b>employer</b> <b>brands.</b> The firms are from a broad range of industries and are characteristically successful (a pharmaceuticals and a financial services firm) and unsuccessful (a transport firm and a semi-government public utility). The case analysis results in the discovery of additional mechanisms relating to industry-level factors, not previously documented. These findings are built on in the third paper, where cross-case analysis of the same firms is used to establish a set of conditions that support or erode <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> success. Importantly, theory perspectives outside the traditional domain of marketing (i. e., human resources, organisational behaviour and strategy) are shown to be critical for understanding the process in practice. A taxonomy of generic market segmentation types is used in the fourth paper to investigate the application of market segmentation to <b>employer</b> <b>branding.</b> Market segmentation is shown to provide a useful link between <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> and broader strategic planning...|$|R

The concept of <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> is a popular recruitment strategy used by large companies or MNCs. However, researches {{on the effectiveness of}} Employer Brand-ing for SMEs are very limited. Thus, this research aims to study the role of <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> in SMEs, especially IT SMEs in Finland.

The theoretical framework is developed using concepts of Marketing (Lievens and Highhouse (2003)) and Strategic HRM (Barney 1991) and how they are connected within <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding.</b> Quantitative survey is utilised and 181 good responses were collected. The empirical findings suggest that <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> has positive influence on students' decision to apply for a job in SMEs but on the contrary, the correlation between instrumental and symbolic values of the <b>employer</b> <b>branding</b> to the attitude of the prospective student employees is weak.

In Finland research data about the state of <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> is not available. Thus, the primary contribution of this thesis to the current knowledge of the topic is to find out the position of <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> in Finnish companies today. The empirical part of the study is based on data collected in a web survey conducted in November 2008 - February 2009. The survey was created based on existing <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> literature and total sampling frame consisted of 190 Finnish companies that had a turnover of over 250 M€ and more than 250 employees in 2008. In total 45 applicable responses were received representing a response rate of 24 % of the sample. The results show that <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> does not have a particularly distinct position in large Finnish companies and, thus, respondents felt that <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> should have a more important role than it currently possesses in their companies. In fact, many companies are developing and researching <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> but resources allocated to the processes were not felt to reach an adequate level. Companies headquartered outside of Finland differentiated from these results as in those companies <b>Employer</b> <b>Branding</b> had more importance and adequate resources than in companies headquartered in Finland.
