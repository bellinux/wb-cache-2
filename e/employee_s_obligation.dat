40|$|VUCA {{represents}} a constantly changing environment - {{a set of}} timeless circumstances that challenge a leader s ability to make decisions, develop plans and execute these plans flawlessly on a daily basis. This research focused {{on the influence of}} leadership, organisational values and organisational change on employee engagement within a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. The construct leadership was further examined using two hierarchical levels, <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line manager and <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders to deepen the understanding of the influence these levels of leadership have on employee engagement A quantitative research approach was followed wherein a non-random convenience sample (N = 969) of permanent staff operating within the Retail Operations Specialities function of South Africa s largest non-food retailer participated in the study. Regression analysis was conducted to determine the strength {{of the relationship between the}} dependent (employee engagement) and independent variables for each research question. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to analyse the differences among group means and their associated procedures. <b>Employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders were found to have a stronger influence on <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> engagement levels in comparison to <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line managers. In addition the study found that the application of organisational values have a positive influence on employee engagement whilst organisational change was found to have the strongest influence on employee engagement explaining 41. 2 % of the variance in employee engagement. The findings of the study challenges the current body of research by identifying that within a VUCA environment when <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> leave the organisation they leave their senior leaders not their line managers.

40|$|The {{obligation}} to provide {{fair and equitable treatment}} to foreign investors and investments has existed {{as a concept}} of international economic law at least since the 1919 Covenant of the League of Nations. The fair and equitable treatment provision is a key protection contained {{in the vast majority of}} modern bilateral investment treaties. Tribunals adjudicating alleged breaches of these fair and equitable treatment provisions have not arrived at a uniform interpretation of the term. As a threshold issue, however each tribunal must address the question of whether a state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligations</b> under a given treaty 2 ̆ 7 s fair and equitable treatment provision will be additive or equal to the state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> preexisting <b>obligations</b> toward all aliens under the minimum standard required by customary international law. Some tribunals have responded to this question by announcing that the protections afforded under fair and equitable treatment provisions and customary international law have converged such that a state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligations</b> under either standard are coextensive. This Note contends that tribunals adopting the convergence approach overstate the protections afforded to investors under customary international law. By subsuming the {{obligation to}} provide fair and equitable treatment within customary international law, these tribunals also ignore the historical development of fair and equitable treatment as a solely treaty-based obligation that did not bind states as a matter of customary international law...|$|R

The argument is made that, generally, Canadian law should be interpreted consistently with Canada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligations</b> at international law, as reflected in conventions and custom. More specifically, the article proposes that Canada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligation</b> at international law to protect {{the family and the}} child be recognized in Canadian law as one of the principles of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Charter. The protection of the family is engaged by the deportation of domiciled aliens because, by definition, these deportees have been in Canada {{for a long period of}} time and have fully assimilated into Canadian society: deportation will, therefore, have an adverse impact on the aliens 2 ̆ 7 family life and their children. Indeed, the adverse effect of deportation on families and children is increasingly recognized, by courts and commentators, as a violation of internationally protected human rights. If the Canadian Charter is interpreted consistently with the growing body of law surrounding these international human rights, a compelling case can be made against the power of the State to deport domiciled aliens from Canada...|$|R
