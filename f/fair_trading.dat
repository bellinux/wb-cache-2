The NCC's product complaint included Apple's iLife as well as Microsoft's Office for Mac, and products by Corel, Adobe, Symantec, Kaspersky, McAfee, and others.

5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market {{because of concerns}} the takeover {{may not be in}} the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E

The diploma thesis analyses this phenomena, specifically in Czech <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> market. The attitude behaviour gap in the Czech <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> market {{was found to be}} in around third of the population, confirming the presence of the gap, which replicated the results of previous research in the field. From people with pro <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> values who do not buy <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> products, approximately half is not aware of <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> existence, indicating that lack of <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> awareness could be possibly hurting <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> sales.

Focus on raising awareness about <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> existence, improving quality perception and decreasing skepticism towards <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> conversion is suggested for <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> marketers for helping to convert people with pro <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> values into <b>Fair</b> <b>trade</b> buyers...|$|R

5|$|The TV rights {{agreement}} between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, {{and a number of}} court cases have arisen as a result. An investigation by the Office of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position. In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, who concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the {{significance}} of the protests was the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch, more commonly known as Manchester United Supporters' Trust today, by journalist Michael Crick. Working alongside IMUSA (Independent Manchester United Supporters Association), their joint aim was to seek a reference of the merger by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Both groups therefore submitted papers to the Office of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading,</b> stressing the importance of why the merger shouldn’t be carried out. IMUSA in particular argued that BSkyB’s main intention was not that of United’s but their already dominant position. Sky Television’s relevant market was premium subscription channels and by buying an established Premier League team when they already had rights to the division was purely for financial gain. Moreover, Manchester United’s market was on the pitch and an acquisition by a media organisation– particularly one run by Murdoch– may create detrimental damage to the sport in the long term.|$|E
5|$|GMG Radio {{was taken}} over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's {{purchase}} of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading</b> and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large {{as a result of the}} deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth. Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014.|$|E

5|$|The {{market for}} replica shirts has grown enormously, with the revenue {{generated}} for leading clubs {{and the frequency}} with which they change designs coming under increased scrutiny, especially in the United Kingdom, where the market for replicas is worth in excess of £200m. Several clubs have been accused of price fixing, and in 2003 Manchester United were fined £1.65m by the Office of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trading.</b> The high prices charged for replicas have also led to many fans buying fake shirts which are imported from countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. Nonetheless, the chance for fans to purchase a shirt bearing the name and number of a star player can lead to significant revenue for a club. In the first six months after David Beckham's transfer to Real Madrid the club sold more than one million shirts bearing his name. A market has also developed for shirts worn by players during significant matches, which are sold as collector's items. The shirt worn by Pelé in the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final sold at auction for over £150,000 in 2002.|$|E

40|$|This thesis answers some {{important}} {{questions about how}} <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> is experienced and perceived by some Northern sellers, consumers, activists, advocates, practitioners, and an importer. As it relates to sellers, I focus only on small scale independent businesses (i. e. I do not include large corporate businesses in my interview sample). <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> works to establish a dignified livelihood for many producers in the South. Some {{of the most important}} actors in the <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> movement are the people who buy, sell, and/or advocate for <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> in the North. <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> is largely a consumer movement which relies on the purchase of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> products. Without consumers purchasing <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> products, retailers providing the products for sale, and activists raising awareness of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade,</b> the movement, as it is presently constituted, would be non-existent. This qualitative research is based on 19 in-depth i. nterviews with nine interviewees involved with <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> in Canada. I focus on benefits, challenges, and limitations of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> {{in the context of their}} involvement with it. I describe and analyze how people become involved with <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade,</b> what motivates them to do so, what they hope to achieve, and the benefits of being involved. I also describe and analyze how people understand and deal with any challenges and limitations associated with their involvement with <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade.</b> I also explore whether involvement with <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> influences how people think about other products that they purchase and, if so, in what ways. I focus mainly on the commodity of coffee, but my discussion is not limited to this single commodity. Interviewees' experiences with and participation in <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> vary in terms of their level of involvement and interest in the broader <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> movement (as opposed to just participating in the market component).
