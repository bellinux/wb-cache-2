She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him.

500|$|Kripke instead {{favored the}} [...] "unique and {{structurally}} interesting" [...] self-enclosed episodes, which sometimes {{arose from the}} writers' unused ideas. From the series' beginning, Kripke desired to feature an evil clown because he felt that [...] "clowns in a context where they're {{not supposed to be}} are friggin' terrifying". To fit with the series, the clown became a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu mythology. This decision made the clown [...] "less satisfying", to Kripke's chagrin, because it limited the clown-related scenes. Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the story of Robert Johnson, which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer. He found the legend similar to Supernatural, noting, [...] "It's a piece of real life American history and folklore, it's an American horror story, it takes place on the dusty back roads of rural America, and it's <b>got</b> <b>great</b> music." [...] However, the lore takes place in the early 20th century, and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean. To circumvent this, writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more deals. Although Gamble envisioned the demon's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a Rottweiler, Kripke felt it would [...] "look stupid". The creature was instead made invisible, which Gamble believes gave it a more terrifying presence.|$|E
