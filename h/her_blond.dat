500|$|It was Madonna's idea {{to include}} the film as part of <b>her</b> <b>Blond</b> Ambition World Tour. Prior to the June 1990 {{theatrical}} release, Disney had already featured Dick Tracy in musical theatre stage shows in both Disneyland and the Walt Disney World Resort, using Stephen Sondheim and Danny Elfman's music. The New York Times also wrote in June 1990 of Disney Stores [...] "selling nothing but Tracy-related merchandise." [...] Max Allan Collins lobbied to write the film's novelization long before Disney had even greenlighted Dick Tracy in 1988. [...] "I hated the idea that anyone else would write a Tracy novel," [...] Collins explained. After much conflict with Disney, leading to seven different printings of the novelization, the book was released in May 1990, published by Bantam Books. It sold almost one million copies prior to the film's release. A graphic novel adaptation of the film was also released, {{written and illustrated by}} Kyle Baker. Reruns of The Dick Tracy Show began airing to coincide with the release of the film, but stations in Los Angeles and New York pulled and edited the episodes when Asian and Hispanic groups protested that the characters Joe Jitsu and Go Go Gomez were offensive stereotypes. A theme park ride for Disneyland, Disney-MGM Studios and Euro Disney Resort called Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers was planned but ultimately never built.|$|E

While shooting the film, Madonna began a relationship with Beatty, which dissolved by the end of 1990. In April 1990, Madonna began <b>her</b> <b>Blond</b> Ambition World Tour, which was held until August. Rolling Stone called it an [...] "elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza" [...] and proclaimed it [...] "the best tour of 1990". The tour generated strong negative reaction from religious groups for her performance of [...] "Like a Virgin", during which two male dancers caressed her body before she simulated masturbation. In response, Madonna said, [...] "The tour in no way hurts anybody's sentiments. It's for open minds and gets them to see sexuality in a different way. Their own and others". The Laserdisc release of the tour won Madonna a Grammy Award in 1992 for Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E

500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement.

She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, <b>her</b> <b>blond</b> hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{included}} {{the song in}} the set list of <b>her</b> <b>Blond</b> Ambition World Tour in 1990, which featured a version based on the Non-Stop Express remix of the song and included lyrics from [...] "Everybody" [...] during the introduction. The set was inspired by Metropolis and the themes {{were taken from the}} factory seen in the music video. It included a number of funnels billowing smoke, steel piping, cables hanging above and a flight of stairs in the middle. As the show started, the set was hurled onstage and Madonna's male dancers, with bare torso, appeared behind the steel structures. They did a choreographed routine on the stage, and towards the end Madonna appeared atop the flight of stairs. She was dressed in a pin-striped suit with holes cut in it, so that her brassiere pocked out of them. Underneath she wore a peach colored corset with a pointed conical bra, designed by Jean Paul Gaultier. She also held a monocle in her hand. Accompanied by her two female dancers dressed in a similar attire, Madonna did a straightforward vocal rendition of the track, and an elaborate choreography, which included voguing, , simulated masturbation and momentary storage of the performers' microphone inside their bras. At one point Madonna opened the suit, to reveal the corset with the bra, and tassels hanging from its sides. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Live! – Blond Ambition World Tour 90, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.

On October 18, 2003, the song was performed by Spears during the twenty-ninth season of the American comedy show Saturday Night Live. William Shaw of Blender stated, [...] "Dancing and singing, Spears is in her element. She drips song-and-dance confidence. Within a few seconds, her shiny hat falls off, sending <b>her</b> <b>blond</b> hair everywhere, but Spears doesn't miss a step. When it comes to Madonna's verse, she can't help mouthing along to the words." [...] Spears opened the 2003 American Music Awards telecast with a performance of [...] "Me Against the Music". She floated down on a wire from the rafters in a gold overcoat, which she quickly shed to reveal a pink bustier, black vinyl thigh-high boots and black hot pants.

Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice.
