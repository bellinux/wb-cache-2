500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, U.S. Senator and Republican presidential {{candidate}} Barry Goldwater {{was quoted in}} a Saturday Evening Post article by Stewart Alsop as saying, [...] "You know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> sell TVA." [...] He had called for the sale to private companies of particular parts of the Authority, including its fertilizer production and steam-generation facilities, because [...] "it would be better operated and would be of more benefit for more people if it were part of private industry." [...] Goldwater's Saturday Evening Post quotation was used against him in a TV ad by Doyle Dane Bernbach for President Lyndon Johnson's 1964 campaign, which depicted an auction taking place atop a dam. It was voiced over as follows: [...] "In a Saturday Evening Post article dated August 31, 1963, Barry Goldwater said, 'You know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> sell TVA.' This is a promise: President Johnson will not sell TVA. Vote for him on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home." ...|$|E

But we shouldn't set up special categories for anybody. [...] And I'm for the rights of everybody, including gays, but not any special rights." [...] He believes that, [...] "marriage is between a man and a woman, and I don't believe judges ought to come along and change that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Kindness {{has proved}} futile," [...] observes Frank, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> {{as a last}} resort, before {{yielding}} ourselves to despair, to use intimidation. Now, Fred," [...] he says, with sudden and terrible severity, [...] "what's your father's name?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In India, Stilwell {{soon became}} {{well-known}} for his no-nonsense demeanor and disregard for military pomp and ceremony. His trademarks were a battered Army campaign hat, GI shoes, and a plain service uniform with no insignia of rank; he frequently carried a Model 1903, [...]30-06 Caliber, Springfield rifle in preference to a sidearm. His hazardous march out of Burma and his bluntly honest {{assessment of the}} disaster {{captured the imagination of}} the American public: [...] "I claim we got a hell of a beating. We got run out of Burma and it is humiliating as hell. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> find out what caused it, go back and retake it.". Stilwell's derogatory remarks castigating the ineffectiveness of what he termed Limey forces, a viewpoint often repeated by Stilwell's staff, did not sit well with British and Commonwealth commanders. It was well known among the troops that Stilwell's disdain for the British was aimed toward those high command officers that he saw as overly stuffy and pompous.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, McCain said {{he would}} {{consider}} changing the U.S. military's don't ask, don't tell policy: [...] "The day that {{the leadership of the}} military comes to me and says, 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> consider seriously changing it." [...] In December 2007, McCain said he supported the policy, citing reports from military leaders that [...] "this policy ought to be continued because it's working." [...] In January 2010, when Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen – the top civilian and uniform leadership of the military – came out in favor of repealing the policy, McCain said he was [...] "disappointed" [...] by their stance: [...] "At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services, we should not be seeking to overturn the Don't ask, don't tell policy," [...] which he described as [...] "imperfect but effective." [...] McCain also criticized Gates for what he saw as an attempt to usurp Congressional authority over the policy. In December 2010, McCain voted against repealing the policy.|$|E
2500|$|Liberal Democrats: Leader Nick Clegg {{stated in}} 2009 that his party backs legalisation. On 4 July 2009, {{in an article}} for LabourList, Clegg wrote that [...] "although civil {{partnerships}} have been a step forward, until same sex marriage is permitted {{it is impossible to}} claim gay and straight couples are treated equally." [...] Following this, the party's LGBT rights group LGBT+ Liberal Democrats launched a petition [...] "Marriage Without Borders" [...] calling for all gender restrictions on marriage and civil partnerships to be lifted, and for same-sex relationships to be recognised across Europe and internationally. The petition was run at Manchester Pride and Reading Pride in 2009, and launched online in January 2010 following an interview with Clegg in Attitude magazine in which he reaffirmed his commitment to equal marriage. However, this did not make it into the party's manifesto. In an interview in July 2010 Lib Dem deputy party leader Simon Hughes confirmed that the coalition Government plans to open marriage to same-sex couples, saying, [...] "It would be appropriate in Britain in 2010, 2011, for there to be the ability for civil marriage for straight people and gay people equally... The state ought to give equality. We’re halfway there. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be able to get there in this parliament".|$|E

2500|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{candidates}} agreed {{with one another}} about most of the issues discussed. [...] One exception came near the end when Cynthia Tucker asked, [...] "Does the U.S. {{have a role to}} play in ending the genocide in Darfur?" [...] All the candidates except Paul answered in the affirmative, though most ruled out using U.S. troops. [...] Huckabee added that we also need to address [...] "the infanticide in our own country, with the slaughter of millions of unborn children." [...] Paul opposed even sending food, and added, [...] "we should direct our attention only to national security, and not get involved for these feel-good reasons of going overseas for the various reasons, and this is the main reason why <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> just come home from every place in the coun-, from every place in the world." [...] Keyes replied, [...] "I have to say I'm appalled by the suggestion that we retreat into some kind of Fortress America, and forget who we are. [...] We are a nation of nations, a people of many peoples. [...] We are in touch with every people on the face of the earth. [...] If somebody's is being hurt somewhere in the world, somebody in America grieves for them. [...] And I don't believe we can turn our backs on that universal significance, that universal mission... We don't have to send troops, but we need to support and reinforce the sense of local regional responsibility for both humanitarian and military order in that region." ...|$|E
