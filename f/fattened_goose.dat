[...] - The global {{increase}} in liver production {{indicates that the}} demand for this unique product will probably remain on the long term. Production, however, will probably be re-structured in favour of cheaper fattened duck liver. Goose liver {{on the other hand}} will remain the top segment within the fattened liver segment. Hungary - the second largest liver producer after France - will be interested in producing both. Hungary has been a global leader in goose liver production for decades but can expect to see new competitors (e. g. China) in worldwide liver trade. Additionally, the increased duck liver production in other countries may also {{make it more difficult to}} export Hungarian liver products. As fattened liver (foie gras) cannot be produced in any other way than the way it is currently done the present requirement of relevant labelling of products made from fattened geese and ducks is the correct solution due to the ever stronger animal welfare movements. This provides customers with fair information, allowing them to make a choice of purchasing of refusing such products. It would be useful to use appropriate tools of communication to make consumers aware that <b>fattened</b> <b>goose</b> liver is a traditional product of Hungary, which has a unique quality. There are serious social interests (jobs, industry) and economic benefits (export revenue) attached to preserving this industry. To protect the entire liver industry and improve the image of fattened liver it would be possible and necessary to refute extreme and baseless criticism of the production of fattened liver by raising awareness of production technologies which promote animal welfare. libamÃ¡j, kacsamÃ¡j, mÃ¡jpiac, mÃ¡jfogyasztÃ¡s, Ã¡llatjÃ³lét, goose liver, duck liver, liver market, liver consumption, animal welfare, International Relations/Trade, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|E

40|$|SummaryMedical {{etymology}} sometimes provides unexpected {{information about}} health concepts and medical practice in {{different times and}} cultures. We conducted an etymological analysis of the terms used to indicate “liver” in Germanic and Romance languages. The Greek word “hèpar” was originally connected {{to the concept of}} “pleasure”, showing that in antiquity the liver was considered to be the seat of soul and human feelings. In Romance languages, the Latin term “ficatum” was linked to the ancient practice of <b>fattening</b> <b>geese</b> with figs (ficus in Latin) to make their livers more delicious. This relationship between the liver, fat, and carbohydrates seems to indicate that ancient gourmets had clear knowledge of the nutritional mechanisms underlying “fatty liver” in animals. On the other hand, the Germanic term “lifere” was initially connected to “life”, underscoring the relation of the liver to health and existence. In the Early Modern Age, the liver became a recurring image in political reflection, especially within the Elizabethan tradition of the body politic, where the king was frequently described as the “liver” of his country. Finally, the liver was used to indicate courage, or the lack of it: some modern French and English idiomatic expressions derive from the ancient belief that people who had no blood in their liver (“lily-livered”) would thus be cowards or betrayers...|$|R

2500|$|Foie gras ( [...] , French for [...] "fat liver") is {{a luxury}} food product made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been {{specially}} fattened. By French law, foie gras {{is defined as the}} liver of a duck or <b>goose</b> <b>fattened</b> by force-feeding corn with a feeding tube, a process also known as gavage. In Spain and other countries outside France it is occasionally produced using natural feeding. [...] Ducks are force-fed twice a day for 12.5 days and geese three times a day for around 17 days. Ducks are typically slaughtered at 100 days and geese at 112 days.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Indians {{enter into}} the Cueva del Guacharo once a year, near midsummer, armed with poles, by means of which they destroy {{the greater part of}} the nests. At this season several {{thousands}} of birds are killed; and the old ones, as if to defend their brood, hover {{over the heads of the}} Indians, uttering terrible cries. The young, which fall to the ground, are opened on the spot. Their peritoneum is extremely loaded with fat, and a layer of fat reaches from the abdomen to the anus, forming a kind of cushion between the legs of the bird. This quantity of fat in frugivorous animals, not exposed to the light, and exerting very little muscular motion, reminds us of what has been long since observed in the <b>fattening</b> of <b>geese</b> and oxen. It is well known how favourable darkness and repose are to this process. The nocturnal birds of Europe are lean, because, instead of feeding on fruits, like the Guacharo, they live on the scanty produce of their prey. At the period which is commonly called at Caripe the [...] "oil harvest," [...] the Indians build huts with palm-leaves near the entrance, and even in the porch of the cavern. Of these we still saw some remains. There, with a fire of brushwood, they melt in pots of clay the fat of the young birds just killed. This fat is known by the name of butter or oil (manteca or aceite) of the Guacharo. It is half liquid, transparent without smell, and so pure that it may be kept above a year without becoming rancid. At the convent of Caripe no other oil is used in the kitchen of the monks but that of the cavern; and we never observed that it gave the aliments a disagreeable taste or smell.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the counts}} or their fiefholders, {{by way of}} the Schultheißen and with help from the Vögte, drew income owed by the peasants. This was destined partly for themselves, but also partly for their lords, the Waldgraves. These {{payments}} were what would be called taxes today. The heftiest among these was der große Zehnt - “the great tithe”. The knight’s Vogt came by horse right onto the field and set aside the ten best sheaves for the lord. All other obligations had been laid down long before in the municipality’s Weistum. These were read out yearly on New Year’s Day, the day when the thing was held. The lordship needed everything, from hay for horse fodder to honey for their dining tables to beeswax for their candles. It goes without saying that they also needed goose feathers, flax and finished linens, along with eggs, <b>fattened</b> <b>geese</b> (for Martinmas), and also Shrovetide chickens, flitches of bacon and smoked meat, all of which had to be delivered on particular days throughout the year. The lord’s tithe barns with their cellars and storage rooms are still in living memory in Löllbach. Older villagers remember that one stood in what is now Karl Herrmann’s garden. It may well have reached across the modern street, Schweinschieder Weg, for behind the municipally owned memorial square is today still found a cellar from the old Kyrburg landhold. The other tithe barn stood in what is now the Family Paulus’s small front garden, just outside the school windows. It, too, would have been of quite a size. Der kleine Zehnt - “the little tithe” - had to be paid, for example, on the occasion of a wedding, while after a family head’s death, the so-called Besthaupt (“best head”) was payable, wherein the heirs took the best head of livestock from the stable - meaning the one that was worth the most - to be paid as a kind of death duty. It should not be overlooked that the exact terms of taxation were not always pursued with the utmost insistence. There are known cases in which judicious lords supported the bereaved with benevolence and charity in special cases. Responsible for oversight and management {{under the terms of the}} Weistum was the Schultheiß. Above him was the Oberamt administration in Kirn. His yearly remuneration was 12 Rhenish guilders, 5 Albus, 8 Malter of corn (likely either wheat or rye), three Malter of oats; he was also accorded personal and material freedom. If the taxes were manifold and high, more burdensome still was the unfree labour also laid down in the Weistum. The lord’s livestock grazed on the “Herrenwasem”. Parts of this field were also laid out as a cropfield. It was the lord who reaped the field’s yield, but the peasant was the one who did all the unpaid work. The same was true over at the “Herrenberg”, the lord’s vineyards. Indeed, all work in the fields and vineyards was done as compulsory labour on the lord’s orders, and it was overseen by the Vogt (reeve). One only needs to look carefully at the land to see clearly where the pond could have lain. There, the lord’s carp were big, and at Shrovetide, the pond was fished clean to fill the lord’s table. Of course, all the fishing and other jobs done at the pond were also unfree work. It is likely that the reeve and the count guessed that this work led to the odd carp landing on a peasant’s table. Unfree labour done for the lord came before one’s own farming, of course, meaning that the peasants’ own harvest was often rained out or because of the inevitable neglect otherwise spoilt. Even the unfree workers’ food and drink were often laid down in the Weistum. Everything done for the lord was unpaid: building the lord’s castle; repairing walls and paths; transporting stone; lugging the tithes to the Kyrburg; supplying young boys and girls to work at the castle; running the lord’s errands from castle to castle.|$|R

50|$|The Chinese or Lop-Eared cat is most interesting, {{because it}} {{provides}} proof that by continual disuse of an organ, the organ withers. With the Chinese cat the hearing and ears have deteriorated. Michel says the Chinese, not only admire the cat in porcelain, but also value it for culinary reasons. The cats are regarded as special morsels and enjoyed particularly with noodles or with rice. This cat is bred particularly {{for the purpose of}} meat production, and is a preferred Chinese morsel; this is not unusual if one considers that the Chinese consume much the sight of which revolts the stomachs of Europeans. The poor creature is confined in small bamboo cages and <b>fattened</b> like a <b>goose</b> on plentiful portions. There is extensive trade with other parts of Asia and the canny Chinese allow no tomcats to be exported so there is no interference in this lucrative source of income.Due to the restrictive conditions that have deprived the cat of its actual use, its hearing has decreased because it is no longer needed for hunting its own food. With no need for watchfulness, it had no need of sharp hearing to listen for hidden things so its hearing became blunted and as a natural consequence its ears lost their upright nature, gradually becoming lower and becoming the hanging ear that is now the characteristic feature of the Chinese cat. At first impression this is a surprising and amusing look, but this impression is lost with closer examination. If one ignores the characteristic of the ears, one sees a beauty similar to the Angora cat: a long, close coat of hair, albeit less rich, covers the body. The hair is silky-soft and shining and the colour is usually isabelline or a dirty white yellow, although some have the usual colouring of the common house-cat. In size it is considerably larger and stronger than a housecat. The ears hang completely, as with our hunting dogs and are large in relation to the cat.Although the Chinese cat is found in considerable numbers in its homeland, it is rarely found at European animal markets. Only one such cat has reached us in the flesh; we acquired this years ago when a sailor returning from China brought it into Hamburg. The accompanying illustration is based on this cat. In character it is like the Angora cat and somewhat languid. It prefer to live by a warm fire, is rather sensitive to flattery, hears badly and is at its most animated when given milk or food. Apart from its unusual ears, it has no really attractive characteristics and is a curious specimen of housecat.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the origin, we know from deconstruction, is problematic. The differantial logic of the trace suspends any pursuit of it, {{inviting}} us instead (as if {{there really is a}} choice) to succumb to its play. Within universities we have explained the postmodern to our children but haven't done it very well. Or perhaps we have done it too well. They interactively embrace the idea that knowledge precedes them and are aware that scholarship is a tissue of interconnected, reflexive quotations. For many of the bright young things that pass through our halls of learning, writing an essay {{is not so much a}} discipline of research and composition as a language game; the permutation of an archive of readymade words and phrases on the myriad topics likely to be encountered in any course of study you care to name. To essay something is not an attempt, a speculation, the trying out of new ideas. It is a process of assembling, or rather dissembling, like a model that you put together, without having any role in its design. All the big guys are quoting other people, so what's the buzz? And the French ones don't even cite the sources they quote anyway. Our students have read their Calvino and can spot a combinatory process a mile away. They got all the hip theoretical references in The Matrix. Postmodern Theory 101 has its avatars and its messages are clear: knowledge, like everything else in hyperreality, is an appearance adrift from the real, a simulacrum. Get with it and get over it. Neo doesn't have to learn Kung Fu as a discipline of mind and body, refining its motor skills and philosophical wisdom from years of training at the local dojo. He just 'knows Kung Fu', having acquired its techniques as store-bought second nature, programmed from a simulation package that does the work for him. In other words, his expertise is not grounded in any actual effort on his part. Wicked. Does this sound jaded? I can't tell any more. It's certainly not meant to be. What do we expect of our students when we force-feed them on diets of Baudrillard, Lyotard and Derrida like so many <b>fattened</b> foie gras <b>geese?</b> As with the logos, they have taken us at our word. Go forth and appropriate. And then we sting them for plagiarism. Within universities plagiarism is without question public enemy number one. Plagiarism is defined and applied in the academy as the unacknowledged use of someone else's ideas and/or words as if they are your own (unlike their customers, our learned line managers aren't hip to allusion, pastiche, collage, sampling and the cut-up-fold-in method). In the long and venerable tradition of belles-lettres there is an unspoken ethics and integrity associated with original research. If you use secondary sources or paraphrase them it is the scholarly and ethical convention to acknowledge them appropriately. 1 The imprimatur of these principles (“best practice” in today's parlance) is the signature of the author. To name is to mark writing with an unimpeachable authority, quod scripsi scripsi. In signing off on an essay, we presume that our students make a pledge in the name of presence. The signature is their seal of authenticity, the confirmation that their written words originate from the fount of their internal resources. But writing is far from being a reliable guarantor of originality and our students know this. Anyone can forge a signature and a plagiarised essay presented in your name is a consequence of the signature effect. It is, in every sense of the word in this context, the mark of an absent presence...|$|R
