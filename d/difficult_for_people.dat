25|$|Davis' {{personality}} {{was often}} described as aloof and his political style cautious and calculated instead of charismatic. His personality forced him to depend more on political skills, such as fundraising, to win elections. Davis' tendency to micromanage his administration made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to present opposing views and even drove some out of service.|$|E

Feeding refers to all aspects of eating and drinking, including getting food and liquids to the mouth; swallowing refers to ingestion or what happens after food or liquids enter the mouth. Primary goals for feeding and swallowing are safe, adequate, and enjoyable mealtimes.|$|E

Often it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to find {{themselves}} a plane ticket off of the island. Sometimes costing $1200 dollars for a round-trip ticket. PenAir having a monopoly over the town has caused {{them to be able}} to charge people overpriced tickets.|$|E
25|$|With {{the closing}} of these state mental {{institutions}} {{it has become increasingly}} <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> who suffer from severe mental illness to receive treatment in a facility. Many mentally ill individuals were left homeless after deinstitutionalization, making up one-third of the homeless population (D.E. Torrey). Today the most prominent treatment for the severely mentally ill is incarceration in a correctional facility, where mentally ill individuals are not receiving adequate care for their disorder.|$|E

Trains on the Kelana Jaya LRT line coming into the city from Kelana Jaya, which normally stop at Pasar Seni and Masjid Jamek, instead bypassed those stations, going from KL Sentral directly to Dang Wangi Station. Passengers were not given any warning of this and many did not realise they {{would not be able to}} stop at these stations until the train was already on its way to Dang Wangi or Sentral.|$|E

Sometime before 4.00 p.m., Jackson and Hanna headed back to Northern Ireland in the poultry lorry after the latter had given the final instructions to the drivers of the car bombs. Upon their return, Jackson and Hanna {{went back to the}} soup kitchen they were running at a Mourneville, Lurgan bingo hall. With the UWC strike in its third day, it was extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> throughout Northern Ireland to obtain necessities such as food.

25|$|The 1879 {{constitutional}} convention also {{dispatched a}} message to Congress pleading for strong immigration restrictions, {{which led to the}} passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. The act was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1889, and it would not be repealed by Congress until 1943. Similar sentiments {{led to the development of}} the Gentlemen's Agreement with Japan, by which Japan voluntarily agreed to restrict emigration to the United States. California also passed an Alien Land Act which barred aliens, especially Asians, from holding title to land. Because it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> born in Asia to obtain U.S. citizenship until the 1960s, land ownership titles were held by their American-born children, who were full citizens. The law was overturned by the California Supreme Court as unconstitutional in 1952.|$|E

25|$|Gerbert {{learned of}} Hindu–Arabic digits and applied this {{knowledge}} to the abacus, but probably without the numeral zero. According to the 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, Gerbert got {{the idea of the}} computing device of the abacus from a Spanish Arab. The abacus that Gerbert reintroduced into Europe had its length divided into 27 parts with 9 number symbols (this would exclude zero, which was represented by an empty column) and 1,000 characters in all, crafted out of animal horn by a shieldmaker of Rheims. According to his pupil Richer, Gerbert could perform speedy calculations with his abacus that were extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> in his day to think through in using only Roman numerals. Due to Gerbert's reintroduction, the abacus became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Body image {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> {{to live up to the}} standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s body image, some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor body image. However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E
25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I really know of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem {{that they do not}} know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It {{is important to recognize that}} intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E

500|$|Historically the Western Ghats were well-covered {{in dense}} forests that {{provided}} wild foods and natural habitats for native tribal people. Its inaccessibility made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> from the plains to cultivate {{the land and}} build settlements. After {{the arrival of the}} British in the area, large swathes of territory were cleared for agricultural plantations and timber. The forest in the Western Ghats has been severely fragmented due to human activities, especially clear felling for tea, coffee, and teak plantations during 1860 to 1950. [...] Species that are rare, endemic and habitat specialists are more adversely affected and tend to be lost faster than other species.

500|$|Jenny's {{character}} was unpopular with both fans and critics {{throughout the entire}} series because of her frequent narcissistic tendencies, her prima donna ways, her egotistical attitude, irresponsibility, frequent self-pity and selfish persona. She has also been labeled a [...] "love to hate" [...] character. The majority of critics have been intrigued by her [...] "polarising personality" [...] and branded {{it as one of}} the main reasons to watch the series. New York magazine gave a large amount of praise to Jenny and on one occasion stated: [...] "Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show." [...] Kirshner received critical praise for her portrayal of the character. Kirshner has stated she loved playing Jenny because she felt like a brand new character during each season.

500|$|Small {{islands of}} trees growing on land raised between [...] and [...] above sloughs and prairies are called {{tropical}} hardwood hammocks. They may range from one (4,000m²) to ten acres (40,000m²) in area, and appear in freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, or pineland. Hammocks are slightly elevated on limestone plateaus risen several {{inches above the}} surrounding peat, or they may grow on land that has been unharmed by deep peat fires. Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees, such as Southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba), royal palm (Roystonea), and bustic (Dipholis salicifolia) that grow in very dense clumps. Near the base, sharp saw palmettos (Serenoa repens) flourish, making the hammocks very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to penetrate, though small mammals, reptiles and amphibians find these islands an ideal habitat. Water in sloughs flows around the islands, creating moats. Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover.
