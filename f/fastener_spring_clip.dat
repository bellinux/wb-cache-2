These systems are particularly useful to control movements caused by wind or tree growth, however they are the used less often, due to the natural limits of the systems.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the rail}} {{fastening}} systems {{play an important}} role for preserving the connection between the rails and sleepers in various conditions. In this paper, stress based concept is used to develop a comprehensive approach for fatigue reliability analysisof fastening <b>spring</b> <b>clip.</b> Axle load, speed and material properties are assumed to be random variables. First, track and train models are analyzed dynamically in order to achieve displacement time history of fas-tening <b>spring</b> <b>clip.</b> Then this displacement time history is applied to the fastening <b>spring</b> <b>clip</b> in FE software to obtain variable ampli-tude of stresses. Crack nucleation life is calculated by rain-flow method and Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule. First Order Relia-bility Method (FORM) and Monte-Carlosimulation technique are employed for the reliability index estimations. The influences of various random variables on the probability of failure are investi-gated by sensitivity analysis. The results show that the equivalent stress range and material parameter have significant effect on fa-tigue crack nucleation...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of agronomic practices on forage production and chemical composition of grass-legume pasture mixture was {{studied at the}} Utah State University Dairy Farm, North Logan, Utah, during spring and summer, 1970. The soil is a well-drained Millville silt loam that has about a 1 percent slope. It is high in potash, phosphorus, and lime, having a pH of 7. 9. Analysis of the clipping management showed that the early <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> decreased the yield of forage. The losses in total yield due to <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> were approximately {{four to five times}} the yields received in early <b>spring</b> <b>clipping.</b> The grasses were affected more than the legumes. The yields of dry forage increased with the increase in fertilizer rates from 0 through 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre. There was no advantage to splitting the nitrogen fertilizer of 300 pounds per acre into three applications. Most of the effects of spring clipp 1 ng and nitrogen fertilization were re fleeted in the first summer harvest. The plots fertilized with nitrogen produced a higher yield and nitrate content than the check plots. Legumes were higher in nitrate on the unfertilized plots than the grasses, but lower on the fertilized plots...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the influence of cutting treatments on the yield and quality of non-irrigated alfalfa in western Oregon. <b>Spring</b> <b>clipping</b> treatments included (1) not clipped, (2) clipped when 6 inches high and (3) clipped when 12 inches high. The hay harvest criteria were (1) near full light interception by the vegetative canopy, (2) crown bud stage and (3) one-tenth bloom stage. Combinations of these criteria included first hay harvest based on light interception followed by either of the other criteria at subsequent harvests, and first harvest based on crown bud development in combination with one-tenth bloom criterion for subsequent harvest. Two alfalfa varieties, Vernal and Du Puits, were subjected {{to each of the}} 18 treatments (6 x 3 in all combinations). Results of one growing season indicated that the influence of <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> was not reflected in yield of dry matter (hay) except at the relatively small third harvest when <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> showed a deleterious effect. The yields obtained by the <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> were sufficient to offset the reduction at the third hay harvest. It was observed that the total yields for the season did not differ. Cutting at the one-tenth bloom stage showed an advantage in yield but with a greatly reduced crude protein percentage. Cutting on the basis of nearly complete light interception resulted in harvest at an immature stage in early May and at a very mature stage in late season. Highest yields, with leafiness and crude protein suitable for high quality hay, were obtained by cutting at the crown bud stage throughout the season, or by taking the first harvest on the basis of light interception and subsequent harvests on the basis of either crown buds or one-tenth bloom. The varieties produced approximately the same total for the season. Vernal was slightly leafier than Du Puits at the second and third hay harvests. A highly significant negative correlation was found between yield of dry matter and percentage protein and between yield of dry matter and leaf-stem ratio. The correlation between percentage protein and leaf-stem ratio was significant and positive...|$|R

50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension pin or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining <b>fastener.</b> <b>Spring</b> pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R
