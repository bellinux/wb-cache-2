5|$|To {{help him}} out, Bart gets Buck {{a job on}} Krusty the Clown's show, but Buck gets drunk and makes a <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself on air, {{crushing}} Bart. Seeing this, Marge and Homer decide to help Buck overcome his alcoholism, so they clean out Buck's house and enroll him in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Despite making progress, Buck is not restored to hero-status for Bart.|$|E
5|$|After Bart and Lisa see Krusty the Clown do {{his show}} at the Mt. Splashmore water park on TV, they {{consistently}} irritate and supplicate Homer about going there. Homer gets annoyed, but reluctantly decides to take them there. The family goes to Mt. Splashmore, where Bart, Lisa and Homer ride an intense water slide named H2WHOA!. Due to his weight, Homer gets lodged in the water slide mid-course and the park's rescue crew are forced {{to shut down the}} ride and remove him {{with the help of a}} large crane. Homer is made a <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> on the news for his massive size and admits that he needs to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E

50|$|The series {{consists}} of two parts, Kuulsuse narrid (Estonian for <b>Fools</b> <b>of</b> Fame) and Raha narrid (<b>Fools</b> <b>of</b> Money). The first part is widely known; the second part was suppressed as inconvenient during Soviet occupation and is consequently little known.|$|R

25|$|David is {{a failed}} comedian and rocker who also fails {{to grasp the}} notion of {{political}} correctness. He tends to either make a <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> {{himself in front of}} the office crew or make it intensely uncomfortable. The one who seems to enjoy him the most is Sam Bisaillon, former army cadet who worships David. He shares his desk with Louis Tremblay, who is secretly in love with the shy receptionist Anne Viens. The problem is that Anne is engaged to Luc, a macho warehouse employee.|$|E

25|$|Feste {{was almost}} {{certainly}} written for Armin, as he is a scholar, a singer, and a wit. Feste's purpose is to reveal the foolishness of those around him. Lear's fool differs from both Touchstone and Feste {{as well as from}} other clowns of his era. Touchstone and Feste are philosopher-fools; Lear's fool is the natural <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> whom Armin studied and wrote. Armin here had the opportunity to display his studies. The fool speaks the prophecy lines, which he tells—largely ignored—to Lear before disappearing from the play altogether. Lear's fool is hardly around for entertainment purposes; rather, he is present to forward the plot, remain loyal to the king, and perhaps to stall his madness.|$|E
25|$|After Superman IV in 1987, Reeve's {{relationship}} with Exton fell apart, and they separated. He moved to New York without his children. He became depressed {{and decided that}} doing a comedy might be good for him. He was given a lead in Switching Channels. Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner had a feud during filming, which made the time even more unbearable for Reeve. Reeve later stated {{that he made a}} <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself in the film and that most of his time was spent refereeing between Reynolds and Turner. The film did poorly, and Reeve believed that it marked the end of his movie star career. He spent the next years mostly doing plays. He tried out for the Richard Gere role in Pretty Woman but walked out on the audition because they had a half-hearted casting director fill in for Julia Roberts.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} in the 1590s, Armin joined a company of players patronised by William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos. With this company, about which little is known, he is presumed to have {{travelled}} from the western Midlands to East Anglia. The nature of his work for the company may be estimated from his parts in The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke. The preface to the 1609 quarto indicates that he played Blue John, a clown in the vein of Tarlton and Kempe; he also seems to have doubled in the role of Tutch, a witty <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> the type he later played in London. The late quarto is associated with a revival by the King's Revels Children, a short-lived troupe of boy players led by Nathan Field, but it was almost certainly written around 1597.|$|E

25|$|The War Committee {{had only}} agreed (28 December 1915) with some {{reluctance}} to make {{preparations for the}} Western Front Offensive agreed at Chantilly, which Haig and Joffre agreed (14 February) {{should be on the}} Somme, although Robertson and the War Committee were not pleased at Joffre’s suggestion that the British engage in “wearing out” attacks prior to the main offensive. For three months, against a backdrop of Russia planning to attack earlier than agreed, Italy reluctant to attack at all and the scaling-down of the planned French commitment because of Battle of Verdun, Robertson continued to urge the politicians to agree to the offensive. He increasingly believed that France was becoming exhausted and that Britain would carry an ever greater burden. After Robertson promised that Haig “would not make a <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> himself” (he told Repington that Haig was “a shrewd Scot who would not do anything rash”), the War Committee finally agreed (7 April).|$|E
25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Harold Spuller {{was inspired by}} Shiban's enjoyment of the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. [...] In fact, Spuller's friend Chuck Forsch is played by Sydney Lassick, who appeared in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as one of Jack Nicholson's fellow patients. Steven M. Porter, who portrayed Spuller, was invited to audition for the show by writer Frank Spotnitz. According to Porter, after the audition {{he felt that he}} had [...] "either made a great impression or a complete <b>fool</b> <b>of</b> myself". Many of the gestures that Porter used in the episode were inspired by his appearance in a play called Asylum.|$|E
