We show that under certain conditions, points with high Local Outlier Factor (LOF) have their value <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projected</b> space lower bounded <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> original LOF.

500|$|In {{the context}} of this debate, music writers have {{interpreted}} Illmatic as an admonishment for hip hop purists and practitioners. In the opening track, [...] "The Genesis", Nas bemoans the lack of legitimacy among other MCs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects,</b> insisting that he has [...] "Been doin' this shit since back then." [...] Citing songs such as “Life's a Bitch”, Guthrie Ramsay Jr. argues that Nas “set a benchmark for rappers in an artistic field consumed by constantly shifting notions of 'realness', authenticity, and artistic credibility." [...] Sohail Daulatzai writes: [...] "Though Illmatic was highly anticipated release, far from under the radar, Nas's taking it back to 'the dungeons of rap' was…a kind of exorcism or purging ('where fake niggas don’t make it back') that was at the very least trying to claim a different aesthetic of resistance and rebellion that was all too aware of hip-hop's newfound mainstream potential." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{technology}} used in constructing skyscrapers continued to develop. Time was increasingly a factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects,</b> and architects and their specialist teams developed faster ways {{to design and}} construct the buildings to minimise the interest payments during construction and hasten the arrival of rental income. By 1930, skyscrapers were being erected in just 12 months by teams of workers totalling 5,000 men, with four floors being assembled in a typical week. Building skyscraper towers involved some adaption of engineering techniques, as effectively two different buildings were being designed – the base and the tower – which needed to be efficiently linked using elevators and other service facilities. Most new offices settled around a standard size, [...] wide by [...] deep, depending on {{the height of the}} ceiling, with multiple small windows considered better than a few larger ones. The output of electric lighting continued to improve, although this began to give off excessive heat within the offices. Air conditioning was first installed in a few skyscrapers during the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|When {{depicting}} life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects,</b> Nas alternates from {{moments of}} pain and pleasure to frustration and braggadocio. The columnist for OhWord.com wrote: [...] " [...] narrative voice swerves between personas that are cynical and optimistic, naïve and world-weary, enraged and serene, globally conscious and provincial". Music writer Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork describes the [...] "enduring image" [...] often associated with Nas's narrated stream of consciousness: [...] " [...] baby-faced Buddha monk in public housing, scribbling lotto dreams and grim reaper nightmares in dollar notebooks, words enjambed in the margins. The only light is the orange glow of a blunt, bodega liquor, and the adolescent rush of first creation. Sometimes his pen taps the paper and his brain blanks. In the next sentence, he remembers dark streets and the noose." [...] Critic and blogger Kenny Waste comments on the significance of Queensbridge as a setting in Illmatic, writing, “The songs are made up largely of recollections or Nas describing his emotions, which range from feeling trapped to overt optimism about his abilities to escape the 'hands of doom'. But they always remain {{within the walls of}} his Queensbridge home.” ...|$|E

The project is funded by the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation of the U.S. State Department. Before the project a steel structure was installed around the cathedral, said to prevent its cracked sandstone walls from collapsing. The WMF and its Turkish partner, the NGO Anadolu Kültür, say they will work on [...] "stabilization and protection" [...] of the cathedral. Turkey's Minister of Culture Ertuğrul Günay stated [...] "We hope that giving new life to the remains of once-splendid buildings, such as the Ani Cathedral and church, will bring new economic opportunities to the region." [...] Armenian officials responded with skepticism. According to Gagik Gyurjyan, president of ICOMOS-Armenia, the Turkish Ministry of Culture rejected the preliminary agreement between Anadolu Kültür and the Armenian side to engage Armenian experts in restoration works. Osman Kavala, president of Anadolu Kültür, stated that the lack of formal bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey may have prevented Armenian experts from being included in the project. Kavala stated in a 2011 interview that an estimated $1 million would be spent on the project, which was scheduled to start in 2012 and end in 4 years. Yavuz Özkaya, an architect who participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> carried out in Ani, stated in March 2014 that studies on preservation and restoration of the cathedral were completed and they had begun to be implemented.
