5000|$|Chaceon quinquedens, {{commonly}} known as the Atlantic <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>red</b> <b>crab,</b> or simply Atlantic red crab or red crab is a <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> in the Atlantic Ocean off the East coast of the U.S. state of Virginia. [...] According to the Virginia Pilot, the species resembles a snow crab from Alaska. Size-wise, the crab is about five to seven inches across the back of the shell and weighs about one to two pounds. [...] The crab is available from North Carolina to Nova Scotia along the east coast. Many fishermen catch these as a by-catch in their lobster pots. By chance, one of the fishermen tried cooking it and [...] "discovered how tasty one was". [...] The crab had only started getting popular in the year 2013 and is making a name for the Hampton Roads area as a sustainable seafood business adding one more seafood option to the area.|$|E

On their bellies, they often display photophores producing low grade light. For a predator from below, looking upwards, this bioluminescence camouflages the silhouette of the fish. However, some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the (red deficient) ambient light, leaving the bioluminescence visible.|$|R

40|$|Abstract OnlyThe Atlantic <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> (Chaceon quinquedens) is {{the target}} of a small, {{directed}} fishery in the Northeast US, which has been managed using total allowable annual catches (TACs) at the fleet level since 2002. Although not a catch share fishery, it shares many of the same features, behaviors, and advantages, which are summarized here. In an examination of the fishery, vessel trip reports and dealer data were analyzed to assess fleet behavior and evaluate changes in the industry. The five vessels in the fishery established a cooperative, and share profits and coordinate landings. Rather than export their landings to a single buyer in Canada, as has been the practice in the past, the industry invested in a shore side processing facility, enabling the development and marketing of products to serve a wider range of buyers. Vessel trips are coordinated and staggered so that crab catches are continuously provided to the processing facility, guaranteeing a steady supply of fresh products. In 2009, the industry obtained certification from the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) in an effort to improve marketability and appeal to consumers. In 2010, the industry began collaboration with Slade Gorton to handle all sales and improve access to a wider range of international markets...|$|E

40|$|The {{blue and}} red shrimp Aristeus antennatus and the giant red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea are among the major {{economic}} resources in the Mediterranean Sea and represent the main target of the western and central Mediterranean <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> (400 800 m) fisheries. In this paper, data on abundance (both number and biomass) of A. antennatus and A. foliacea resulting from the MEDITS surveys from 1994 to 2004, carried out with common protocols in seven Mediterranean FAO GFCM Geographical Sub Areas (GSAs), have been analyzed using standardized methodologies. Both red shrimps species occur almost exclusively on the “meso bathyal” stratum (500 800 m). The distribution pattern appears quite different for the two species, but no significant trends in density and biomass (neither at geographical nor at temporal level) could be detected. Sardinia shows the highest abundance for both species, although with some local negative tendencies along time. A very high interannual variability was detected in all areas. Comparing the present results to those recorded by Cau et al. in 2002, a more or less stable status of the <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>red</b> shrimps stocks was observed, which is not an encouraging finding when considering the reduction in fishing capacity and the management measures adopted by the EU in recent years...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OnlyThe {{notion of}} {{individual}} transferable quotas (ITQs) has permeated the fisheries economics literature {{over the last}} 40 years. The most long-standing prediction about ITQs has been extensively documented, namely that transferable property rights to harvest induce changes along the extensive margin via consolidation of quota among {{a smaller number of}} vessels. However, behavioral changes along the intensive margin as harvesters adjust their fishing practices in response to ITQ incentives have been relatively neglected. We use the 2005 introduction of ITQs to the Bering <b>Sea</b> <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> fishery as a platform to decompose the sources of rent generation across both extensive and intensive margins. We develop a conceptual model of the crab harvesting production process that captures the principle decisions made by the skipper and crew throughout a fishing season with respect to traveling to and from fishing grounds and the process of setting and lifting traps. We also depict the decision-making environment under pre- and post-ITQ settings by modeling a limited entry and an ITQ fishery as two different symmetric games played between all participating harvesters in the fishery. Using multiple treatments in a hypothetical experimental setting, we show that the effects of introducing ITQs are potentially multi-faceted, non-monotonic, and at times contrary to prior expectations. For the crab fishery we find that the bulk of rents were generated by consolidation across the extensive margin...|$|R

40|$|The <b>red</b> land <b>crab,</b> Gecarcoidea natalis, is {{endemic to}} Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Although {{the biology of}} adult crabs, {{including}} the seaward migration and spawning, has been well studied the obligate marine larval phase is poorly understood. Surface plankton tows using a 500 μm net were conducted monthly over 14 months, at three sites on the north coast of Christmas Island, to investigate the composition, abundance and seasonal variation of the plankton and to ascertain the presence of <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> zoea in the plankton.

The <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> (Paralithodes camtschaticus) is a highly valuable resource that also represents a potential threat since it is an alien invasive species in the Barents Sea ecosystem. This thesis explores the use of different interdisciplinary frameworks to analyse how ecological, social and economic concerns could be accounted for in deciding on how the king crab should be managed in the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea. Clarification of terminology used in invasion biology and systematisation of ecological information in order to establish the ecological knowledge base for management forms the basis for further analysis. Bio-economic modelling and discourse analysis are used to explore how uncertainty and the range of services the ecosystem provides can be incorporated in management. Finally the use of ecosystem service frameworks to integrate ecosystem and social science research in ecosystem based management is discussed. 	 							The ecological review revealed numerous knowledge gaps in our understanding of how the king crab interacts with native biota. It also identified negative impacts on benthic ecosystems that provide supporting services, and on provisioning services through predation on eggs of commercial fish. Bio-economic analysis illustrated the need to identify the correct relationship between crab stock size and ecosystem damage. It also showed that optimal harvest of king crab cannot be reconciled with the Barents Sea management goal of securing the ecosystem structure. The discourse analysis showed that people recognise both positive and negative impacts of the crab on supporting, provisioning and cultural services. In addition the impacts on ecosystem services {{we do not have the}} knowledge to value today, or option values, were important in forming people’s perception on how the crab should be managed. 	This thesis demonstrates that while the natural sciences have a clear role to play in establishing the ecological knowledge base, uncertainty and the need to account for stakeholder concerns calls for integration of social science research in the management process. Ecosystem service frameworks can be useful tools for identification, integration and evaluation of such information...|$|R
