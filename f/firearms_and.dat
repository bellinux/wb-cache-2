5000|$|The recoil of a firearm, whether {{large or}} small, {{is a result}} of the law of {{conservation}} of momentum. Assuming that the <b>firearm</b> <b>and</b> projectile are both at rest before firing, then their total momentum is zero. Assuming a near free-recoil condition, and neglecting the gases ejected from the barrel, (an acceptable first estimate), then immediately after firing, conservation of momentum requires that the total momentum of the <b>firearm</b> <b>and</b> projectile is the same as before, namely zero. Stating this mathematically:where [...] is the momentum of the <b>firearm</b> <b>and</b> [...] is the momentum of the projectile. In other words, immediately after firing, the momentum of the <b>firearm</b> is equal <b>and</b> opposite to the momentum of the projectile.|$|R
