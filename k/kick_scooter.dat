50|$|Nitro World Games is {{an action}} sports {{competition}} held annually since 2016 at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salk Lake City, featuring freestyle motocross, BMX, <b>kick</b> <b>scooter</b> and skateboard competitions.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{quick-release}} {{mechanisms are}} also used to operate seatpost clamps, and the collapsing stem of folding bicycles and <b>kick</b> <b>scooters.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{increasing}} {{variety of}} personal transporters are being manufactured, including the one-wheeled self-balancing unicycles, self-balancing <b>scooters,</b> electric <b>kick</b> <b>scooters</b> and electric skateboards.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} scooters today have two hard small wheels, are made {{primarily}} of aluminum and fold for convenience. Some <b>kick</b> <b>scooters</b> have 3 or 4 wheels, or {{are made of}} plastic, or are large, or do not fold. High performance trickster scooters made for adults resemble the old [...] "penny-farthing" [...] with much larger wheel in front. Electric <b>kick</b> <b>scooters</b> differ from electric scooters in that they also allow human propulsion, and have no gears. Range is typically about 5 km, and maximum speed is around 30 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Unlike a <b>kick</b> <b>scooter,</b> {{a bicycle}} has {{a seat and}} drive train, which add speed, cost, weight and bulk. A folding scooter can be more easily carried than a folding bicycle or even a {{portable}} bicycle. Even a non-folding scooter is easier to manoeuvre between obstacles, as there are no protruding pedals. Thus a cyclist has advantages in longer journeys and open spaces, and a <b>kick</b> <b>scooter</b> in shorter and more crowded ones. Kick scooters seldom have a luggage rack, so the rider usually carries any cargo on their back.|$|E
50|$|On 30 May 2006 The Colmarien Pascal Couffin {{beat the}} world hour {{record for the}} <b>kick</b> <b>scooter</b> at the Ladhof Stadium. In all, he {{traveled}} 17 kilometers and 188 meters.|$|E

25|$|Except for {{the local}} {{ambulance}} van and the small firetrucks, the only motor vehicles on the island are electrically powered and used primarily for moving material. <b>Kick</b> <b>scooters</b> are sometimes used as substitutes for bicycles.|$|R
50|$|Mopeds, {{electric}} bicycles, {{and even}} electric <b>kick</b> <b>scooters</b> are a simple {{form of a}} hybrid, powered by an internal combustion engine or electric motor and the rider's muscles. Early prototype motorcycles in the late 19th century used the same principle.|$|R
50|$|Bicycles can {{be brought}} on the ferry or rented {{seasonally}} on land and used on the island's main roads. Electric scooters and Segways can also be rented. Due to the terrain, roller skates, roller blades, skateboards, <b>kick</b> <b>scooters,</b> and personal Segway scooters are prohibited.|$|R
5000|$|Nicole Lavana Tieri (born 1980) is an American {{singer and}} actress {{who was a}} {{contestant}} on American Idol in 2004, where she arrived at auditions on a <b>kick</b> <b>scooter,</b> which earned her the nickname of [...] "Scooter Girl".|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} <b>kick</b> <b>scooter</b> is {{a personal}} transporter consisting of two small inline wheels connected by a standing platform with foldable handlebars. The rider can either rely on the electric motor or using their feet as with a kick-scooter.|$|E
50|$|The tailwhip is a bike trick {{typically}} {{performed on}} a BMX, {{in which the}} frame of the bike performs a complete rotation around the front end (bars and forks), which remains stationary throughout the move. The same trick may also be performed on a <b>kick</b> <b>scooter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{personal}} transporter (also personal light electric vehicle, {{personal mobility}} device, electric rideable [...] ) {{is a new}} class of compact portable electrically-powered electric vehicle for transporting an individual at speeds that don't normally exceed 25 km/h, which includes electric skateboards, electric <b>kick</b> <b>scooters,</b> self-balancing unicycles and Segways.|$|R

50|$|An {{electric}} <b>kick</b> <b>scooter</b> {{is a small}} {{platform with}} two or more wheels that is propelled by an electric motor. The most common scooters are light weight with two small hard wheels and fold for convenience. There are also larger non-folding standing devices and non-folding devices with seats.|$|E
50|$|A {{motor scooter}} is a {{motorcycle}} {{similar to a}} <b>kick</b> <b>scooter</b> with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels. The United States Department of Transportation defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests, and has a step-through architecture.|$|E
50|$|Pedestrian zones have a {{great variety}} of {{approaches}} to human-powered vehicles such as bicycles, inline skates, skateboards and <b>kick</b> <b>scooters.</b> Some have a total ban on anything with wheels, others ban certain categories, others segregate the human-powered wheels from foot traffic, and others still have no rules at all. Many Middle Eastern kasbahs have no wheeled traffic, but use donkey-driven or hand-driven carts for freight transport.|$|R
50|$|The Mini125_100 has 100 mm {{diameter}} wheels, {{the smallest}} {{in the world}} on a riding bicycle. Made of high-rebound polyurethane, they achieve low rolling friction despite the small diameter. Another model, Mini125_p, features pneumatic tires for riding in historic city districts. The Mini125 was originally designed with roller ski wheels, the only 100 mm quality polyurethane wheels then available. Polyurethane <b>kick</b> <b>scooters</b> wheels became available during development. Since inline speed skates began using larger wheels, such as 100 mm and 110 mm, the Mini125 can use those.|$|R
2500|$|On 15 May 2017, an MU-2B-40 Solitaire, {{registration}} N220N, {{disappeared from}} radar about 37 {{miles east of}} Eleuthera while en route from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to Titusville, Florida. Debris from the aircraft was found by United States Coast Guard search and rescue teams the next day about 15 {{miles east of the}} island. Jennifer Blumin, founder and CEO of Skylight Group, her two young children, and her boyfriend and pilot of the aircraft Nathan Ulrich, co-founder of Xootr <b>kick</b> <b>scooters</b> and ex-husband of Rae Dawn Chong were on board and are presumed to have perished in the crash.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} Xootr {{go back to}} 1999, when Karl Ulrich, Nathan Ulrich, and Tom Miner (along with {{partners}} Lunar Design and Cheskin Research, and several other investors) founded Nova Cruz Products. Nova Cruz designed, manufactured and sold the Xootr <b>kick</b> <b>scooter,</b> the Xootr eX3 electric scooter, and the Voloci electric motorbike.|$|E
50|$|At low speeds {{a bicycle}} is {{difficult}} to control while pedalling, which is why cyclists occasionally kick their way through dense traffic or in other conditions where they cannot {{take advantage of the}} speed of their machine. Thanks to the superior low-speed stability of a <b>kick</b> <b>scooter,</b> it is allowed on many footpaths where riding a bicycle is forbidden.|$|E
5000|$|Active mobility, Active Travel or Active Transportation, {{is a form}} of {{transport}} of people and sometimes goods, that only uses the physical activity of the human being for the locomotion. The most known forms of active mobility are walking or cycling, though other mobility means such as the skateboard, <b>kick</b> <b>scooter</b> or roller skates are also a form of active mobility.|$|E
5000|$|Xootr (pronounced [...] "zoo-ter") is a {{manufacturer}} of folding <b>kick</b> <b>scooters</b> and folding bicycles. [...] Xootr scooters are characterized by 180 mm polyurethane wheels with aluminium hubs, and a hand brake for the front wheel (for the rear on old models). Compared to the other folding scooters with smaller wheels, these larger wheels provide an easier ride, {{at the expense of}} a somewhat less easy portability. The hinge is distinguished from competitors in being locked by inserting a pin, rather than by a cam or other latch. The platform is large enough for adults, and available in plywood, magnesium, or aluminum at different prices.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kick</b> <b>scooters</b> {{have been}} {{handmade}} in industrial urban areas in Europe and the U.S. {{for at least}} 100 years, often as play items made for children to roam the streets. One common home-made version is made by attaching roller skate wheel sets to a board {{with some kind of}} handle, usually an old box. One can lean to turn, or by a second board connected by a crude pivot. The construction was all wood, with 3-4 inch (75-100 mm) wheels with steel ball bearings. An additional advantage of this construction was loud noise, just like from a [...] "real" [...] vehicle. An alternative construction consists of one steel clamp - on roller skate divided into front and rear parts and attached to a wood beam.|$|R
5000|$|The riding {{performance}} of portable bicycles is {{challenged by the}} need to make the bike as small and as light as possible. Rider body weight and size, and road conditions have a strong impact on design and on performance. Typically, portable bicycles intended for the East Asia market (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, ...) can be designed for riders lighter than 80 kg and shorter than 174 cm. Northern Europe and America require designs for riders up to 120 kg and 200 cm. City roads are generally smoother in Asian cities, but the bicycle {{has to be able to}} ride in crowded city sidewalks. Many European city streets are paved with cobblestone, so portable bicycles marketed in Europe need to cope with such a pavement. The smaller the diameter of a bicycle wheel, the higher the rolling friction and the rougher the ride, which is a challenge for portable bicycles as well as for <b>kick</b> <b>scooters.</b> New technological solutions are being studied to offer the same rolling friction at smaller wheel diameters.|$|R
50|$|Z5 is an {{electrically}} powered, motorized, 2-wheel standing scooter with upright handle, {{similar to}} a <b>kick</b> <b>scooter.</b> It is foldable like other airwheel series and has a modular battery design interfacable with USB ports and mobile phones to either charge the scooter or charge the mobile phone from the scooter battery. Z5 is, by design, an urban commuter and a bicycle replacement.|$|E

40|$|We {{live in an}} {{interesting}} age full of mind-numbing technical advancements and funny contradictions. Contradictions like last Christmas where the two hottest must-have gifts were the Sony PlayStation 2 and Razor <b>kick</b> <b>scooters.</b> It’s ironic in this computer age with corporate predictors saying that low-voltage audio information appliances are {{the next big thing}} that a completely mechanical device consisting of a platform, a stick and two wheels was just as popular {{as one of the most}} sophisticated computers ever developed. Another interesting contradiction is being able to obtain audio off the Internet from thousands of different sources, being able to store hours of fullbandwidth audio in a low-cost Web access device, with no moving parts, not much bigger than a package of gum, only to have it sound not much better than your best friend next door yelling at you through a tin can and waxed string. Okay, it’s not that bad. But it can be a lot better. Let’s look at the class of low-voltage audio devices called Information (or Internet, both are used interchangeably) appliances (IA) 1, and let’s define them as anything connected to the Internet other than a PC that includes audio.

40|$|Throughout the United States, {{there has}} been a {{dramatic}} increase in the varieties and numbers of nonmotorized users on trail and roadway facilities. <b>Kick</b> <b>scooters,</b> inline skates, hand cycles, recumbent bicycles, and other emerging users are now commonly seen sharing space with bicycles and pedestrians on roadways and shared use paths. Urban trail operators are reporting operational and safety problems associated with the increasing number of emerging users and their operational needs. User groups are petitioning State legislatures and local governments to legally operate their nonmotorized vehicles on roadways. The guidelines provided in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Guide to the Development of Bicycle Facilities are based on the physical dimensions and operating characteristics of bicycles only and may not meet the needs of emerging trail users. To address these issues, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) sponsored this study to better understand the physical dimensions and operational characteristics of an increasingly diverse group of nonmotorized trail and roadway users. The results of this study can be used to help design professionals adequately design roadway and shared use path facilities to meet the operational and safety needs of a more diverse group of users...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} some European cases {{referred to}} promotion of soft mobility {{as a new}} lifestyle oriented to improve benefits on environment and urban livability. Soft mobility refers to human powered displacement (HPM) and represents a particular component of passenger traffic, it is particularly associated with pedestrian traffic, hiking, cycling as well as getting around on vehicle-type devices (such as inline skates, <b>kick</b> <b>scooters,</b> etc.). Promoting this kind of sustainable transport needs interventions both on physical and functional system. On one hand cities have to provide specific attractive, safe and integrated facilities whose realization could be an opportunity of urban requalification; {{on the other hand}} they have to dispose political actions to improve soft mobility use. European context is characterized by high disparity among countries in the use of soft mobility applied to urban displacement in spite of a prolific production of laws and roles referred to the emergency of adopting new ways of moving to minimize negatives impacts generated by car dependence also in urban short distance. The use of soft mobility for short displacement especially referred to leisure and tourism activities could represent an occasion both to promote special measures to create better condition in urban life and to improve integration between territorial transformation and mobility management achieving higher level of urban quality life. The cases shown in this paper underline that promotion of soft mobility affect both territorial and urban level giving a chance toward new ways of enjoying urban and territorial resources...|$|R
