5|$|Stevenson opposed {{almost every}} effort to expand blacks' rights beyond the {{minimums}} assured by federal amendments and legislation. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 guaranteed that blacks could testify against whites in federal courts, but he opposed New Departure Democrats when they insisted that Kentucky amend its laws to also allow black testimony against whites in state courts, and the measure <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1867 legislative session. Later that year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, but a federal court soon overturned that decision. Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats' appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. By 1871, however, he had {{changed his mind and}} supported blacks' right to testify. Despite Stevenson's support, the measure <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly again in 1871, but it passed the following year, after Stevenson had left office.|$|E

5|$|A left-arm medium-pace seam bowler, Toshack was {{a member}} of the first-choice team, and played in the first four Test matches before succumbing to a {{persistent}} knee injury. Toshack contained the English batsmen with leg theory in between the new ball bursts of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. He took 11 wickets in the Tests; his most notable performance was the 5/40 he took in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's. However, his knee <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first innings of the Fourth Test when he took 1/112. He was unable to bowl in the second innings and missed the Fifth Test, marking the end of his Test career.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight <b>failed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E

All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lords.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Allan Webb {{resumed his}} stage {{career with the}} role of Count Almaviva in the 1946 Sadler's Wells {{production}} of The Marriage of Figaro. In 1947 he appeared in the original run of the Vivian Ellis musical Bless the Bride, and made several further stage appearances in the following two years. During this time he had a brief affair with the actress Sydney Malcolm, for which Gibbons quickly forgave him. He left the theatre in 1949 to become a director of a book club specialising in special editions, and later bought a bookshop in the Archway district of London. His health <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1950s and in 1958 he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver. He died in July 1959 at Oakshott Avenue.|$|E

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, however, Cloutier spent the season mostly inactive until signing with EC KAC of the Austrian Hockey League on January 20, 2005. Replacing injured starter Andrew Verner, he appeared in 13 games with the Klagenfurt-based team, going undefeated with a 1.94 GAA. EC KAC finished the regular season second with the second-best record in the league. Cloutier appeared in 10 additional playoff games, recording a 2.75 GAA. EC KAC advanced to the finals, where they were defeated four-games-to-three by the Vienna Capitals.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} KPA defense {{halted the}} Marines who responded with artillery, raking Cloverleaf Hill.

Kippax was the third selector on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next two tour matches, so he missed out on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E
5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} {{the apex}} of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state antitrust law and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting women's suffrage, <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House by a single vote.|$|E
