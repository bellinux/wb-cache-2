5|$|Lemur diets {{are highly}} {{variable}} and demonstrate {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Iowa is {{the second}} studio album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. Released by Roadrunner Records on August 28, 2001, it was {{produced}} by Ross Robinson and Slipknot. The title derives from the band's home state, Iowa, which members have stated <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> greatest sources of inspiration. With much anticipation for the band's second album following {{on the success of}} their 1999 self-titled debut, pressures on the band were high. Their relationships with each other suffered and was later described as the darkest time of their career. It was also the first time that guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved in a Slipknot album as Root was only featured on two songs from their debut album, due to his joining very late in recording of that release. Despite troubles within the band and with Iowas development, Slipknot promoted it for almost a year.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E

5|$|The {{preservation}} of these fossils <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms, they would normally not fossilize and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota {{such as the}} Burgess Shale or Solnhofen Limestone, the Ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was something very different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures {{to be left behind}} and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived. Their preservation was possibly enhanced by the high concentration of silica in the oceans before silica-secreting organisms such as sponges and diatoms became prevalent. Ash beds provide more detail and can readily be dated to the nearest million years or better using radiometric dating.|$|E

25|$|Plasma {{polymers}} can {{be thought}} of as a type of graft polymers since they are grown off of a substrate. These polymers are known to form nearly uniform surface deposition, which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> desirable properties. Polymers formed from this process often cross-link and form branches due to the multiple propagating species present in the plasma. This often leads to very insoluble polymers, which gives an advantage to this process, since hyperbranched polymers can be deposited directly without solvent.|$|E

25|$|Since the mid-20th century many {{scholars}} like Marian Wenzel, the world's once leading {{authority on the}} art and artifacts of medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina, concluded that the stećci tombstones were a common tradition amongst Catholic, Orthodox and Bosnian Church followers alike. Wenzel's conclusion supported other historians' claims that they reflect a regional cultural phenomenon rather than belonging to a particular religious faith.

25|$|The group {{formally}} meets Diana {{who they}} learn has a frail body and has lost her will to live. Diana {{has the power}} to glimpse into the future and see people's fates but Shinjiro eventually convinces her that even if the circumstances look dire, she can fight her destiny and give her a new path to follow. Diana joins the Star Division and helps them repel an attack by Yumedono, a vain woman who wants to engulf New York in insects. After losing a duel with Subaru, Shinjiro is forced to perform on stage as a new star called Peppermint. Subaru questions why Shinjiro is able to succeed even though he is flawed. Subaru opens herself up to the group eventually recognizing everyone's importance in her life, including Shinjiro's. The Star Division repels an attack led by Tsugarubi, who resents women and steals their life essence turning them into stone. Soon, after learning about the Five Star Warriors, Shinjiro recruits Gemini to the Star Division due to her ties to the Five Star Warriors. But in discovering that Ranmaru <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> enemies, Gemini's sister Geminine—who resides in her body as an alter-ego—plots to exact revenge for her master's death. Shinjiro persuades Geminine not to go through with it.

500|$|Culturally, the album's {{glorification of}} teenage freedom {{made a very}} big impact on the overall Britpop music scene.

Though it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> most popular songs, the band rarely play [...] "Alright" [...] in their live sets any more. In a 1999 interview, Gaz Coombes joked, [...] "We don't play 'Alright' anymore. We should play it in a minor key, and in the past tense." [...] Around the time of its release Coombes said that [...] "it wasn't written as an anthem. It isn't supposed to be a rally cry for our generation. The stuff about We are young/We run green... isn't about being 19 but really 13 or 14 and just discovering girls and drinking. It's meant to be light-hearted and a bit of a laugh, not at all a rebellious call to arms." [...] Danny Goffey noted, [...] "It certainly wasn't written in a very summery vibe. It was written in a cottage where the heating had packed up and we were trying to build fires to keep warm." ...|$|E

500|$|At least 700 {{grizzly bears}} are {{believed}} {{to exist in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which includes Shoshone National Forest, with approximately 125 grizzlies in the forest. The grizzly is listed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the forest <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> last strongholds. For what are considered to be [...] "nuisance bears", non-lethal traps are set to capture them {{so that they can be}} relocated to remote areas, away from civilization. In the case of the grizzly, each captured bear is tranquilized and then ear tagged with an identifying number. Each number is registered, and if the bear continues to return to areas where they pose a risk of imminent threat to human safety, they are exterminated. The grizzly recovery efforts implemented by federal agencies have often resulted in major disagreements with local landowners and surrounding municipalities. This situation occurs less frequently with the smaller and less aggressive black bear. An active management program, in conjunction with other National Forests and National Parks within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, works cooperatively to maximize human safety and to ensure habitat protection for both species of endemic bears. Visitors are mandated to store their food in their vehicles or in steel containers found in campgrounds, and bear-proof trash receptacles are located in the front-country zones throughout the forest. In the backcountry, food must be stored some distance from campsites, and other related precautions are enforced to help prevent bad encounters.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Robert Christgau said Meddle {{was a fairly}} good progression over the group's previous work and featured folk songs highlighted by unique melodies, although he lamented the lyrics to [...] "A Pillow of Winds": [...] "The word 'behold' should never cross their filters again". In his critique of [...] "Echoes", he believed the lyrics imitate [...] "Across the Universe" [...] by the Beatles but over 23 minutes of music that flows with a [...] "timeless calm" [...] similar to [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Daryl Easlea of BBC felt it is a similar, but more consistent and tuneful version of Atom Heart Mother highlighted by [...] "Echoes", which he said [...] "dominates the entire work" [...] and is [...] "everything right about progressive rock; engaging, intelligent and compelling". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield said [...] "Echoes" [...] showed Pink Floyd {{to be a more}} developed group than before, [...] "coloring the slow guitar ripples with deep-in-the-studio sonic details that only the truly baked would notice, much less appreciate." [...] Writing for AllMusic, editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Meddle the best album from their transitional years leading up to The Dark Side of the Moon, as it [...] "spends most of its time with sonic textures and elongated compositions, most notably on its epic closer, 'Echoes'". He noted a [...] "uniform tone", but not song structure, and wrote of the album's significance in the group's catalogue: [...] "Pink Floyd were nothing if not masters of texture, and Meddle <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> greatest excursions into little details, pointing the way to the measured brilliance of Dark Side of the Moon and the entire Roger Waters era." ...|$|E
500|$|Flynn has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from film critics.

Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies lauded Flynn as [...] "a hero invested with enough colour to liven up {{what could have}} been a monochromatic role". Margot Harrison of Seven Days concluded that the character is [...] "better than a prince". Meanwhile, Amy Nicholson of Inland Empire Weekly reviewed the character as a significant improvement upon traditional Disney heroes, writing, [...] "If anything, Tangled is hommepowerment—one more step forward in Disney's slow march to treat male suitors like equals, from its early nameless princes ... to here, a dude with a full-on personality and nearly equal screen time." [...] Tyler Hanley of the Palo Alto Weekly observed that [...] "Flynn talks in a laid-back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable". Ian Bunting of the Daily Record concluded that although [...] "Male characters sometimes get shortchanged in Disney movies ...

Jeff Meyers of the Metro Times dismissed Flynn as not [...] "all that heroic". The Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli quipped that Flynn's [...] "sensitive chin fur, and the way he talks out of the side of his mouth [...] makes him look like Dick Cheney at a poetry slam". The Los Angeles TimesKenneth Turan believes that the film's [...] "initial shakiness" [...] is [...] "amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of" [...] Flynn. Accusing the character of [...] "lacking both superficial and emotional individuality", Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star panned Flynn as [...] "rather obnoxious", Dan Kois of The Village Voice dismissed him as [...] "vanilla". Flynn's narration has also been widely panned. Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referred to it as [...] "flippant". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described it as [...] "annoyingly smart-alecky". Justin Chang of Variety described the character's opening monologue as [...] "clunky". William Goss of Moviefone compared Flynn to [...] "a modern-day Chris Evans/Pine type, and his glib narration [...] combined with a hasty prologue [...] almost makes it feel like writer Dan Fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys' AND girls' club". However, Goss relented, [...] "The voice-over tapers off, though, and Levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to the neurotic love interest." ...|$|E
