40|$|The {{pitch of}} stimuli was studied under {{conditions}} where place-of-excitation was held constant, and where pitch was therefore derived from "purely temporal" cues. In experiment 1, the acoustical and electrical pulse trains consisted of pulses whose amplitudes alternated between a high {{and a low}} value, and whose interpulse intervals alternated between 4 and 6 ms. The attenuated pulses occurred after the 4 -ms intervals <b>in</b> <b>condition</b> A, and after the 6 -ms intervals <b>in</b> <b>condition</b> B. For both normal-hearing subjects and cochlear implantees, the period of an isochronous pulse train equal in pitch to this " 4 - 6 " stimulus increased from near 6 ms at the smallest modulation depth to nearly 10 ms at the largest depth. Additionally, the modulated pulse trains <b>in</b> <b>condition</b> A were perceived as being lower in pitch than those <b>in</b> <b>condition</b> B. Data are interpreted in terms of increased refractoriness <b>in</b> <b>condition</b> A, where the larger pulses are more closely followed by the smaller ones than <b>in</b> <b>condition</b> B. Consistent with this conclusion, the A-B difference was reduced at longer interpulse intervals. These findings provide a measure of supra-threshold effects of refractoriness on pitch perception, and increase our understanding of coding of temporal information in cochlear implant speech processing schemes. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Andrić's {{literary}} {{career began}} in 1911, and {{prior to the}} outbreak of World War I, he published a number of poems, essays and reviews, and also translated the works of foreign writers. In the {{years leading up to}} the war, he joined a number of South Slav student movements calling {{for an end to the}} Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was also a close friend of Princip. In late July or early August 1914, Andrić was arrested by the Austro-Hungarians for his connections to Franz Ferdinand's assassins. He spent much of World War I in captivity, and was only freed in July 1917, after Emperor Charles declared a general amnesty for political prisoners. Andrić entered the diplomatic service in 1920. Throughout the interwar period, he served as an ambassador of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). He published a short story titled The Bridge on the Žepa, which was to serve as a prototype for the Bridge on the Drina, in 1925. In 1939, he was appointed Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany, which went on to spearhead an invasion of his country in April 1941, within the wider context of World War II. Andrić and his staff were arrested by the Germans following the invasion's commencement, and in June 1941, he was permitted to return to Belgrade. Andrić was retired from the diplomatic service and confined to a friend's apartment by the Germans, living <b>in</b> <b>conditions</b> that some biographers have likened to house arrest.

5|$|For the Royal Navy, {{the early}} years of the war had been successful, but the {{commitment}} to a global conflict was creating a severe strain on available equipment, men and financial resources. The navy had expanded from 134 ships at the start of the conflict in 1793, to 633 by 1797, and personnel had increased from 45,000 men to 120,000, an achievement possible only as a result of the impressment service, which abducted criminals, beggars and unwilling conscripts for compulsory service at sea. Wages had not been increased since 1653, and were usually months late, rations were terrible, shore leave forbidden and discipline harsh. Tensions in the fleet had been gradually rising since the start of the war, and in February 1797, anonymous sailors from the Channel Fleet at Spithead sent letters to their former commander, Lord Howe, soliciting his support in improving their conditions. The list was deliberately ignored on the instructions of First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Spencer, and, on 16 April, the sailors responded with the Spithead Mutiny: a largely peaceful strike action led by a delegation of seamen from each ship tasked with negotiating with the authorities and enforcing discipline. For a month the fleet remained at stalemate, until Lord Howe was able to negotiate a series of improvements <b>in</b> <b>conditions</b> that enabled the strikers to return to regular service. The mutiny had achieved almost all of its aims; increasing pay, removing unpopular officers and improving conditions for the men serving in the Channel Fleet and, ultimately, the whole navy.|$|E

Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action.
