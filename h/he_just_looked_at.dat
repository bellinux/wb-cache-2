[...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down.

When von Sydow asked the director for some insight into the character, Riead gave him a simple but telling answer. “I said, the whole world looked up to Mother Teresa,” he recalls. “And Mother Teresa looked up to Father van Exem. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me for a long moment, and he said, ‘got it.’ And that was it.

40|$|Abstract: Virtual environments are {{recognized}} as more effective than other digital approaches for the acquisition of several abilities. This is because the brain recognizes the virtual world as real and this facilitates {{the transfer of the}} newly acquired skills to the real world. In this paper, we present a game that has been designed and developed with the aim of teaching spatial orientation abilities to teenagers with mild intellectual impairments. In particular, the game focuses on the training of two basic skills: perspective taking and mental rotation. Perspective taking refers to the ability of imagining how the world looks like from another person’s point of view, while mental rotation is the ability to mentally represent and manipulate physical objects in one’s mind. The game, which takes place in a virtual environment, shows the player a scene with some objects on the table. The player has to choose among four provided alternatives, the one that shows how the scene would look like from a different side of the table. The game was first developed to be used with either a desktop pc monitor or an interactive touch table. In this case, a virtual world is represented, but the player is not completely immersed in it, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the scene from outside. A second version of the same game has then been developed using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), which makes the player feel immersed in the virtual environment, where he can freely move aroun...|$|R

Then I went to do Easy Rider, but didn't see him because we didn't have any scenes together ... At the premiere, I saw him out in the lobby afterward and I started crying ... He didn't understand that, but what it was [...] that I really loved him a lot, and I didn't know it until I saw him again, because it all welled up." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Audley came, {{having just}} parted with the doctor, who had {{explained}} the sudden termination as {{what he had}} of late not thought improbable, and further shown {{that it had been}} most merciful, since there might otherwise have been weeks, if not months, of much severer suffering. <b>He</b> had <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in <b>at</b> the wife, but she had hardly noticed him, and he saw no dangerous symptoms about her, except an almost torpid calmness.|$|R
60|$|The girl marvelled at {{the effect}} {{her voice had}} upon the creature. Somewhere in that {{enormous}} brain there was a chord that was touched by melody. It was the sole link between herself and the brain when detached from the rykor. When it dominated the rykor it might have other human instincts; but these she dreaded even to think of. After she had sung she waited for Ghek to speak. For a long time <b>he</b> was silent, <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her through those awful eyes.|$|R
6000|$|St. John arrived first. I had entreated {{him to keep}} {{quite clear}} of the house till {{everything}} was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, [...] "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?" [...] I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I got {{him to make the}} tour of the house. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in <b>at</b> the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode.|$|R

5000|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] "... He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. ..." [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] "You know, I think, at the end of the day, Owen's basically a good man who has some pretty extreme teaching techniques that he learned in the army. And all these things that are in the show are actually the way trauma surgeons are taught. But I think probably beyond that, <b>he</b> very much <b>just</b> calls a spade a spade and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> each scenario. He's not trying to be difficult. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> each scenario and each case and each patient and knows what is needed and when to cut to the chase, and doesn't want to mess about with the periphery of it. And sometimes that gets him into trouble, and sometimes that is for the best. So, it'd be interesting and kind of exciting to see where he goes." [...] Kevin McKidd [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not <b>just</b> the <b>look</b> of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon of war." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{believed}} in being <b>just!</b> <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{her as she}} walked by his side, stepping along with the delightful freedom of healthy youth, her limbs clearly defined beneath her thin skirt,--for they were facing a land breeze which played havoc, also, with her hair. She walked well, her head a little thrown back. Deane recognized the graceful lines of her neck and throat, the carriage of her chin. There was something particularly rhythmic about her movements. She was a believer in justice! Well, she looked like that. The mouth, in repose, was a little hard,--the jaw determined. He found himself wondering, with a nervous sort of morbid curiosity, exactly what she would say and do if she had known with whom she was walking, and if Dick Sinclair had indeed been her uncle! Supposing she knew the whole truth,--knew of that heated interview, knew of Rowan's enterprise, knew of the paper which was still sewn into the dead man's coat! She would scarcely be an easy person to deal with, he thought.|$|R

But Joe had not reached the corner before he wanted to be back with her again. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> wanted to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. He had no thought that it was love. Love? That was when young fellows and girls walked out together. As for him--And then his desire took sharper shape, and he discovered that that was the very thing he wanted her to do. He wanted to see her, to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, and well could he do all this if she but walked out with him. Then that was why the young fellows and girls walked out together, he mused, as the week-end drew near. He had remotely considered this walking out to be a mere form or observance preliminary to matrimony. Now he saw the deeper wisdom in it, wanted it himself, and concluded therefrom that he was in love.|$|R
500|$|Captain Jack {{has gone}} on to become a {{recognisable}} figure in the British public consciousness, and has attracted some parody. These parodies frequently echo criticisms both of the character and of Barrowman's portrayal. The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical impressionist television show Dead Ringers. Played by Jon Culshaw, the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent campness, as well his melodramatic personality in Torchwood. In one sketch, he walks bizarrely towards the camera, kissing a policeman as he passes him. In another sketch, he can be seen having a threesome with two Cybermen, a race of cyborgs from Doctor Who. Satirical technology columnist Verity Stob wrote a parody of Torchwood Season One in the style of Dylan Thomas's radio play Under Milk Wood, called Under Torch Wood. This parody described Captain Jack as [...] "the insomniac bicon; snug as a hobbit, pretty as a choirboy, immortal as carbon dioxide, wooden as a horse." [...] Barrowman's ubiquity, however, has even provoked criticism of the character. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror, in his review of Children of Earth, said [...] "Unlike David Tennant's Doctor, Barrowman's endless appearances on friendly drivel like Tonight's the Night, The Kids Are All Right and Any Dream Will Do, is so over-exposed, 'Captain Jack' is about as intriguing or alien as a Weetabix and twice as irritating. Unlike Tennant, as an actor <b>he</b> is <b>just</b> not good enough." [...] Television journalist Charlie Brooker, in his Screenwipe review of 2009 criticised Barrowman, with focus on his acting. [...] "Harkness is of course a man of mystery. You can't tell what <b>he's</b> thinking <b>just</b> by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> his face... no matter how hard Barrowman tries." ...|$|R
