40|$|<b>Emitting</b> <b>dipole</b> {{orientation}} (EDO) is {{an important}} issue of emitting materials in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) for an increase of outcoupling efficiency of light. The origin of preferred orientation of <b>emitting</b> <b>dipole</b> of spherically shaped iridium-based heteroleptic phosphorescent dyes doped in organic layers is revealed by simulation of vacuum deposition using molecular dynamics (MD) along with quantum mechanical (QM) characterization of the phosphors for a direct comparison with experimental observations of EDO. Consideration of both the electronic transitions in a molecular frame and the orientation of the molecules interacting with the environment at the vacuum/molecular film interface allows quantitative analyses of the EDO depending on host molecules and dopant structures. Interaction between the phosphor and nearest host molecules on the surface, minimizing the non-bonding energy determines the molecular alignment during the vacuum deposition. Parallel alignment of the main cyclometalating ligands in the molecular complex due to host interactions rather than the ancillary ligand orienting to vacuum leads to the horizontal EDO.

Higher end beacons such as the Mammut® Pulse Barryvox and Arva® Link are equipped with a digital compass and free-flowing arrow, facilitating more exact direction finding, even rotating to maintain direction between pulses of the transmitting beacon (a feature that is impossible without a digital compass or sophisticated accelerometer). In addition, many higher end beacons can point to victims 360°, including behind the user if the user is moving in the wrong direction.

40|$|Light-harvesting complex I (LHCI), {{which serves}} as a {{peripheral}} antenna for photosystem I (PSI) in green plants, consists mainly of four polypeptides, Lhca 1 - 4. We report room temperature emission properties of individual reconstituted monomeric Lhca proteins (Lhca 1, - 2, - 3, and - 4) and dimeric Lhca 1 / 4, performed by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. The emission quantum yields of the samples are approximately 0. 12, 0. 085, 0. 081, 0. 041, and 0. 063 for Lhca 1, - 2, - 3, - 4, and the - 1 / 4 dimer, respectively, which is considerably lower than the value of 0. 22 found for light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), the main peripheral antenna complex of photosystem II in green plants. The decay components of LHCI proteins can be divided in two categories: Lhca 1 and Lhca 3 have decay times of 1. 1 - 1. 6 ns and 3. 3 - 3. 6 ns, and Lhca 2 and Lhca 4 have decay times of 0. 7 - 0. 9 ns and 3. 1 - 3. 2 ns. These categories seem to correlate with the pigment composition of the samples. All decay times are faster than that observed previously for LHCII. When the absolute emission yields and the lifetimes of the Lhca samples are combined, the overall emission properties of the individual Lhca proteins are expressed in terms of their <b>emitting</b> <b>dipole</b> moment strength. In the samples without extreme red states, that is, Lhca 1 and Lhca 2, the <b>emitting</b> <b>dipole</b> moment has a value close to unity (relative to monomeric chlorophyll in acetone), which is similar to that for LHCII, whereas, in the samples with the red-most state (F- 730), that is, Lhca 3, - 4, and the - 1 / 4 dimer, the <b>emitting</b> <b>dipole</b> moment has a value less than unity (0. 6 - 0. 8), which can be explained by mixing the red-most (exciton) state with a dark charge-transfer state, as suggested in previous PSI red pigment studies. In addition, we find a lifetime component of approximately 50 - 150 ps in all red-pigment-containing samples, which cannot be due to "slow" energy transfer, but is instead assigned to an unrelaxed state of the pigment-protein, which, on this time-scale, is converted into the final emitting state...|$|E

In this work, we study the properties of a single NV center in nanodiamonds embedded in an air-like silica aerogel environment which provides a new domain for probing the emission behavior of NV centers in nanoscale environments. In this arrangement, the emission rate is governed primarily by the diamond crystal lattice with negligible contribution from the surrounding environment. This is in contrast to the conventional approach of studying nanodiamonds on a glass coverslip. We observe an increase in the mean lifetime due to the absence of a dielectric interface near the <b>emitting</b> <b>dipoles</b> and a distribution arising from the irregularities in the nanodiamond geometry.

In order to avoid these statistical trials, the knowledge of the nature of the emitter (single or double dipole) and its orientation are both crucial for a deterministic approach. Based on the theoretical development of the point-dipole emission, we propose in this paper to determine the nature and the polarization of two types of nanoemitters (spherical nanocrystals and dot-in-rod) by the analysis of their emission polarization [1, 2].

The existence of a pumping threshold is confirmed for the laser effect.

40|$|An ongoing {{challenge}} {{in electrical engineering}} is the design of antennas whose size is small compared to the broadcast wavelength λ. One difficulty is that the radiation resistance of a small antenna is small {{compared to that of}} the typical transmission lines that feed the antenna, 1 so that much of the power in the feed line is reflected off the antenna rather than radiated unless a matching network is used at the antenna terminals (with a large inductance for a small dipole antenna and a large capacitance for a small loop antenna). The radiation resistance of an antenna that <b>emits</b> <b>dipole</b> radiation is proportional to the square of the peak (electric or magnetic) dipole moment of the antenna. This dipole moment is roughly the product of the peak charge times the length of the antenna {{in the case of a}} linear (electric) antenna, and is the product of the peak current times the area of the antenna in the case of a loop (magnetic) antenna. Hence, it is hard to increase the radiation resistance of small linear or loop antennas by altering their shapes. 2 One suggestion for a small antenna is the so-called “crossed-field ” antenna [2].
