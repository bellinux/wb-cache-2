5|$|In Strasbourg, Bucer {{joined a}} team of notable reformers: Zell, who took {{the role of the}} preacher to the masses; Wolfgang Capito, the most {{influential}} theologian in the city; and Caspar Hedio, the cathedral preacher. One of Bucer's first actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of reform was to debate with Thomas Murner, a monk who had attacked Luther in satires. While the city council vacillated on religious issues, the number of people supporting the Reformation and hostile towards the traditional clergy had grown.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour {{government}} of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After {{the political and economic}} crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of peace and disarmament.|$|E
5|$|Born in Warsaw and {{following}} in his father's footsteps, he {{became interested in}} politics {{at an early age}} and soon became involved in the military and the revolutionary affairs in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Pulaski was one of the leading military commanders for the Bar Confederation and fought against Russian domination of the Commonwealth. When this uprising failed, he was driven into exile. Following a recommendation by Benjamin Franklin, Pulaski emigrated to North America to help <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the American Revolutionary War. He distinguished himself throughout the revolution, most notably when he saved the life of George Washington. Pulaski became a general in the Continental Army, created the Pulaski Cavalry Legion and reformed the American cavalry as a whole. At the Battle of Savannah, while leading a daring charge against British forces, he was gravely wounded, and died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He {{approved of the}} former president's plans to legislate {{on behalf of the}} underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E

5|$|Mathias Brugman (1811–1868) {{was the son}} of Pierre Brugman from Curaçao of Dutch-Jewish ancestry and Isabel Duliebre from Puerto Rico. His parents met {{and married}} in New Orleans, Louisiana where Brugman was born, raised and educated. The Brugman family moved to Puerto Rico and settled in the City of Mayagüez where Brugman met and married Ana Maria Laborde. He opened a colmado (grocery store) and became rather successful, only to lose a good part of his fortune {{attempting}} to grow coffee. Like many other residents of Puerto Rico at the time, he resented the political injustices practiced by Spain on the island. This led him to become a believer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the Puerto Rican independence movement.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian, who {{was married}} to the former Kathleen Davis, also became {{involved}} with medical causes later in life. Along with Mike and Cindy Parseghian, his son and daughter-in-law, he founded the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation in 1994. The foundation is seeking a cure for Niemann-Pick disease Type C, a genetic disorder affecting children that causes the buildup of cholesterol in cells, resulting in damage to the nervous system and eventually death. Three of his grandchildren, Michael, Marcia, and Christa Parseghian, died from the disease. He was also active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> {{to find a cure}} for multiple sclerosis; his daughter, Karan, was diagnosed with the disease.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area {{if they could get}} to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.|$|E

5|$|The couple {{met with}} Mahatma Gandhi, {{becoming}} the first African Americans to have an audience with him. When Thurman asked him to take his message to the United States, he demurred as his work in India and his personal quest there were not finished. One {{important aspect of the}} meeting was a discussion of how non-violent resistance {{could be used as a}} means of creating social change. The meeting had a profound effect on the couple, changing the direction of their lives. Though they would remain Christians, the meeting with Gandhi led them to consider establishing a church free of prejudice, transcending racial, social, economic and spiritual boundaries. After they returned to the United States, Howard received a letter from A. J. Muste on behalf of Alfred Fisk who was looking for someone to establish a church in San Francisco which crossed the racial and spiritual divides. Muste was hopeful that Rev. Thurman might know of a divinity student interested in the position. Instead, Howard decided to take up the challenge himself, securing a leave of absence in order to found the church. Thurman went with him bringing their two daughters, as she strongly believed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E
5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of {{the common}} cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza {{is less likely to}} result in a runny nose.|$|E
5|$|When news {{first arrived}} that Philip was in Elatea, {{just three days}} march away, there was panic in Athens. In what Cawkwell {{describes}} as his proudest moment, Demosthenes alone counseled against despair, and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans; his decree was passed, and he was sent as ambassador. Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes, requesting that the Thebans join him, or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered. Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip, they could have avoided the conflict altogether. However, in spite of Philip's proximity, and their traditional enmity with Athens, they chose to ally with the Athenians, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of liberty for Greece. The Athenian army had already pre-emptively been sent {{in the direction of}} Boeotia, and was therefore able to join the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon III {{had tried}} to secure {{territorial}} concessions from both sides {{before and after the}} Austro-Prussian War, but despite his role as mediator during the peace negotiations, he ended up with nothing. He then hoped that Austria would join in a war of revenge and that its former allies—particularly the southern German states of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria—would join <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b> This hope would prove futile since the 1866 treaty came into effect and united all German states militarily—if not happily—to fight against France. Instead of a war of revenge against Prussia, supported by various German allies, France engaged in a war against all of the German states without any allies of its own. The reorganization of the military by von Roon and the operational strategy of Moltke combined against France to great effect. The speed of Prussian mobilization astonished the French, and the Prussian ability to concentrate power at specific points—reminiscent of Napoleon I's strategies seventy years earlier—overwhelmed French mobilization. Utilizing their efficiently laid rail grid, Prussian troops were delivered to battle areas rested and prepared to fight, whereas French troops had to march for considerable distances to reach combat zones. After a number of battles, notably Spicheren, Wörth, Mars la Tour, and Gravelotte, the Prussians defeated the main French armies and advanced on the primary city of Metz and the French capital of Paris. They captured Napoleon III and took an entire army as prisoners at Sedan on 1 September 1870.|$|E
