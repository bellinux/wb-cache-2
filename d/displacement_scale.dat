40|$|Computational {{modeling}} {{of the structural}} behavior of continuous fiber composite materials often {{takes into account the}} periodicity of the underlying micro-structure. A well established method dealing with the structural behavior of periodic micro-structures is the so- called Asymptotic Expansion Homogenization (AEH). By considering a periodic perturbation of the material <b>displacement,</b> <b>scale</b> bridging functions, also referred to as elastic correctors, can be derived in order to connect the strains {{at the level of the}} macro-structure with micro- structural strains. For complicated inhomogeneous micro-structures, the derivation of such functions is usually performed by the numerical solution of a PDE problem - typically with the Finite Element Method. Moreover, when dealing with uncertain micro-structural geometry and material parameters, there is considerable uncertainty introduced in the actual stresses experienced by the materials. Due to the high computational cost of computing the elastic correctors, the choice of a pure Monte-Carlo approach for dealing with the inevitable material and geometric uncertainties is clearly computationally intractable. This problem is even more pronounced when the effect of damage in the micro-scale is considered, where re-evaluation of the micro-structural representative volume element is necessary for every occurring damage. The novelty in this paper is that a non-intrusive surrogate modeling approach is employed with the purpose of directly bridging the macro-scale behavior of the structure with the material behavior in the micro-scale, therefore reducing the number of costly evaluations of corrector functions, allowing for future developments on the incorporation of fatigue or static damage in the analysis of composite structural components.

However, neither model correctly captures the short-timescale behavior quantified by the displacement probability distribution or the turning angle distribution. We develop a hybrid model that includes both run and tumble behavior and heterogeneous noise during the runs, which correctly matches the short-timescale behaviors and indicates that the run times are not Lévy distributed.

Many random walks have a mean square displacement that grows linearly in time. More generally, the 2 n-th moment of the <b>displacement</b> <b>scales</b> as a power of time t 2 nH(n), where the scaling exponent H is known as the Hurst exponent. Monofractal walks have unique exponents H(n) =H, whereas multifractal walks have non-unique H(n). There are a number of biological instances in which finite sized probing windows need to be considered, from examples of cells and bacteria in confined spaces to rodent populations of interest in epidemic spread. A monofractal random walk seen through a finite probing window will incorrectly appear to have multifractal properties [1]. We propose a method to correct for such spurious detection of multifractality.
