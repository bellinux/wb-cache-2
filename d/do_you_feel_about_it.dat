And there was boiled fowl and tongue at every dinner. The fifteenth time, the foreigner couldn't stand it any longer. He slapped his forehead, and he said, 'Ah, merciful Heaven, cock and bacon again!' You won't mention it, will you?--and perhaps you think as I do?--I'm sick of cock and bacon, myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|As Miss Grammont and Sir Richmond Hardy {{fulfilled}} {{the details of}} his excellent programme and revised their impressions of the past and their ideas about the future in the springtime sunlight of Wiltshire and Somerset, with Miss Seyffert acting the part of an almost ostentatiously discreet chorus, it was inevitable that their conversation should become, by imperceptible gradations, more personal and intimate. They kept up the pose, which was supposed to represent Dr. Martineau's philosophy, of being Man and Woman on their Planet considering its Future, but insensibly they developed the idiosyncrasies of their position. They might profess to be Man and Woman in the most general terms, but the facts that she was the daughter not of Everyman but old Grammont and that Sir Richmond was the angry leader of a minority upon the Fuel Commission became more and more important. [...] "What shall we do with this planet of ours?" [...] gave way by the easiest transitions to [...] "What are you and I doing and what have we got to do?

Not that he was eva one to push, and I don't know as he so much as spoke of it, afta we left the hotel two yea's ago; but I presume it wa'n't out of his mind a single minute. Time and time again I'd say to him, 'Now, Albe't, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> just the way you done?' and he'd say, 'I ha'r't had any call to charge my mind about it,' and then I'd begin tryin' to ahgue him out of it, and keep a hectorin', till he'd say, 'Well, I'm not askin' you to do it,' and that's all I could get out of him. But I see all the while 't he wanted me to do it, whateva he asked, and now I've got to do it when it can't give him any pleasure." [...] Mrs. Lander put up her black-bordered {{handkerchief}} and sobbed into it, and Clementina waited till her grief had spent itself; then she gave her a fan, and Mrs. Lander gratefully cooled her hot wet face. The children had found the noises of her affliction and the turbid tones of her monologue annoying, and had gone off to play in the woods; Claxon kept incuriously about the work that Clementina had left him to; his wife maintained the confidence which she always felt in Clementina's ability to treat with the world when it presented itself, and though she was curious enough, she did not offer to interrupt the girl's interview with Mrs. Lander; Clementina would know how to behave.|$|E

I’ll bet you’d {{like some of}} this heat, it must be terribly cold at home right now. I didn’t do {{anything}} this weekend, I only had until nine o’clock Saturday night because {{we were supposed to}} fly Sunday. Went to the movies on the post, saw two stinkin’ pictures, I’ve even forgotten what they were. I went last night again though and saw Fred MacMurray and Claudette Colbert in “Practically Yours” it was quite good and very funny. I saw “Experiment Perilous” it was marvelous wasn’t it? Well honey I finally wrote Uncle Guy. Told him I was going to get married now I’m hopefully awaiting an answer. I guess Dottie told you I was getting 15 days delay en route in March. We still want to get married down here because it’s so much easier and cheaper, the Six’s will probably blow a gut but that’s T. S. were’re [sic] the ones that are getting married. Gosh the train fare home for us would just about swamp me, and then we’d have {{to go all the way}} to Texas, I couldn’t do it, it will be tough enough as it is. And another thing, we’d waste so much time traveling too. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> honey? Do you think I should get married at home? I spoke to the Chaplain about the chapel. He’s a wonderful man, a lot of fun we talked for about an hour and a half like a couple of old ladies. It’s all arranged for two o’clock Sunday afternoon. I think I graduate at ten in the morning. Honey, what kind of a bouquet should I get Dottie? What did Bobbie have? I’ve never done this before, you’re an old hand at it by now I guess. Gosh it sure is complicated, I can see now what you went through marrying off two daughters. I spoke to the photographer and that’s all settled, for $ 15. Money, money, whew! Well honey, take care of yourself, I’m so glad you’re feeling better. Give my love to everyone and to you honey, I send a heartful and a thousand kisses, always.
