40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} germination of good bean seed of the variety Galeb and the bad bean seed of the same variety. We were also interested in germination of bean and snap bean seed damaged by <b>grain</b> <b>weevil,</b> and in germination of the seed treated by freezing which was aimed at controlling <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> by cold. We also recorded the differences between bean and snap bean seed, which was or was not treated by freezing in laboratory conditions. This investigation was carried out by applying the two factorial block system. The obtained results were evaluated by the variance analysis and x 2 test These results suggest that the bean seed of a bad fraction had low levels of germination, but still it was present. Although the seed of good appearance was carefully selected, germination was slightly lower than it should have been. The seed with the large amount of <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> performed a high level germination in laboratory conditions. There were no differences in germination between the seed injured by <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> either in beans or in snap beans.

50|$|Adult rice weevils {{are able}} to fly, and can survive {{for up to two}} years. Females lay 2-6 eggs per day and up to 300 over their lifetime. The female uses strong mandibles to chew a hole into a grain kernel after which she {{deposits}} a single egg within the hole, sealing it with secretions from her ovipositor. The larva develops within the grain, hollowing it out while feeding. It then pupates within the grain kernel and emerges 2-4 days after eclosion.Male S. orzyae produce an aggregation pheromone ((4S,5R)-5-Hydroxy-4-methylheptan-3-one) to which males and females are drawn. A synthetic version is available which attracts rice weevils, maize <b>weevils</b> and <b>grain</b> <b>weevils.</b> Females produce a pheromone which attracts only males.|$|R
40|$|The {{view that}} parasites can develop {{cooperative}} symbiotic {{relationships with their}} hosts is both appealing and widely held; however, there is no molecular genetic evidence of such a transition. Here we demonstrate that a mutualistic bacterial endosymbiont of <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> maintains and expresses inv/spa genes encoding a type III secretion system homologous to that used for invasion by bacterial pathogens. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that inv/spa genes were present in presymbiotic ancestors of the weevil endosymbionts, occurring at least 50 million years ago. The function of inv/spa genes in maintaining symbiosis is demonstrated by the up-regulation of their expression under both in vivo and in vitro conditions that coincide with host cell invasion...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken following the survey into {{the incidence of}} infestation of stored cereals by insects (Munro, 1940), and forms {{part of a comprehensive}} research programme initiated by that author into the problems of the biology and control of <b>grain</b> <b>weevils.</b> Once infestation of a stock of grain has taken place the rate at which it develops depends on the number of insects present and {{on the extent to which}} the conditions favour their multiplication. Of the factors governing multiplication may be mentioned the rate of oviposition, the length of time a female lives before she lays eggs and the length of her ovipository life. These factors are dependent in turn on the environ-ment, and they have formed the subject of this investigation with reference to the <b>grain</b> <b>weevil,</b> Calandra granaria, in stored wheat. In no earlier work have strictly controlled environ-mental conditions been applied in this connexion. For instance, Kunicke (1936) reports that at 260 C. a female lays 200 eggs over an unstated period of time and that at 240 C. adult Calandra could live for a year. Lavrekhin (1937) states that at 25 - 270 C. the females lived for about 130 days, and that the average rate of oviposition was 0 - 9 egg per day from the 14 th to the 54 th day, the rate then falling off. Since these results were obtained without any precise control of the atmospheric humidity they are of little value. With these defects, in mind the features of oviposition rate, length of preoviposition period and of lengths of ovipository life in Calandra have been examined under a series of controlled humidities for each of several temperatures. In this way some comparison can fairly be made between the effects of temperature and atmospheric humidity separately and together...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} doses (0, 90, 270, 810 kg/ha) of selenium, molybdenum and zinc microelements on their translocation and accumulation in grains, seedling growth and grain infestation were examined {{under field conditions}} on a calcareous chernozem soil. Thirteen years after the application of selenium, molybdenum and zinc, significant translocation and accumulation of these elements in the grain were established, indicating a long-term effect of these microelements on triticale plants. The highest degree of accumulation in grains and seedling shoots was found for selenium, then molybdenum, while the detected amounts of zinc were significantly lower. The degree of accumulation of all threemicroelements in the grain and seedling shoot increased as doses increased. Translocation index from shoot to grain at the grain-filling phase was the highest when zinc was used, then selenium, and the lowest when molybdenum was applied. The highest translocationindex from the grain during germination into seedling shoots was obtained with zinc, then molybdenum and selenium. Translocation indexes of the investigated elements significantly decreased as the doses of elements increased. Dry weight of seedling shoots decreasedas molybdenum and zinc in grain increased. High selenium concentration moderately stimulated seedling development, pointing out a high tolerance of triticale to higher concentration of this microelement at initial development stages. Infestatation with <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> was provoked by high concentrations of these microelements in the grain. High concentrations of zinc and selenium, in particular, significantly decreased the percentage of damaged grains, while molybdenum moderately increased their numbers. The effect of zincand molybdenum {{may be attributed to}} their chemical effect, while selenium effect may also be referred to a negative effect of the volatile selenium compound.

Also, inert dusts induced death in <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> by desiccation since respiration and ingestion {{did not seem to}} harm the insects. While ZnO is not inert, it is entirely possible that termite mortality demonstrated by Kartal et al. [12] and Clausen et al. [11, 15] {{is the result of a}} physical reaction alone, or in addition to a physiochemical reaction since a film of nano-particles remained on the surface of the unleached wood blocks. Furthermore, antibacterial activity has been reported to increase with reduction in particle size [8]. In our previous study, wood blocks were treated with a single particle size (30 nm) of ZnO and the effect of particle size could not be ascertained.|$|R

Despite differences in storage methods between Malawi and Zambia, farmers in both countries were familiar with pesticidal plants, where Tephrosia vogelii was the most frequently reported. Surprisingly few farmers actually used pesticidal plants, highlighting a promotion opportunity.

A number of VOCs were specifically linked with confused flour beetle T. confusum and not observed with the other insect and mite species. For instance, 2 -methyl-p-benzoquinone and 2 -ethyl-p-benzoquinone were specifically linked to confused flour beetle. However, this study found that benzoquinones were not present in the headspace volatiles of the larvae of confused flour beetle, whereas, 1 -pentadecene was detected in adults and larvae of confused flour beetle. The results of the volatile extraction experiments with saw-toothed grain beetles O. surinamensis showed that several volatiles were detected in the adults and larvae of saw-toothed grain beetle {{but not in the}} other insect and mite species. Some of these VOCs were detected only in adults, and these were butanoic acid, 1 -methylethyl ester and 1, 3 -octadiene. The others were found in both larvae and adults. These were 2, 4 -hexadien- 1 -ol, octane, 3 -methylbutanoic acid, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, 1 -octen- 3 -one and 1 -octen- 3 -ol. The analysis of the headspace from <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> S. granarius showed three VOCs which were specifically linked to weevils compared to the other species. These were mequinol, 2 -methylpropanoic acid and 2 -pentanone.
