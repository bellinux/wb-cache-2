The remaining three carriages of the Duke's train were detached and the band's carriage, hauled by Northumbrian, {{set off for}} Manchester with Stephenson driving. Lord Wilton held Huskisson's hands and arms steady, while Lord Colville supported his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees and tried to cushion him from the vibration of the train. With the train almost unladen and Stephenson running the engine flat-out, the train reached the speed of almost , briefly giving those on board the world speed record. The crowds lining the route, unaware of what had happened, cheered and waved as Northumbrian rushed past.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

After killing Jaworski, Dexter drives to see Rita, but is sidetracked when he sees a refrigerated truck. Dexter follows the truck, and the driver throws a severed head at Dexter's car. When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level, under the impression that this is what Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> refrigerator door. Inside the freezer, he finds the other parts of the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E

25|$|Portrait of Dr. Gachet {{is one of}} {{the most}} revered {{paintings}} by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet who took care of Van Gogh during the final months of his life. There are two authenticated versions of the portrait, both painted in June 1890 at Auvers-sur-Oise. Both show Gachet sitting at a table and leaning his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right arm but they are easily differentiated in color and style. In 1990, the first version fetched a record price of $82.5 million ($75 million, plus a 10 percent buyer's commission) when sold at auction in New York.|$|E
25|$|That {{evening at}} the music hall, Tintin and Haddock watch a {{performance}} by the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, which Milou turns into an impromptu duet. Haddock storms out from the show because of Castafiore's singing. Ragdalam the fakir and Yamilah the clairvoyant perform after Castafiore; after a few novelty predictions, Ragdalam asks Yamilah {{to tell him about}} a woman in the audience, Mme Clairmont (Mrs Clarkson). She says that her husband, Clairmont (Clarkson), is a photographer, and that he has been struck down by the curse of Rascar Capac. Mme Clairmont must leave the show with her daughter, Fleur, when she receives a message that her husband is indeed ill. The magician's act is on, and Haddock stumbles onto the stage with a stage prop of a cow's <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his,</b> after having got lost backstage trying to find his way out.|$|E
500|$|Hopley's trial {{took place}} at Lewes Assizes on 23 July 1860. The {{prosecutors}} were Parry and Knapp; Hopley was defended by the serjeant-at-law William Ballantine, who subsequently described Hopley as [...] "distorted". Throughout his trial, Hopley described himself as reluctant to use corporal punishment. In describing the events preceding Cancellor's death, Hopley stated that he started crying while beating Cancellor, after which Cancellor presented his lesson and [...] "Hopley took his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> breast and prayed with him". Hopley presented testimonials from past students who described him as [...] "kindly" [...] and who noted an infrequent use of violence. Hopley {{claimed to be a}} paedagogical follower of John Locke, who had decried the use of corporal punishment except in cases of extreme obstinacy {{on the part of the}} student. He argued that, through the application of this theory, the beating that killed Cancellor had been a necessary one.|$|E

500|$|Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was {{negative}} in her review and dismissed the episode for feeling [...] "like a plateful of warmed-up leftovers." [...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, or maybe it only seems that way because it's long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are too important to be killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time". The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005, calling it [...] "note-perfect." ...|$|E

He {{convinced}} the staff to select halfback Jim Kiick in the 1969 NFL Draft. In contrast to some of the other staff members earlier assessments, Idzik said, [...] "He's not slow. He has got good speed and power and balance and a good <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulders." [...] In 1967, Idzik was a frontrunner for the vacant head coaching job at his alma mater, which went instead to fellow alumnus Bob Ward.|$|E
2500|$|After Madame Giry and Meg are {{dispatched}} to find help, Christine reveals to Gustave that the Phantom is his real {{father and the}} shocked boy flees ("Look with Your Heart" [...] (Reprise)). Christine tells the Phantom that her love for him will never die, then they share a final kiss and she dies in his arms ("Once Upon Another Time" [...] (Reprise)). Gustave returns with Raoul, who looks on silently and sadly, and Gustave lays his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mother's lap. The Phantom surrenders Christine's body to Raoul, then moves {{to the edge of}} the pier and collapses to his knees in grief. Gustave goes to the weeping Phantom, who sings to him, and the boy embraces his real father for the first time ("Love Never Dies" [...] (Reprise)). Gustave then removes the Phantom's mask, but does not react as he did before; instead, he gently touches the Phantom's face in an act of acceptance. Gustave and the Phantom gaze at one another as the curtain falls.|$|E

2500|$|The lords' {{failure to}} {{understand}} {{the need for an}} impartial and functioning judiciary is echoed in the rebellion; [...] "The virulent ambition and hostility to law that characterised the barons equally characterise the workmen," [...] suggesting there is no difference between the old order and the new. This is evident in Cade's speech after ordering the execution of Lord Saye; [...] "The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulders unless he pay me tribute. There shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it. Men shall hold of me in capite. And we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell" [...] (4.7.112–117). In this proposed new world order, Cade envisions establishing an autocracy where all will pay fealty to him, and where his laws, which he can make arbitrarily, stand for everyone. As such, in this political system, as in the old, law and justice seem to have little relevance.|$|E
2500|$|An {{exquisite}} literary perfectionist, {{akin to the}} 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé, Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages [...] "covered {{with fine}} lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut for a page...". He worked [...] "long hours with great concentration". According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes. [...] Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style [...] "Behind Saint-Exupéry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts {{by as much as}} two-thirds". The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt [...] "free" [...] and able to concentrate, [...] "writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy", until he instantaneously dozed off. He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arms. [...] Saint-Exupéry stated {{it was the only way}} he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new form}} of the image, which from the rare early {{versions}} {{seems to have been}} formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave – or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church. Above the opening a mountain, represented in miniature, rises up. Mary now lies recovering on a large stuffed cushion or couch ("kline" [...] in Greek) beside the infant, who is on a raised structure, whilst Joseph rests his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hand. He is often part of a separate scene in the foreground, where Jesus is being bathed by midwives (Jesus is therefore shown twice). Despite the less than ideal conditions, Mary is lying-in, the term for the period of enforced bed rest in the postpartum period after childbirth that was prescribed until modern times. [...] The midwife or midwives come from early apocryphal sources; the main one is usually called Salome, and has her own miracle of the withered hand, although this is rare in art. They featured in most medieval dramas and mystery plays of the Nativity, which often influenced painted depictions. Several apocryphal accounts speak of a great light illuminating the scene, also taken to be the star of the Magi, and this is indicated by a circular disc {{at the top of the}} scene, with a band coming straight down from it – both are often dark in colour.|$|E
