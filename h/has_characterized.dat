5|$|Gilsig <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> Terri {{as being}} emotionally {{still in high}} school, and lacking the skills to make her {{marriage}} work. She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, worried that it is pulling him away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She {{does not know how}} long Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply as an obstacle to come between Will and Emma.|$|E
5|$|The character's focal storyline {{involved}} {{a romantic relationship}} with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). She sustained life-threatening injuries after an aviation accident, in the eighth-season finale, which ultimately ended in her death. The character's death resulted in mixed critical feedback and the reason given for the departure was Leigh's desire {{to spend more time}} with her family. Rhimes <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> Lexie as being a dork, as well as having issues with saying how she feels. Leigh has been moderately well received by critics, and was among the cast to receive a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2007.|$|E

25|$|While the {{movement}} has spawned {{a number of other}} groups, the Chabad-Lubavitch branch appears to be the only one still active, making it {{the movement}}'s main surviving line. Sarna <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> Chabad as having enjoyed the fastest rate of growth of any Jewish religious movement for the period 1946-2015.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commentary}} on Manning and his Reform Party ignores his political thinking and portrays him {{in terms of}} traditional western-based political protest movements. Sigurdson (1994) argues that Manning should be regarded instead as a postmodern conservative whose politics are {{a response to the}} process of postmodernization that <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> Canada in recent years.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the civil war, Switzerland adopted a federal constitution in 1848, amending it extensively in 1874 and establishing federal responsibility for defense, trade, and legal matters, leaving all other matters to the cantonal governments.

25|$|According to some scholars, {{what both}} {{religion}} and spirituality {{have in common}} is a sense of the supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality. In colonial America, some people had a supernatural curiosity that was often combined with free-thinking rationalism advocated by intellectuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Robert Fuller <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> the SBNR phenomenon as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the piety of established churches.|$|E
25|$|Leahy {{has stated}} the {{importance}} of increasing the prevalence of public health care during times of economic downturn. He voted to increase Medicare benefits and to allow this organization to negotiate lower-priced, bulk prescriptions from pharmaceutical manufacturers.

25|$|Antisemitism did not {{cease to}} exist in the {{aftermath}} of World War II and continued to be part of Austrian political life and culture with its strongest hold in the political parties and the media. Bernd Marin, an Austrian sociologist, <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> antisemitism in Austria after 1945 as an ‘antisemitism without Jews’, since Jews constituted only 0.1 percent of the Austrian population. Antisemitism was stronger in those areas where Jews no longer lived and where previously practically no Jews had lived, and among people who neither have had nor have any personal contact with Jews.|$|E

25|$|Portuguese {{literature}} is, generally speaking, literature {{written in}} the Portuguese language, particularly by citizens of Portugal; it may also refer to literature written by people living in Portugal, Brazil, Angola and Mozambique, {{as well as other}} Portuguese-speaking countries. An early example of Portuguese literature is the tradition of a medieval Galician-Portuguese poetry, originally developed in Galicia and northern Portugal. The literature of Portugal is distinguished by a wealth and variety of lyric poetry, which <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> it from the beginning of its language, after the Roman occupation; by its wealth of historical writing documenting Portugal’s rulers, conquests, and expansion; by the then considered Golden Age of the Renaissance period of which it forms part the moral and allegorical Renaissance drama of Gil Vicente, Bernardim Ribeiro, Sá de Miranda and especially the great 16th-century national epic of Luís de Camões, author of national and epic poem Os Lusíadas (The Lusiads).|$|E

[...] Salem Press's Carol Ann Gearhart <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> the novel as domestic realism.|$|E
500|$|Ginsburg characterizes her {{performance}} on the Court as a cautious approach to adjudication. She argued in a speech shortly before her nomination to the Court that [...] motions seem to me right, in the main, for constitutional as well as common law adjudication. Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable." [...] Legal scholar Cass Sunstein <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> Ginsburg as a [...] "rational minimalist", a jurist who seeks to build cautiously on precedent rather than pushing the Constitution towards her own vision.|$|E
500|$|Savage has {{summarized}} {{his political}} philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> his views as conservative nationalism, while critics have characterized them as [...] "fostering extremism."

Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg <b>has</b> <b>{{character}}ized</b> the movie's {{story as}} [...] "fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot." [...] The film's central theme {{is the question}} of free will vs. determinism. It examines whether free will can exist if the future is set and known in advance. It also concerns itself with the role of preventative government in protecting its citizenry, which was apt of the time of the picture's given America's debates over the government's expanding powers after 9/11.|$|E
500|$|Furtado <b>has</b> <b>characterized</b> [...] "Maneater" [...] as [...] "a 'couture pop' song", {{explaining}} {{that it is}} [...] "in your face and very fashionable, stylistic and of-the-moment." [...] In an interview with MTV News, she compared it favorably to eating too much cheesecake: [...] "It's got a crazy loud beat, and the vocals are bitchy and loud. A {{lot of people say}} it sounds like Peaches, because of the delivery, the spooky vocals." [...] According to Furtado, the song is related to how people become [...] "hot on themselves" [...] when dancing in their underwear in front of a mirror. [...] " [...] truly has a life of its own; it makes you move", she said.|$|E

Grey has been positively received by television critics, with Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times referring to her as [...] "the heroine of Grey's Anatomy". News of Pompeo leaving arose when it was made clear that her contract ended after the eighth season, {{and whether or not}} she would return to the series after her contract expires has been the centre of media speculation ever since. In 2016, Pompeo re-negotiated her contract and signed up for the thirteenth season of the show.|$|E
