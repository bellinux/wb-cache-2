5|$|Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nilofar was, at the time, the third-strongest cyclone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea. In late October 2014, {{it reached}} peak maximum {{sustained}} winds estimated between 205km/h (125mph) and 215km/h (130mph). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) named it Nilofar; the name {{refers to the}} water lily, and was suggested by Pakistan. The western fringes of the storm caused flash flooding in northeastern Oman, killing four people.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the cyclone was {{considered}} to be a Category 4 equivalent storm by the JTWC, with peak winds of 215km/h (135mph). This would have made the system the first recorded storm of that intensity on record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea. However, in post-storm analysis, it was discovered that 1-minute winds did not exceed 205km/h (125mph). The next storm to reach this intensity was Cyclone Gonu in 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, which became the first known super cyclonic storm in the region. Upon attaining its peak intensity, the storm attained a barometric pressure of 932mbar (hPa), the lowest in the region at the time. The cyclone was ranked as the strongest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea for six years until it was surpassed by Gonu in 2007, which attained a minimum pressure of 920mbar (hPa). In 2010, Cyclone Phet surpassed the 2001 cyclone as the second-strongest storm in the region, attaining winds of 240km/h (145mph), according to the JTWC.|$|E

5|$|The 2001 India cyclone was {{the second}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone, in terms of barometric pressure, to form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea on record; only Cyclone Gonu in 2007 was stronger. The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May18. Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. After taking this turn, the storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May24 with winds of 215km/h (135mph 3-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 932mbar (hPa). At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Arabian Peninsula is a {{peninsula}} {{between the}} Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf. There are 57known tropical cyclones that affected the peninsula, primarily Yemen and Oman. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of Socotra. Most {{of the tropical}} cyclones originated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea, {{the portion of the}} Indian Ocean north of the equator and west of India. The remainder formed in the Bay of Bengal off India's east coast. Collectively, the 57storms have caused at least US$5.7billion in damage and 1,662deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was Cyclone Gonu, which caused US$4billion in damage and 50fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula is chiefly due to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} the Arabian {{peninsula}} known today as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use the camel, approximately 4,000–5,000years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of different water masses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North <b>Arabian</b> Sea continues to remain {{of interest to}} scientists and researchers. Focus on these water masses {{is due to the}} unique monsoonal reversal features of <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea. <b>The</b> encroachment of Persian Gulf water into <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea has been acknowledged and traced. This paper presents the results of an investigation on the spreading patterns of Persian Gulf water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern <b>Arabian</b> Sea. <b>The</b> study incorporated two different techniques: the core-layer method and the constant sigma-theta surface method on data collected during <b>the</b> North <b>Arabian</b> Sea Environment and Ecosystem Research (NASEER) programme. Horizontal curves of temperature and salinity plotted by both methods show that the Persian Gulf water reduces in concentration as it moves from west to east, whereas the major direction of flow is along the coast of Oman. The results of the study indicate that features of the Persian Gulf water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern <b>Arabian</b> Sea are so pronounced that either of the method can be used to study and identify the water mass fairly well...|$|R

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed off the Karnataka-Goa coastline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> Sea on May 27 and developed into a depression the next day. The system developed further into a cyclonic storm on May 29 as it moved to the north. The storm reached its peak with 95km/h (60mph) soon after this as it turned to the west, but soon degenerated into a deep depression over the northern Arabian Sea on May 31. The depression continued to move west, weakening to a remnant low shortly as it made landfall on the Arabian Peninsula on June 2. The remnant low dissipated over southern Saudi Arabia the next day.|$|E

5|$|Differences {{occur in}} pelage colouration, {{ranging from a}} pale white (as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> oryx) to black (as in the black wildebeest).

In several species, females and juveniles exhibit a light-coloured coat, while those of males darken with age. As in the wildebeest, the coat may be marked with prominent or faint stripes. In some species such as the addax, the coat colour can vary by the season. Scent glands and sebaceous glands are often present.|$|E
5|$|Director Colin Campbell was {{concerned}} with the film's realism. He had sets constructed to represent the streets of Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus, and used animals from the Selig Zoo. Scenes set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' clothing was genuine, and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was hand tinted. Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms.|$|E

5|$|Late on June 3, the IMD {{upgraded}} {{the storm}} to Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Gonu.
