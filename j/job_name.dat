It includes system status checking, performance tuning, bottlenecks detecting, troubleshooting, fault notifying. In particular a good monitoring infrastructure have to provide all the information needed to track the status of each job submitted to the GRID {{in order to be}} able to detect problems as soon as they come up. In this respect a good interaction between the monitoring system and the other Grid services is required. The current LCG testbed integrates GridICE as monitoring system.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the Human Resources Management became a very {{important}} area of activity, which brought relevant changes to the human resources approach in terms of place and role within the Romanian R&D entities. Also, HR proved its importance through the solutions offered for personnel allocation {{in order to achieve}} the entities’ objectives and, meanwhile, it supported the employees’ aspirations. At present, although promoted a series of regulations on the status of the researcher, both, national and European level, as the main human resource in the establishment of RDI, to the research staff are imposed in most cases the general rules of human resources management. Starting with the strengthening of the concept of European Research Area - ERA, the European Commission adopted the "European Charter for Researchers" and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. These documents are addressed to researchers and to public and private sector employers. Also, are considered key elements of EU policy researchers, to make careers more attractive, being considered vital for economic growth strategy and increase the number of employees of RDI. Human resource development requires good knowledge and understanding of their particular role to the organization. Researchers, regardless of hierarchy or <b>job</b> <b>name,</b> are the key resource of RDI entities (universities, institutes, NGOs, SMEs) that ensure their survival, development and competitive success. The evolution of knowledge-based companies needs to improve relations between knowledge and development. Knowledge is a necessary tool to meet economic needs and an important component of sustainable development at European level. European Research Area concept was launched at the Lisbon European Council meeting in March 2000, but true recognition began in 2007 with the launch of the European Commission's Green Paper on ERA. In 2008 the Council set in motion the Ljubljana process to improve political governance of ERA and adopted a common vision - ERA 2020. Tangible progress has been made but a series of partnership initiatives proposed by the Commission since November 2008. Economy and social prosperity of Europe depends to a large extent of scientific, technological development, transfer of knowledge and successful new products, innovative services, creating a healthier environment and continuous improvement of living conditions. The only correct and safest alternative to successfully meet these new challenges is the development of intensive research and innovation, based on high quality research - development and innovation and motivated human potential...|$|E
