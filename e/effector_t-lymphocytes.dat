40|$|The {{generation}} of an antigen-specific T-lymphocyte response {{is a complex}} multi-step process. Upon T-cell receptor-mediated recognition of antigen presented by activated dendritic cells, naive T-lymphocytes enter a program of proliferation and differentiation, {{during the course of}} which they acquire effector functions and may ultimately become memory T-cells. A major goal of modern immunology is to precisely identify and characterize effector and memory T-cell subpopulations that may be most efficient in disease protection. Sensitive methods are required to address these questions in exceedingly low numbers of antigen-specific lymphocytes recovered from clinical samples, and not manipulated in vitro. We have developed new techniques to dissect immune responses against viral or tumor antigens. These allow the isolation of various subsets of antigen-specific T-cells (with major histocompatibility complex [MHC]-peptide multimers and five-color FACS sorting) and the monitoring of gene expression in individual cells (by five-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]). We can also follow their proliferative life history by flow-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of average telomere length. Recently, using these tools, we have identified subpopulations of CD 8 + T-lymphocytes with distinct proliferative history and partial effector-like properties. Our data suggest that these subsets descend from recently activated T-cells and are committed to become differentiated <b>effector</b> <b>T-lymphocytes...</b>|$|E

The activation of <b>effector</b> <b>T-lymphocytes</b> and the release of cytokines define the course of dengue viral infection. CD 4 ⁺ T-lymphocyte induces the immunopathology via various mechanisms; however, its kinetics in different onset of fever and disease severity are not fully understood. This study was conducted to observe the kinetics of CD 4 + T-lymphocyte level among dengue infected patients and to obtain the absolute cell count and relative percentage of CD 4 + T-lymphocyte. This was a descriptive study on thirty six patients who met the WHO- 1997 criteria of dengue infection, hospitalized in Dr. Sardjito Hospital in the period of March to May 2009. The CD 4 + T-lymphocytes were examined using the flow cytometer. The significance of median CD 4 + T-lymphocytes among days were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney SPSS 11 for Window. The absolute CD 4 + T-lymphocyte was significantly different among days (p 0. 05). The Absolute CD 4 + T-lymphocytes count was low in the beginning of the disease course and increased from the 2 nd day of fever to the normal level on the 7 th day. In conclusion, DF and DHF do not differ in the absolute CD 4 + T-lymphocytes count as well as in the relative CD 4 + T-lymphocytes percentage...|$|E
40|$|Infection of {{susceptible}} {{strains of}} mice with Friend leukemia virus (FLV) {{results in a}} profound depression of cell-mediated immunity as assessed by lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. This depression occurs early in the disease, {{before the onset of}} splenomegaly, and is associated with a decline in the susceptibility of splenocytes from FLV-infected mice to lysis by anti-Thy- 1. 2 serum and complement. Treatment of splenocytes from FLV-infected mice with neuraminidase restores, in large part, their susceptibility to anti-Thy- 1. 2 serum as well as their cytolytic capacity.

5000|$|L-selectin {{acts as a}} [...] "homing receptor" [...] for {{lymphocytes}} {{to enter}} secondary lymphoid tissues via high endothelial venules. Ligands present on endothelial cells will bind to lymphocytes expressing L-selectin, slowing lymphocyte trafficking through the blood, and facilitating entry into a secondary lymphoid organ at that point. The receptor is commonly found on the cell surfaces of T cells. Naive T-lymphocytes, which have not yet encountered their specific antigen, need to enter secondary lymph nodes to encounter their antigen. Central memory T-lymphocytes, which have encountered antigen, express L-selectin to localize in secondary lymphoid organs. Here they reside ready to proliferate upon re-encountering antigen. <b>Effector</b> memory <b>T-lymphocytes</b> do not express L-selectin, as they circulate in the periphery and have immediate effector functions upon encountering antigen.|$|R
5000|$|T-lymphocytes must receive costimulatory signal.

Receptor-ligand engagement triggers T-cell signaling resulting in IL-2 production, clonal expansion and therefore development of <b>effector</b> and memory <b>T-lymphocytes.</b> In contrast, there are also such receptors on T-lymphocytes that cause inhibition of T-cell activation (for instance CD152/CTLA-4 receptor which binds CD80 and CD86 as well).

40|$|In a {{mathematical}} model of the cellular immune response we investigate immune reactions to tumors that are introduced in various doses. The model represents macrophage T-lymphocyte interactions that generate cytotoxic macrophages and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. In this model antigens (tumors) can induce infinitely large T-lymphocyte effector populations because <b>effector</b> <b>T-lymphocytes</b> are capable of repeated proliferation and we have omitted immunosuppression. In this (proliferative) model small doses of weakly antigenic tumors grow infinitely large (i. e. sneak through) eliciting an immune response of limited magnitude. Intermediate doses of the same tumor induce larger immune responses and are hence rejected. Large doses of the tumor break through, but their progressive growth {{is accompanied by a}} strong immune response involving extensive lymphocyte proliferation. Similarly a more antigenic tumor is rejected in intermediate doses and breaks through in large doses. Initially small doses however lead to tumor dormancy. Thus although the model is devoid of explicit regulatory mechanisms that limit the magnitude of its response (immunosuppression is such a mechanism), the immune response to large increasing tumors may either be a stable reaction of limited magnitude (experimentally known as tolerance or unresponsiveness) or a strong and ever increasing reaction. Unresponsiveness can evolve because in this model net T-lymphocyte proliferation requires the presence of a minimum number of helper T cells (i. e. a proliferation threshold). Unresponsiveness is caused by depletion of helper T cell precursors...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Vulvar {{carcinoma}} has an {{incidence of}} 2 - 3 / 100. 000 women a year. Surgery {{is the primary}} treatment of vulvar carcinoma. Vulvar carcinoma has a good overall prognosis. However, 15 - 30 % of patients with vulvar carcinoma will develop recurrent disease. The principal mechanism of tumor immunology is eradication of tumor cells by tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TIL). TIL include regulatory CD 4 + T-lymphocytes (Treg) and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) among others. Tregs control immune responses and suppress <b>effector</b> <b>T-lymphocytes</b> like CTL. CTLs eradicate tumor cells. Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) is a tumor escape mechanism. IDO is an intracellular enzyme which catalyzes degradation of tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway. Depletion of tryptophan and production of tryptophan metabolites initiate T-lymphocyte apoptosis and activate Tregs. Tumors with high IDO activity have a poor overall survival. In this report we determined the immunologic characteristics of primary squamous cell vulvar carcinoma. Materials and Methods: Immunohistochemistry with anti-IDO, anti-CD 8 (CTL) and anti-FoxP 3 (Treg) antibodies was performed on tissue micro arrays with primary vulvar carcinoma. Expression of IDO activity and presence of CD 8 +- and FoxP 3 + T-lymphocytes were evaluated in 298 patients. Immunohistochemistry data were correlated with established prognostic parameters and survival. In serum of 20 patients with vulvar carcinoma the concentration kynurenine (kyn) and tryptophan (trp) was measured preoperatively, at complete remission and at recurrence of disease. The kyn/trp ratio was calculated, which reflects IDO activity in serum. IDO activity in serum was correlated with IDO activity in vulvar carcinoma. Results: TIL {{are present in the}} majority of vulvar carcinomas, however there is no relationship between presence of TIL and clinicopathological factors and survival. A minority of vulvar carcinomas express high IDO activity. There is no correlation between expression of IDO activity and clinicopathological factors and survival. An association is found between high IDO activity and age. Furthermore, there is no correlation between presence of TIL and IDO expression. No correlation was found between IDO activity in serum and IDO activity in tumors. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the immunological status of vulvar carcinoma in a large and well documented patient population. The immune system {{does not seem to be}} of great influence on vulvar carcinoma. ...|$|E
40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is one of}} the most common urological cancer. Conventional treatments result in only limited success. Recently, new agents for targeted cancer therapies were approved. These tyrosine kinases inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors block the growth and spread of cancer cells by interfering with specific molecules involved in tumor growth and progression. However, complete and durable remissions are rare. Therefore alternate therapeutic strategies are demanded. The company Mologen AG has developed a cell-based therapy for tumor vaccination. Thereby cells of a renal {{cell carcinoma}} cell line (B 25 -MOL) are genetically modified by in vitro transfection with four MIDGE® DNA vectors encoding co-stimulatory molecules (CD 80, CD 154) and cytokines (IL- 7, GM-CSF) and serve as active component in the tumor vaccine. As a result of gene modification and further effects, caused by the manufacturing process the phenotype of B 25 -MOL cells is changed. Using the DNA-Microarray technology the overall aim of this thesis was to elucidate the alterations of the gene expression profile of B 25 -MOL cells and vaccine cells. The comparison of gene expression profiles of native B 25 -MOL cells and vaccine cell results in a total of 392 differentially expressed genes (change in intensity of expression > 3). The focus of the research was on the biological context with potential impact on the mode of action of the tumor vaccine. The increased production of cytokines and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules by the vaccine cells may contribute to improved recruitment and activation of APC and immunological effector cells. Corresponding to this, preliminary Data of an on-going clinical study using dSLIM® in combination with modified tumor cells, that express CD 80, CD 154 and IL- 7 and GM-CSF, show promising efficacy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (Grünwald et al., 2013). This is mainly due to the expression of these four molecules through the vaccine cells. Besides this, increased expression of other immunostimulatory molecules and cytokines due to secondary effects probably contributes to this effect. Additionally, the increased expression of certain TNF receptors, may lead to an increased sensitivity against receptor-mediated apoptosis. No significant change in expression of genes that are involved in processing and presentation of antigens is observed. The expression level of MHC class I molecules on cell surface remains unchanged when comparing native B 25 -MOL cells with vaccine cells. Expression of co-stimulatory molecules as CD 80 enables the vaccine cells to present protein fragments of antigens (including TAA) and, as a consequence, activate <b>effector</b> <b>T-lymphocytes</b> directly. A variety of TAA exhibit a relatively high gene expression level in vaccine cells. In contrast, only a few of these genes show an altered gene expression level. Comparison of B 25 -Mol cells and vaccine cells by genome-wide expression analysis show mainly stable gene expression profiles. These minor changes in the expression profile induced by the manufacturing process are probably irrelevant for the mode of action. Expression of the four proteins encoded by the MIDGE® DNA vectors result in secondary effects that probably enhance the intended mode of action...|$|E

All vaccinated cats developed a humoral response which recognized the {{synthetic peptide}} immunogen and the intact viral core and envelope proteins.

40|$|Immunity to M. {{tuberculosis}} (MTB) infection {{consists of}} interactions between various T-cell subsets {{that control the}} infection and prevent further reactivation. We analysed the effector/memory T-cell dynamics and cytokines production in the peripheral blood of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). We observed that the frequency of CD 4 + T-cell effectors was significantly increased during active TB, confirming a major role of this T-cell subset in TB immunity. Pre-terminally differentiated CD 8 + T-lymphocytes were increased in the peripheral blood as well. In contrast, we observed a reduced number of <b>effector</b> mycobacteria-reactive gammadelta+ <b>T-lymphocytes</b> with a specific defects in reacting to mycobacterial nonpeptidic antigens, suggesting that this innate response is rapidly lost during TB infection. Nevertheless, the frequency of gammadelta+ T-cells effectors in TB patients was higher than the alphabeta+ T-cell response to peptide from MTB-ESAT- 6 protein and quantitatively similar to PPD reactivity. Thus, alphabeta+ and gammadelta+ T-cell differentiation and function are differently triggered by active TB infection...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether inhibitory natural killer {{cell receptor}} (iNKR) expression contributes to impaired antigen-specific cytotoxicity and interferon-c (IFN-c) production by CD 8 T cells during chronic infection. iNKR immunoglobulin-like transcript- 2 (ILT 2 ⁄ CD 85 j) is expressed on 40 – 55 % of cytomegalovirus (CMV) -, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) - and human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) -specific CD 8 T cells in both healthy and HIV-infected donors. Other iNKRs (CD 158 a, b 1, e 1 ⁄ e 2, k, CD 94 ⁄NKG 2 A) are expressed on only {{a small minority of}} CD 8 T cells and are not preferentially expressed on tetramer-staining virus-specific cells. In normal donors, ILT 2 is expressed largely on perforin+ CD 27 – effector cells. However, in HIV-infected donors, only a third of ILT 2 + cells are also perforin+. In both normal and HIV-infected donors, ILT 2 + cells are prone to spontaneous apoptosis. Therefore, ILT 2 is normally expressed during <b>effector</b> cytotoxic <b>T-lymphocyte</b> (CTL) differentiation, but can also be expressed when effector mat-uration is incomplete, as in HIV infection. The effect of ILT 2 on CD 8 cell function was assessed by preincubating effector cells with ILT 2 antibody. While blocking ILT 2 engagement has no appreciable effect on cytotoxicity, it increases antiviral IFN-c production by approximately threefold in both normal and HIV-infected donors. Thus, ILT 2 expression, increased on anti-viral CD 8 cells in chronic infection, may interfere with protective CD 8 T-cell function by suppressing IFN-c production...|$|R
40|$|Monocyte/macrophages are {{professional}} antigen-presenting {{cells of}} the cellular immune system, serving to generate peptides for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted recognition by CD 4 + <b>T-lymphocyte</b> <b>effector</b> cells.

To study simultaneous presentation of peptides derived from exogenous and endogenous proteins by human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, we isolated the peptides from a human immunodeficiency virus nef transfected U 937 monocytic cell line. The HLA class I-bound peptides were separated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography.

40|$|A {{relatively}} detailed {{model of}} experimentally described macrophage T-lymphocyte interactions has been developed. In this model we investigate the immune response to tumors that differ in antigenicity and/or in initial slee. Having deliberately {{omitted from the}} model tumor escape mechanisms (e. g. suppression, antigenic modulation or heterogeneity), we study the circumstances that nevertheless lead to progressive tumor growth. The model behavior shows that: (1) tumor antigenicity can best be {{defined in terms of}} helper T cell reactivity; (2) small differences in the availability of HTL (*) markedly influence tumor rejectability; (3) compared with the impact of macrophages, the impact of CTL increases more with increasing tumor antigenicity; and (4) sneaking through and tolerance are intrinsic to this model. HTL have a large impact on the model behavior (i. e. the immune response) because there are self-reinforcements in the HTL activation and proliferation process. Interestingly, unresponsiveness (tolerance) evolves in this model, despite the precense of these self-reinforcements end the absence of negative interactions (e. g. suppression). Tolerance ie caused by a proliferation threshold that comes into existence when <b>T-lymphocyte</b> <b>effectors</b> are made short-lived.

To determine whether analogous antigen receptor molecules and autocrine growth mechanisms are utilized by suppressor T-cells, we produced an anti-clonotypic monoclonal antibody against a non-cytotoxic T 8 + suppressor T-cell, T 8 AC 6, which defines a T 3 -associated disulphide-linked heterodimer of similar molecular weight to the above clonotypes. We find that Te-Ti triggering of suppressor clones (T 8 AC 6, T 8 AC 7 or T 8 RW) does not result in IL- 2 production or T-cell proliferation and in contrast to inducer clones, also leads to a transient IL- 2 unresponsive state.

40|$|Abstract. An {{intracellular}} staining {{technique of}} marker cytokines {{was applied for}} evaluation of quantitative distribution of <b>T-lymphocyte</b> <b>effector</b> subsets in children and adults. The {{results of this study}} have shown that the numbers of Th 2 lymphocytes in infants (7 to 12 months old) correspond to appropriate normal values in adults, being accompanied by decreased Th 1 and Тс 1 cell contents, whereas absolute amounts of Tc 2 lymphocytes proved to be higher than in all other age groups. Absolute counts of Th 17 and Tnc 17 subsets in infants of 7 to 12 months were higher than in adults. Hence, these infants exhibited a shift of immune response towards Th 2 (Tc 2) and Th 17 (Tnc 17), thus presenting a potential factor of Th 2 -mediated allergic disorders in the children under one year. In children over 1 year, absolute amounts of Th 1 and Тс 1, as well as Th 2 and Тс 2 lymphocyte counts did not significantly differ from adult values. Th 2 lymphocyte counts among adolescents (15 to 18 years) were decreased, along with relative increase of IL- 17 А-positive lymphocyte scores, thus reflecting a probable predisposition for autoimmune disorders induced at this age. The age-dependent increase in Th 1 and Тс 1 counts in children may immediately correlate with formation of T-cell memory pool. </p...|$|R

Unexpectedly, our studies revealed that the inactivation of the Vav 1 proto-oncogene favors the formation of lymphoblastic lymphoma-like tumors in aging mice. Those tumors, {{that can be found}} either localized exclusively inside the thymus or widely disseminated in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues, are composed of CD 3 (+) lymphoblasts that display heterogeneous combinations of CD 4 and CD 8 surface markers.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Previous work has demonstrated that rat sponge matrix allograft infiltrating cells produce more. N = O on stimulation with alloantigen than syngeneic graft-infiltrating cells. Addition of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA), an inhibitor of. N = O synthesis, promotes allospecific cytolytic <b>T-lymphocyte</b> <b>effector</b> function. METHODS: Polyurethane sponges were implanted subcutaneously in recipient Lewis rats and injected with 10 x 10 (6) ACl splenocytes. On various days after grafting, graft-infiltrating cells were harvested for in vitro study. Adherent macrophages from the graft infiltrating cell population were obtained by a 2 - to 3 -hour incubation to plastic dishes with subsequent washing to remove nonadherent cells. RESULTS: Stimulation of unseparated graft-infiltrating cell populations with lipopolysaccharide or interferon-tau resulted in enhanced. N = O synthesis by allograft infiltrating cells compared with syngeneic graft-infiltrating cells, early after grafting. Macrophages recovered from an allograft site spontaneously produce more. N = O than macrophages recovered from syngeneic grafts (p < 0. 001). Significantly enhanced levels of.

A marked suppression of the thymus-derived (T) lymphocyte response to concanavalin A has been demonstrated in vitro during renal infection and the mechanisms by which suppression occurs have been investigated. In particular we have considered the possibility that suppression might result from the inhibitory effect of prostaglandins, secreted by activated macrophages with immunoregulatory potential. The experiments {{have shown that the}} <b>T-lymphocyte</b> <b>effector</b> status in experimentally-induced renal infection is determined by two suppressor cells, one infection-induced and the other naturally occurring. The inability to respond to mitogenic stimulation was reversible and restoration of immune responsiveness to splenic lymphocytes from infected animals could be achieved in two stepwise manipulations; differential centrifugation removed the infection-induced suppressor cells, and the suppressor activity of the naturally occurring suppressor cells could then be inhibited by indomethacin. Thus the two suppressor cells were distinguishable {{on the basis of their}} physical characteristics and their response to indomethacin. The dominant factor determining the immune responsiveness of splenic lymphocytes from the pyelonephritic animals was, however, the infection-induced suppressor cell. This cell has been characterized as a sedimentable cell (30 g) with suppressor activity demonstrable in co-culture experiments. Plastic-adherent cells from the sedimentable fraction of pyelonephritic animals' splenic cells were shown to have suppressor activity that was not inhibited by indomethacin.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} {{for the first}} time the behaviour of CD 4 +FOXP 3 + T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood of human subjects undergoing a psychological stressor. It has previously been shown that acute psychological stress alerts the adaptive immune response causing an increase in antigen-experienced effector T cells in the peripheral blood. Tregs play a central role in maintaining self-tolerance and controlling autoimmune responses. 31 healthy young males underwent a brief laboratory stressor and, in a crossover design, served as their own unstressed controls. Effects of acute stress on CD 4 +FOXP 3 + T regulatory cells and other T cell subpopulations have been quantified using flow cytometry. In addition, the expression of Treg-related effector molecules has been analyzed in the subjects’ peripheral CD 4 + T cells. Acute psychological stress caused a decrease in CD 4 +FOXP 3 + Tregs and in CD 4 + T cells expressing Treg-related <b>effector</b> molecules “Cytotoxic <b>T-lymphocyte</b> associated protein- 4 ” (CTLA- 4) and “Latency Associated Peptide” (LAP). The previous observation of a stress-induced decrease in CD 45 RA+CCR 7 + “naïve” and CD 45 RA-CCR 7 + “central memory” T cells has been confirmed while CD 45 RA-CCR 7 - “effector memory” and CD 45 RA+CCR 7 - “terminally differentiated” effector T cells remained stable or increased. In conclusion, inhibiting components of the adaptive immune response, like Tregs, are down-regulated during an acute stress-induced activation of the adaptive immune response. In situations of repeated stress exposition, this scenario might result in an exacerbation of inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune diseases...|$|R
