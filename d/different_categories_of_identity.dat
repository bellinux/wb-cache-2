50|$|More {{contemporary}} scholars {{attempt to}} understand the intersecting points of femininity and complicate our common assumptions about gender politics by accessing <b>different</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> (race, class, sexual orientation, etc.) The ultimate goal {{of any of these}} tools is to uncover and expose patriarchal underlying tensions within novels and interrogate the ways in which our basic literary assumptions about such novels are contingent on female subordination. In this way, the accessibility of literature broadens to a far more inclusive and holistic population. Moreover, works that historically received little or no attention, given the historical constraints around female authorship in some cultures, are able to be heard in their original form and unabridged. This makes a broader collection of literature for all readers insofar as all great works of literature are given exposure without bias towards a gender influenced system.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the accounts of}} mothers who have been using illegal drugs, have received treatment and {{are in the process}} of recovering. The data is based on 19 individual interviews conducted between May and December 2005 in two institutions for female drug users in southern Finland. The primary aim is to discuss the self-conceptions of the inter-viewed women as they related their experiences with social workers and the child welfare system. The study relies on the social constructionist view <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> as a self-construction created in situations of interaction and routines of everyday life. As a result, four <b>different</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> motherhood <b>identities</b> and their connections to the various positions of child welfare authorities identified in the interviews of women with drug histories are presented: Responsible moth-erhood – asking for help, Giving up motherhood – submitting to outside forces, Strategic motherhood – learning to cope and Stigmatized motherhood – fighting back. Asking help from child welfare services was the only category in which the mothers were able to manifest responsible motherhood and co-operate with social workers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the thought of}} Joan <b>of</b> Arc for <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> paving the way to modern nationalism. The underlying model for this undertaking is Ernst Kantorowicz's theory of the increasing depersonalization or abstractness of power. With this model as a guide, this thesis proposes a set <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> on which {{the process of change}} put forward by Kantorowicz can be tracked. The thesis then classifies, against this backdrop, the individual categories as either progressive, i. e. abstract, or concrete, i. e. dependent on the older ideas of power and kingship, arguing that the concrete categories may be associated with the principles of popular mentality as described by Aron Gurevich. It turns out, however, that clear-cut criteria distinguishing concrete and abstract categories are difficult to establish and, {{at the end of the}} day, we have to settle for a simplifying and not entirely satisfactory classification. The analytical part of the thesis then examines what instances <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> can be found in the minutes of the interrogation of Joan of Arc. The overwhelming majority <b>of</b> these <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity,</b> it turns out, fall under the 'concrete' label. Such a result seems to correspond very well with the Gurevichian idea of difference, although by no means an absolute [...] ...|$|R
