5|$|October 29, 2012– Hurricane Sandy makes {{landfall}} {{north of}} the state. However, due to the tremendous size of the storm, its effects were <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> over Maryland. During {{the peak of the}} storm, 60mph sustained winds were felt from Frederick, Maryland eastward. However, power outages were not widespread and any problems were solved quickly due to better preparation. Heavy rain affected the state, with up to a foot of rain falling in some spots. Storm surge was also a large factor along the beaches, washing out many piers and some boardwalks along Ocean City. Hurricane Sandy is the deadliest tropical cyclone to affect the state, causing 11 deaths.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General P. P. Kumaramangalam was due {{to retire}} in June 1969. Though Manekshaw was the most senior {{commander}} in army, Defence Minister Sardar Swaran Singh was in favour of Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, who had {{played a key role}} as the GOC-in-C of Western Command during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war. Despite this, Manekshaw was appointed as the 8th Chief of the Army Staff on 8 June 1969. As the Chief of the Army Staff, he developed the Indian Army into an efficient instrument of war. During his tenure as COAS, he was instrumental in stopping the implementation of reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the army. Though he was Parsi, a minority group in India, Mankeshaw felt that implementing reservations would compromise the ethos of the army; he also <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> must be given an equal chance.|$|E

Furthermore, what explicitly appears in Wetti's visions not only reveals {{a great deal about}} his perspectives on wealth, lust, gender relations and monastic responsibility, but also the degree to which these issues (excluding monasticism) pervaded all levels of lay and religious officialdom in 9th-century Carolingian France. Clearly, he saw these as something debasing and degrading Frankish society, however, {{it is also clear that}} because of his monastic training in humility, he <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> but unable to speak out against them.|$|E

We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

She told him of the family's plan to visit Geneva for Christmas; Balzac agreed to visit {{before the end of the}} year.

500|$|By this time, Virginia had {{developed}} consumption, first seen {{sometime in the}} middle of January 1842. While singing and playing the piano, Virginia began to bleed from the mouth, though Poe said she merely [...] "ruptured a blood-vessel". Her health declined and she became an invalid, which drove Poe into a deep depression, especially as she occasionally showed signs of improvement. In a letter to a friend, Poe described his resulting mental state: [...] "Each time I <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> the agonies of her deathand at each accession of the disorder I loved her more dearly & clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity.

The {{following}} April, Saban brought in quarterback Babe Parilli, who formerly played for the Browns and Green Bay Packers, as a backup in the AFL's biggest-ever trade at the time. Five games into the season, however, with the Patriots at 2–3, Saban was fired and replaced by assistant Mike Holovak. Patriots owner Billy Sullivan said {{the decision was made}} by a majority vote of the team's board of directors, who [...] "just simply <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> the talent on our team had not been used and felt Mike was the man who would {{be able to use the}} talent we had to the extent that it is capable of performing." ...|$|E

500|$|Since the {{earthquake}} caused only minor ground movement, {{and was only}} lightly <b>felt,</b> <b>all</b> the damage that occurred on the island {{was due to the}} tsunami.

A tsunami flow depth of [...] usually resulted in complete destruction of these types of structures. A group of scientists that evaluated the damage considered the unreinforced brick construction as weak, because the performance of homes constructed in that style did not fare much better than the timber/bamboo variety.

500|$|Australia's {{opportunity}} came at Headingley, a Test {{described by}} Bradman {{as the best}} he ever played in. England batted first and made 223. During the Australian innings, Bradman backed himself by opting to bat on in poor light conditions, reasoning that Australia could score more runs in bad light on a good wicket than on a rain affected wicket in good light, {{when he had the}} option to go off. He scored 103 {{out of a total of}} 242 and the gamble paid off, as it meant there was sufficient time to push for victory when an England collapse left them a target of only 107 to win. Australia slumped to 4/61, with Bradman out for 16. An approaching storm threatened to wash the game out, but the poor weather held off and Australia managed to secure the win, a victory that retained the Ashes. For the only time in his life, the tension of the occasion got to Bradman and he could not watch the closing stages of play, a reflection of the pressure that he <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> tour: he described the captaincy as [...] "exhausting" [...] and said he [...] "found it difficult to keep going".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{wrote that}} [...] "Throughout the album, Madonna proves that she's a terrific singer whose voice has {{improved}} over the years." [...] He added, [...] "Not {{one of the}} tracks is second-rate, and the best songs on Something to Remember rank among the best pop music of the '80s and '90s". Neil Strauss of The New York Times <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> the songs on the album [...] "cohere better than a greatest-hits package would" [...] and [...] "they tell a story of their own, of a voice and attitude that have hardened in the dozen years that have elapsed between the bubble-gum-chomping innocence of 1983's 'Crazy for You' and the tortured torch singing of the new 'You'll See'." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "By placing her greatest-hit ballads ('Live to Tell', 'Crazy for You', 'Take a Bow', etc.) in a new context—that is, separated from her more attention-getting dance music—Madonna reinvigorates them, which is just what a good best-of compilation is supposed to do. The three new songs 'You'll See', 'One More Chance', and a wonderfully eerie version of Marvin Gaye's 'I Want You' are consumer enticements that just add to the allure." ...|$|E
500|$|... "G.U.Y." [...] was {{included}} in the setlist of her Manhattan residency show at Roseland Ballroom.

She {{stood in the middle of}} the Ballroom stage and sang the opening lyrics while purple neon lights flooded the stage. On April 2, her performance of the song was broadcast on Late Show with David Letterman along with her song [...] "Dope". Amanda Holpuch from The Guardian recalled that the performance of [...] "G.U.Y." [...] received [...] "as much love as [...] first big hit 'Just Dance'". April Spanos from The Village Voice rendered the performances of [...] "Applause" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y." [...] as the [...] "power duo" [...] of the night. She added that the latter was [...] "particularly pleasant to hear live; the Zedd beat was made to be experienced in a club and its crunch was <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> over the dancefloor." [...] Conversely, Hilary Hughes from USA Today felt that the simplest moments of the performances were the ones featuring toned down versions of her singles like [...] "Born This Way" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", rather than the [...] "extravagant" [...] choreography during [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y." [...] On the final day of the Roseland shows, Gaga took a bow with her dancers after the performance, saying [...] "Roseland, thank you for all the wonderful memories you've given us...

500|$|As no {{studio was}} big enough for the {{interior}} of Stromberg's supertanker, and set designer Ken Adam {{did not want to}} repeat what he had done with SPECTRE's volcano base in You Only Live Twice— [...] "a workable but ultimately wasteful set"— construction began in March 1976 of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the 007 Stage, at a cost of $1.8 million. To complement this stage, Eon also paid for building a water tank capable of storing approximately 1,200,000 gallons (5,500,000 litres). The soundstage was so huge that cinematographer Claude Renoir found himself unable to effectively light it due to his deteriorating eyesight, and so Stanley Kubrick visited the production, in secret, to advise on how to light the stage. For the exterior, while Shell was willing to lend an abandoned tanker to the production, the elevated insurance and safety risks caused it to be replaced with miniatures built by Derek Meddings' team and shot in the Bahamas. Stromberg's shark tank was also filmed in the Bahamas, using a live shark in a saltwater swimming pool. Adam decided to do experiments with curved shapes for the scenery, as he <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> his previous setpieces were [...] "too linear". This was demonstrated with the Atlantis, which is a dome and curved surfaces outside, and many curved objects in Stromberg's office inside. For Gogol's offices, Adam wanted an open space to contrast M's enclosed headquarters, and drew inspiration from Sergei Eisenstein to do a [...] "Russian crypt-like" [...] set.|$|E
500|$|Nevada was {{the first}} {{battleship}} in the US Navy to have triple gun turrets, a single funnel, and an oil-fired steam power plant. In particular, {{the use of the}} more-efficient oil gave the ship an advantage over earlier coal-fired plants. Nevada was also the first US battleship with geared turbines, which also helped increase fuel economy and thus range compared to earlier direct drive turbines. The ability to steam great distances without refueling was a major concern of the General Board at that time. In 1903, the Board <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> American battleships should have a minimum steaming radius of [...] so that the US could enforce the Monroe Doctrine. One of the main purposes of the Great White Fleet, which sailed around the world in 1907–1908, was to prove to Japan that the US Navy could [...] "carry any naval conflict into Japanese home waters". Possibly as a result of this, battleships after 1908 were mainly designed to [...] "steam 8,000miles at cruising speeds"; given the distance between San Pedro, where the fleet would be based, and Manila, where the Fleet was expected to have to fight under War Plan Orange, was , endurance was obviously a major concern for the U.S. Navy. Also, oil allowed for the boiler-room crew to be reduced— the engineer on [...] estimated that 100 firemen (stokers) and 112 coal passers could be adequately replaced by just 24 men, which would allow some crew's quarters to be eliminated; this would save weight and also reduce the amount of fresh water and provisions that the ship would have to carry.|$|E
500|$|Spears {{originally}} envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary", but <b>felt</b> <b>all</b> {{right with}} her label's producers, since [...] "It made {{more sense to}} go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." [...] The album opens with the first single [...] "...Baby One More Time", a teen pop and dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] (1977), [...] "Start Me Up" [...] (1981), [...] "These Words" [...] (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws {{due to the fact}} the track [...] "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is composed by [...] "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." [...] The next song and third single, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] runs through a moderately slow dance beat, and has a rhythm and blues melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single [...] "Sometimes" [...] is a ballad, that Spears begins with [...] "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too close I move away". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has [...] "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm." ...|$|E
