50|$|The {{process of}} binary fission in {{bacteria}} involves the following steps. First, the cell's DNA is replicated. The replicated DNA copies then move to opposite poles {{of the cell}} in an energy-dependent process. The cell lengthens. Then, the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> of the cell constricts and separates the plasma membrane such that each new cell has exactly the same genetic material.|$|E
5000|$|Metaphase (from the Greek μετά, [...] "adjacent" [...] and φάσις, [...] "stage") is a {{stage of}} mitosis in the {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle in which chromosomes are at their second-most condensed and coiled stage (they are at their most condensed in anaphase). These chromosomes, carrying genetic information, align in the equator of the cell before being separated into {{each of the two}} daughter cells. Metaphase accounts for approximately 4% of the cell cycle's duration.Preceded by events in prometaphase and followed by anaphase, microtubules formed in prophase have already found and attached themselves to kinetochores in metaphase.In metaphase, the centromeres of the chromosomes convene themselves on the metaphase plate (or <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate),</b> an imaginary line that is equidistant from the two centrosome poles. This even alignment ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cell cycle}} begins with {{interphase}} when the DNA replicates, the cell grows and prepares to enter mitosis. Mitosis includes four phases, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Prophase is the initial phase when spindle fibers appear that function {{to move the}} chromosomes toward opposite poles. This spindle apparatus consists of microtubules, microfilaments and a complex network of various proteins. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up using the spindle apparatus {{in the middle of}} the cell along the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate.</b> The chromosomes move to opposite poles during anaphase and remain attached to the spindle fibers by their centromeres. Animal cell cleavage furrow formation is caused by a ring of actin microfilaments called the contractile ring, which forms during early anaphase. Myosin is present in the region of the contractile ring as concentrated microfilaments and actin filaments are predominant in this region. The actin filaments here are both pre-existing and new. Cleavage is driven by these motor proteins, actin and myosin, which are the same proteins involved with muscle contraction. During cellular cleavage, the contractile ring tightens around the cytoplasm of the cell until the cytoplasm is pinched into two daughter cells. During the final phase of mitosis, telophase, the furrow forms an intercellular bridge using mitotic spindle fibers. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) has been shown to be present during this time which indicates that is may play a role in movement between the plasma membrane and contractile ring. The bridge is then broken and resealed to form two identical daughter cells during cytokinesis. The breakage is formed by microtubules and the resealing is negated by Calcium dependent exocytosis using Golgi vesicles. In comparison, the plant cell septum and the animal cell mid-zone are analogous. Both require vesicular secretions by the Golgi apparatus for resealing and formation of the cytoskeletal network in addition to microtubules and microfilaments for division and movement. The cleavage furrow mechanism in animal cells is a complex network of actin and myosin filaments, Golgi vesicles and Calcium dependent channels enabling the cell to break apart, reseal and form new daughter cells with complete membranes.|$|E

Apart from an initial period of 30 min, metaphases have well developed <b>equatorial</b> <b>plates</b> and chromosomes are discrete from one another. By employing a standardized continuous wash procedure for detachment of dividing cells during exposure of HeLa monolayers to hypertonicity, excellent yields of mitotic cells con-sisting almost entirely of metaphases were obtained. They compared favourably with a col-cemid control and were superior in yield and synchrony to isotonic collection of mitotic cells. This method is compared with a manual shake-off procedure. Reversibility of the hypertonically collected metaphases by dilution allowed excellent synchronous progression of cells out of mitosis and into their next division 24 h later. Recovery was also studied by conventional plating and growth-kinetic studies to establish the loss of viability after exposure of cells to varying degrees of hypertonicity. It is concluded that the arrest of cells in metaphase by hypertonicity and the ease of detach-ment of arrested cells from monolayers offers an excellent synchronizing procedure for HeLa cells...|$|R

In this male-sterile, female-fertile mutant, up to metaphase II, the meiotic behavior {{was similar to that}} described for the st series of synaptic mutants previously reported in soybean. Besides many univalents, few or total absence of bivalents were recorded in diakinesis. Bivalents presented one or two terminal chiasmata, while univalents retained the sister chromatid cohesion. Bivalents and most univalents congregated at the <b>equatorial</b> metaphase <b>plate,</b> although univalents frequently migrated to the poles prematurely. Laggards resulting from delay in chiasmata terminalization were also recorded. Distinctly different in their behavior from st series soybean mutants, telophase I-originated micronuclei of different sizes organized their own spindle in the second division. This behavior contributed towards an increase in genome fractionation. Several microspores and microcytes of different sizes were recorded at the end of meiosis. Pollen sterility was estimated at 91. 2 %. Segregation ratio for sterility in this line and its progenies reached 3 : 1. Allelism tests with st series of synaptic mutants are in progress.

40|$|In mitosis, {{the spindle}} {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) prevents anaphase onset until all chromosomes have been {{attached to the}} spindle microtubules and aligned correctly at the <b>equatorial</b> metaphase <b>plate.</b> The major checkpoint proteins in mitosis consist of mitotic arrest-deficient (Mad) 1 – 3, budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (Bub) 1, Bub 3, and monopolar spindle 1 (Mps 1). During meiosis, {{for the formation of}} a haploid gamete, two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation occur with only one round of DNA replication. To pull homologous chromosomes to opposite spindle poles during meiosis I, both sister kinetochores of a homologue must face toward the same pole which is very different from mitosis and meiosis II. As a core member of checkpoint proteins, the individual role of Bub 3 in mammalian oocyte meiosis is unclear. In this study, using overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches, we analyzed the role of Bub 3 in mouse oocyte meiosis. Our data showed that overexpressed Bub 3 inhibited meiotic metaphase-anaphase transition by preventing homologous chromosome and sister chromatid segregations in meiosis I and II, respectively. Misaligned chromosomes, abnormal polar body and double polar bodies were observed in Bub 3 knock-down oocytes, causing aneuploidy. Furthermore, through cold treatment combined with Bub 3 overexpression, we found that overexpressed Bub 3 affected the attachments of microtubules and kinetochores during metaphase-anaphase transition. We propose that as a member of SAC, Bub 3 is required for regulation of both meiosis I and II, and is potentially involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment i...|$|R
40|$|The paper starts by {{describing}} the normal embryonic {{development of the}} plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and the flounder (Pleuronectes flesus) up {{to the formation of}} the embryo. The development is divided into fourteen stages, a schedule of which is given. The embryonic development of the two species is exactly similar, the only difference being the comparative size of their eggs, blastodiscs and cells. The size proportion between the two species is however not constant, but {{in the course of the}} development changes in favour of the flounder. The size proportion between the blastodiscs of the plaice and the flounder which at first is approximately 2 :l will thus change to about 3 : 2 later in the development. The rate of development of the flounder is greater than that of the plaice. The flounder-embryo with optic vescles is formed after about 98 hours, the plaice embryo after about 122 hours. This lead increases during the later stages of the development, since the hatching of the flounder eggs occurs 6 - 8 days earlier than that of the plaice eggs. The organological and histological development of both the hybrid forms does not differ from that of the parents. But the size of the blastodisc and the cells and the rate of development until the formation of the embryo are in complete accordance with the mother-form. Later the influence of the father on the rate of development becomes noticeable, the hybrid plaice ♀ x flounder ♂ will now develop faster than the mother but slower than the father, and the hybrid flounder ♀ x plaice ♂ slower than the mother but faster than the father. Under the temperature -conditions prevailing during this experiment both the hybrid forms were hatched after a period of 12 days, the flounder after 9 days and the plaice after 15 - 16 days. Neasurements of nuclei from plaice, flounder and their reciprocal hybrids gave the following results: The nuclear size decreases during the development in all four forms. In the first part of the development until stage 8 the author found especially in the plaice and the hybrid plaice ♀ flounder ♂ great variations in the nuclear size of different individuals from the same stage. These individual variations suggest complications due to a haploid or polyploid development. But probably all of these abnormal eggs die before gastrulation, only normal ones developing further. In almost all stages the plaice has a greater nuclear size than the flounder, a fact which according to studies of <b>equatorial</b> <b>plates,</b> is a consequence not of a greater number, but rather of a greater size of the plaice chromosomes. One should expect the nuclear size of the hybrids to be intermediate between those of the parents, but the curves do not give a clear confirmation of this probably on account of an insufficient number of measurements. But the curves do show that in the latest stages the nuclear size of the hybrids seems to approach that of the flounder. This may indicate that some of the father chromosomes of the hybrids are ejected. Since the cellsize of the hybrids corresponds with that of the mother, but the nuclear size differs from the nuclear size of both the mother and the father, the nucleus-plasma-relation of the hybrids and their parents is different. Until the age of 49 - 56 days after the fecundation the growth of the fry shows great individual variations. The author did not succeed in breeding the flounder and the hybrid flounder ♀ x plaice ♂, therefore the following growth-dates only concern the plaice and the hybrid plaice ♀ x flounder ♂. The mean length of 355 plaices was 16. 58 mm ± 0. 6, whereas 114 and 142 hybrids showed a mean length of respectively 17. 88 mm ± 0. 9 and 16. 08 mm ± 0. 7. The results indicate that the growth rate of the hybrid plaice ♀ x flounder ♂ does not differ from that of the plaice in the first months of their lives...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the process of somatic-type cytokinesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) meristem cells with a three-dimensional resolution of ~ 7 nm by electron tomography of high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples. Our data demonstrate that this process {{can be divided into}} four phases: phragmoplast initials, solid phragmoplast, transitional phragmoplast, and ring-shaped phragmoplast. Phragmoplast initials arise from clusters of polar microtubules (MTs) during late anaphase. At their <b>equatorial</b> planes, cell <b>plate</b> assembly sites are formed, consisting of a filamentous ribosomeexcluding cell plate assembly matrix (CPAM) and Golgi-derived vesicles. The CPAM, which is found only around growing cell plate regions, is suggested to be responsible for regulating cell plate growth. Virtually all phragmoplast MTs terminate inside the CPAM. This association directs vesicles to the CPAM and thereby to the growing cell plate. Cell plate formation within the CPAM appears to be initiated by the tethering of vesicles by exocyst-like complexes. After vesicle fusion, hourglass-shaped vesicle intermediates are stretched to dumbbells by a mechanism that appears to involve the expansion of dynamin-like springs. This stretching process reduces vesicle volume by ~ 50 %. At the same time, the lateral expansion of the phragmoplast initials and their CPAMs gives rise to the solid phragmoplast. Later arriving vesicles begin to fuse to the bulbous ends of the dumbbells, giving rise to the tubulo-vesicular membrane network (TVN). During the transitional phragmoplast stage, the CPAM and MTs disassemble and then reform in a peripheral ring phragmoplast configuration. This creates the centrifugally expanding peripheral cell plate growth zone, which leads to cell plate fusion with the cell wall...|$|R
40|$|The meiotic {{behaviour}} of the X chromosome and one autosomal pair of the heteropteran Triatoma infestans was analysed {{by means}} of C-banding plus DAPI staining. At ®rst metaphase, the X univalent is oriented with its long axis parallel to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate,</b> which suggests a holocentric interaction with the spindle ®bres. After this initial orientation, kinetic activity is restricted to one of both chromatid ends. The election of the active chromatid end is random and it is independent of the end selected in the sister chromatid. At second metaphase, the X and Y chromatids associate side by side forming a pseudobivalent. After that, the kinetic activity is again restricted to either of both chromosomal ends in a random fashion. At ®rst metaphase, the fourth autosomal bivalent shows two alternative random orientations depending on the chromosome end showing kinetic activity (DAPI positive or opposite). At second metaphase, half bivalents are oriented with their long axis parallel to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate.</b> Three different segregation patterns are observed. The kinetic activity can be localised: (i) in the end with the DAPI signal (46. 9 %), (ii) in the opposite end (44. 6 %) or (iii) in one DAPI-positive end in one chromatid and in the opposite end in the other one (8. 5 %). The existence of the last pattern indicates that the same end can show kinetic activity during both meiotic divisions.

40|$|The {{equatorial}} Pacific {{is a major}} {{region of}} biological production in the world oceans and {{an important part of}} the global carbon cycle. Changes in climate during the Cenozoic (65 Ma to present) have impacted the carbon cycle, and it is important to assess these impacts. This study focuses on the primary productivity of the equatorial Pacific during the early to middle Miocene (24 - 12 Ma) as recorded by Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 574, and investigates the sedimentary components potentially linked to productivity: bio-Ba, bio-SiO?, Corg, CaCO?, and uranium, as well as detrital thorium to estimate clay-bound barium. Within this time frame the plate beneath Site 574 traveled northwesterly across the equator and allows a unique opportunity to monitor changes in productivity and the carbon cycle in this region. It is difficult to determine directly primary productivity from the sedimentary record because the preservation of different proxies for this parameter - Corg, bio-CaCO?, and bio-SiO?, can be highly variable. The variability has many causes, including nutrient recycling in the water column and the depth of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD), which prevents the preservation and ultimate burial of plankton debris at the seafloor. To interpret the production versus deposition rates during the early and middle Miocene, proxies were used in conjunction with direct measurements of biogenic remains. By determining the concentrations of biogenically produced barium (bio-Ba), which is less affected by degradation, it is evident that the mass of Corg produced was much greater than that preserved in the sediments. We observed higher deposition of bio-Ba and bio- SiO? as the site was transported over the <b>equatorial</b> divergence by <b>plate</b> tectonics, as expected. In contrast, CaCO?, accumulation was low in the divergence region, and coincides with a dissolution event known from other site studies in the equatorial Pacific. The pattern of uranium deposition resembles CaCO? and Corg, and average U concentrations suggest that it was primarily deposited as a trace element in the shell material of biogenic carbonate. Corg also resembles CaCO? and appears to represent primarily a dissolution signal. Total uranium analysis proved to be a useful proxy for Corg and CaCO? preservation, and analysis of detrital thorium (???Th) concentration suggests very limited terrigenous clay input. Comparison of the different proxies reveals carbonate preservation events, changes in Corg preservation, and changes in deposition as DSDP Site 574 migrated northwesterly across the equator...|$|R

PTPIP 51 mRNA is expressed in all stages of the cell cycle; it is highly expressed six hours post-nocodazole treatment and minimally expressed one hour post-nocodazole treatment. Recent investigations located PTPIP 51 protein at the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate.</b> This study reports the localization of the PTPIP 51 /CGI- 99 and the PTPIP 51 /Nuf- 2 complex at the equatorial region during mitosis. Moreover, Duolink proximity ligation assays revealed an association of PTPIP 51 with the microtubular cytoskeleton and the spindle apparatus. High amounts of phosphorylated PTPIP 51 associated with the spindle poles was seen by confocal microscopy. In parallel a strong interaction of PTPIP 51 with the epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylating PTPIP 51 at the tyrosine 176 residue was seen. In the M/G 1 transition {{a high level of}} interaction between PTPIP 51 and PTP 1 B was registered, thus restoring the interaction of PTPIP 51 and Raf- 1, depleted in mitotic cells.

40|$|During {{preprophase}} in the chloromonadophycean alga Vacuolaria virescens microtubules {{are present}} around the flagellar basal bodies and extend over the anterior {{surface of the}} nucleus. These microtubules assist in {{the separation of the}} flagella and later enter the nucleus through polar gaps. During prophase the nucleoli begin to disperse and the chromosomes become condensed. At metaphase the nucleus assumes an elliptical shape and an <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> of chromosomes becomes aligned across the long axis of the nucleus; kinetochores are recogni-zable on some of the chromosomes. The nuclear envelope remains intact over most of the surface and in places it forms folds. During anaphase chromosomes are less distinct and vesicles are present in the elongating nucleus. Most of the new nuclear envelope around the progeny nuclei is formed by coalescence of these membrane vesicles during late anaphase and telophase, although some of the original nuclear envelope may also become incorporated. During telophase disintegration of the original nuclear envelope becomes pronounced and portions of this structure are recognizable in the cytoplasm after completion of mitosis. It is suggested that this unusual type of nuclear envelope behaviour may be important in ensuring the segregation of the Golgi apparatus and contractile vacuole to progeny cells...|$|E
40|$|The actin {{cytoskeleton}} (microfilaments, MFs) {{accompanies the}} tubulin cytoskeleton (microtubules) during the meiotic {{division of the}} cell, but knowledge about the scope of their physiological competence and cooperation is insufficient. To cast more light on this issue, we analysed the F-actin distribution during the meiotic division of the Psilotum nudum sporocytes. Unfixed sporangia of P. nudum were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole dihydrochloride, and we monitored {{the changes in the}} actin cytoskeleton and nuclear chromatin throughout sporogenesis. We observed that the actin cytoskeleton in meiotically dividing cells is not only part of the kariokinetic spindle and phragmoplast but it also forms a well-developed network in the cytoplasm present in all phases of meiosis. Moreover, in telophase I F-actin filaments formed short-lived phragmoplast, which was adjacent to the plasma membrane, exactly at the site of future cell wall formation. Additionally, the meiocytes were pre-treated with cytochalasin-B at a concentration that causes damage to the MFs. This facilitated observation of the effect of selective MFs damage on the course of meiosis and sporogenesis of P. nudum. Changes were observed that occurred in the cytochalasin-treated cells: the daughter nuclei were located abnormally close to each other, there was no formation of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> of organelles and, consequently, meiosis did not occur normally.

40|$|TFIIB ({{transcription}} factor IIB) is a {{transcription factor}} {{that provides a}} bridge between promoter-bound TFIID and RNA polymerase II, {{and it is a}} target of various transcriptional activator proteins that stimulate the pre-initiation complex assembly. The localization and/or attachment matrix of TFIIB in the cytoplast is not well understood. This study focuses on the function of TFIIB and its interrelationship with α-tubulins in a mouse model. During oocyte maturation TFIIB distributes throughout the entire nucleus of the germinal vesicle (GV). After progression to GV breakdown (GVBD), TFIIB and α-tubulin co-localize and accumulate {{in the vicinity of the}} condensed chromosomes. During the MII stage, the TFIIB signals are more concentrated at the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> and the kinetochores. Colcemid treatment of oocytes disrupts the microtubule (MT) system, although the TFIIB signals are still present with the altered MT state. Injection of oocytes with TFIIB antibodies and siRNAs causes abnormal spindle formation and irregular chromosome alignment. These findings suggest that TFIIB dissociates from the condensed chromatids and then tightly binds to microtubules from GVBD to the MII phase. The assembly and disassembly of TFIIB may very well be associated with and driven by microtubules. TFIIB maintains its contact with the α-tubulins and its co-localization forms a unique distribution pattern.

40|$|According to {{the minimum}} {{interaction}} theory, the chromosome evolution of eukaryotes proceeds {{as a whole}} toward increasing the chromosome number. This raises the following two questions: what was the starting chromosome number of eukaryotes and does the chromosome number increase infinitely? We attempted to provide a theoretical framework to resolve these questions. We propose that the species with n= 2 observed in Protozoa, Platyhelminthes, Annelid, Algae, Fungi and higher plants would be chromosomal relicts conserving the karyotypes of ancestral eukaryotes. We also propose that the ideal highest number of eukaryotes (nmax) can be given by an inverse of the minimum terminal interference distance (Itmin) in crossing-over (nmax= 100 /Itmin). AsItmin = 0. 6 in mammals, nmax≈ 166. On the other hand, the value estimated by computer simulations is somewhat lower with nmax= 133 – 138. Our arguments {{can be applied to}} other eukaryotes, if they have a localized centromere and the ratio of total synaptonemal complex/nuclear volume is comparable to that of mammals. We revealed that the index of gene shuffling per karyotypes (G) by means {{of the total number of}} gamete types with different gene combinations can be formulated asG = 2 n+Fxi, where Fxi means interstitial chiasma frequency per cell corresponding to crossing-over mediated by the recombination nodule. The Fxi value increases in proportion to the n value in areas where n 40 and becomes zero when n> 83.

In germinal vesicle-stage oocytes, iNOS immunoreactivity was mainly localized in the germinal vesicle. Shortly after germinal vesicle breakdown, the iNOS immunoreactivity accumulated around the condensed chromosomes. At metaphase I and metaphase II, with the organization of chromosomes to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate,</b> iNOS immunoreactivity was concentrated around the aligned chromosomes, putatively {{the position of the}} metaphase spindle. The accumulation of iNOS immunoreactivity could not be detected at anaphase I and anaphase II. However, at telophase I and telophase II, the staining of iNOS was concentrated in the region between the separating chromosomes/chromatids. Furthermore, the staining of iNOS also accumulated in the male and female pronuclei in fertilized eggs. Germinal vesicle breakdown and the first polar body emission of the oocytes were significantly blocked by the iNOS-specific inhibitor AG in a dose-dependent manner. The germinal vesicle breakdown in oocytes injected with NOS antibody was also inhibited. We found that the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in oocytes after germinal vesicle breakdown was inhibited by AG treatment. The control oocytes extruded a normal first polar body, while the AG-treated oocytes exhibited an elongated protrusion or no elongated protrusion. The results of confocal microscopy showed that the AG-treated oocytes were arrested at anaphase I-telophase 1.

40|$|Several genes {{expressed}} at the centrosome or spindle pole {{have been}} reported to underlie autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of an important brain size reduction present since birth, associated with mild-to-moderate mental handicap and no other neurological feature nor associated malformation. Here, we report a mutation of CASC 5 (aka Blinkin, or KNL 1, or hSPC 105) in MCPH patients from three consanguineous families, in one of which we initially reported the MCPH 4 locus. The combined logarithm of odds score of the three families was > 6. All patients shared a very rare homozygous mutation of CASC 5. The mutation induced skipping of exon 18 with subsequent frameshift and truncation of the predicted protein. CASC 5 is part of the KMN network of the kinetochore and is required for proper microtubule attachment to the chromosome centromere and for spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation during mitosis. Like MCPH gene ASPM, CASC 5 is upregulated in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the human fetal brain. CASC 5 binds BUB 1, BUBR 1, ZWINT- 1 and interestingly it binds to MIS 12 through a protein domain which is truncated by the mutation. CASC 5 localized at the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> like ZWINT- 1 and BUBR 1, while ASPM, CEP 152 and PCTN localized at the spindle poles in our patients and in controls. Comparison of primate and rodent lineages indicates accelerated evolution of CASC 5 in the human lineage. Our data provide strong evidence for CASC 5 as a novel MCPH gene, and underscore the role of kinetochore integrity in proper volumetric development of the human brain.

30|$|Chromosome {{instability}} (CIN) {{is considered}} {{as an important}} factor promoting tumorogenesis (He et al. 1998; Shen et al. 2002; Wajed et al. 2001). In colon cancer and invasive endocrine tumor cells induced by APC mutation, CIN is very distinct (Rubinfeld et al. 1996). In the mitosis, a vital function of microtubule is {{to participate in the}} formation of spindle and divide equally the chromosome between the two daughter cells. APC protein, positioning in centromere, spindle and centrosome directly, takes part in the normal spindle arrangement in <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate,</b> centromere stability and regulation of the connection between spindle microtubule and chromosome. A study by Aoki et al. (2007) showed that APC mutation would induce error separation of chromosome. In the embryonic stem cell and intestinal polyp cells of mice, the truncated APC mutation may cause chromosomal aberration and non-integer value, thus leading to the chromosome instability. Fodde (2003) found that in the HCT 116 cell strain of human colon cancer cells expressing the overall length APC, although the C terminal domain of APC (including microtubule binding domain) could be expressed, the none-integer chromosome was also developed. Moreover, in HCT 116 cell, the expression of APC N terminal domain may affect the interaction between centromere and microtubule to induce CIN. Therefore, APC was thought to affect the centromere function and chromosomes separation through its interaction with microtubule. The results of this study indicated that there were APC gene mutations in the occurrence process of ameloblastoma, which mainly manifested as point mutation. Thereby, the amino acid at individual site changed in APC. If this change affected the structure and functions of APC protein, the stability of APC protein complex would be affected to change the degradation of complex to β-catenin and promote occurrence of certain malignant phenotype (invasiveness and metastasis) in ameloblastoma.|$|E
40|$|Of all {{the periods}} in the Phanerozoic time scale, the Cambrian {{system is the}} most perplexing. Several lines of {{evidence}} which together suggest that the Cambrian Earth may have experienced a large, rapid episode of true polar wander (TPW) include: (1) The Cambrian is short. Once thought to have a duration approaching 100 Ma, stratigraphic Rb/Sr and U/Pb geochronometry now suggests a time span of about 20 Ma. (2) Lithostratigraphic analyses suggest that Northern Africa went from high to low and back to high latitudes within this time interval. North America at least moved into the carbonate belt during the early Cambrian. (3) Improvements in biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and carbon isotopic stratigraphy around the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary now allow precise correlations to be made between strata in Siberia, China, Morocco, Australia, and with somewhat less precision to North America. Isochronous poles from Australia and Africa demonstrate that they were moving separately in the late Precambrian. (4) Paleomagnetic poles, derived from biostratigraphically-dated units, suggest nearly 90 ° of APW for many, if not all, of these continents during Cambrian time. We interpret these effects as an episode of TPW resulting from the collision of East and West Gondwana during the early Cambrian. This suturing event would stop subduction of a large <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> dipping under Africa (responsible {{at least in part}} for the Pan-African metamorphic events). Thermal warming of the orphaned slab then removes its mass anomaly, causing the magnitudes of the minimum and intermediate eigenvectors of the total earth moment of inertia tensor to switch, leading to a 90 ° TPW reorientation of the crust. The Cambrian sea-level transgression may then be the result of moving a large ocean basin from the polar region onto the equatorial buldge. Similarly, the enormously accelerated rates of organic evolution observed during Cambrian time {{may be the result of}} paleoenvironmental dislocation driven by TPW...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{characterized}} plk 1 in mouse oocytes during meiotic maturation {{and after}} parthenogenetic activation until {{entry into the}} first mitotic division. Plk 1 protein expression remains unchanged during maturation. However, two different isoforms can be identified by SDS–PAGE. A fast migrating form, present in the germinal vesicle, seems characteristic of interphase. A slower form appears as early as 30 min before germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), is maximal at GVBD, and is maintained throughout meiotic maturation. This form gradually disappears after exit from meiosis. The slow form corresponds to a phosphorylation since it disappears after alkaline phosphatase treatment. Plk 1 activation, therefore, takes place before GVBD and MAPK activation since plk 1 kinase activity correlates with its slow migrating phosphorylated form. However, plk 1 phosphorylation is inhibited after treatment with two specific p 34 cdc 2 inhibitors, roscovitine and butyrolactone, suggesting plk 1 involvement in the MPF autoamplification loop. During meiosis plk 1 undergoes a cellular redistribution consistent with its putative targets. At the germinal vesicle stage, plk 1 is found diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and enriched in the nucleus and during prometaphase is localized to the spindle poles. At anaphase it relocates to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> and is restricted to the postmitotic bridge at telophase. After parthenogenetic activation, plk 1 becomes dephosphorylated and its activity drops progressively. Upon entry into the first mitotic M-phase at nuclear envelope breakdown plk 1 is phosphorylated {{and there is an}} increase in its kinase activity. At the two-cell stage, the fast migrating form with weak kinase activity is present. In this work we show that plk 1 is present in mouse oocytes during meiotic maturation and the first mitotic division. The variation of plk 1 activity and subcellular localization during this period suggest its implication in the organization and progression of M-phase...|$|E

40|$|EN] Among the {{offspring}} of triploids of Narcissus bulbocodium (3 x = 21) obtained by means of artificial pollination, are found individuals with 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 26, 30, 32, 33 and 34 chromosomes. From free pollination between these plants, arise individuals with 14, 21, 22, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 54 chromosomes. It was found that, putting the diploids aside, the chromosome number was not always the same in all the equatorial plates from the same root, samll oscillations occurring towards either more or less relative to the numbers cited above, which were the most frequent. Analysis of the interphasis nuclei of the F 1 and of the F 2 showed that he most of the individuals that are not diploids possessed chromocentres whose number was, as a rule, difficult to determine. The presence of these chromocentres revealed the existence of heterochromatinosomes whose number was established in certain plants not only by counting {{the maximum number of}} chromocentre, but also, thanks to the fact that these chromosomes lose their colour more rapidly than the euchromatinosomes in the root tip meristems fixed in Navashin's solution and stained with gentian violet. The determination of the number of heterochromatinosomes present allowed us to {{come to the conclusion that}} the most of the plants that, from their chromosomic constitution, apeared to be in genetical unbalance were not so, since the supernumerary chromosomes corresponded to the heterochromatinosomes which are inert or posses a very weak genic activity. Plants were found with 21 and 22 chromosomes provided, respectively, with 7 and 8 heterochromatinosomes, as well as one with 42 which had 14. In certain plants and in certain mitoses, the heterochromatinosomes, if not all at least some, have a retarded behaviour, placing themselves on the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> after the euchromatinosomes have began their poleward movement. In these conditions, they often suffer misdivision of the centromere, thus giving rise to telocentric chromosomes and afterwards to isochromosomes. Other types may eventually arise by translocation with the euchromatinosomes. Sometimes the heterochromatinosomes do not come to be incorporated in the polar groups, being eliminated, which explains the variation found in the numer of chromosomes. All the observed facts can be explained on the assumption that in at least one triploid employed in the initial crossings there was present a dominant H gene determining the heterochromatinization of the supernumerary chromosomes that alter the genic balance. Furthermore, everything leads to the belief that the H factor acts not only in the zygote but also in the pollen and embryo sac. The progeny of these crossings is in a realty almost composed only of balance plants corresponding to diploids, triploids, tetraploids, pentaploids, etc. provided with heterochromatinosomes. The appearance in this progeny only of a few plants with supernumerary euchromatinosomes is explained by the selection of gametes with heterochromatinosomes and by the non-viability or small viability of the zygotes and of the genetically unbalanced plants. Althought also related to a mechanism of genic balance, the heterochromatinization of one of the chromosomes X of the females of Mammals seems to be determined by factors which act in a different manner from that of the H gene of N. Bulbocodium. Peer reviewe...|$|E

M 109. 061275 Histone H 1 phosphorylation {{is important for the}} regulation of high order chromosome organisation during mitosis. One of these phosphorylation sites in the linker histone subtype H 1. 4 is shown here to be phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase, a master regulator of mitosis. Altered phosphorylation of H 1. 4 on this phosphorylation site at serine 27 illustrated the significance of the timing of this phosphorylation. When serine 27 of H 1. 4 is mutated to prevent this phosphorylation chromosome congression to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>plate</b> during metaphase is hindered. In contrast, {{in the presence of the}} constitutive H 1. 4 serine 27 phosphorylation mimic, bridging and lagging chromosomes occurred, leading to a corresponding increase in the proportion of cells with a micronucleus. These phenotypes could be brought about through disruption of the Heterochromatin protein 1 family members bound to the adjacent methylated lysine. Such aberrations during mitosis can lead to genetic instability and ultimately aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer. With the frequently reported over-expression of Aurora B in cancer this shows another mechanism in which this kinase, via histone H 1. 4 phosphorylation, can push a cell toward malignancy. Another important mitotic kinase, Cyclin dependent kinase 1 together with cyclin B, is responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of histone H 1. 4 during mitosis; which is required for condensing the cells genetic information into highly compact metaphase chromosomes. This vital mitotic event ensures the faithful transmission of the duplicated DNA into the dividing daughter cells. The mechanisms through which histone H 1 hyperphosphorylation contribute to chromosome condensation are poorly understood. One mechanism through which this may occur is via the recruitment of condensation factors such as the condensins or Topoisomerase II. Here the interaction between the Condensin I subunit, CAPD 2, and histone H 1. 4 is explored. CAPD 2 interacts with the two most prominent linker histone subtypes, H 1. 4 and H 1. 2, through their C-terminal tails. H 1. 4 and CAPD 2 can interact in vitro whilst each is phosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinase as they are during mitosis, in a manner dependent on RNA. Overall, these results indicate that histone H 1. 4 is a vital component of higher order chromatin and its phosphorylation is essential for the normal progression through mitosis...|$|E
