500|$|In {{his last}} years Poulenc observed, [...] "if {{people are still}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music in 50 years' time {{it will be for}} my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels." [...] In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's {{prediction}} was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: [...] "both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias." [...] At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as [...] "a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for Bolger said that Brown {{was not allowed}} to give her opinion on a school employee retirement bill because when Brown said [...] "Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that you're all are so <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> vagina, but no means no”, she had violated the rules of the House and had [...] "failed to maintain the decorum of the House." ...|$|E
60|$|My brother {{showed no}} excitement--scarcely, even, any <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> information. His face, however, had darkened.|$|R
6000|$|... “I didn’t have {{a natural}} appetite—nor even an unnatural, when they fixed up things for me. I took no <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> food.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is it? oh! I see," [...] and {{the next}} moment I secured my prize and placed it with loathing, but <b>interest,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entomological box.|$|R
2500|$|Darwin's cousin William Darwin Fox {{continued}} to give hims strong support, warning him against overworking on his huge book and recommending a holiday, but Darwin was immersed in his experiments and his writing. [...] "I am got most deeply <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> subject; though I wish I could set less {{value on the}} bauble fame, either present or posthumous, than I do, but not, I think, to any extreme degree; yet, if I know myself, I would work just as hard, though with less gusto, if I knew that my Book wd be published for ever anonymously".|$|E
2500|$|Following the war, Shindo studied {{music at}} Los Angeles State College and studied jazz {{composition}} at the American Operatic Laboratory school. [...] He also formed a dance band in 1947, which {{he continued to}} operate for more than 25 years. [...] In a 1947 interview, Shindo discussed the multi-ethnic composition of his band: [...] "As long as a player can produce good music, that's all I'm <b>interested</b> <b>in.</b> <b>My</b> band {{is supposed to be}} Japanese-American. But besides the four Nisei on it, I have Jewish, Negro, Russian, Irish, and Mexican-American boys on it. And we have a swell time together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeffries {{remained}} mostly {{hidden from}} media attention {{until the day}} of the fight, while Johnson soaked up the spotlight. John L. Sullivan, who made boxing championships a popular and esteemed spectacle, stated that Johnson was in such good physical shape compared to Jeffries that he could lose only if he had a lack of skill on the day. Before the fight, Jeffries remarked, [...] "It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him out as soon as possible." [...] While his wife added, [...] "I'm not interested in prizefighting but I am <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> husband's welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight." [...] Johnson's words were [...] "May the best man win." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does that {{surprise}} you?" [...] she asked. [...] "I {{fail to see}} why I {{should be expected to}} lose all <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> friends--even if they appear to have lost <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Too much trouble,' said he, lazily. 'There is no horse running that I take <b>interest</b> <b>in.</b> <b>My</b> racing {{days are}} over. I am an old {{domestic}} character.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] said Winston. [...] "Still, {{is there}} any reason why I should be {{debarred}} the usual privilege of taking an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> neighbor's affairs?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Fiennes {{stated that}} he had two weeks to shoot the climactic {{showdown}} scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fiennes said with a chuckle: [...] "I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren't before." [...] In preparation, he read the novel Goblet of Fire, but jokingly conceded: [...] "I was only <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> scene, and I {{had to go through}} thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, until I got to my scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research." [...] Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Richard nodded. He {{was much}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> new camera.|$|E
60|$|I grew <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> shoes. His open admiration {{was getting}} quite embarrassing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am much {{obliged to}} you for your <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> niece; but I fear there would be objections. More than that, she is devoted to this man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could be}} nothing so discourteous," [...] said Mr. Caryll. [...] "Would it be prying {{on my part}} to inquire what may be your <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> papers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you mean--and your father seems to take an unwarrantable <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> affairs," [...] said Reddy, with an anger that he was conscious, however, was half simulated.|$|R
60|$|The {{merchant}} {{was much}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> journey, {{and thought it}} dangerous to sleep afield.|$|E
60|$|I nodded. I was not {{particularly}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> letters! I drew Ashley a little on one side.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I little thought,' said Martin, greatly moved, 'that it {{had come}} from you; I little thought that you were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fate. If I had--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray don't think I am {{unworthy of}} your kind <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> welfare," [...] he pleaded. [...] "Can {{you tell me}} of any facts which justify what you have just said?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And she {{was moving}} on when Coventry asked, with a {{suspicious}} look, [...] "What made {{you think it was}} lost? You seem to take an uncommon <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> affairs today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that would exceed my power, the {{disappointment}} would be so strong. May I ask why you show so much <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> keeping so cruel a mortification to myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe I can {{get your}} uncle <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> land," [...] {{suggested}} Mr. Franklin. [...] "I wish he'd look it over. It wouldn't cost him anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Henry," [...] she protested, [...] "I cannot flatter {{myself that}} there is any other person in the world {{sufficiently}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> movements to have me watched." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mrs. Catherick; [...] "I don't {{wonder at}} all. This {{appears to be}} your affair. You are <b>{{interested}}</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> affairs. I am not interested in yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 115. We {{will try}} {{it at once}} on this second variety of the Titania, of which I find nothing of much <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> books, and have nothing discursive myself to say.|$|R
6000|$|... "We had--considerable difficulty. Considerable. But of course--as I {{pointed out}} to her--it was {{scarcely}} possible for her to continue as my typewriter unless she was disposed to take an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> investigations--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Any <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> beloved friend Darsie Latimer,' said Fairford, {{stepping}} {{a little}} back, and putting a marked restraint upon his former advances, 'gives me a double {{right to be}} useful to'--He stopped short.|$|R
6000|$|... “Your aunt {{has always}} been {{inclined}} to disapprove of my doings, and I don’t suppose she’d be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> prospecting experiences. We’ll let them stand over till another day.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That means there's {{others that}} bet I won't," [...] he rattled on hastily. [...] "An' {{that means that}} there's men aboard the Elsinore right now financially <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> taking-off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Hare, I'm Holderness. You'll recall my name. You {{were sent}} to Lund by men <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ranges. I {{expected}} {{to see you in}} Lund, but couldn't get over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Sir Henry Baskerville, [...] "perhaps {{you will}} tell me, Mr. Holmes, what in thunder {{is the meaning}} of that, and who it is that takes so much <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> affairs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your {{mother does}} not meet me with pleasure; she hears of nothing that has {{occurred}} to me with pride; your mother has ceased to take an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> welfare; and why should you be unchanged?' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ravenor softly {{pulled down}} the green {{lampshade}} on the side nearest to him, and in the subdued light I could scarcely see his face, but I felt that his <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> story was growing.|$|R
