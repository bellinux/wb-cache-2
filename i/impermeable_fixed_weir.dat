40|$|Movable weirs {{have been}} {{developed}} to address the weaknesses of conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs.</b> However, the structures for riverbed protection downstream of movable weirs are designed using the criteria of <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs</b> in most cases, and these applications cause problems, such as scour and deformation of structures, due to misunderstanding the difference between different types of structures. In this study, a hydraulic experiment was conducted to examine weir type-specific hydraulic phenomena, compare hydraulic jumps and downstream flow characteristics according to different weir types, and analyze hydraulic characteristics, such as changes in water levels, velocities and energy. Additionally, to control the flow generated by a sluice gate, energy dissipators were examined herein for their effectiveness in relation to different installation locations and heights. As a result, it was found that although sluice gates generated hydraulic jumps similar to those of <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs,</b> their downstream supercritical flow increased to eventually elongate the overall hydraulic jumps. In energy dissipator installation, installation heights were found to be sensitive to energy dissipation. The most effective energy dissipator height was 10 % of the downstream free surface water depth in this experiment. Based on these findings, it seems desirable to use energy dissipators to reduce energy, as such dissipators were found to be effective in reducing hydraulic jumps and protecting the riverbed under sluice gates...|$|R

40|$|Dams are {{critical}} infrastructures whose failure would entail serious consequences for community safety. Although large dams represent {{the most dangerous}} items, small size dams may be critical, as {{a large number of}} these constructions are built in the proximity to inhabited zones. Earthquake is one of the hazards that may affect an existing dam. To assess safety and plan investments, dam owners need to create prioritisation sequences of interventions through a protocol considering technical, political and societal aspects. It is presented herein a specific procedure, based on a multi-criteria analysis with a rapid screening survey of the infrastructures, which addresses to classify the seismic criticality of dams considering the effects (in terms of loss of life and property) of a failure scenario subsequent to an earthquake. A protocol is used to define a prioritisation of interventions that mitigate the seismic risk. It has been applied to a group of 9 small concrete dams and 17 <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs,</b> built from 1920 to 1990 in Aosta Valley (Italy).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the issue of}} the inviscid limit for the compressible Navier-Stokes system in an <b>impermeable</b> <b>fixed</b> bounded domain. We consider two kinds of boundary conditions. The first one is the no-slip condition. In this case we extend the famous conditional result obtained by Kato in the homogeneous incompressible case. Kato proved that if the energy dissipation rate of the viscous flow in a boundary layer of width proportional to the viscosity vanishes then the solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to some solutions of the incompressible Euler equations in the energy space. We provide here a natural extension of this result to the compressible case. The other case is the Navier condition which encodes that the fluid slips with some friction on the boundary. In this case we show that the convergence to the Euler equations holds true in the energy space, as least when the friction is not too large.

25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A fuse plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs</b> at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{floodplains}} adequately {{is crucial}} for numerous water management applications. Many of these require {{a large number of}} simulations or long term calculations, thereby necessitating the use of models with a limited calculation time. This paper investigates two different flexible data-driven methods for computationally efficient lumped floodplain modelling that predict the inundation level in the floodplain and the flow between the river and the floodplain for a given set of river stages. The flow can be calculated using a set of optimized discharge equations. Alternatively, a hybrid approach can be followed that combines physical principles with neural networks that rely on water levels to obtain flow estimates. The derived methodology was tested on a case study using simulation results from a detailed MIKE 11 model that solves the full de Saint-Venant equations. The results show that both approaches deliver accurate results, although the neural networks outperform the <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> equations. At the same time, the simulations are more than 10. 000 faster compared to the original full hydrodynamic model. The obtained floodplain models can be used for various applications that require very short computation times. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Construction of {{the canal}} was overseen by {{architect}} John Nash, with James Morgan acting as supervising engineer. Hampstead Road Locks were built between 1818 and 1820, with the chambers made of brick and stone coping along the top. The two locks are arranged side by side, with an island platform between them. Each chamber has two gates at both ends, {{and they have been}} Grade II listed since 1992. They were the first of 12 pairs of similar locks which dropped the level {{of the canal}} by 96 ft to reach Limehouse Basin. The transfer of water between the chambers made operation of the locks more complex, and so they were permanently manned during the heyday of the canal, with lock-keepers working a shift system to provide 24-hour cover. As the use of the canal declined, in part due to railway competition, manning levels were reduced, and padlocks were used to prevent operation of the locks at the weekends. Following the end of commercial traffic and the growth of leisure boating, the locks reverted to operation by boat crews, and in order to prevent flooding caused by incorrect operation of the paddles, in the 1980s most of the pairs were converted to single locks, by replacing the lower gates of one chamber with a <b>fixed</b> <b>weir.</b> Hampstead Road Lock is the only one where both chambers have been retained, although they are now emptied conventionally.

The breach flow was modeled as flow over a compound broad-crested weir. A laboratory experiment was carried out with a <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> model in a flume. Five cases with different breach properties were tested. Firstly, the discharge coefficients for all cases were quantitatively determined. The calibrations were done under two flow conditions, namely emerged flow conditions (flow only through the breach) and overtopping flow conditions (flow through the compound cross-section of weir). In perfect weir situations, {{it turned out that the}} values of the discharge coefficient were below 1 and rather different in the two flow conditions. Particularly in the case of overtopping flow, the linear combination of traditional discharge equations was verified for predicting the discharge and the discharge distribution over the weir. In imperfect weir situations, submergence coefficient was introduced in emerged condition. Secondly, the dependence of the energy head loss caused by the weir on the upstream discharge and the downstream water depth was discussed in imperfect weir situations. The Form Drag model for estimating the energy head loss was proved to be applicable for the modeled breach flow. Thirdly, the local hydraulic characteristics of breach flow were described by means of velocity distribution, water level elevation and flow patterns appearing behind the weir. At last, the numerical model (Delft 3 D) was verified on the modeling of the present experiment by comparing with the experimental data.

The measured bed shear stress at the dam break fluid tip for an initially dry, horizontal bed was close to twice that estimated using steady flow theory. The temporal variation of swash bed shear stress showed a large peak in landward directed stress at the uprush tip, followed by a rapid decay throughout the uprush flow interior. The peak seaward directed stress during the backwash phase was less than half that measured in the uprush.

For this problem, {{only one of the}} material length scales involved in the flow equation enters the final solution. When the additional material length scale associated with the boundary conditions is signed to ensure satisfaction of the second law at the channel walls the theory delivers solutions that agree neither quantitatively nor qualitatively with observed features of plane channel flow.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was the study of elastic or elastically supported, permeable or non-permeable panels, used as protective structures for sensitive crops. Similarly to the flexible tree windbreaks interacting with the wind, flexible panels and elastically supported panels were studied through full-scale experiments and numerical simulations. The design of such structures was optimized {{with respect to their}} performance, minimizing wind loads, thus reducing the corresponding cost. Initially, an elevated panel was studied using permeable or impermeable cladding material. The airflow around a fixed elevated panel was studied, and the wind loads were estimated by analyzing the effect of the aerodynamic characteristics of the permeable agricultural nets on the airflow. Afterwards, elastically supported and flexible panels that used permeable agricultural nets as cladding materials were investigated. In all studied cases, comparisons were made to fixed panels of similar geometry in order to demonstrate the advantages: a) from the use of agricultural nets, b) from the interaction of the panel with the wind and c) from the combination of both. Numerical simulations are a relatively new tool for analyzing fluid dynamics problems, quickly developing in the last decades. In all studied cases numerical simulations have been carried out in order to examine whether they are reliable to represent accurately the airflow around all studied panel types, as well as to calculate wind loads. Comparisons of numerical results with the corresponding full-scale experiments led to the estimation of the validity of the numerical methods. The present results proved that the interaction of elastically supported permeable panels constitute an innovative structural solution for the protection of crops. The protection they provide in their leeward area and the corresponding reduction of wind loads increases while the cost of the structure is reduced, in comparison to the conventional agricultural structures of this type that are <b>impermeable</b> and <b>fixed</b> to the ground. Results taken from the numerical simulations confirmed the reliability of these methods for the calculation of wind loads on every type of panel (elastically supported, flexible) irrespective of the cladding material case.

40|$|A {{commonly}} used flood mitigation technique in coastal areas of Australia {{during the late}} 1960 ’s was the installation of one-way floodgates on flood mitigation drains. In regions affected by acid sulphate soils (the oxidation of pyrite in the soil forms sulphuric acid), the floodgates prevent tidal carbonate/bicarbonate buffering of the drains and thereby create reservoirs of acidic water (pH 3 ̆c 4. 5) that discharge during low tide.

Therefore main aim of this paper study and characterized hydraulic characteristics of rectangular labyrinth weirs by using laboratory data. Materials and Methods: In this study rectangular labyrinth weir discharge and coefficient discharge relationships used dimensional analysis and experiment on hydraulic modeling, constant coefficient was defined. Laboratory flume is shown in Figure 2 (0. 5 m wide x 12 m long x 0. 8 m deep). Models was made from clear plexiglass plate with 10 cm thickness thatcuted using leaserdevice and the crest manualy shaped quadrant with radius 10 cm, all models using silicon glue install in the flume. The upstream depth readership by point gauge that installed in upstream of models. Discharge calcutaed byupsterm depth of triangular weir that installed in down stream of flume. Data were analyzed by SPSS software and to compare relationships with each other used two parameter {{root mean square error}} and correlation coefficient and charts darw in Excel Results and Discussion: discharge coefficient formula (11) carried out by using SPSS software that compared with formula (3). Results showed (Tables 2 and 3) that the correlation coefficient of formula (11) was more than a formula (3) and formula (11) RSME was less than formula (3) RSME except in first and fifth hydraulic model (rectengular 1 and 5) that they were almost equal. So the formula (11) was more accurate than a formula (3) to peredict discharge of flow in flume. In previous step we used all data, we saw flourmloa (11) had more accurate then we diceded data divided in to three groups: high change, length change and all that calculated correlation coefficient and RSME for formula (11) to figure out which group have more accurate, results was brought in table 4. The result showed that constant coefficient of formula (11) yields from all data was useful for the design proposed. Plotted discharge changes against H/P for rectangular labyrinth and straight weirs in Figs. 3 and 4. In constant discharge and high with raising length weir, decreased depth of flow over the weir because the effective weir length was raised and the ratio of distributed length to apex length (b) was decreased. As well as in constant H/P and high weir with raising apex length, discharge was increased that similarity of the results of Tullis et al. (15) and Khode et al. (8). In length, and the ratio H / P constant with increasing height in the discharge coefficient due to submergence reduce local side Jt Hay reduce interference, but increases with increasing height from 0. 20 to 0. 25 m m discharge coefficient decreases as flow rate and Weber number decreased {{as a result of the}} effect of surface tension and increased resistance to flow. In length, and the ratio H / P fixed amount of overflow discharge increases with increasing height as the ratio H / P value of the denominator increases and therefore increases the total height of the water upstream. For designoverflow rectangular labyrinth weirs recommends 0. 20 ≤H/P≤ 0. 40 that maximum aeration and discharge coefficient in this range is the result of Hay and Taylor (7) and Darvas (4) is consistent. In discharge and <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> height and maximum height of the water upstream directly at least equal to 1. 8 of the overflow stright weirs. So for the areas where there is a height restriction of water upstream, the water level upstream of rectangular labyrinth weirs less direct overflow weirs requires the use of this is recommended. Conclusion: The results showed the relationship (11) that uses most of effective parameters has more accurate results and proposed for design aim. In constant water head upstream discharge of labyrinth weir maximum 2. 6 times more than straight weir discharge and in constant discharge water head upstream of straight weir 1. 8 times more than upstream labyrinth weir water head so use a labyrinth weir appropriate for areas that have head and discharge restrictions.

As sub-zero temperatures were expected to affect vapour resistance of microporous membranes, the effect of using semipermeable and impermeable rain covers for sleeping bags on the accumulation of moisture in the bags during 6 days of use at − 7 °C and 5 days at − 20 °C were investigated. In addition, the routine of shaking off hoarfrost {{from the inside of}} the cover after the sleep period as a preventive measure for moisture accumulation was studied. Moisture accumulation (ranging from 92 to 800 grams) was found {{to be related to the}} vapour resistance of the materials used. The best semipermeable material gave the same moisture build-up as no cover at − 7 °C, though build-up increased substantially at − 20 °C. Shaking off the hoarfrost from the inside of the cover after each use was beneficial in preventing a high moisture build-up.

Detailed laboratory measurements of horizontal velocity above a rough, <b>fixed,</b> <b>impermeable</b> slope were made to determine the effect of varying wave conditions on the shear stress in the swash zone. The research involved the design, construction and installation of a 1 : 10 impermeable beach slope in a wave flume fronted by a 1 : 35 impermeable slope, a sidewall constricting the working section of the flume to 0. 3 m, and the manufacture of a model beach for attachment onto the 1 : 10 slope. The 1 : 10 impermeable model beach comprised coarse sand of nominal diameter 2. 2 mm fixed in place to ensure that the flow was fully rough turbulent. Velocities were measured at up to 18 locations along the slope using a laser Doppler velocimeter and at several elevations for each location. Free surface elevations were measured by a wave gage. The testing conditions included waves of three different periods, i. e. 2. 0 s, 3. 0 s and 4. 0 s periods. For this thesis, two locations were assessed, one outside the surf zone and the other inside the surf zone, for 2. 0 s and 4. 0 s wave periods.

Flow reversal diminished the applicability of the logarithmic profile assumption. Seaward of the surf zone, under non-breaking wave conditions, {{there appears to be a}} net onshore stress. After the wave has broken (inside the surf zone), a net offshore stress was noted.

By {{examining}} {{data from}} different sites of language practices of Lusaka urbanites, that include, casual and formal conversations, Zambian popular music, computer mediated discourses and advertisements; the study shows how interlocutors creatively draw on their extended communicative repertoire to make meaning, transform social structures/roles and stylize modern identities. Accordingly, the study consolidates the recent sociolinguistic theoretical position that views language as social practice and privileges speakers as social actors in shaping and recreating language. In this regard, the study foregrounds language as localized social practice and argues {{against the idea}} that language is homogenous and a bounded system. In doing so, the study adds to recent sociolinguistic theorizing calling for a paradigm shift to language studies. Therefore, the main research question that the study addresses, relates to how Lusaka urban dwellers achieve their mediated agency, voice and actorhood through linguistic choices during interactions in various social contexts of modern Lusaka. In turn, the question relates to how urbanites use language as localized social practice to maintain, transform and reproduce social structures/roles and identities in modern Lusaka. Owing {{to the type of}} data the study collected, a multifaceted methodological and analytical approach was employed for both data collection and analysis. Informed by a descriptive research design, the study used focus group discussions and individual key-informant interviews to collect data from casual and formal conversations. Data from Zambian popular music were purposively sampled from Youtube. com and music CDs. In addition, group/individual interviews with musicians were conducted in order to supplement data collected from music CDs and video sources. Data from online discourses were collected from the Facebook platform and from two Zambian based online news blogs, while data from print advertisements were collected through the capturing of images on billboards around Lusaka city as well as advertisements from newspapers and internet sites. Television and radio advertisements were recorded from the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation TV and radio channels. All the data collected from these sources were generally analyzed using Conversational Analysis, Facework Negotiation Theory, Multimodal Discourse Analysis and its cognate analytical tools such as Resemiotisation, Semiotic Remediation, Intertextuality, Multivocality and Dialogism. The study shows that message consumption is not a function of isolated semiotic resource but a combination of semiotic material drawn from semiotics that people are familiar with. The study thus argues that social meaning is steeped into social and cultural experiences of the speakers and that any study of language practices in such contexts should take into account the multifaceted nature of human communication. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that given the advancements in communication technology and mobility of semiotic resources across modes which have largely contributed to a reconceptualization of the nature of human language, any study of language in social contexts ought to account for other meaning making semiosis in both methodological and approaches to data collection and analysis, respectively. The study further shows how interactants in late modern settings of Lusaka stylize their multiple identities by dissolving the traditional linguistic boundaries through use of the extended linguistic repertoire. In this vein, the study demonstrates that social identity is a dynamic aspect of social life which is actively negotiated and performed through speakers' linguistic choices. In this respect, the study finds that speakers simultaneously stylize translocal hybrid identities which include urban versus rural, modern versus traditional, African versus Christian (Western fused) as well as gendered ones, through their use of different linguistic choices. Furthermore, the study finds that language borders and domains of language use are permeable. In this regard, the study demonstrates how Lusaka urban speakers use localized language forms to colonize the formal spaces thereby challenging the dominant ideologies about language as a <b>fixed,</b> <b>impermeable</b> and a bounded system. In the process of colonizing formal spaces using localized language forms, the study shows how speakers perform acts of humour, role play, face saving, identity and meaning enhancement. In turn these localized repertoires are drawn upon as resources to accomplish different tasks which would not be accomplished if only a 'single' language were to be used. In this regard, the study views language as a resource that transcends the role of meaning making. In addition, the study shows how, through the use of localized repertoires in formal spaces, speakers transform traditions and modernity into a hybrid space which identifies them as having multiple identities. This demonstrates that speakers in such modern settings use language as a resource to accomplish several things at once. It also highlights speakers’ agency in recreating language as well as transforming their social spaces. The findings of the study entail contributions to recent arguments on language that view it not as an autonomous system but rather as embedded in people’s social interactions. It demonstrates that languages have no clear-cut borders. The study also contributes to methodological and analytical approaches to the study of language in recent times. In addition, the study adds new knowledge to our understanding of identity as a performative act which is actively negotiated for as people interact in different social contexts. This implies that identity is not a fixed thing as traditionally conceived. Ultimately, the study calls for a rethinking of our conception of language and identity considering modernity practices...|$|R
