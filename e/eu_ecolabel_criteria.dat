40|$|The {{following}} Technical Report {{presents the}} final proposal for <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> and <b>EU</b> GPP <b>criteria</b> on Flushing Toilets and Urinals, and explains {{the rationale behind}} each criterion. The primary goal of establishing <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> and GPP <b>criteria</b> for flushing toilets and urinals is to increase their water efficiency during operation, as water consumption in the use phase has been identified to contribute most to the environmental impact caused by this product group. Further, other aspects related to the product’s life cycle, which improvement can bring environmental benefits, are also considered. Establishing ecological criteria for flushing toilets and urinals and promoting appropriately the awarded products, if accepted by {{a wider range of}} producers and users, will contribute to greener product purchases, which shall reduce the consumption of water. Besides, this should also result in other environmental benefits, like lower water pollution and eutrophication, energy saving and lower related air emissions, resource consumption and potentially higher resource efficiency management. Finally, the environmentally friendlier products should also bring private and public customers direct cost savings. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|R

The EU Ecolabel promotes the production and consumption of products with a reduced environmental impact along the life cycle and is awarded only to the best (environmental) performing products in the market. The objective of this project is to revise the two existing <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> <b>criteria</b> relating to tourism services: tourist accommodation services and camp site services. These criteria will be merged, to form one set of criteria for tourist accommodation. Since the last revision of the criteria (2009 / 578 /EC & 2009 / 564 /EC: Commission Decisions of 9 July 2009), a number of important changes have taken place in this area, including policy changes, changes in the market and changes in the perception of tourism’s environmental impacts. This report outlines the factors which may lead to a change in criteria, through updates, revisions or the addition of new criteria. This technical report is aimed at providing a sound base to the revision process of the <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> <b>criteria</b> for Tourist Accommodation (2009 / 578 /EC) and Camp Site Services (2009 / 564 /EC).

The identification of the main hotspots is carried out in this study by means of an initial extensive literature review and subsequent LCA studies. LCA studies showed that sourcing of the raw materials is the most relevant environmental aspect followed by heating up the water during cleaning if needed. Based on the normalisation assessment, by far the most significant impact category for all-purpose cleaners in Europe is natural land transformation. These findings are in agreement with the published literature and can be extrapolated to other all-purpose cleaners such as sanitary cleaners and window cleaners. The study reveals that there are several improvement opportunities such as cleaner concentration which can bring savings in resources or reduction in the wash temperature.

40|$|This {{technical}} report {{is aimed at}} providing a sound base to the revision process of the <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> <b>criteria</b> for Soil improvers and Growing Media. Currently, separate sets of <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> <b>criteria</b> exist for Soil improvers (Decision 2006 / 799 /EC) and Growing media (Decision 2007 / 64 /EC). The revision process spanned both product groups; thus common criteria for both Soil improvers and Growing media are developed, only distinguishing between technical product characteristics where necessary. Another objective of this revision is addressing the possibility to broaden the current scope to the product mulch, {{as it has been}} identified as a differentiated sub-product within the product group 'soil improvers'. To achieve those objectives, a Preliminary Report was produced together with the first version of this {{technical report}} as a working document. Hence, this document was developed to undergo the stakeholder consultation, which is crucial to come up with criteria adapted to the market reality while being able to select the best environmental performance products available on the market.

LCA studies shown that the energy used for heating the washing water during the use stage, has an impact in all the environmental categories under study but especially on fossil fuel depletion and global warming potential. The extraction and processing of raw materials that cause impacts on the categories such as mineral depletion, land use and energy use as well as the emissions to the environment (discharge of wastewater) has also impacts of importance depending on the scenario under consideration.

40|$|Not only {{ecolabelling}} {{and energy}} labeling {{but also its}} wider framework, namely, the idea of sustainable consumption and production are recent issues of the globe compared to consumer product safety which {{dates back to the}} 19 th century. Previous studies analyze the regulation of ecolabelling and energy labeling neglecting its common aspects with product labeling for human health and safety purposes. This article focuses on the development of those three types of product labels, namely, CE Marking, EU Energy Label and <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> employed in the European Union (EU) also with a view to predict their future. It is revealed that increasing societal awareness in ecological issues tend to converge earlier measures of product safety labelling (CE Marking) into new measures of <b>ecolabelling</b> (<b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel)</b> in terms of substance. Secondly, the Article shows that both EU Energy Label and <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> tend to converge into CE Marking particularly in terms of standardisation procedures as well as conformity assessment, market surveillance and enforcement. Interestingly, convergence tends to occur in both directions regarding the substance and standardisation of <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> vis-à-vis CE Marking. In the end, it is suggested that <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> may (and perhaps should) become mandatory in the future in view of the historical development and justifications regarding mandatory CE Marking and EU Energy Label. On the other hand, a mandatory federal ecolabel does not seem so likely in case of the United States (US) due to its different attitude towards product labeling as well as consumers’ impact on the environment.

40|$|The {{support of}} the EU Ecolabel has proven very limited among the Danish fashion companies. This project has {{therefore}} decided to explore which actors and factors can influence the diffusion of the EU Ecolabel in the Danish fashion production. Implicit lies in this {{an exploration of the}} demands that an implementation of the <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> <b>criteria</b> put on the Danish fashion companies, and what the reasons are for the lack of support from the industry. The empirical framework in this project is put together by literature studies and qualitative interviews from key actors. The theoretical foundation consists of Frank Geels' theory of socio-technical systems, communication from a system theoretical perspective based on Niklas Luhmann, governance structures of production chains by Gary Gereffi and Jeremy Hall's theory of environmental improvements in product chains. From our study we are able to conclude that the criteria of the EU Ecolabel require a transition of the dominating socio-technical system in the industry, focusing on supportive capacity building. It is concluded that an implementation of the EU Ecolabel is possible but that the fashion companies lack incentive to use the label. A pressure from f(actors) in the socio-technical system, either on landscape or niche level, is essential to increase the diffusion of the EU Ecolabel.

40|$|Type I {{environmental}} {{labels are}} voluntary programs aiming at identifying environmental superior product options {{on the basis}} of pass-fail criteria founded on cycle considerations. The criteria development process typically involves the analysis of complex product systems. This contribution describes experience gained during the development of <b>EU</b> <b>Ecolabel</b> <b>criteria</b> and the role played by Life Cycle Asssessment (LCA) in this process. A practical Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) approach based on LCA and complemented by other product-related information has been applied in this context. LCA plays a core role in the criteria development process for assessing environmental impacts of typical products on the market, identifying life cycle hotspots and evaluating improvement options. Review of the material produced in the literature and development of ad-hoc studies to integrate such information can be functional for the definition of key environmental areas on which to set criteria and for addresssing further investigation efforts to find best practices of production and consumption. A complementary product-oriented analysis is necessary to gather legislative, technoeconomic and environmental elements that could be not entirely integrated in LCA (e. g. legislative constraints, market and quality of products, inherent safety, indoor air quality, noise emissions) and to identify options which could be used to formulate relevant criteria. In this process, interaction with stakeholders is essential for gathering information and views from experts, pointing out key challenges and solving critical aspects related to the definition of feasible and fair criteria. The outlined approach has been applied to a series of product groups. As illustration, main findings related to the development of labelling criteria for Absorbent Hygiene Products (AHP), which includes products as baby diapers, feminine care pads, tampons and nurse pads, have been reported. The criteria development process involves the analysis of complex systems where LCA plays a core role, although the definition of a coherent set of criteria needs also multi-disciplinary analyses and continuous discussion with experts. LCA can be a powerful instrument for informing policy makers but there are inherent limitations which require critical analysis and certain flexibility for finding a balance between what could be good to do in theory {{and what can be done}} in practice.

Thus several EU regulations encourage manufacturers to create products considering the whole life cycle of products. European Product Policies aim at boosting the EU market to be progressively more sustainable.
