50|$|The turn of {{the year}} saw Ashley's control over Rangers {{weakened}} as deals were made with a consortium led by Dave King, to purchase the shareholding of Laxey Partners which had stood at 16%. King took control of a 14.57% stake and two weeks later called for EGM on 16 January. The original date was set by the board was 4 March in a hotel in London, however, this was then moved to Ibrox Stadium after two successive hotels refused to host the event and the date was confirmed for the 6th of March. During the run up to the EGM, the incumbent Rangers board agreed £10m funding deal with Sports Direct. The agreement saw Sports Direct hold a floating charge over Murray Park, Edmiston House, the Albion Car Park and the club's registered trademarks. Sports Direct was also transferred 26% of Rangers' share in Rangers Retail Limited (Rangers previously held 51% with Sports <b>Direct</b> <b>holding</b> 49%). The club were bound to forego all shirt sponsorship revenue for the 2016-17 season and subsequent seasons until the loan is repaid. On transfer deadline day, Rangers also loaned five players from Newcastle United, a Premier League club that Ashley owned.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{working with}} the {{securities}} industry, developed a new form of, [...] "direct holding system" [...] that would allow both the speedy settlement of securities transactions and communication between shareholders and their companies. This new system was a type of book-entry direct registration system (DRS) operated by stock transfer agent. This concept would allow any retail investor who wants his or her securities to be registered directly on the books of the issuer, but does not necessarily want to receive a certificate, to register those securities in book-entry form directly on the books of the issuer. The DRS concept {{has been slow to}} develop for two reasons. First, many investors do not understand that if they give up paper certificates while joining a DRS, this will return them to the status of direct shareholders of the issuer rather than just customers of a broker (who is the registered shareholder {{in the eyes of the}} issuer), and second, once brokers and banks had been inserted as the [...] "indispensable" [...] middlemen between shareholders and issuers, they were not eager to surrender this privileged position of control. As a result, one version of the [...] "direct holding system" [...] is an inefficient relic of the past and a modern DRS form of <b>direct</b> <b>holding</b> remains for most shareholders an unrealized thing of the future.|$|E
