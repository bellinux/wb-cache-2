The ARK (Archival Resource Key) is {{the only}} {{persistent}} naming scheme for internet information objects that squarely faces the service issues underlying practical electronic permanence. The ARK is a specially constructed, actionable URL encapsulating a <b>globally</b> <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> that is independent of the current service provider. Each ARK is by definition bound to three things: (a) object access, (b) object metadata, and (c) a faceted commitment statement. These service bindings provide {{the best way for}} service providers to communicate their varied commitments to objects. It is for these reasons that the California Digital Library is pursuing the use of ARKs. ...|$|E
40|$|In many {{class-based}} {{object-oriented database}} systems {{the association between}} an instance and a class is both exclusive and permanent. Therefore, these systems have serious difficulties in representing objects taking on different and multiple roles over time. Recently, some researchers have proposed the use of roles to tackle these problems. In their approaches, objects acquire additional properties by dynamically playing roles. However, relationships between objects and roles have not been addressed. Therefore, an object may evolve on its own by dynamic acquiring new roles, without coordination or cooperation by any other objects. In this paper, a novel object-oriented database management system, called DOOR, which supports object evolution, dynamic role (context-dependent) modeling, objects of multiple specific classes, and object-role relationships, is described. In DOOR, a role is an entity with state and behavior, but does not have <b>globally</b> <b>unique</b> <b>identity.</b> Therefore, its existence [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{upcoming}} WebRTC-based browser-to-browser {{communication services}} present new challenges for user discovery in peer-to-peer mode. Even more so, if {{we wish to}} enable different web communication services to interact. This paper presents Identity Mapping and Discovery Service (IMaDS), a global, scalable, service independent discovery service that enables users of web-based peer-to-peer applications to discover other users whom to communicate with. It also provides reachability and presence information. For that, user identities need to be mapped to any compatible service identity {{as well as to}} a <b>globally</b> <b>unique,</b> service-independent <b>identity.</b> This mapping and discovery process is suitable for multiple identifier formats and personal identifying properties, but it supports user-determined privacy options. IMaDS operates across different service domains dynamically, using context information. Users and devices have profiles containing context and other specific information that can be discovered by a search engine. The search results reveal the user's allocated <b>globally</b> <b>unique</b> identifier (GUID), which is then resolved to a list of the user's service domains identities, using a DHT-based directory service. Service-specific directories allow tracking of active endpoints, where users are currently logged on and can be contacted.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the shift of}} thread {{semantics}} that arises when adapting a centralized Java program for execution in a distributed environment. More specifically we focus on distributed applications that are developed {{by means of a}} distributed control flow programming model like Java RMI or OMG CORBA. The shift in thread semantics causes unexpected execution results or run-time errors if these differences were not taken into account by the programmer. We overcome this semantical gap between local and distributed programming by extending Java programming with the notion of distributed thread identity. Propagation of a <b>globally</b> <b>unique,</b> distributed thread <b>identity</b> provides a uniform mechanism by which all the program's constituent objects involved in a distributed control flow can uniquely refer to that distributed thread as one and the same computational entity.

When using a distributed control flow programming model like Java RMI or OMG CORBA, the programmer should take into account an inherent shift of semantics. We experienced a particular problem with shift of thread semantics when extending a serialization mechanism for JVM threads to a distributed setting. More specific, we encountered the problem of losing logical thread identity when the control crosses system boundaries. We solved this problem by introduced the generic notion of distributed thread identity in Java programming.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{mechanism}} for serializing the execution-state of a distributed Java application that is implemented on a conventional Object Request Broker (ORB) architecture such as Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI). To support serialization of distributed execution-state, we developed a byte code transformer and associated management subsystem that adds this functionality to a Java application by extracting execution-state from the application code. An important benefit of our mechanism is its portability. It can transparently be integrated into any legacy Java application. Furthermore, it does require no modifications to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or to the underlying ORB. Our serialization mechanism can serve many purposes such as migrating execution-state over the network or storing it on disk. In particular, we describe {{the implementation of a}} prototype for repartitioning distributed Java applications at run-time. Proper partitioning of distributed objects over the different machines is critical to the global performance of the distributed application. Methods for partitioning exist, and employ a graph-based model of the application being partitioned. Our mechanism enables then applying these methods at any point in an ongoing distributed computation. In the implementation of the management subsystem, we experienced the problem of losing logical thread identity when the distributed control ow crosses address space boundaries. We solved this well known problem by introducing the generic notion of distributed thread identity in Java programming. Propagation of a <b>globally</b> <b>unique,</b> distributed thread <b>identity</b> provides a uniform mechanism by which all the program's constituent objects involved in a distributed control ow can uniquely refer to that di [...] ...|$|R
