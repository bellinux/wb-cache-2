5|$|An {{event that}} had a {{profound}} impact on Gaudí's personality was Tragic Week in 1909. Gaudí remained in his house in Güell Park during this turbulent period. The anticlerical atmosphere and attacks on churches and convents caused Gaudí to worry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sagrada Família, but the building escaped damage.|$|E
5|$|Due to an asbestos-related concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings, the visitors' centre (including the planetarium) {{was mostly}} {{demolished}} in 2003 leaving {{a remnant of}} its far end; a large marquee {{was set up in}} its grounds. A new science centre was being planned at the time. Those rebuilding plans were shelved when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST merged to become the University of Manchester in 2004, leaving the interim centre, which received around 70,000 visitors a year.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, White was {{concerned}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county's records {{and proceeded to}} load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for safekeeping. Because of White's efforts, Hampshire County land records survived the war, while those records that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies. White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|On , a {{group of}} European citizens, led by German {{biochemist}} Otto Rössler, filed a suit against CERN in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

5|$|Once {{again the}} Byzantines' {{military}} power was depleted and Andronicus III {{was forced into}} diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; in return <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would {{be paid to the}} Ottomans. Unfortunately for the Byzantine Empire, this did not stop the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.|$|E
5|$|The {{sovereignty}} convention {{gathered at}} the William Forst House in Russellville as scheduled on November 18, 1861. Burnett also presided over this convention. Fearing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delegates, he first proposed postponing proceedings until January 8, 1862, but Scott County's George W. Johnson convinced {{the majority of the}} delegates to continue. By the third day, the military situation was so tenuous that the entire convention had to be moved to a tower on the campus of Bethel Female College, a now-defunct institution in Russellville.|$|E

5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running {{the length of the}} tunnel. The wire ran along the wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in {{defiance}} of the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext that there was a threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people.|$|E

5|$|At 9:50 {{and under}} heavy {{pressure}} from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, and headed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> straits. The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Barbaros Hayreddin, Turgut Reis, and Mesudiye took several hits during the battle, though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. When they approached the straits, Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik took up positions to cover {{the withdrawal of the}} damaged pre-dreadnoughts. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of Ostend. The only ship {{available}} in the area was A4, commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh. On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with the gold and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from port to port because of concerns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cargo during unloading, the gold was landed at Plymouth on 26 May, {{two days before the}} Belgian surrender. The gold was finally deposited at the Bank of England. A4 also carried Hubert Ansiaux, the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, as {{the allied}} Christian fleet resumed operations, it faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha. The Spanish contingent under Don John {{did not reach}} the Ionian Sea until September, meaning that the Ottomans enjoyed numerical superiority for a time, but the Ottoman commander {{was well aware of}} the inferiority of his fleet, constructed in haste of green wood and manned by inexperienced crews. He therefore actively avoided to engage the allied fleet in August, and eventually headed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow, but friction among the Christian leaders and the reluctance of Don John squandered the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Titanic {{began in}} July 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with {{the filming of}} the modern day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full scale RMS Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.|$|E

5|$|The Balkan League, {{of which}} Greece was a member, {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire in October 1912. Two months later, the Ottoman fleet attacked the Greek navy, {{in an attempt to}} disrupt the naval blockade surrounding the Dardanelles. The Ottoman fleet, which included Turgut Reis, Barbaros Hayreddin, the outdated ironclad battleships Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik, nine destroyers, and six torpedo boats, sortied from the Dardanelles at 9:30. The smaller ships remained {{at the mouth of the}} straits while the battleships sailed north, remaining near to the coast. The Greek flotilla, which included the armored cruiser Georgios Averof and Psara and her sisters, had been sailing from the island of Imbros to the patrol line outside the straits. When the Ottomans were sighted, the Greeks altered course to the northeast in order to block the advance of their opponents. In the ensuing Naval Battle of Elli, the Ottoman ships opened fire first, at 9:50, from a range of about 15,000yards; the Greeks returned fire ten minutes later, by which time the range had decreased significantly to 8,500yards. At 10:04, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, and steamed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> straits in a disorganized withdrawal. Within an hour, the routed Ottoman ships had withdrawn into the Dardanelles.|$|E
5|$|The eight trains {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to arrive back in Liverpool at 4.00pm. By 7.00pm, the passenger train was not yet even halfway back to Liverpool. As darkness fell it began to rain, and the drivers, fearing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trains in the dark and wet, slowed the train further. As it had not been intended that the inaugural journey take place in the darkness the trains were not fitted with lighting or engine lamps; the driver of Comet, leading the train, held a burning tarry rope to light the way ahead. Although some of the crowds lining the route were now dispersing, many others had remained to see the trains return. These crowds had been drinking all day; as the train passed under bridges the train, with its open carriages, was pelted with objects thrown down from the bridges, and on one occasion Comet struck a wheelbarrow, apparently deliberately placed across the rails. Passing Eccles, the train stopped briefly for enquiries to be made about Huskisson; those enquiring were told that he was looking frail, and a successful operation was unlikely in his current condition.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners found A and B wings {{unsupervised}} as {{the prison}} officers had already evacuated, {{and began to}} free other prisoners who were still locked in their cells. The prison officer {{in charge of the}} first landing of C wing was ordered to evacuate, {{and with the help of}} three other officers evacuated the 73 Rule 43(a) prisoners being held there, being fearful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoners who were regarded as sex offenders. Due to rioting prisoners entering the wing, the officers were unable to evacuate a further seven Rule 43(a) prisoners who were being held on the second landing. Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in their cells after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners. One such prisoner was Derek White, who was being held on remand on charges of indecent assault and buggery. White later died in North Manchester General Hospital on 3 April after being admitted suffering from head wounds, a dislocated shoulder and chest pains.|$|E
