25|$|There are {{numerous}} types of knitting machines, ranging from simple spool or board templates with no moving parts to highly complex mechanisms controlled by electronics. All, however, produce {{various types of}} <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics,</b> usually either flat or tubular, and of varying degrees of complexity.

40|$|The impact {{properties}} of weft <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites {{have been investigated}} based on their fracture toughness and tensile properties. The fracture toughness of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites was investigated by using double cantilever beam (DCB) tests. The delamination resistance of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites was studied by using the measured fracture toughness values in a simplified delamination model. As forces required to create a delamination are higher than the ultimate impact force, <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites do not fail in delamination failure mode. <b>Knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites tend to fail in flexural mode, either in compression at the impacted area or in tension at the bottom side, opposite to the impacted area. Therefore, {{it is interesting to}} compare the {{impact properties}} of weft <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites with their tensile properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E

It is very attractive in materials science field since the microstructure affects macroscopic properties of a material. This method has great potential when dealing with materials having complex structure, where high variability of characteristics exists. This paper describes an experimental procedure for evaluating structure of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric,</b> used for reinforcements in polymer composites, at mesoscopic scale. The 3 D geometry of the undeformed <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> is determined experimentally using X-ray tomography.

2500|$|The {{most widely}} {{recognized}} form of needle is the single-pointed needle. It is a slender, straight stick tapered {{to a point}} at one end, with a knob {{at the other end}} to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are always used in pairs and are usually 10-16 inches (254–406mm) long but, due to the compressibility of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics,</b> may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. [...] The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. Fictional depictions of knitting in movies, television programs, animation, and comic strips almost always show knitting done on straight needles. Both Wallace and Gromit and Monty Python, for example, show this type of knitting.|$|E
2500|$|Weft-knit fabrics {{may also}} be knit with {{multiple}} yarns, usually to produce interesting color patterns. [...] The two most common approaches are intarsia and stranded colorwork. [...] In intarsia, the yarns are used in well-segregated regions, e.g., a red apple on a field of green; in that case, the yarns are kept on separate spools and only one is knitted at any time. [...] In the more complex stranded approach, two or more yarns alternate repeatedly within one row and all the yarns must be carried along the row, as seen in Fair Isle sweaters. Double knitting can produce two separate <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> simultaneously (e.g., two socks). [...] However, the two fabrics are usually integrated into one, giving it great warmth and excellent drape.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two types}} of {{stitches}} have a different visual effect; the knit stitches look like 'V's stacked vertically, whereas the purl stitches look like a wavy horizontal line across the fabric. Patterns and pictures can be created in <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> by using knit and purl stitches as [...] "pixels"; however, such pixels are usually rectangular, rather than square, depending on the gauge/tension of the knitting. Individual stitches, or rows of stitches, may be made taller by drawing more yarn into the new loop (an elongated stitch), which {{is the basis for}} uneven knitting: a row of tall stitches may alternate with one or more rows of short stitches for an interesting visual effect. Short and tall stitches may also alternate within a row, forming a fish-like oval pattern.|$|E
40|$|The tension-tension fatigue {{behaviour}} of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites {{has been}} investigated. The fatigue damage of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites such as matrix cracks and yarn-matrix debonds was initiated from {{the part of}} the knitting loop that is perpendicular to the loading direction. The fatigue damage then propagated following the knitting structure. The fatigue properties of weft <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites are compared with the fatigue properties of woven fabric composites, loaded in weft and bias (45 degrees) directions. The residual mechanical properties after a certain number of fatigue cycles, such as stiffness and strength, are also presented. As the fatigue damage of the <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> and woven fabric composites in the bias direction is matrix dominated, the hysteresis heating is studied by varying the fatigue frequency.

40|$|A {{progressive}} damage {{model is}} presented for {{the prediction of}} the overall non-linear tensile behaviour of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites. The model {{is an extension of}} a recently developed inclusion method for textile composites, taking into account the major damage modes of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites simultaneously. Matrix non-linearities, playing {{an important role in the}} behaviour of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites, are implemented using the secant stiffness method. Whereas, non-linearities can be attributed to different sources, depending upon the resin toughness, only some limited yielding was currently investigated. Yam/matrix debonding, predominantly responsible for the knee behaviour of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites, is investigated using a simple interfacial failure criterion. A selective degradation scheme based upon a finite set of interfacial damage state variables is employed in the reduction of the inclusion stiffness. Finally, a Hoffman criterion is used for yam failure. The model was used to simulate the tensile behaviour of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> E-glass/epoxy composites, showing the ability to predict the material response with reasonable accuracy in the region before ultimate failure.

2500|$|A {{knitting}} needle or knitting pin {{is a tool}} in hand-knitting to produce <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics.</b> [...] They generally have a long shaft and taper at their end, {{but they are not}} nearly as sharp as sewing needles. [...] Their purpose is two-fold. [...] The long shaft holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place. [...] In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly {{absorbent}} bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term [...] "blue-collar"); and corduroy, seersucker, and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight, [...] breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{knitting}} needles (also called [...] "knitting pins"). [...] The {{first and most}} common type consists of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob {{at the other end}} to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually [...] long but, due to the compressibility of <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics,</b> may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. [...] The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25mm (roughly 1inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge/tension of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. [...] Thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. [...] Although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle. [...] Such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. [...] Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches. [...] The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. [...] Needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.|$|E
