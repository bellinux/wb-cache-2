2500|$|Joanna Sedley – (the heroine) {{also known}} as John Matcham, the ward of Lord Foxham but kidnapped by Sir Daniel. She is sixteen in May 1460. Her {{softness}} and diminutive frame are constantly alluded to in Book 1 as unbecoming to her masculine attire, but later this is set in contrast to her appearance and bearing as a noble young lady: [...] "she, who <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> little and so awkward in the attire of Matcham, was now tall like a young willow, and swam across the floor as though she scorned the drudgery of walking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt {{proceeds}} to contrast {{in greater detail}} the realities of human nature with Bentham's benevolent attempts to manipulate it. Bentham would observe and attempt to alter {{the behavior of a}} criminal by placing him in a [...] "Panopticon, that is, a sort of circular prison, with open cells, like a glass bee-hive." [...] When the offender is freed from its restraints, however, Hazlitt questions whether it is at all likely he will maintain the altered behavior that <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> amenable to change. [...] "Will the convert to the great principle of Utility work when he was from under Mr. Bentham's eye, because he was forced to work when under it? ... Will he not steal, now that his hands are untied? ... The charm of criminal life ... consists in liberty, in hardship, in danger, and in the contempt of death, in one word, in extraordinary excitement".|$|E
2500|$|After {{some three}} weeks at the front, Orwell {{and the other}} English militiaman in his unit, Williams, join a {{contingent}} of fellow Englishmen sent out by the Independent Labour Party to a position at Monte Oscuro, within sight of Zaragoza. [...] "Perhaps {{the best of the}} bunch was Bob Smillie—the grandson of the famous miners' leader—who afterwards died such an evil and meaningless death in Valencia." [...] In this new position he witnesses the sometimes propagandistic shouting between the Rebels and Loyalist trenches and hears of the fall of Málaga. [...] "... every man in the militia believed that the loss of Malaga was due to treachery. It was the first talk I had heard of treachery or divided aims. It set up in my mind the first vague doubts about this war in which, hitherto, the rights and wrongs <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> beautifully simple." [...] In February, he is sent with the other POUM militiamen 50 miles to make a part of the army besieging Huesca; he mentions the running joke phrase, [...] "Tomorrow we'll have coffee in Huesca," [...] attributed to a general commanding the Government troops who, months earlier, made one of many failed assaults on the town.|$|E
5000|$|They are {{her friends}} {{whether or not}} they <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{time that}} pussy went where good cats go. He {{must be at}} least fifteen years old. He <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> lonely since Aunt Martha died." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought she}} had beaten some one of late; she <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> gay and happy. I didn't suppose it was all because I was going away." ...|$|R
60|$|My heart sank. I hated {{all this}} incomprehensible secrecy; {{a moment before}} she <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> different.|$|E
60|$|As may be imagined, {{the sleep}} which visited the three boys {{was not as}} {{profound}} {{as it would have}} been had they been in bed at Kenniston farm. In the first place, the bed of brush, which <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> soft when they first lay down, seemed suddenly to have developed a great number of hard places, while the ends of the boughs, which <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> small when they were cut, apparently increased in size after they had served as a bed for an hour.|$|E
60|$|Faith's {{confidence}} in her champion had dimmed a little by evening, however. Walter <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> very quiet and dull {{the rest of}} the day in school.|$|E
6000|$|... "So this is {{the meaning}} of the change in you, Louise! I knew that {{something}} had happened. You <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> different for the last few months." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 126. The {{extraordinary}} circumstance accompanying this action, which <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> inexplicable, namely, {{the cessation}} of all phenomena when the magnet and metal are brought to rest, now receives a full explanation (82.); for then the electrical currents which cause the motion cease altogether.|$|R
60|$|The {{countryside}} <b>had</b> never <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> scarred {{to him as}} it {{did that}} day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] whispered Lane, and {{he leaned}} forward to cover {{his face with his}} hands. He <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> numb to feeling. But now a storm shook him.|$|E
60|$|Lawford paused. Like a {{flock of}} sheep {{streaming}} helter-skelter {{before the onset of}} a wolf were the thoughts that a moment before <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> orderly and sober.|$|E
60|$|But Jeanne seemed {{unconscious}} of all this. Her {{mind was}} absorbed in Armand, the man whom she loved in her simple, whole-hearted way, and who <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> different of late.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{had thought}} you would take this matter to heart, Puntojee, I should not have told you about it. I did so because I thought you could {{scarcely}} be stained, much longer, without demanding the reason for what must <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> strange a thing.|$|R
60|$|An ode in {{four hundred}} lines would not <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> {{touching}} to Esther; {{her eyes filled}} with happy tears: yes, here was the father of whom she had dreamed, whom Dick had described; simple, enthusiastic, unworldly, kind, a painter at heart, and a fine gentleman in manner.|$|R
60|$|Show her! How could I, when I {{knew that}} for one who {{read between the}} lines the story of my own {{suffering}} was there? My secret had been hard enough to keep faithfully, even from her to whom the truth, had she ever divined it, must <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> incredible.|$|R
60|$|The title <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> {{promising}} overnight--so full of strenuous possibilities. It {{was still}} speciously attractive; {{but now that}} the moment had arrived for writing the story its flaws became manifest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Corey!" [...] said Lapham, in the {{peremptory}} {{voice of}} a master,--he <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> indifferent to Corey's presence {{that the young man}} thought he must have forgotten he was there,--"Is Dennis anywhere round?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I? I {{thought it}} was myself that I doubted." [...] She was {{stricken}} with sudden misgiving as to what <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> well; her words tended rapidly she could not tell whither.|$|E
60|$|Katharine and Ralph were {{agreed with}} {{scarcely}} {{a word of}} discussion {{as to what they}} wished to do, and in a moment she joined him in the hall dressed for walking. The night was still and moonlit, fit for walking, though any night would <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> to them, desiring more than anything movement, freedom from scrutiny, silence, and the open air.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{actually}} {{with tears}} in her eyes, she said that now we knew why she couldn't take us in--why she <b>had</b> to <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> unkind.|$|R
60|$|The {{fifteen minutes}} seemed an hour, but {{they came to}} an end at last, and the word 'Recess!' <b>had</b> never <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> welcome to her before.|$|R
60|$|That night Mr. Stubbs {{slept in}} Toby's arms, {{in the band}} wagon, and both boy and monkey {{appeared}} very well contented with their lot, which a short time previous <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> hard.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed out}} frankly. She wore no veil, and {{a tinge of}} colour had {{found its way into}} her cheeks, {{relieving}} that delicate but not unhealthy pallor, which to Densham <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> exquisite.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't be a minute," [...] {{the tailor}} said, pulling {{the curtain of}} the alcove aside, and then there began those sounds of objurgation and expostulation, {{although}} the ladies <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> amiable before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you love}} me? Can {{you learn to}} love me? Oh, Isa, I have thought of this so long! But you <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> cold that I have not dared to speak. Isa, can you love me?" [...] And he sat himself close beside her. Now that the ice was broken, he was quite {{prepared}} to become an ardent lover,--if she would allow of such ardour. But as he sat down she rose.|$|R
6000|$|... "This, then," [...] said Middleton thoughtfully, [...] "accounts {{for much}} that <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> strange {{in the events}} through which we have passed; for the {{knowledge}} of my identity and my half-defined purpose which has always glided before me, and thrown so many strange shapes of difficulty in my path. But whence,--whence came that malevolence which your father's conduct has so unmistakably shown? I had done him no injury, though I had suffered much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are well, Beric," [...] {{the girl}} said; [...] "but oh the time <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> long! It {{is not yet}} a month since you sent us here, but it seems a year. She has been very kind to us, and done all that she could, and the girls, her daughters, have gone with me {{sometimes}} for rambles in the wood; but they cannot speak our language. Not another person has been here since we came." ...|$|R
60|$|Trevor {{was not at}} {{all sure}} how the {{headmaster}} would take it. But Clowes <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> cut up at his suggestion that it had better be omitted, that he had allowed it to stand.|$|E
60|$|All {{that had}} been in his mind seemed {{suddenly}} miraged before him--the removal of Hunterleys, his own wife's failing health. The way <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> clear only a little time ago, and now the clouds were back again.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes. Once more {{there was that}} change in his face which <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> {{wonderful}} to her. The blue of his eyes was soft, his mouth almost tremulous. She answered him almost as though mesmerised.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} {{replaced}} the chair. And suddenly {{a wave of}} pity passed over her for the dead woman, who <b>had</b> always <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> lonely in the great stiffly-furnished house, and the tears came.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, very, sometimes. I fancy, {{but it is}} only fancy, that I {{could move}} better if I was up and dressed. It <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> more <b>so</b> lately, since I have been stronger." ...|$|R
60|$|And yet it <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> full {{of comfort}} and of strength, the night. In its great presence, our small sorrows creep away, ashamed. The day has been so full of fret and care, and our hearts have been so full of evil and of bitter thoughts, and the world <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> hard and wrong to us. Then Night, like some great loving mother, gently lays her hand upon our fevered head, and turns our little tear-stained faces up to hers, and smiles; and, though she does not speak, we know what she would say, and lay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom, and the pain is gone.|$|R
