50|$|Partial stroke testing (or PST) is a {{technique}} used in a control system to allow the user to test {{a percentage of the}} possible failure modes of a shut <b>down</b> <b>valve</b> without the need to physically close the valve. PST is used to assist in determining that the safety function will operate on demand. PST is most often used on high integrity emergency shutdown valves (ESDVs) in applications where closing the valve will have a high cost burden yet proving the integrity of the valve is essential to maintaining a safe facility. In addition to ESDVs PST is also used on high integrity pressure protection systems or HIPPS. Partial stroke testing is not a replacement for the need to fully stroke valves as proof testing is still a mandatory requirement.|$|E

The main boundary conditions for the CODEX-CT- 2 were similar to the previous CODEX-CT- 1 test. The most significant difference between the two tests was the operation of the air let <b>down</b> <b>valve</b> that was open in the first test and closed in the second one. In the second test the hydrogen produced in the Zr-steam reaction could not escape from the test section and it prevented the access of steam to the Zr surfaces and caused much less oxidation than was observed in the first tests.

50|$|A {{sleeve valve}} is a device {{typically}} {{used in a}} water supply or distribution system {{when there is a}} need to reduce high pressure or throttle flow. The sleeve valve consists of a cylindrical gate (tube) which slides over an inner sleeve. The inner sleeve consists of a series of nozzles specifically sized and arranged to provide a solution to cavitation issues frequently encountered in throttling applications with other valve types. Because of its design, it minimizes cavitation. Cavitation that does occur in severe throttling conditions is directed from the <b>valve</b> <b>down</b> to center of the valve or pipe so that no erosion damage to the piping can take place.|$|R
50|$|A {{rocker arm}} (in {{the context of}} an {{internal}} combustion engine of automotive, marine, motorcycle and reciprocating aviation types) is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement at the poppet valve to open it. One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft (either directly or via a tappet (lifter) and pushrod) while the other end acts on the valve stem. When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm, the inside presses <b>down</b> on the <b>valve</b> stem, opening the valve. When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation, the inside rises, allowing the valve spring to close the valve.|$|R
50|$|When {{the rods}} {{at the pump}} end are {{travelling}} up, the traveling valve is closed and the standing valve is open (due to the drop in pressure in the pump barrel). Consequently, the pump barrel fills with the fluid from the formation as the traveling piston lifts the previous contents of the barrel upwards. When the rods begin pushing <b>down,</b> the traveling <b>valve</b> opens and the standing valve closes (due {{to an increase in}} pressure in the pump barrel). The traveling valve drops through the fluid in the barrel (which had been sucked in during the upstroke). The piston then reaches the end of its stroke and begins its path upwards again, repeating the process.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{screw-down}} tap mechanism was patented {{and manufactured}} by the Rotherham brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845. Most older taps use a soft rubber or neoprene washer which is screwed <b>down</b> onto a <b>valve</b> seat {{in order to}} stop the flow. This is called a [...] "globe valve" [...] in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the rubber washer and the valve seat are subject to wear (and for the seat, also corrosion) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking tap. The washer can be replaced and the valve seat resurfaced (at least a few times), but globe valves are never maintenance-free.|$|R
50|$|Generally L-head engines use a {{small chamber}} {{on one side of}} the {{cylinder}} to carry the valves. This has a number of advantages, primarily in that it makes the cylinder head much simpler. It also means that the valve can be operated by pushing directly up on it, as opposed to needing some sort of mechanical arrangement to push the <b>valves</b> <b>down.</b> It may also lead to slightly easier cooling, as the valves and operating rods are out of the way of the cylinder, making a cooling jacket simpler to construct (but see below). The line of intakes along the side of the engine lead to the name L-head, due to the cylinders having the shape of an upside-down L. This configuration is also known as sidevalve, as the valves are located beside the cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2000s, Lipsky began another {{redefinition}} of palette, reincorporating color within a bold central image.

[...] The critic David Cohen, in The New York Sun, noted instead the opposite of classicism, [...] "a steely, seemingly dispassionate composure" [...] that contained [...] "seething reserves of aesthetic emotion," [...] stating, [...] "Lipsky is not merely the dean of contemporary geometric abstraction but its dominatrix." ...|$|R
5000|$|Steam engines {{frequently}} possess {{two independent}} mechanisms for {{ensuring that the}} pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe. Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve {{in the top of}} a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the <b>valve</b> <b>down</b> to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.|$|R
