5000|$|During the 50s {{this method}} was {{widespread}} throughout the mine. According to the inclination of the veins, used: parallel fronts (for sub-horizontal veins) or irregular fronts, also called [...] "modas e bordados” (fashions and embroideries) (for veins with a slope between 7º and 12º). Wooden ore cars circulated within the stope (manual filling) that transported the ore to the bins where it dropped by gravity to the Lower Scrolling Level. Mechanical drilling {{was done with}} compressed air <b>jacklegs</b> and the start off was done, as today by explosives. When filling the ore cars the waste was chosen remaining as a wall that accompanied the advancement of the excavation constituting the structure responsible {{for the support of}} the cavity. This method had several drawbacks such as the requirement of a lot of labour and the loss of the finer fraction of the ore as it was violently thrown against the stone walls. The method was improved in order to find solutions for the loss of this finer fraction and consequently more mineralized.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether aesthesiometric threshold changes occur over the course of a workshift in vibration exposed hard rock miners relative to workers unexposed to vibration during the shift. The subjects were 99 miners and 40 smelter workers; four subjects declined to participate and nine were excluded from the analysis because of apparent failure to comprehend the testing procedure. Two point discrimination and depth sense aesthesiometry were conducted at the beginning and at the end of the workshift in all digits of both hands excluding the thumbs. In addition to the use of a vibrating tool during the shift, age, digital temperature, signs of arm injury, presence of fingertip callus, and handedness were documented. In the analysis the difference between postshift and preshift readings was studied in relation to these variables, particularly exposure to the <b>jackleg</b> drill during the shift. With the exception of exposure of the <b>jackleg</b> drill, no associations were observed between these variables and change over the workshift in aesthesiometric results, on both unadjusted comparison of means and backward elimination regression analysis. A statistically significant association, however, was found between the use of a <b>jackleg</b> drill and change in two point discrimination and in depth sense aesthesiometric results over the course of the shift, for the right hand. Evidence of the occurrence of a learning effect, particularly for two point discrimination aesthesiometry, was observed. The occurrence of an effect in the right, but not the left, hand reflects dominant handedness and relatively greater vibration exposure in the right hand in our subjects. This study supports the incorporation of an exposure free interval before aesthesiometric testing of vibration exposed workers...|$|E

40|$|Overexposure to noise {{remains a}} widespread, serious health hazard in the US mining and other {{industries}} despite 25 years of regulation. Most categories of illnesses and injuries associated with mining have improved, {{with the exception}} of hearing loss. The drilling of rock in a confined work environment contributes to high levels of noise exposure in mining. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is conducting research to reduce the noise exposures of <b>jackleg</b> drill operators and to prevent additional cases of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) by developing and evaluating low-cost retrofit noise controls for equipment. This report describes the procedure for the measurement and reporting of noise from portable pneumatic tools such as <b>jackleg</b> drills. The technique used in this research allows for the determination of the source A-weighted sound power levels and the radiation patterns in octave and 1 / 3 octave bands. Overall sound power level is also determined. This paper also reports the results obtained by using this procedure to evaluate a SECO S 215 standard production drill and a CSIR Miningtek prototype rock drill incorporating engineering noise control measures. It was found that by using the manufacture 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s recommended operating pressure of 496 kPa (72 psi) that the CSIR prototype 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s sound power was 10 dB(A) less then that of the SECO S 215...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Jackleg</b> Testament Part I: Jack & Eve is a one-of-a-kind {{motion picture}} {{derived from the}} crisply styled woodcuts of Kentucky-born Jay Bolotin (b. 1949). The film reinterprets the story of Adam and Eve as a dark, provocative tale in which Eve is lured from the Garden of Eden by a Jack-in-the-Box. Presiding over the story is Nobodaddy, a mischievous, unforgiving creator, named after William Blake’s term for God within the Old Testament. Bolotin’s world is meticulously and vividly realised, an evocative hybrid of German expressionism, Brueghel and medieval {{religious}} imagery. An operatic score and soundtrack, composed by Bolotin, propels the film throughout, featuring {{the voices of the}} great English tenor Nigel Robson, Wagnerian bass Monte Jaffe, Karin Bergquist, lead singer of US band Over the Rhine, and Bolotin himself. The script, also written by the artist, is rich in literary echoes, from Shakespeare to Kafka, and often darkly funny Jay Bolotin is a prolific artist, writer, composer, performer, set designer, musician and filmmaker. Born in Kentucky, 1949, his woodcuts are represented in collections including Museum of Modern Art, New York, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego and Seattle Art Museum, and he has composed and performed scores for opera, dance productions, films and television <br/...|$|E
40|$|In the October 1998 {{issue of}} the Holmes Safety Association Bulletin, NIOSH authors Mark Stephenson and Carol Merry wrote the article Hearing loss among miners and {{measures}} to protect hearing, which focused on the extensiveness of hearing loss among miners {{and the use of}} hearing protection to prevent hearing loss. While the primary importance of engineering controls in preventing hearing loss was discussed, since miners do not generally have control over their work en 2 or assignments, the article focused on the importance of consis 2 use of hearing protection. In this article, all aspects of a compre 2 approach to the prevention of hearing loss in miners will be covered. The discussions will do the following: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 describe application of the hierarchy of controls in preventing hear 2 loss in miners, 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 give an example for each type of control measure and its impact, 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 explain the major provisions, be 2 the hierarchy of controls, of the recent NIOSH document en-titled Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupa 2 Noise Exposure, Revised Criteria 1998 relative to a hearing loss prevention program, and 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 summarize important points on control of noise exposure for every miner to remember, equipment in most facets of operations. Miners are well aware of noisy areas in or around equipment, icluding extraction machinery such as draglines, power shovels, longwall shearers, and continuous mining machines; powered haulage equipment such as load-haul-dumps, shuttle cars, large trucks, and continuous haulage units; roof bolting machines; <b>jackleg</b> drills and stopers; auxiliary equipment such as compressors, fans, and pumps; size reduction equipment, etc. They are not well aware of the insidious nature of pro 2 hearing loss, which is per 2, but they are generally aware of what levels of noise are hazardous and what measures can be taken to reduce their personal noise exposure. Behaviorally, however, there are many reasons why miners choose not to use hearing protection faithfully...|$|E
