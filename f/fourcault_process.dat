5000|$|Time, {{speed and}} spacing {{of the various}} phases of the process are {{critical}} factors in the <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process.</b> <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process</b> machine operators require experience in order to judge placement of the die, location of {{various parts of the}} process, and rates of draw. These must be balanced against glass quality and the age of the draw.|$|E
50|$|The {{resultant}} {{product is}} a form of flat glass which is suitable for lesser quality uses. Due to process instabilities <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process</b> glass can have waves, seeds (small gas bubbles) or stones (undissolved materials).|$|E
50|$|He died in 1948 and was {{survived by}} {{three of his}} four sons. The eldest, Bishambar Dayal Varshnei who died in 1939, {{introduced}} hollow ware technology to India. His second son, Harish Chandra Varshnei is credited {{with the introduction of}} sheet glass manufacturing (with the <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process)</b> to Continental Asia (ex-Japan) in the 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process</b> {{requires}} a [...] "pit" [...] or drawing area and an assembly of machines {{to draw up}} the ribbon of glass while performing actions upon it that ensure desired quality and process yields. Today most glass manufacture has a [...] "hot end" [...] where the products are made. Fourcault is no exception.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process</b> is {{a method}} of {{manufacturing}} flat glass. First developed in Belgium by Ã‰mile Fourcault during the early 1900s, the process was used globally. Fourcault {{is an example of}} a [...] "vertical draw" [...] process, in that the glass is drawn against gravity in an upward direction. Gravity forces influence parts of the process.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{economics}} and product quality the <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process</b> has been supplanted in many countries by the Pilkington developed [...] "Float" [...] process. The Float process lets the molten glass settle {{on top of a}} pool of liquid tin, so that gravity creates a flat sheet. Due to various chemistry and physical aspects of window glass the Pilkington Float process produces a vastly superior product.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{producing}} hand-blown window glass included broad sheet, blown plate, crown glass and polished plate. These methods of manufacture lasted {{at least until}} the end of the 19th century. The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as rolled plate, machine drawn cylinder sheet, the <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process</b> of flat drawn sheet, single and twin ground polished plate and most common, float glass.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Fourcault</b> <b>Process</b> uses {{a ceramic}} die to shape fused (or molten) glass into a ribbon of {{rectangular}} cross section. The die, {{known as a}} Debiteuse, floats in the molten glass inside of the pit to a prescribed depth which slightly pushes {{a part of the}} molten glass slightly above the top surface of the die. A slot is cut {{through the center of the}} Debiteuse, which is shaped to produce the best quality of glass.|$|E
50|$|Drawn Sheet {{glass was}} made by dipping a leader into a vat of molten glass then pulling that leader {{straight}} up while a film of glass hardened {{just out of the}} vat - this is known as the <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process.</b> This film or ribbon was pulled up continuously held by tractors on both edges while it cooled. After 12 metres or so it was cut off the vertical ribbon and tipped down to be further cut. This glass is clear but has thickness variations due to small temperature changes just out of the vat as it was hardening. These variations cause lines of slight distortions. This glass may still be seen in older houses. Float glass replaced this process.|$|E
5000|$|General Glass Industries was a United States based {{wholly owned}} {{subsidiary}} of General Glass International. Also known as [...] "GGI", this company manufactured sheet glass from 1988 until 1993 using the <b>Fourcault</b> <b>process.</b> GGI also produced cut sheet and window glass from flat glass produced by other manufacturers. The site of GGI {{was located in}} Jeannette, Pennsylvania, which is located east of Pittsburgh, PA. GGI {{was one of the}} largest single employers in Jeannette {{and was one of the}} last of the [...] "major" [...] glass plants to operate in the [...] "Glass City". According to local rumors the [...] "Window House" [...] as it was known, was once the largest producer of window glass in the world.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970s, Asahi Glass Co. Ltd. {{was searching}} for a new {{overseas}} production base after Thailand. In Indonesia, it found a joint partner PT Rodamas, a merchant company turned consumer and industrial product manufacturer. Both established Asahimas Flat Glass in April 1973. It produced simple clear glass using the traditional <b>Fourcault</b> <b>Process.</b> Therefore, its product line was quickly diversified to include new, innovative products such as Specialty Glass,History Safety Glass, Reflective Glass and Mirror. These days, Asahimas increases an aggregate installed production capacity of 570,000 tons for Flat Glass, 4,500,000 square meters for Safety Glass and 2,400,000 square meters for mirror. This large number of annual capacity ranks Asahimas not only as the largest glass manufacturer in Indonesia but also in Southeast Asia. Ownership (2014): ...|$|E
