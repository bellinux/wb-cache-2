40|$|It {{has always}} been a major {{priority}} for policy makers to know whether national debts are fiscally sustainable. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of public government debt levels (debt as a share of GDP) on per-capita GDP growth in the ten Canadian provinces. Using panel data from 1989 to 2008 and the standard two-stage least squares approach (IV/ 2 SLS) as well as GMM estimation, the study concludes that public debt is inversely related to the growth rate of GDP per capita. Consistent with other existing studies, this paper also shows evidence that debt levels are nonlinearly associated to economic growth with a debt turning point estimated to be around 40 % of GDP on average. This threshold may seem small compared to an average of 80 - 90 % that has been reported in previous studies but it would be both irrelevant and misleading to make such a comparison. This is because the analysis in this paper is based on <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> <b>debt</b> (the difference between total financial assets and total liabilities) and not gross debt. Therefore, given how significant the gap between gross <b>debt</b> and <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> can be, the debt turning point estimated in this study is not small per se.

40|$|Executive summary: While Commonwealth {{government}} debt {{has been the}} focus of attention recently, this report takes a broader view by bringing state debt into the picture. Much has been made of the fact that Commonwealth {{government debt}} is projected (under current expenditure and tax policies) to grow from $ 300 billion at June 2013 to more than $ 400 billion in 2016 – 17 — and keep growing. Over the same four years, <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> (after deducting certain financial assets) is expected to grow from $ 153 billion to $ 280 billion and then to $ 325 billion in 2018 – 19, at which point it will peak as a percentage of GDP. State debt has also risen dramatically since 2007, when <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> was negative. In the six years to 2013, states added $ 70 billion to their general government <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> to reach a positive level of $ 43 billion. Aggregate state debt is manageable at that level, but the upward trend is of concern—and more so in some states than others. By 2016 – 17, combined Commonwealth and state general government (GG) <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> will exceed $ 350 billion—almost 20 % of GDP, or more meaningfully, more than 50 % of general government revenue. The general government debt figures do not tell the full story. For the broader non-financial public sector (which includes non-financial public corporations), state <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> was much higher at $ 127 billion in 2013. Combined with the Commonwealth, total non-financial public sector <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> was $ 283 billion, already 50 % of the sector’s revenue. Public corporations’ debt is guaranteed by their government owners, but these corporations are better able to carry debt as their investments are supposed to be commercially viable. The above figures exclude non-debt financial liabilities such as unfunded superannuation and long-service leave liabilities. These loom large in state finances. When added to <b>net</b> <b>debt,</b> non-debt <b>financial</b> liabilities bring the 2013 total of <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> liabilities to $ 190 billion for state general government and $ 319 billion for the state non-financial public sector. In most states, general government <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> liabilities in 2013 exceeded 100 % of revenue, having increased steeply since 2007. The states’ financial position has deteriorated because their net operating surpluses have shrunk while capital (‘infrastructure’) spending soared, resulting in large cash deficits. All states have experienced this deterioration: Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have lost the coveted triple-A credit rating, and NSW and Victoria are at risk of being downgraded should current trends continue. All states have curbed the growth of operating expenditure, but they will need to persevere in the face of sluggish revenue if they are to rebuild operating surpluses and avoid sharp cuts in capital expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Expected Returns, Actual Returns, and Leverage: Empirical Analysis of the S&P 500, 2006 - 2015 Edward Bace, Middlesex University Business School, e. bace@mdx. ac. uk ABSTRACT Purpose The {{theoretical}} {{construct of}} the weighted {{average cost of}} capital (WACC), which uses an expected equity return, suggests that lower WACC, often facilitated by use of debt, should result in commensurate returns to shareholders, and higher shareholder value, that is if management is adept at investing in projects yielding returns {{at or above the}} WACC. In other words, finding good projects ought to be made easier by a lower hurdle rate on investment, thus translating into returns comparable to or above the WACC, and higher valuations. Is this actually the case? Does the relation between WACC, actual returns, and financial leverage also hold, as predicted, where higher leverage should result in lower WACC, and higher actual returns? Methodology This brief study looks at performance and valuation (total equity market returns to shareholders, and market values, on an annual basis) of S&P 500 companies over a recent ten year period (2006 - 2015), versus valuations implied by price to book ratios and WACC based on firm leverage. We compare theoretical valuations with the actual, and note variations year on year, but greater similarity over a longer time frame. Regression analysis is performed on these shareholder returns and valuations versus equity cost of these companies as computed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Bloomberg data. Another regression is run on WACC versus <b>financial</b> leverage (<b>net</b> <b>debt</b> to market capitalisation) for the same sample. Findings The study finds mixed evidence that expected return on equity, regarded as a benchmark for shareholder returns, was commensurate with actual returns and valuations on average over the time frame.

We show that the examination of the concept of <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> (gross debt less public sector assets) can cover up important questions about the public indebtedness. We ask if one can have some idea about the future behavior of <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> based on the present performance of gross debt.

40|$|Abstract: We {{lay out a}} {{decomposition}} of book-to-price (B/P) that articulates precisely how B/P “absorbs ” leverage, and apply this decomposition to examine the relation between B/P and future stock returns. If <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> is carried at market value on the balance sheet, B/P can be decomposed into an enterprise book-to-price (that potentially reflects operating risk) and a financial leverage component (that reflects financing risk), with differences between the book value {{and the price of}} equity attributable only to the operating component. With this accounting for <b>net</b> <b>debt,</b> the book-to-price ratio for <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> is unity and the standard measure of “market ” leverage – <b>net</b> <b>debt</b> relative to the market value of equity – is economic leverage, but only if the market prices risk appropriately. The enterprise book-to-price ratio is positively related to subsequent stock returns but, conditional upon the enterprise book-to-price, the financial leverage component of B/P is negatively associated with future stock returns. While it is difficult to interpret the result for the enterprise book-to-price as a reward for risk or a mispricing of risk, the result for financial leverage is seemingly perverse: Finance theory rather unambiguously predicts that, given operating risk, investors should be further rewarded for taking on financing risk. We find the opposite, for all levels of the enterprise book-to-price. The findings survive under controls fo...|$|R
