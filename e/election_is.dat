40|$|Abstract One of {{the common}} {{normative}} assumptions about <b>elections</b> <b>is</b> that competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> inherently good, and non-competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> problematic. This paper challenges that assumption. At the level of individual elections, competitive elections pro-duce either sub-optimal results or trivially optimal results, but competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> never uniquely optimal. In aggregation, competitive elections {{for a set of}} offices are inher-ently sub-optimal. From a procedural perspective, the circumstances in which competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> appropriate are rare, and from a diagnostic perspective, we cannot conclude that there are problems in the electoral system based on a lack of competition. In the context of social choice theory, competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> not inherently good...|$|R

5|$|If the <b>election</b> <b>is</b> a non-reserved election, and {{the person}} applied for a {{community}} certificate, the certificate issued to him or the Community Committee's written rejection of the application.

5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy.

While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E
