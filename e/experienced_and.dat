The task was made all the more dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including Manfred von Richthofen's highly <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> well equipped Jasta 11, which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft {{during the first week of}} April (Bloody April).

Using a large administrative dataset for Norwegian manufacturing, I find that more educated workers have higher <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> seniority premiums, indicating that they accumulate more human capital (both general and firm-specific) than workers with less education. Firm characteristics are also found to be important for <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> seniority premiums.

There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing, pressure suit malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Information on patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> {{satisfaction}} with individual physicians could {{play an important}} role for performance measures, improved health care and health literacy. Physician rating sites (PRSs) bear {{the potential to be a}} widely available source for this kind of information. However, patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction are complex constructs operationalized by multiple dimensions. The way in which PRSs allow users to express <b>and</b> rate patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction could likely influence the image of doctors in society and the self-understanding of both doctors and patients. This study examines the extent to which PRSs currently represent the constructs of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. Methods First, a systematic review of research instruments for measuring patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction was conducted. The content of these instruments was analyzed qualitatively to create a comprehensive set of dimensions for patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> patient satisfaction. Second, PRSs were searched for systematically in English-language and German-language search engines of Google and Yahoo. Finally, we classified every structured question asked by the different PRS using the set of dimensions of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. Results The qualitative content analysis of the measurement instruments produced 13 dimensions of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. We identified a total of 21 PRSs. No PRSs represented all 13 dimensions of patient satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> with its structured questions. The 3 most trafficked English-language PRS represent between 5 and 6 dimensions and the 3 most trafficked German language PRSs between 8 and 11 dimensions The dimensions for patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction most frequently represented in PRSs included diversely operationalized ones such as professional competence and doctor-patient relationship/support. However, other less complex but nevertheless important dimensions such as communication skills and information/advice were rarely represented, especially in English-language PRSs. Conclusions Concerning the potential impact of PRSs on health systems, further research is needed to show which of the current operationalizations of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction presented in our study are establishing themselves in PRSs. Independently of this factual development, the question also arises whether and to what extent health policy can and should influence the operationalization of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction in PRSs. Here, the challenge would be to produce a set of dimensions capable of consensus from among the wide range of operationalizations found by this study. </p...|$|R
