5|$|The second {{school of}} Vedanta is the Vishishtadvaita, {{which was founded}} by Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE). Ramanuja {{disagreed}} with Adi Shankara and the Advaita school. Visistadvaita is a synthetic philosophy bridging the monistic Advaita and theistic Dvaita systems of Vedanta. Ramanuja frequently cited the Upanishads, and stated that Vishishtadvaita <b>is</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|The third {{school of}} Vedanta called the Dvaita school {{was founded by}} Madhvacharya (1199–1278 CE). It is {{regarded}} as a strongly theistic philosophic exposition of Upanishads. Madhvacharya, much like Adi Shankara claims for Advaita, and Ramanuja claims for Vishishtadvaita, states that his theistic Dvaita Vedanta <b>is</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upanishads.|$|E

25|$|Many {{elements}} of the gut develop in a three-fold pattern (for example, dances repeated three times). Threefoldedness has important meaning in Sinism, for it signifies completion or fulfilment of the beginning; a three-time repetition of an action means to complete the initial intention.

25|$|Drop kicks {{are used}} to start play at the {{beginning}} of each half or restart play after points have been scored or the ball <b>is</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> in-goal by a defending team. The ball is either kicked long to gain as much territory as possible or short so that the chasers have a chance to regain possession. A shot at goal can also be attempted using a drop goal. This can happen anytime during general play, except after a free kick has been awarded. As a missed drop goal gives possession to the opposition they are generally only attempted in close games to either gain the lead or to push the score beyond a converted try.|$|E
25|$|A {{contrasting}} {{approach is}} called physicalism. Physicalism is a philosophical theory holding {{that everything that}} exists is no more extensive than its physical properties; that is, {{that there are no}} non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. Reductive physicalism <b>is</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, non-reductive physicalism asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as qualia) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not {{rule out the possibility that}} mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, anomalous monism, mental events supervene on physical events, describing the emergence of mental properties correlated with physical properties - implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as property dualism rather than monism, yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the idea that when people access a word's meaning, sensorimotor information that is used to perceive and act on the concrete object the word suggests is automatically activated. In the theory of grounded cognition, the meaning of a particular word <b>is</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sensorimotor systems. For example, when one thinks of a pear, knowledge of grasping, chewing, sights, sounds, and tastes used to encode episodic experiences of a pear are recalled through sensorimotor simulation. A grounded simulation approach refers to context-specific re-activations that integrate the important features of episodic experience into a current depiction. Such {{research has}} challenged previously utilized amodal views. The brain encodes multiple inputs such as words and pictures to integrate and create a larger conceptual idea by using amodal views (also known as amodal perceptions. Instead of being representations in modality-specific systems, semantic memory representations had previously been viewed as redescriptions of modality-specific states. Some accounts of category-specific semantic deficits that are amodal remain even though researchers are beginning to find support for theories in which knowledge is tied to modality-specific brain regions. This research defines a clear link between episodic experiences and semantic memory. The concept that semantic representations are grounded across modality-specific brain regions can be supported by the fact that episodic and semantic memory appear to function in different yet mutually dependent ways. The distinction between semantic and episodic memory has {{become a part of the}} broader scientific discourse. For example, it has been speculated that semantic memory captures the stable aspects of our personality while episodes of illness may have a more episodic nature.|$|E

500|$|Building on that theme, E. P. Clowney {{explained}} that three dimensions of Christian meditation are crucial, not merely for showing its distinctiveness, but for guiding its practice. The {{first is that}} Christian meditation <b>is</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bible. Because the God of the Bible is a personal God who speaks in words of revelation, Christian meditation responds to this revelation and focuses on that aspect, in contrast to mystic meditations which use mantras. The second distinctive mark of Christian meditation is that it responds to the love of God, as in I John : [...] "We love, for he first loved us". The personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion is thus heightened in Christian meditation. The third dimension is that the revelations of the Bible {{and the love of}} God lead to the worship of God: making Christian meditation an exercise in praise.|$|E

[...] Within {{the ecosystem}}, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain, and exchange energy and matter between themselves {{as well as with the}}ir environment.
