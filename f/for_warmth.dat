5|$|A cold-blooded reptile, {{the painted}} turtle regulates its {{temperature}} through its environment, notably by basking. All ages bask <b>for</b> <b>warmth,</b> often alongside {{other species of}} turtle. Sometimes more than 50individuals are seen on one log together. Turtles bask {{on a variety of}} objects, often logs, but have even been seen basking on top of common loons that were covering eggs.|$|E
5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} <b>for</b> <b>warmth</b> and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The Galloway is {{naturally}} hornless, {{and instead of}} horns has a bone knob {{at the top of}} its skull called the poll. This breed's shaggy coat has both a thick, woolly undercoat <b>for</b> <b>warmth</b> and stiffer guard hairs that help shed water, making them well adapted to harsher climates.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires <b>for</b> <b>warmth</b> or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was born}} on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He was one of six {{children}} born to Julia Lindsey Brown, a schoolteacher, and John Brown, a grocery warehouse worker. He had four brothers, Marvin, William, Fletcher, and Lura, {{as well as an}} older sister known as Johnny. Brown's ancestry was African American, Chicksaw, and Choctaw. The family lived in a house without central heating or indoor plumbing so they relied on a fireplace <b>for</b> <b>warmth.</b> As a child, Jesse's brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the tunnel}} fell into disuse. It became popular with {{homeless}} people and drug users. A police report from around 1950 stated that squatters used the edifice <b>for</b> <b>warmth</b> and shelter from elements, {{as well as}} a hideout and a meeting place. The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led to the rise of a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the Croatian Parliament palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gupčeva Zvijezda.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "shortie" [...] wetsuit may be worn over a full wetsuit <b>for</b> added <b>warmth.</b> Some vendors sell a {{very similar}} item and {{refer to it as}} a 'core warmer' when worn over another wetsuit. [...] A [...] "skin" [...] may also be worn under a wetsuit. This {{practice}} started with divers (of both sexes) wearing body tights under a wetsuit <b>for</b> extra <b>warmth</b> and to make donning and removing the wetsuit easier. A [...] "skin" [...] may also be as an undersuit beneath a drysuit in temperatures where a full undersuit is not necessary.|$|R
5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, {{but the most}} likely time of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers <b>for</b> <b>warmth.</b> For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E
5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows {{up and down in}} front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers <b>for</b> <b>warmth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditional hunters {{used all}} parts of the walrus. The meat, often preserved, is an {{important}} winter nutrition source; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools, as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered <b>for</b> <b>warmth</b> and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas. While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets, and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.|$|E

5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a well-known brand of footwear owned by Deckers. The boots {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn <b>for</b> <b>warmth</b> and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion trend in the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide trend in the late 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders <b>for</b> <b>warmth</b> and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its high}} {{altitude}} the city temperatures can reach temperatures below 0°C. Many homes burn firewood <b>for</b> <b>warmth</b> in cold weather.

25|$|Bonin {{flying foxes}} are an animal species known to display {{homosexual}} behavior, with males observed performing fellatio on other males.

In one of these half-sleeping moments {{he thought he saw}} a figure, as of a woman in white, gliding into the room, and beckoning Wolfgang from it. He looked again. Wolfgang was gone. At that moment twelve o'clock clanged from the town, and Otto started up.|$|R
