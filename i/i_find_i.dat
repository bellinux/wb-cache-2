500|$|On November 23, 1998, Madonna {{appeared}} on the Spanish RTVE show El Séptimo de Caballeria and performed [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", along with her other song [...] "The Power of Good-Bye". Three years later, Madonna named her 2001 Drowned World Tour after the song, and performed it as the opening number. She entered the stage amidst billows of dry ice, dressed in a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, jeans with zips and bondage straps, a studded dog collar and a tartan kilt and performed the song standing on a [...] rising platform on {{the middle of the}} stage. Also during this same tour, the last lyrics from the song ("Now, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> changed my mind/This is my religion") were used {{at the end of the}} performance of [...] "Ray of Light". The performance at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan on August 26, 2001 was released in the live video release, Drowned World Tour 2001. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH gave the performance a positive review, saying it was sung beautifully. Joshua Clover from Spin described Madonna's arrival during the performance as [...] " [...] taking the style war to stage".|$|E
2500|$|Dembski has not {{explained}} {{the origin of}} the intelligent designer that created the universe, which he argues is unnecessary, since such an intelligent designer is likely outside the dimensions of space and time, or to have any of his pro-intelligent design articles published in the peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals. While intelligent design proponents often claim that such failure to get articles published is due to an alleged pro-evolution bias or conspiracy, Dembski himself has said that he prefers to disseminate his ideas in non-peer-reviewed media: [...] "I've just gotten kind of blasé about submitting things to journals where you often wait two years to get things into print. And <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> can actually get the turnaround faster by writing a book and getting the ideas expressed there. My books sell well. I get a royalty. And the material gets read more." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June Pitt heard Fitzwilliam's {{objection}} {{from the}} Duke of Portland. Pitt assured [...] "that the re-establishment of the Crown of France in such {{person of the}} family of Bourbon as shall be naturally entitled to it was the first and determined aim of the present Ministry". Pitt wished to discuss this with Fitzwilliam in person. On 23 June Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland that he believed the government had moved to the Whig position and that [...] "for my own part I am now ready, not only to adopt the opinion that a junction should take place, as your sentiment, but to advise it as the genuine offspring of my own judgement... as much weight and sway should be given to us as possible. ... In my humble opinion, this junction will not produce half its effect if it is not opened to the world by such marks of real substantial favour and confidence {{on the part of the}} Crown towards us as will mark beyond dispute the return of weight, power and consideration to the Old Whigs...after thirty years' exclusion from patronage in the line of peerage" [...] new Whig peers should be created. He also rejected office except of [...] "going to Ireland, but...it is impossible". However the Duke of Portland and Lord Mansfield implored Fitzwilliam to accept office and when Lord Mansfield saw Fitzwilliam when he came down to London on 28 June he got Fitzwilliam [...] "to admit that if ever he was to take office this was the time". The next day Fitzwilliam met the Duke of Portland and reported that: [...] "I see little prospect of escaping office...the duke...seems so intent upon my accepting, as almost to say that he will not, if I do not—I left him last night my reasons for thinking that I should be more serviceable out of office, than in...if <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> have not persuaded him, I must submit". When Pitt met the Duke of Portland on 1 July he offered the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland to Fitzwilliam as soon as Lord Westmoreland could be compensated for the loss of it. Therefore, on 3 July Fitzwilliam agreed to join the coalition government as Lord President of the Council for the time being, writing that day to Lady Rockingham: [...] "It is a time when private affection must give way to public exigency".|$|E
