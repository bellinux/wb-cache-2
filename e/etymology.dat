5|$|Number {{names are}} {{rendered}} {{in the language}} of the country, but are similar everywhere due to shared <b>etymology.</b> Some languages, particularly in East Asia and South Asia, have large number naming systems that are different from both the long and short scales, for example the Indian numbering system.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} {{theories about the}} <b>etymology</b> {{the name of the}} goddess, connections to fertility and ploughing practices, the implications of the references made to her as a virgin, five potential mentions of the goddess in the Old English poem Beowulf, and potential connections between Gefjon and Grendel's Mother and/or the goddesses Freyja and Frigg.|$|E
5|$|The <b>etymology</b> of London is uncertain. It is {{an ancient}} name, attested already {{in the first century}} CE, usually in the Latinised form Londinium; for example, hand-written Roman tablets {{recovered}} in the city originating from AD 65/70-80 include the word Londinio ("in London").|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of the word grope {{being used in the}} indecent sense of sexual {{touching}} appears in 1380; cunt has been used to describe the vulva since at least 1230, and corresponds to the Old Norse kunta, although its precise <b>etymology</b> is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|According to Pāṇini, a 6th-century BCE Sanskrit grammarian, {{the term}} yoga {{can be derived}} from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). In the context of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the root yuj samādhau (to concentrate) is {{considered}} by traditional commentators as the correct <b>etymology.</b> In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras, states that yoga means samādhi (concentration).|$|E

5|$|Bismuth metal {{has been}} known since ancient times, {{although}} it was often confused with lead and tin, which share some physical properties. The <b>etymology</b> is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic bi ismid, meaning having the properties of antimony or the German words weiße Masse or Wismuth ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century to New Latin bisemutum.|$|E

50|$|Everything that we {{know about}} the {{religious}} festivals of the pagan Anglo-Saxons comes from a book written by Bede, titled De temporum ratione ("The Reckoning of Time"), in which he described the calendar of the year.However, its purpose was not to describe the pagan sacred year, and little information within it can be corroborated from other sources. Bede provided explanations for the names of the various pre-Christian festivals that he described, however these <b>etymologies</b> are questionable; it is unknown if these <b>etymologies</b> were based on his pre-existing knowledge or whether they represented his own theories. Casting further doubt over some of his festival <b>etymologies</b> is {{the fact that some of}} the place-name <b>etymologies</b> that Bede provides in his writings are demonstrably wrong.|$|R
5|$|Brown {{formally}} {{described and}} named the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He {{did not identify}} a type specimen, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not explicitly give an <b>etymology</b> for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic <b>etymology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early {{attestations}} of {{the name}} in Basque include Errama-itçéla, Erroumancel, later errumanzel and erremaitzela. The initial E- is the Basque prosthetic vowel, added because no Basque word may begin with an R-, and the final -a is the absolutive case suffix, used when citing a name. If this <b>etymology</b> is correct, it is a rare case of a native Romani name for themselves (an endonym) being borrowed by another language.|$|E
50|$|Tolkien {{was much}} {{interested}} in words. Thus The <b>Etymologies</b> are preoccupied with them, only a few Elvish phrases are presented.

5|$|It {{was these}} {{similarities}} that lead theorists {{to conclude that}} the kulintang was originally imported to the Philippines during the migration of the kolenang through the Malay Archipelago. Based on the <b>etymology,</b> two routes have been proposed as the route for the kulintang to Mindanao: One from Sunda, through Banjermasin, Brunei and the Sulu Archipelago, a route where the word “kulintangan” is commonly used for the horizontal row of gongs; The other from Sunda, thru, Timor, Sulawesi, Moluccas and Mindanao where the word kolintang/kulintang is commonly seen.|$|E
5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} <b>etymology</b> of the various names for this plant, suggests a very different origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and which appears to describe a plant resembling the daffodil. Ellacombe provides further support for this from a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E

5|$|The {{cross is}} thought to date from the tenth century, and {{exhibits}} distinctive Hiberno-Scottish mission influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and folk <b>etymology</b> suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus, leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the apocryphal Battle of Barry. The name of the stone is likely to derive from the extinct village of Camuston, which has a Celtic toponymy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>etymology</b> of Buffalo Creek is unknown. No buffalo {{have ever}} been {{definitely}} observed on the creek, although there are rumors about old buffalo wallows. Buffalo Township, Buffalo Valley, and Buffalo Mountain are all named after the creek. Historical industries in the watershed included mills and timbering, but livestock raising and agriculture are {{more common in the}} 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>etymology</b> of Buffalo Creek's name is unknown. In the 1700s, {{it was one}} {{of eight}} streams named Buffalo Creek in Pennsylvania, despite the almost total absence of buffalo in the state in that century. Except for legends, there is {{virtually}} no evidence that any buffalo ever lived in the Buffalo Creek area.
