5|$|Each squad {{member in}} Mass Effect 2 had music {{composed}} for them, intended to convey their character; BioWare gave the composers detailed character studies for each to help. Tali's theme {{was created by}} Jimmy Hinson, who had generally made game remixes beforehand. Hinson worked {{from his home in}} Tennessee and made his pieces using FL Studio 9. Although they were given full access to the game's content, Hinson chose to avoid looking beyond what <b>he</b> <b>absolutely</b> needed to look at to write the tracks, due to wanting to experience the game fresh upon its release. In addition to Tali, Hinson also wrote tracks for Samara and Grunt, as well as various other tracks in the game.|$|E

Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{review of}} the album, wrote: [...] "Chris Martin's melodies... shine: even his loudest detractor could hardly deny his way with a tune as evidenced here by '42' and 'Lovers in Japan'." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters remarked that the song is [...] "stunning, jaw-dropping highlight". He added that [...] "Martin pounds away at a bouncy toy-piano melody... leading into a chorus where guitarist Jonny Buckland gets to unleash {{what might be the}} catchiest guitar riff he's written... (and yes, <b>he</b> <b>absolutely</b> bathes in the moment)." [...] Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle described [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] as a [...] "joyous, romantic anthem that combines wistful rock riffs and gorgeous piano". He also wrote that the song is one of [...] "the disc's best moments".|$|E
500|$|Mark Ruffalo {{began his}} role as Banner / Hulk in The Avengers, after Feige said {{he chose not to}} bring back Norton. In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers? I do believe that. I do believe <b>he</b> <b>absolutely</b> could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until Avengers 2. So there's a lot of time to think about it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Sarah {{discovered}} fiancé Craig Dean's (Guy Burnet) {{affair with}} best friend John Paul McQueen (James Sutton), in the storyline dubbed [...] "McDean". The storyline reached its climax as {{the truth is}} revealed [...] "dramatically" [...] at her engagement party. Sarah walked in on the pair kissing, A Hollyoaks spokesperson stated {{in an interview with}} Digital Spy, [...] "John Paul's sick of all the lies and decides enough is enough. He sends a text from Craig's phone asking Sarah to come upstairs to see him. Safe in the knowledge that Sarah is on her way, JP sets about seducing Craig. When she walks in, she can't believe what she's looking at..." [...] Sarah tried to recover from this and Batley said: [...] "I don't think she got over Rhys, either. Craig more so, though. <b>He</b> <b>absolutely</b> destroyed her happiness and belief in men. Her relationship with Craig was going to be her life and she put so much effort into it, emotionally and physically, and it completely destroyed her." [...] Batley said Sarah could not handle the fact he cheated on her with another man. She opined this was the reason her storyline with Zoe and Lydia worked well. However John Paul's betrayal also had impact on Sarah's life because he was one of her best friends. Batley said: [...] "John Paul was her confidante and she thought they were best friends - it's hard to say which part made more of an impact on her. It was all just one horrible experience. It was the betrayal from both of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|From {{his days}} in the Netherlands Van Gogh became {{familiar}} with Delacroix's color theory and was fascinated by color.

He said of Delacroix that he [...] "makes us feel the life of things, and the expression of movement, that <b>he</b> <b>absolutely</b> dominates his colors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back in high school, Gilbert {{never looked}} at big-time {{football}} factories such as Michigan. He {{wanted to get away}} from what he saw in Detroit. He wanted a quiet, smaller environment in which to live after one of his classmates was gunned down. So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan to go to a school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas. The Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason said, [...] "The very first play of the first drill, he goes up against a lineman and <b>he</b> <b>absolutely</b> demolished him. We just looked around at each other." ...|$|E

[...] The Union Army finally complied with Garrett’s request {{and by the end of}} July 1862 the rails of the Centreville Military Railroad were all returned to the original rightful owners, the B Railroad.|$|E

2500|$|Pat's {{interests}} in veganism, Zen Buddhism and his unusual stances on various issues {{seem to be}} driven less by {{an appreciation of the}} philosophies, but more by a desire to feel superior to his friends, and indeed the rest of the world; a [...] "magical Mexican realism" [...] camera, which shows people as they truly feel about themselves, rather than printing an actual photograph of the person, revealed that despite his aggressive veganism, Pat would prefer to eat large quantities of meat. He will often boycott companies at the slightest perceived provocation. His elitist, negative attitude extends to a particular focus on barbers and hairstylists, whom <b>he</b> <b>absolutely</b> despises, for reasons that are never made clear, as well as toll booth operators, Mexican motorists, and employees with disabilities.|$|E
2500|$|It was at {{this time}} that he became {{interested}} in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903), and Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903). Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a [...] "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation." [...] In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing. He wrote: [...] "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. <b>He</b> <b>absolutely</b> wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics." ...|$|E

Gillan stated, [...] "What I love about that relationship is that we really saw it develop {{to get to the}} stage where they were happy together. Because we started off at a point where Amy didn't want to be committed to him, and <b>he</b> <b>absolutely</b> did, and that just gave us somewhere to go with it, rather than just them being happy together. So it was interesting, and it evolved, and Rory really became a hero in the process". She was pleased that the audience was able to see Amy's life [...] "pan out", starting {{when she was a child}} and through her marriage and daughter. Gillan stated that the aftermath of [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] would [...] "change her in a big way for the long run and I think we are going to get to see Amy in a really different light". According to Moffat, by the seventh series, Amy and Rory had become [...] "a crack team"; so used to being the Doctor's companions that instead of marvelling at him they [...] "treat him like a big kid they have to look after".|$|E
