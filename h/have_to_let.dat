5|$|On Stevie's birthday, Naz {{arranges}} {{a dinner}} party for Stevie. Stevie's mother calls, asking her to carry out an errand but not mentioning her birthday. Naz sees a birthday card from when Stevie was thirteen and Stevie says {{it is the last}} card she received from her family. Naz tells her to forget her family. When Sol falls out with both Naz and Asher, Stevie tries to help resolve the problems. She and Sol go to a club where Stevie bumps into Pippa and they are more friendly. The next day, they wake up in bed together and Stevie tries to hide Pippa from her housemates. Olly bursts in saying he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the flat go as he needs his deposit, but Stevie asks for one more day. Pippa writes Stevie a cheque to cover it, says {{she is one of the}} sexiest girls she has ever met, and asks her to call her, before leaving. Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has already given notice and Stevie will have to move out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees. Stevie then invites Olly over, and he hopes to rekindle their relationship. However, she ties him naked to a chair, then humiliates him by making him walk home in a dress. She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family.|$|E

There has been much debate about this policy. Worries about TSA line length and security have arisen. Visitors still have their bags screened, and show ID at the TSA checkpoint. They also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> travelers go in front of them, if asked.|$|E

Audette is still on the line and jokes that [...] "if one voice can change the world for Obama, one Viagra can change the world for McCain." [...] One of Palin's assistants {{picks up the phone and}} says [...] "I’m sorry, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you go. Thank you." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{financial}} failure of Anarky vol. 2, the character entered {{a period of}} absence from DC publications that lasted several years. [...] Norm Breyfogle attempted to continue using the character in other comics during this time. However, when his efforts were rejected, he came to suspect the character's prolonged absence was {{due in part to}} censorship. Since the cancellation of the Anarky series, Grant has disassociated himself {{from the direction of the}} character, simply stating, [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> these things go." ...|$|E
500|$|Ayola {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to play Kyla, which expired in October 2008. It was announced on 11 October 2008 {{that she would be}} departing from the show {{in order to have a}} second child. Ayola said of her decision to leave: [...] "It's strange but sad at the same time. I've had a great time and I'll miss it.

500|$|On November 1, 2008, American vice-presidential {{candidate}} Sarah Palin {{fell victim}} to a prank call by the Masked Avengers, a Quebecer radio comedy duo, who tricked Palin into believing {{she was talking to}} French President Nicolas Sarkozy. During the conversation, the fake Sarkozy, speaking in English (the real Sarkozy does not speak English), talked to Palin about foreign policy, hunting, and the 2008 U.S. presidential election. After it was revealed to Palin that the call was a prank, she handed the phone to one of her assistants who told the comedy duo [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you go" [...] and hung up.|$|E
500|$|In early 2004, Usher {{broke up}} with Chilli due to [...] "irreconcilable {{differences}} and because they found {{it almost impossible to}} make compromises." [...] Usher said in an interview: [...] "It's unfortunate when you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a situation go because it's not working", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact {{broke up with}} Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by looking at his friends' personal situations.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Manning {{published}} The Doves of Venus, {{which drew}} on her experiences in London in the 1930s; the two friends, Ellie Parsons and Nancy Claypole, bore similarities to Manning and Stevie Smith. In the book, an isolated Ellie seeks {{to escape a}} stultifying mother. The reviews were generally favourable, but Manning was not satisfied. Perhaps annoyed at her depiction in the novel, Stevie Smith wrote what Manning described as a [...] "bitchy review"; the two great friends barely spoke thereafter, despite Smith's efforts at a rapprochement. Eventually, however, Manning grudgingly forgave her: learning of Smith's final illness, she remarked that [...] "Well, if she's really ill, we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> bygones be bygones." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{coaching}} situation had been settled, Gillis next {{turned his attention}} back to trading Luongo. The Canucks were hoping to make a deal at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. As the draft approached, it was reported the Canucks were also shopping Schneider. Originally, it was believed the rumors were an attempt by Gillis to gain leverage for any potential Luongo deals. However, in a surprise move, Schneider was trade to the New Jersey Devils for the ninth overall pick in the draft, which Vancouver used to select Bo Horvat. Fans, as well as both Luongo and Schneider, were shocked by the news. Luongo stated, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> this sink in and figure out what I'm going to do." [...] While Schneider stated he was not sure what to say or think and he was speechless, adding, [...] "it was nice to have resolution to the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} officially {{canceled}} by ABC on May 13, 2010. In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Bloc Party convened at Deltalab Studios in Copenhagen to make Silent Alarm with Paul Epworth. The {{band had}} already written demo songs to record, but Okereke {{has noted that}} [...] "it is a {{creative}} process and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> yourself be inspired while you're in the studio as well". The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included bare mains cables and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the recording time a [...] "growing process" [...] because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after tonsil problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, {{they did not know}} how songs were going to start or end. Okereke often asked Tong to play something on the drums, which inspired him to mould a track by adding guitar chords to the beat.|$|E

500|$|Perry {{also said}} that her music would be getting [...] "real fucking dark", though also stated that her fans {{would be able to}} relate to it. [...] "I imagine that maybe my next record would {{be a little bit more}} of an artistic venture," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'" [...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality. But I have to honor the music." ...|$|E
500|$|Test {{screenings}} for {{the film}} were encouraging for 20th Century Fox. Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing Edward Scissorhands {{on the scale of}} [...] "an E.T.-sized blockbuster," [...] but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it find its place. We want {{to be careful not to}} hype the movie out of the universe," [...] he reasoned. Edward Scissorhands had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. Edward Scissorhands eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film was declared to be a box office success. The New York Times wrote [...] "the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were both together in real life at the time (1989–1993), gave the film teen idol potential, drawing younger audiences." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava {{was used as the}} director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical. It's a new approach that I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> [...] explain. It's new territory." [...] During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied [...] "my feet repel them dahling." [...] When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed her feet were [...] "in agony" [...] and said [...] "My high heels had left my feet bleeding. Laugh all you want, my feet hurt." ...|$|E

500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me do this kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he would let me is because he has a great sense of humor." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
