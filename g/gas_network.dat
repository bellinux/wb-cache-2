The cut off happened as Uzbek president, Islam Karimov protested Russia's growing presence in the region. The shut-off left hundreds of thousands in south Kyrgyzstan without gas. The president of Kyrgyzstan has since promised to build a new gas pipeline to the country's south, bypassing Uzbekistan. He also announced the country would pursue integration and continue on its path to join the Eurasian Economic Union. Gazprom later announced it had struck a deal to restore gas supplies to southern Kyrgyzstan.|$|E
