5|$|Crash Boom Bang! {{features}} forty mini-games {{that can}} be played alone or remotely against friends. Balance, timing, and intelligence are required to win these mini-games. When a player is not {{taking part in a}} mini-game, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> bet Wumpa Fruit on the winner. The player can help players that have been bet on or obstruct players that have not been bet on by using the Motion Panel. If the player has a special item, the player can access the Shop screen from the Bet screen and buy or sell items.|$|E

The election, however, had taken place on 3 October 1998, on which date Hill was still a dual national.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as fast as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can.</b> According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E

5000|$|In {{each event}} there are 9 lanes and competitors. There are {{determined}} special rules about the wide of the lanes. Each lane should be 9 meters wide and a competitor can be disqualified {{if he is}} within 5 meters to another competitor because <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> then <b>can</b> get some benefit of [...] "surfing" [...] the others wash.|$|R
5|$|In the Adventure Mode, the {{characters}} {{compete in a}} race for the Super Big Power Crystal. This race {{is made up of}} six stages, each containing smaller sub-maps. The host of the race, the Viscount, sets a task for each stage. This task must be completed before the player can continue to another map. The player with the most points is the winner of the stage. The overall winner of all the stages is the winner of the Viscount's race. In the Festival Mode, the gameplay is fundamentally the same as in the Adventure Mode, {{with the exception of the}} ability to select stages to play freely. In the My Room mode, the player's character has his or her own private room in which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> either play minigames that have been collected in Adventure Mode, view a collection of items obtained in Adventure Mode, or create a Motion Panel, a unique in-game communication tool can allow customized messages to be sent mid-game to help friends or distract other players' gameplay. The decorations in My Room is different for each character.|$|E
5|$|Magical healing spells, {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E
5|$|Revelations: The Demon Slayer, Last Bible II, and Last Bible III are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} which all have similar gameplay. Players explore the game world and fight {{various types of}} monsters. During battles, players choose commands for their characters to do from a menu. Players can attack with both physical attacks and magic spells; different kinds of magic are effective against different types of monsters. Characters in players' party learn new spells {{throughout the course of}} the game. By defeating monsters, players gain experience points and money. As characters gain more experience points, players get access to points which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> add to the characters' attributes; for instance, players can add points to a character's speed attribute, which allows that character to move earlier during battles. Players can use money that they've earned through battles to buy armor, weapons, and items, in shops found throughout the game world.|$|E
5000|$|The Completer Finisher is {{a perfectionist}} and will often {{go the extra}} mile to make sure {{everything}} is [...] "just right," [...] and the things <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> delivers <b>can</b> be trusted to have been double-checked and then checked again. The Completer Finisher has a strong inward sense of the need for accuracy, and sets his or her own high standards rather than working on the encouragement of others. They may frustrate their teammates by worrying excessively about minor details and by refusing to delegate tasks that they do not trust anyone else to perform.|$|R

I know that he has shown that complete human fulfillment is altogether independent of all the things which we associate with the good life.” Source p. 61, 62.|$|R
50|$|The {{presidency}} {{is not a}} ceremonial position in the semi-presidential political system of Northern Cyprus. The President reserves the right to dismiss the Assembly of the Republic in case a government cannot be formed within sixty days or three successive governments receive votes of no confidence. <b>He</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> also <b>can</b> preside over the Council of Ministers if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> wishes to do so, approves the appointments of the judges {{and president of the}} Supreme Court and has the right to send laws approved by the Assembly of the Republic to the Supreme Court. The President has also traditionally been the chief negotiator for the resolution of the Cyprus dispute and been responsible for the foreign relations of Northern Cyprus.|$|R
5|$|The mobile {{version of}} the game, {{entitled}} Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ, shares multiple gameplay features with its browser counterpart: the main exception is that this version is tailored for a touch screen. The ability to travel freely between different Disney worlds is also replaced with a stage system. These stages, called quests, are confined to specific areas of specific worlds. Instead of spending AP on individual actions, AP is paid to start a quest, and the player can attack as many enemies, collect as many materials, and open as many chests as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> find before defeating a target Heartless. If the player's HP is fully depleted, a choice is offered between forfeiting all progress in the quest or continuing to fight by spending Jewels, a new general-purpose in-game currency. Lux is considered another name for character-leveling experience points. Clothing, hair, and accessories are obtained through Avatar Boards, which each contain an array of nodes on branching pathways. These nodes are unlocked, in set sequences, with Avatar Coins, and may also yield such benefits as increased limits for AP and HP. Cards from the browser version are here replaced by Medals, which are no longer drawn randomly in battle. Instead, each equipped Medal is presented one at a time, and the player is given the choice of attacking one enemy, attacking all enemies (dealing less damage), or using the special attack granted by the Medal (provided the Keyblade's special attack gauges are sufficiently filled). Medals can be combined with matching Medals to improve their special attacks.|$|E

50|$|The {{details of}} the {{committee}} structure and membership are {{at the discretion of}} the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is free to reorganize committees and their responsibilities however <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> wishes, and <b>can</b> appoint or dismiss members freely. The sole limitation is the requirement that Cabinet ministers must be sworn members of the Privy Council, since the Cabinet itself is a sub committee of the Privy Council.|$|R
40|$|In {{everyday}} speech, {{the word}} “professional” has an ambiguous ring, applied to one who follows, {{by way of}} profession, what is ordinarily regarded as a pastime (e. g., a sport), or disparagingly applied to one who “makes a trade” of politics and the like. In this sense it is contrasted with “amateur”, one who does something, literally, {{for the love of}} it, without remuneration. The latter is generally regarded as superior to the former; remuneration being considered as likely to irremeably invest the activity with self-interest, resulting in the task at hand being merely accomplished with the minimally sufficient expertise and skill to obtain the offered remuneration, whereas the amateur strives to do whatever task is at hand as well as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> possibly <b>can,</b> “ excellence for its own sake”...|$|R
5000|$|FTT {{has also}} been applied in the domains of {{consumer}} behavior and economics. For example, since the theory posits that people rely primarily on gist representations in making decisions, and that culture and experience can affect consumers' gist representations, factors such as cultural similarity and personal relevance {{have been used to}} explain consumers' perceptions of the risk of food-borne contamination and their intentions to reduce consumption of certain foods. In other words, one's evaluation of how [...] "at-risk" [...] <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is <b>can</b> be inﬂuenced both by speciﬁc information learned {{as well as by the}} fuzzy representations of culture experience, and perceived proximity. In practice this resulted in greater consumer concern when the threat of a food-borne-illness was described in a culturally similar location, regardless of geographical proximity or other verbatim details.|$|R
25|$|Neverpeak Mountain is {{the huge}} {{mountain}} {{that is right}} in the middle of Neverland. According to Peter Pan in Scarlet, when a child is on top of Neverpeak Mountain, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> see over anyone and anything and can see beyond belief.|$|E

25|$|If {{a person}} {{has never been a}} Muslim, and is not a kafir (infidel, unbeliever), <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> live in an Islamic state by {{accepting}} to be a dhimmi, or under a special permission called aman. As a dhimmi or under aman, he or she will suffer certain limitations of rights as a subject of an Islamic state, and will not enjoy complete legal equality with Muslims.|$|E
25|$|In Euclidean geometry, {{a figure}} can be scaled up or scaled down indefinitely, and the {{resulting}} figures are similar, i.e., {{they have the same}} angles and the same internal proportions. In elliptic geometry this is not the case. For example, in the spherical model we can see that the distance between any two points must be strictly less than half the circumference of the sphere (because antipodal points are identified). A line segment therefore cannot be scaled up indefinitely. A geometer measuring the geometrical properties of the space <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> inhabits <b>can</b> detect, via measurements, that there is a certain distance scale that is a property of the space. On scales much smaller than this one, the space is approximately flat, geometry is approximately Euclidean, and figures can be scaled up and down while remaining approximately similar.|$|R
50|$|In the novels, God {{takes three}} forms: the Lord Father, El Shaddaih; the son, Jesus, who often follows Indigo around and gives her instruction; and the Holy Earth Mother Spirit, Isis. Isis is the balancing, comforting {{force in the}} world. She {{possesses}} every living thing. The more in touch a person is with Isis, the more psychic <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is. Isis <b>can</b> take any form, but her image is a dark woman in a purple cloak. Isis entered the world through Mary when she carried Jesus, so Isis and Mary became one spirit.|$|R
5000|$|Complete Surround/All {{speakers}} {{are treated}} equally - Instead of following the traditional ways of mixing in stereo, this much more liberal approach lets the mix engineer do anything <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> wants. Instruments <b>can</b> appear to originate from anywhere, or even spin around the listener. When done appropriately and with taste, interesting sonic experiences can be achieved, {{as was the}} case with James Guthrie's 5.1 mix of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, albeit with input from the band. This is a much different mix from the 1970s quadrophonic mix.|$|R
25|$|Membership {{is usually}} gained through birth within {{the borders of}} the state and also the {{principle}} of jus sanguinis. Kemalist form of nationality is integrated to the Article 66 of the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey.

25|$|Progress {{through the}} game depends on {{fulfilling}} each operation's primary objectives; if the player fails an operation, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> attempt it again. The initial game's storyline concludes with the player flying as Luke Skywalker in his {{attack against the}} Death Star. Two expansion packs extend the story beyond the events in A New Hope, up {{to the establishment of}} the Rebel base depicted at the beginning of The Empire Strikes Back.|$|E
25|$|He {{extended}} {{the idea of}} capital to categories such as social capital, cultural capital, financial capital, and symbolic capital. For Bourdieu each individual occupies a position in a multidimensional social space; {{he or she is}} not defined only by social class membership, but by every single kind of capital <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> articulate through social relations. That capital includes the value of social networks, which Bourdieu showed could be used to produce or reproduce inequality.|$|E
5000|$|... 7 World Trade Center is {{equipped}} with Otis destination elevators. After pressing a destination floor number on a lobby keypad, passengers are grouped and directed to specific elevators that will stop at the selected floor (there are no buttons to press inside the elevators). This system is designed to reduce elevator waiting and travel times. The elevator system is integrated with the lobby turnstile and card reader system that identifies the floor on which a person works as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> enters and <b>can</b> automatically call the elevator for that floor.|$|R
40|$|Some {{environmentalists have}} argued that an {{effective}} ecological conscience may be rooted in a perspective that is either anthropocentric or sentiocentric. But, neither {{seems to have had}} any substantial effect on the ways in which our species treats nature. In looking to successfully awaken the ecological conscience, the focus should be on extending moral consideration to the land (wherein doing so includes all of the soils, waters, plants, animals, and the collectivity of which these things comprise) by means of coming to love the land. Coming to love the land involves coming to view the land’s interests as our own—and, conferring upon the land a kind of moral patient-hood. In order to perceive the land’s “subjectivity,” and so, to come to love the land, we must relearn the way to look at the land by viewing its personality through the lens of <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> who <b>can</b> already do so, i. e., the nature write...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Miranda v. Arizona {{requires}} {{that an individual}} in custody “be warned prior to any questioning” that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> {{has the right to}} remain silent, anything <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> says <b>can</b> be used against that individual in a court of law, that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has the right to the presence of an attorney, and, if the individual cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for him or her prior to any questioning if the individual so desires. An interaction between law enforcement officials and an individual generally triggers Miranda’s prophylactic warnings when the interaction becomes a “custodial interrogation. ” For Miranda to apply, the defendant must be in custody and subject to interrogation. Many scholars and circuits are currently split on what constitutes a “custodial interrogation” in border situations, when a situation is no longer routine, and at what point law enforcement personnel must give Miranda warnings. By analyzing the circuit split of the application of Miranda rights during border situations, lower courts may now have direction when deciding similar issues and, more importantly, the analysis may signal to the Supreme Court that judicial guidance needs to be developed...|$|R
25|$|Where {{decisions}} of the syariah court affect a non-Muslim, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> seek recourse in the secular courts which, in theory, overrule the syariah courts as the Syariah courts are limited in their jurisdiction by Article 121 of the Federal constitution. In 2006 a judge ruled that Article 121 limited the federal courts from ruling on matters ruled on by the Syariah court when it touches Islamic matters. This {{was seen as a}} misinterpretation of the article by some, and the case is under appeal in the court of appeals.|$|E
25|$|Cave arrows, Line arrows or Dorff markers (after Lewis Holtzendorff) are plastic {{arrowhead}} markers {{which are}} hooked onto a cave line by wrapping the line around the arrow through the slots. They {{are used to}} indicate the direction to the exit, and can be identified by feel. The message is simple, but of critical importance, as if a diver does not know {{which way to go}} at a line junction there is a risk of serious trouble. Line arrows are also used at a junction on the permanent line, and at a tie-off, so when the diver gets back to the tie-off, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> identify which way to turn.|$|E
25|$|The {{breach of}} a {{procedural}} legitimate expectation {{has been recognized}} {{as a form of}} procedural impropriety. This involves the idea that if a public authority has made a representation to an individual who will be affected by a decision that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> expect to be consulted in advance of the decision being taken but does not do so, this is unlawful. The representation giving rise to such a legitimate expectation may either be an express promise given on behalf of an authority, or the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue. These principles were accepted as part of Singapore law in Re Siah Mooi Guat.|$|E
25|$|Player {{characters}} {{can also}} get married in-game, by requesting this to a marriage NPC. A pet system is also available. Players may purchase Pet Cards from the game store and summon them in-game. Pets can help in combat or, in some cases, even be used as transportation, allowing the player to travel at a greater speed than on foot. Each pet has a fully customizable AI system, allowing the owner to give it preset actions <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> desires. Pets <b>can</b> even be played by players themselves. Like the player characters, pets also grow as they age. However, unlike player characters, pets automatically learn skills based on their level.|$|R

Touching an object [...] "intimately connected" [...] {{to a person}} (such as an object <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is holding) <b>can</b> also be battery. Furthermore, a contact may {{constitute}} a battery {{even if there is}} a delay between the defendant's act and the contact to the plaintiff's injury. For example, where a person who digs a pit with the intent that another will fall into it later, or where a person who mixes something offensive in food that he knows another will eat, has committed a battery against that other when the other does in fact fall into the pit or eats the offensive matter.|$|R
40|$|Investigating {{biology and}} {{behaviour}} {{in the context}} of evolution enables the public, scientists and medical professionals to better understand the impact of particular medical care on human physiology and emotions. Evolutionary medicine is a useful starting point because recognition of the possible mismatches between an individual’s predisposition to interact a certain way and the environment in which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is found <b>can</b> lead to practical improvements. Human parturition and postnatal care are salient examples of how culturally constructed beliefs can inhibit appropriate somatic and psychological support.
