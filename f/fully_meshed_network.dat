To minimize network traffic, we propose an algorithm for generation of communication sets that allows any two nodes to communicate by traversing at most two nodes regardless of the network size by dividing the nodes in the system into subgroups of size G where G> 1, which are then organized into quorum groups of size k_ 1 = (√(N/G) approx.) in a method {{similar to that used}} in Maekawa's algorithm except that now quorum groups are constructed out of subgroups instead of nodes. The performance analysis of the proposed partitioning algorithm shows that it significantly reduces network traffic as well as total number of communication links required for a node to communicate with other nodes in the system...|$|E

Voice, data, and facsimile are statistically multiplexed at each terminal. In order to minimize terminal costs, frequency-precorrected, and level-preadjusted continuous-wave tones are sent from the central network control station in each beam so that the terminals in each down-link beam can use these pilots as references for antenna acquisition and tracking, as reliable frequency sources, and as indicators of signal fade for up-link power control (ULPC). The potential CDMA 'near-far' problem due to up-link fades is mitigated by using ULPC.

The usage of multimedia features in a collaborative work environment is the core of BETEUS- Broadband Exchange for Trans-European USage. In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of the BETEUS communication platform. BETEUS is a european project funded by the EC which is aiming at providing a platform for the support of CSCW applications such as tele-teaching, tele-meeting or tele-seminar. The communication platform is the part of the overall BETEUS platform that provides end-to-end connectivity between BETEUS sites. The realization of the communication platform is constrained by the services available on the European ATM pilot. The development of the BETEUS application platform is independent from the actual support of the underlying communication infrastructure. Although all BETEUS user sites run FORE ATM 200 switches, this was not obvious when the design of the communication platform was started. But, at that time, it was apparent that IP connectivity was available for all partners either directly over ATM or SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Service). The communication platform can be extended so that IP multicast facilities can be used for point-to-multipoint communication as is requested by teleteaching applications. The paper discusses the services offered by the European ATM pilot. Since the BETEUS communication platform is designed to provide reliable connectivity between BETEUS user sites, sites are connected by a <b>fully</b> <b>meshed</b> <b>network</b> using ATM VPs (Virtual Path), i. e. permanent virtual channels (PVC).

40|$|Push-to-Talk (PTT) is {{a useful}} {{capability}} for rapidly deployable wireless <b>mesh</b> <b>networks</b> used by first responders. PTT allows several users to speak with each other while using a single, halfduplex, communication channel, such that only one user speaks at a time while all other users listen. Furthermore, enabling regular PSTN phone users (e. g., cell phones) to seamlessly participate in the wireless mesh PTT session is key to supporting the heterogeneous environment commonly found in such settings.

We present the architecture and protocols of SMesh, the first transparent wireless mesh system that offers seamless, fast handoff, supporting real-time applications such as interactive VoIP. The handoff and routing logic is done solely by the access points, and therefore connectivity is attainable by any 802. 11 device.

This thesis presents the architecture and protocols of the first transparent wireless mesh system that offers seamless, fast handoff, supporting VoIP and other real-time application traffic for any unmodified 802. 11 device.

We then show an inter-domain handoff protocol that transfer connectivity between access points connected to the Internet. Both handoffs, which can occur simultaneously, maintain all previously opened connections while transferring them as fast as possible without any involvement from the mobile device.

In this paper, we first briefly survey the main features of IEEE 802.11 ac, and then, we evaluate these new features in a <b>fully</b> connected wireless <b>mesh</b> <b>network</b> using an analytic model and simulations.

The comparison of the two MAC schemes is conducted through three spatial stream allocation algorithms. A simple but accurate analytical model is derived for the two MAC schemes, the results of which are validated with simulations.
