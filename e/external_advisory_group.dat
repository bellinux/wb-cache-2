40|$|In most settings, sputum is not {{routinely}} {{collected for}} microbiological diagnosis from children with lower respiratory disease. To evaluate {{whether it is}} feasible and diagnostically useful to collect sputum in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, we reviewed the literature on induced sputum procedures. Protocols for induced sputum in children were collated from published reports and experts on respiratory disease and reviewed by an <b>external</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> for recommendation in the PERCH study. The advisory group compared 6 protocols: 4 followed a nebulization technique using hypertonic saline, and 2 followed a chest or abdomen massage technique.

An <b>external</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> recommended that sputum be collected from children hospitalized with severe and very severe pneumonia who participate in the PERCH study provided no contraindications exist.

40|$|Background: Care home {{residents}} in England have variable {{access to health}} care services. There is currently no coherent policy or consensus about the best arrangements to meet these needs. The purpose of this review was to explore the evidence for how different service delivery models for care {{home residents}} support and/or improve wellbeing and health-related outcomes in older people living and dying in care homes. Methods: We conceptualised models of health care provision to care homes as complex interventions. We used a realist review approach to develop a preliminary understanding of what supported good health care provision to care homes. We completed a scoping of the literature and interviewed National Health Service and Local Authority commissioners, providers of services to care homes, representatives from the Regulator, care home managers, residents and their families. We used these data to develop theoretical propositions to be tested in the literature to explain why an intervention may be effective in some situations and not others. We searched electronic databases and related grey literature. Finally the findings were reviewed with an <b>external</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>group.</b> Results: Strategies that support and sustain relational working between care home staff and visiting health care professionals explained the observed differences in how health care interventions were accepted and embedded into care home practice. Actions that encouraged visiting health care professionals and care home staff jointly to identify, plan and implement care home appropriate protocols for care, when supported by ongoing facilitation from visiting clinicians, were important. Contextual factors such as financial incentives or sanctions, agreed protocols, clinical expertise and structured approaches to assessment and care planning could support relational working to occur, but of themselves appeared insufficient to achieve change...|$|E

Conclusion How relational working is structured between health and care home staff is key to whether health service interventions achieve health related outcomes for residents and their respective organisations. The belief that either paying clinicians to do more in care homes and/or investing in training of care home staff is sufficient for better outcomes was not supported...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} characteristics of non-mandated standing <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in all 501 school districts in Pennsylvania from the perspective of each group‘s administrator or leader. For the {{purpose of this}} study, <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in school districts mandated by federal and state laws were excluded. ^ Given this large participant population, online research instruments were used. A survey was initially emailed to all school districts superintendents. A follow up questionnaire was then sent to the contact person for the <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> if the superintendent indicated utilization. An interview was then conducted with the <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> contact persons for each school district. ^ The results of this study were organized into three main categories: reasons for creating <b>advisory</b> <b>groups,</b> outcomes of the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups,</b> and best practices of <b>advisory</b> <b>groups.</b> The data in each category were coded and three themes emerged in each category. The themes for <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> include creation for a specific goal, creation for a specific problem, or creation for a means of communication. The themes for outcomes of the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> were attainment of a goal, resolution of a problem, and dissemination of information about the district into the community. Finally, the themes for best practices of <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> included selecting suitable <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> members, setting guidelines for meetings, and promoting attendance at meetings. Participants offered advice to school districts contemplating starting an <b>advisory</b> <b>group,</b> as well as tips for success. Some of these tips were scheduling meetings at times convenient for most participants, opening the group to diverse members including those who have opposition to an issue, and establishing rules and procedures for how the group operates. ...|$|R
