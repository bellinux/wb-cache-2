5|$|In 1909 Soegija {{started at}} the Xaverius College in Muntilan, a school for {{aspiring}} teachers, and stayed in the dormitory. He was one of 54 students in his year. The boys followed a strict schedule, attending classes {{in the morning and}} engaging in other activities, such as gardening, discussions, and chess, in the afternoon. The Catholic students had regular prayers. Although the college did not require students to be Catholic, Soegija was pressured by his Catholic classmates, leading to several fights. Feeling dissatisfied, Soegija complained to his teacher that the Dutch priests were like merchants, thinking only of money. The priest replied that the teachers were unpaid and only hoped for the students' <b>good.</b> <b>This</b> led Soegija to better respect the priests, and when van Rijckevorsel told the other students that Soegija {{did not want to be}} Catholic, they stopped pressuring him.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire <b>good</b> <b>This</b> is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E
25|$|Indirect rebound effect: The {{lower cost}} of a service enables {{increased}} household consumption of other goods and services. For example, the savings from a more efficient cooling system may be put into another luxury <b>good.</b> <b>This</b> {{is caused by the}} income effect.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{societies}} {{rely heavily}} on machines powered by fuels {{for the production of}} <b>goods.</b> <b>This</b> produced further dramatic increases in efficiency. The increased efficiency of production of the industrial revolution produced an even greater surplus than before. Now the surplus was not just agricultural goods, but also manufactured <b>goods.</b> <b>This</b> larger surplus caused all of the changes discussed earlier in the domestication revolution to become even more pronounced.|$|R

25|$|Approximation theory studies how to {{find the}} best {{approximation}} to a given function by another function from some predetermined class, and how <b>good</b> <b>this</b> approximation is. This clearly yields a bound on how well the interpolant can approximate the unknown function.|$|E
25|$|Graphically, non-rivalry {{means that}} if each of several {{individuals}} has a demand curve for a public good, then the individual demand curves are summed vertically to get the aggregate demand curve for the public <b>good.</b> <b>This</b> {{is in contrast to}} the procedure for deriving the aggregate demand for a private good, where individual demands are summed horizontally.|$|E

25|$|However, {{some key}} aspects of dhimmi status were retained, {{including}} that the testimony of Christians against Muslims was not accepted in courts, which granted Muslims effective immunity for offenses conducted against Christians.

40|$|There is {{only one}} {{technique}} for prior-free optimal mechanism design that generalizes beyond the structurally benevolent setting of digital <b>goods.</b> <b>This</b> technique uses random sampling to estimate the distribution of agent values and then employs the Bayesian optimal mechanism for this estimated distribution on the remaining players. Though quite general, even for digital <b>goods,</b> <b>this</b> random sampling auction has a complicated analysis and {{is known to be}} suboptimal. To overcome these issues we generalize the consensus and profit-extraction techniques from Goldberg and Hartline [2003] to structurally rich environments that include, e. g., single-minded combinatorial auctions...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the initial}} unrest, the 1950s were {{something}} of a golden age for the nearly 40,000 remaining Italian expatriates in Italian Somaliland. With United Nations funds pouring in and experienced Italian administrators {{who had come to}} see the territory as their home, infrastructural and educational development blossomed. Relations between the Italian settlers and the Somalis were also generally <b>good.</b> <b>This</b> decade passed relatively without incident and was marked by positive growth in many sectors of local life.|$|E
25|$|A {{final step}} {{can be taken}} in {{relating}} the composite good to a unit of account such as money by setting {{the price of the}} composite good to 1. Since the prices of all other goods are known, the composite good can be converted into any combination of bundles that represent the optimal choice other than the first <b>good.</b> <b>This</b> final step clarifies the relation of the model to the real world where many goods can be stated in terms of money value. In John R. Hicks's classic Value and Capital (1939), a composite good was used to generalize mathematically from consumer demand equilibrium for an individual in the 2-good case to market equilibrium via supply and demand in the n-good case.|$|E
25|$|Alexandra {{started a}} new life in Kiev. Initially, she settled at the Mariyinsky Palace, the Emperor's {{residence}} in Kiev, in the hope that she could recover. She completely relied on religion for solace and comfort. Bound to a wheelchair, the Grand Duchess decided to stay in Kiev for <b>good.</b> <b>This</b> was convenient for her husband, who wanted to divorce her so he could marry his mistress. Alexandra vehemently refused to grant a divorce and Nicholas hoped that he could be a widower so he could remarry, as it had been the case of his brother Alexander II, who after his wife's death married his mistress. Alexandra, in spite of her poor health, outlived both her husband and her husband's mistress.|$|E

5000|$|Kant posits two {{different}} senses of [...] "the highest good." [...] On one sense, {{it refers to}} that which is always good and which is required for all other <b>goods.</b> <b>This</b> sense is equivalent to [...] "dutifulness".

25|$|One {{approach}} {{considers the}} problem {{from the perspective of}} who benefits most from the public <b>good.</b> <b>This</b> approach is sensitive to the fact that different preferences exist between different income classes. The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good, where those who use the public good must pay for it. Some people will benefit more from the public good than others, thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes. A difficulty with public goods is determining who exactly benefits from the public good, although some estimates of the distribution of {{the costs and benefits of}} global warming have been made – see above. Additionally, this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate policy should be shared.|$|E
25|$|In 1256 Innocent's {{successor}} Alexander IV called together {{various other}} hermit groups {{from around the}} world and ultimately joined them to this existing Augustinian Order. From June to July 1255 he issued 22 bulls of instruction, encouragement, and protection of the young Order. His bull Cum Quaedam Salubria summoned all the hermits of St. Augustine and St. William to send two representatives to Rome for a General Chapter, again to be held under the supervision of his nephew, Cardinal Annibaldi, and during this Chapter the following groups of hermits, inter alia, were amalgamated to the Order, which up to then had only consisted of the groups of the Tuscan hermits: the two Orders of St. William the Hermit (the Malevale and MonteFavale communities), the Brittin, and the Bonites (named after St. John the <b>Good).</b> <b>This</b> historical union has subsequently been referred to as the Grand Union of 1256. At this Chapter Lanfranc Settala, the leader of the Bonites, was elected Prior General. This 12-year-old religious Order of friars now consisted of 100 or more houses.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the ways in which cultural factors such as language, region and colonial ties affect trade in agricultural products, as compared with trade in manufactured goods. Using the augmented gravity model, we find that commonality of language, religion and a colonial relationship between trading countries enhance trade in agricultural products more significantly than trade in manufactured <b>goods.</b> <b>This</b> result implies that trade in agricultural products depends more heavily on cultural ties between the trading partners than trade in manufactured <b>goods.</b> <b>This</b> greater effect of cultural ties on agricultural trade remains, even upon analyzing differentiated agricultural products and manufactured goods...|$|R

He explores Hazlitt's accounts of Shakespeare's tragedies—Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and especially Coriolanus—where he shows that Hazlitt reveals that our love of power in sympathising with what can involve evil can overcome the human desire for the <b>good.</b> <b>This,</b> Kinnaird points out, has serious implications in considering the meaning and purpose of tragic literature in general.|$|E
