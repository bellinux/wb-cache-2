500|$|The {{silky shark}} is an {{opportunistic}} predator, feeding mainly on bony fishes from {{all levels of}} the water column, including tuna, mackerel, sardines, mullets, groupers, snappers, mackerel scads, sea chubs, sea catfish, eels, lanternfishes, <b>filefishes,</b> triggerfishes, and porcupinefishes. It may also take squid, paper nautilus, and swimming crabs, and fossil evidence indicates it scavenged on whale carcasses. Good feeding opportunities can draw silky sharks in large numbers; one such feeding aggregation in the Pacific has been documented [...] "herding" [...] a school of small fishes into a compact mass (a bait ball) and trapping it against the surface, whereupon the sharks consumed the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, silky sharks charge through the ball and slash open-mouthed, catching the prey fish at the corners of their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.|$|E

50|$|The {{dotterel}} <b>filefish</b> {{is similar}} to the orange <b>filefish,</b> although the dotterel <b>filefish</b> has a longer tail fin and no orange spots along the body. The orange <b>filefish</b> differs from other triggerfishes by having only 2 dorsal spines.|$|R

50|$|Either solitary, {{in pairs}} or small groups {{depending}} on the species, <b>filefish</b> are not terribly good swimmers; their small fins confine the fish to a sluggish gait. <b>Filefish</b> are often observed drifting head downward amongst stands of seaweed, presumably {{in an effort to}} fool both predator and prey alike. When threatened, <b>filefish</b> may retreat into crevices in the reef.|$|R
50|$|Their {{laterally}} compressed {{bodies and}} rough, sandpapery skin inspired the <b>filefish's</b> common name; {{it is said}} that dried <b>filefish</b> skin was once used to finish wooden boats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Filefish</b> spawn {{at bottom}} sites {{prepared}} and guarded by the males; {{both he and}} the female may guard the brood, or the male alone, depending on the species. The young <b>filefish</b> are pelagic; that is, they frequent open water. Sargassum provides a safe retreat for many species, both fish and weed being at the current's mercy. Juvenile <b>filefish</b> are at risk from predation by tuna and dolphinfish.|$|R
50|$|The <b>filefishes</b> of {{the genus}} Frigocanthus have 21 {{vertebrae}} and show a remarkable enlargement of scales. Furthermore they have a strong first dorsal spine with large, prominent barbs. The species Frigocanthus margaritatus can reach a length of about 310 mm.|$|E
50|$|Cantherhines dumerilii is {{a species}} of fish in the family Monacanthidae, the <b>filefishes.</b> Its common names include whitespotted filefish, barred filefish, orange-fin file, and yelloweye leatherjacket.

50|$|Ostraciidae is {{a family}} of squared, bony fish {{belonging}} to the order Tetraodontiformes, {{closely related to the}} pufferfishes and <b>filefishes.</b> Fish in the family are known variously as boxfishes, cofferfishes, cowfishes and trunkfishes. It contains about 23 extant species in 6 extant genera.|$|E
50|$|The American whitespotted <b>filefish</b> {{typically}} has a {{brown or}} olive colored body, {{although it may}} also be grey. These fish can rapidly change appearance to a high contrast color pattern with a much darker background and many light colored spots With a maximum length of around 18 inches, they are smaller than the scrawled <b>filefish</b> which is also found in their range. The American whitespotted <b>filefish</b> is often seen in pairs.|$|R
5000|$|Adult <b>filefish</b> are {{generally}} shallow water fish, inhabiting depths {{of no more}} than about 30 metres. They may be found in lagoons or associated with seaward reefs and seagrass beds; some species may also enter estuaries. Some species are closely associated with dense mats of sargassum, a particularly ubiquitous [...] "sea weed"; these <b>filefish,</b> notably the planehead <b>filefish</b> (Stephanolepis hispidus) are also coloured and patterned to match their weedy environments.|$|R
50|$|Amanses scopas, {{also known}} as the broom <b>filefish,</b> is a <b>filefish,</b> the only species in the genus Amanses of the family Monacanthidae. It is also called brush-sided leatherjacket in Australia or broom leatherjacket in Christmas Island.|$|R
50|$|Cantherhines pardalis is {{a species}} of fish in the family Monacanthidae, the <b>filefishes.</b> Common names include {{honeycomb}} filefish, honeycomb leatherjacket, and wire-netting filefish. It is native to the Indian Ocean, the eastern Atlantic, and the western Pacific, except for the seas around Hawaii, where it is replaced by Cantherhines sandwichiensis.|$|E
50|$|It has {{a number}} of predators. These include pufferfishes, parrotfishes and <b>filefishes</b> which feed on the branch tips and hermit crabs which scrape the {{skeletal}} tissue. Other predators feed on the soft tissues while leaving the skeleton intact. These include such fish as the butterflyfishes, the angelfishes and the damselfish, Stegastes acapulcoensis. Invertebrate predators include the crown-of-thorns starfish, the sea urchin, Eucidaris galapagensis, and the gastropods, Jenneria pustulata and Quoyula sp.|$|E
50|$|Various bizarre {{forms are}} {{included}} here, all radical departures from the streamlined body plan typical of most fishes. These forms range from nearly square or triangular (boxfishes), globose (pufferfishes) to laterally compressed (<b>filefishes)</b> and triggerfish. They {{range in size}} from Rudarius excelsus, measuring just 2 cm in length, to the ocean sunfish, the largest of all bony fish at up to 3 m in length and weighing over 2 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>filefish</b> (Monacanthidae) are {{a diverse}} family of {{tropical}} to subtropical tetraodontiform marine fish, {{which are also}} known as foolfish, leatherjackets or shingles.

50|$|Stephanolepis is a genus of bony fish in {{the family}} Monacanthidae, the <b>filefishes.</b> Members of this genus are unusual-shaped fish and have a very rough skin which gives them their common name. They are {{laterally}} flattened and deep bodied with long dorsal and anal fins and a fan-shaped tail. They have a mouth {{at the tip of}} the projecting snout and a long spine on the top of the head.|$|E
50|$|The tetraodontiform {{strategy}} {{seems to}} be defense {{at the expense of}} speed, with all species fortified with scales modified into strong plates or spines — or with tough, leathery skin (the <b>filefishes</b> and ocean sunfish). Another striking defensive attribute found in the pufferfishes and porcupinefishes is the ability to inflate their bodies to greatly increase their normal diameter; this is accomplished by sucking water into a diverticulum of the stomach. Many species of the Tetraodontidae, Triodontidae, and Diodontidae are further protected from predation by tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin concentrated in the animals' internal organs.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} predators feed on this coral. These include pufferfishes, parrotfishes and <b>filefishes</b> which {{feed on the}} tips of the {{branches}} and hermit crabs which scrape the skeletal tissue. Other animals feed on the soft tissues while leaving the skeleton intact including the butterflyfishes, the angelfishes and the damselfish, Stegastes acapulcoensis. Invertebrates which feed on this coral are the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), Jenner's cowry (Jenneria pustulata), the sea urchin, Eucidaris galapagensis and the coral snails, Coralliophila spp.. Both the starfish and the cowry can kill a mature coral colony by stripping off the living tissue.|$|E
