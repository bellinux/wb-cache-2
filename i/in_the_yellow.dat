5|$|Vessels from Silla, Balhae and Hizen Province of Japan {{were all}} {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea trade, which Silla dominated. After Silla and Japan reopened renewed hostilities {{in the late}} 7th century, most Japanese maritime merchants chose to set sail from Nagasaki towards {{the mouth of the}} Huai River, the Yangzi River, and even as far south as the Hangzhou Bay in order to avoid Korean ships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea. In order to sail back to Japan in 838, the Japanese embassy to China procured nine ships and sixty Korean sailors from the Korean wards of Chuzhou and Lianshui cities along the Huai River. It is also known that Chinese trade ships traveling to Japan set sail from the various ports along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the urging}} of his crewmen, Choe changed his clothes in a ritual fashion in {{preparation}} for death, although he prayed to the heavens to spare him and his crew, asking what sins they had committed to deserve this fate. On the sixth day, during fairer weather, their ship came upon a group of islands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea where Chinese pirates were moored. The pirates robbed their ship of spare goods and rations, threw away the Koreans' oars and anchor, and left them to drift aimlessly into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over a patch of mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, covered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> secretion, being digested alive.|$|E

5|$|UN bombers {{immediately}} {{targeted the}} pontoon {{bridge across the}} Han River at Seoul which was a main line of supply to the Pusan battlefield, and to destroy the repaired railroad bridge there. Several attempts in July by B-29s to destroy the rail bridge failed, but on July 29, 12 bombers succeeded in hitting the pontoon bridge and reported it as having been destroyed. The next day, 47 B-29s bombed the Chosen Nitrogen Plant at Hungnam on the northeast coast. In the meantime, carrier-based planes from the USS Valley Forge, which was operating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea, destroyed six locomotives, exploded 18 cars of a 33-car train, and damaged a combination highway and rail bridge at Haeju on July 22.|$|E
5|$|Wang Mang {{initiated}} {{a series of}} major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful.

Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying {{to the north and}} the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.|$|E

The typhoon washed a freighter ashore, killing four people and forcing the other 15crew members to be rescued. In the country, Fengshen dropped heavy rainfall that caused mudslides and left $4million (¥475million 2002JPY), in crop damage. There was an additional death in the country. After affecting Japan, Fengshen weakened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea to a tropical depression, before moving across China's Shandong Peninsula and dissipating on July28.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Tsingtao, Scharnhorst went into dock for her annual repair; Krosigk accordingly shifted his flag to Gneisenau temporarily. On 10 October, the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing Dynasty broke out, which caused {{a great deal}} of tension amongst the Europeans, who recalled the attacks on foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900–01. The rest of the East Asia Squadron was placed on alert to protect German interests and additional troops were sent to protect the German consulate. But the feared attacks on Europeans did not materialize and so the East Asia Squadron was not needed. By late November, Scharnhorst was back in service and Krosigk returned to the ship. She cruised to Shanghai by way of Tientsin and Yantai, arriving on 12 December. From 14 to 24 January 1912, Scharnhorst toured the ports of the central China coast and returned to Tsingtao on 9 March, where the rest of the squadron had assembled. On 13 April, the ships went on a month-long cruise to Japanese waters, returning to Tsingtao on 13 May. From 17 July to 4 September, Scharnhorst went on another tour of Japanese ports and during this period she also visited Vladivostok in Russia and several ports <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea.|$|E
5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a nearby table for the man to find. As Carey once again is shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen {{on the other side}} gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E

40|$|Sedimentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower {{reaches of}} <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> River {{is a major}} problem {{requiring}} implementation of large-scale control measures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper and middle drainage basin. For maximum benefit, major sediment generation areas must be delimited. For this purpose, the upper and middle drainage basin of <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> River has been divided into four major sediment and water source areas. A series of databases of runoff and sediment yields from these source areas and for the corresponding quantities of sedimentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>Yellow</b> River channel have been established. On this basis, a set of multiple-regression equations has been established that define the relationships between sedimentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>Yellow</b> River and <b>the</b> yearly or event-based runoff and sediment yields from the four source areas or subsystems. Based on the regression equations obtained, the contribution of the four major source areas to <b>the</b> sedimentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>Yellow</b> River channel can be estimated. The results obtained indicate that, given other factors, for each ton of sediment reduced from the coarse-sediment producing area (CSA), <b>the</b> sediment deposited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>Yellow</b> River would be reduced by 0. 455 ton; for each ton of sediment reduced from the fine-sediment producing area (FSA), <b>the</b> sediment deposited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>Yellow</b> River would be reduced by 0. 154 ton only. Therefore, if limited erosion control measures are applied to the coarse-sediment producing area, the benefits for sedimentation reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>Yellow</b> River will be much larger than if similar resources are applied to the fine-sediment producing area.

5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
