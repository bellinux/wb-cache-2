40|$|AbstractThe {{calculation}} {{equation of}} large diameter bored <b>pile's</b> <b>effective</b> length {{is connected with}} its distribution of pile shaft resistance. Thus, {{there is a great}} difference between the calculation results under the different distributions of pile shaft resistance. Primarily, this paper summarizes the conceptualized mode of pile shaft resistance under the circumstance that the soil surrounding the piles presents different layer distributions. Secondly, based on Mindlin's displacement solution and in consideration of the effect of pile diameter, the calculation equation is optimized with the assumption that the pile shaft resistance has a parabolic distribution. The influencing factors are analyzed according to the calculation result of <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length. Finally, combined with an engineering example, the calculation equation deduced in this paper is analyzed and verified. The result shows that both the Poisson ratio of soil and pile diameter have impacted the <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length. Compared with the Poisson ratio of soil, the effect of pile diameter is more significant. If the pile diameter remains the same, the effect of the Poisson ratio of soil to the <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length decreases as the ratio of pile elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. If the Poisson ratio of soil remains the same, the effect of the pile diameter to the <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length increases as the ratio of pile elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. Thus the optimized calculation result of <b>pile</b> <b>effective</b> length under the consideration of pile diameter effect is more close to the actual situation of engineering and reasonably practicable...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{undertakes}} {{the analysis}} of pile-cap system under the assumption of continuo piles-pile-cap connection. The piles are simulated by means of springs of varying stiffness. Nonlinearity of the piles was treated under the assumption of a hyperbolic stress-strain relationship. The pile cap was assumed as plate elements. The analysis conducted {{in this study is}} the moment distribution within the cap. Comparison was made for distribution under a constant stiffness and varying stiffness assumptions. The effect of pile cap stiffness on bending moment was demonstrated for the analysis. The distribution of bending moments along the two considered sections for cap thickness of 3 m, the piles are assumed to have linear behavior. The bending moments have the lowest value at the ends of sections. The bending moment increased when moving towards the center of cap until reaching the maximum value. For <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> of 1. 0 m to 4. 0 m, the maximum bending moment was found to be located between center line of the pile cap and edges.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{methodology}} currently followed in the offshore industry for the prediction of the pile fatigue induced by pile hammering during installation. A few decades ago piles were thicker, of lower yield stress and hammers were less efficient. Today, to be cost effective, it is common to use high strength steel resulting in lower <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> and increased driving stress together with better hammer efficiency to reduce installation time. Hence fatigue damages are more important. Evaluation of fatigue damages depend on various parameters such as applied stresses, number of blows, Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) and S-N curves. It is shown how fatigue damages are dependant on the choice of the values used for the SCF and S-N curves and also on applied stresses by the hammer, and in the end the impact of these parameters on the residual available fatigue life for the in-place conditions...|$|R

However, single piles are rarely found in practice. It is quite complicated to analyze pile groups since pile soil interaction is complex. In this study, {{two dimensional analysis}} of pile group under vertical load is carried out using finite element software ANSYS. Pile group has 16 numbers of piles and it is located in c-ø soil, parameters like diameter (0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 m), length (3, 4, 5, 6 m) and spacing of piles (2 D, 2. 5 D, 3 D, 3. 5 D, 4 D) and <b>thickness</b> of <b>pile</b> cap (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4 m) are varied to study the behavior of pile group.

Brittle deformation dominates the N 105 ° fault segment, where the volcanic pile is more than 200 m thick, {{with the development of}} a well-defined fault plane characterised by main left-lateral kinematics. The transtensive deformation of the N 105 ° fault is partitioned eastward at Rocca Campana to a main N 120 ° segment. Here, this segment crosses a culmination of the sedimentary basement close to Vena village where the deformation pattern of the thin volcanic pile, less than 100 m thick, is influenced by the more ductile behaviour of the basement generating local short structures with different orientation and kinematics in the southern block of the fault. On the northern one, short E–W trending faults show left-lateral displacements with a minor reverse component on south-dipping planes. This kinematics is related to the oblique orientation of the N 120 ° segment with respect to the seaward motion of the NE flank of Etna.

40|$|The seismic {{record of}} recent sediments of the Rhone delta in Lake Geneva (Switzerland, France) {{presents}} a discontinuity {{over a large}} area of the delta. Previous studies hypothesized that sediments inducing this discontinuity could originate from a giant rock fall (named Tauredunum) {{that occurred in the}} Lake Geneva watershed in 583 AD. To verify this hypothesis, two long cores have been retrieved from the lake sediments in the region where the sediment <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> is reduced. The sediment sequence presented three major units, with an upper, fine grained and laminated sediments (Unit A), and intermediate unit consisting of alternating coarse and fine grained sediments (Unit B), and a lower unit (Unit C) with sediment characteristics comparable to Unit (A). Unit B was interpreted as sediments inducing the seismic discontinuity. Two organic remains were sampled in Unit B and Unit A, and dated by AMS 14 C to 1390 - 1440 cal. AD and 1680 - 1780 cal. AD, respectively. The base of Unit B was dated by extrapolation to 1310 cal. AD that is more than six centuries after the Tauredunum rock fall. Moreover, the structure of the intermediate unit was interpreted as a succession of turbidite deposits and hemipelagic sedimentation. The mode of deposition of the sediments and, mainly, the AMS 14 C dating of organic remains invalidate the hypothesis of an origin of the intermediate unit in relation to the Tauredunum rock fall. Possible processes are larger inputs (as compared to present time) of detrital material during the “Little Ice Age” and a shift in the sand lobes at the end of sub-lacustrine canyons...|$|R
40|$|Calculation of {{deflections}} for piles loaded {{under both}} axial and lateral loads {{are a key}} component of <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> design. This thesis presents the solution for the problem of a pile in a multi-layered elastic soil subject to axial loads, lateral loads and moments. The multi-layered soil profile is a continuum following either linear elasticity or nonlinear elasticity. The input parameters needed are the pile geometry, soil profile and the elastic constants of the soil and pile. For nonlinear elastic soil, additional parameters are also required. For a given set of loading conditions, the displacement field at any point in the pile-soil domain can be obtained using principles of continuum mechanics and calculus of variations. An analytical solution for the pile displacements is obtained. Functions varying along the depth and radial direction describe the displacement field in the soil. Using strain-displacement and stress strain relationships, these functions are used to define the strain potential energy of the pile-soil system. Further, through calculus of variations, we get the governing differential equations along with boundary conditions involving these functions. The solution of the boundary-value problem relies on the eigenvalue method for the pile differential equations and on the finite difference method for the soil differential equations. An iterative scheme couples the soil and pile solutions, so that the solution to the problem reflects the interaction between the pile and soil. ...|$|R

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are frequently}} used in very loose and weak deposits, in particular soft marine clays deposits to support various industrial structures, power plants, petrochemical complexes, compressor stations and residential multi-storeyed buildings. Under these circumstances, piles are predominantly subjected to horizontal dynamic loads and the pile response to horizontal vibration is very critical {{due to its}} low stiffness. Though many analytical methods {{have been developed to}} estimate the horizontal vibration response, but they are not well validated with the experimental studies. This paper presents the results of horizontal vibration tests carried out on model aluminium single piles embedded in a simulated Elastic Half Space filled with clay. The influence of various soil and pile parameters such as pile length, modulus of clay, magnitude of dynamic load and frequency of excitation on the horizontal vibration response of single piles was examined. Measurement of various response quantities, such as the load transferred to the pile, pile head displacement and the strain variation along the pile length were done using a Data Acquisition System. It is found that the pile length, modulus of clay and dynamic load, significantly influences the natural frequency and peak amplitude of the soil-pile system. The maximum bending moment occurs at the fundamental frequency of the soil-pile system. The maximum bending moment of long piles is about 2 to 4 times higher than that of short piles and it increases drastically with the increase in the shear modulus of clay for both short and long piles.

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{structures}} in the marine environment is a major problem. The deterioration {{of this kind of}} structures is costly and difficult to predict both when designing new structures and when estimating the remaining service life time for existing structures. The aim of this investigation was to find indicative values for the corrosion rate of steel sheet piles on the Swedish west coast. Such corrosion rates (mm/year) can be used both when designing new structures by oversizing the steel thickness and when estimating the bearing capacity of existing sheet pile structures. Earlier investigations on the corrosion rates along the Swedish east coast – with salinity from about 0. 2 % - 0. 8 % – are still used today as guidelines for the corrosion rate of all steel {{structures in the}} Swedish maritime environment even though the salinity on the west coast can be as high as 3. 0 %. Steel sheet pile wharfs located in the port of Halmstad on the Swedish west coast were inspected by ultrasonic measurements. Three wharf structures with a total length of about 700 m were inspected. None of the inspected wharfs had or have had cathodic protection. The thickness measurements of the steel sheet pile structures were performed by divers. The age of the three inspected sheet pile structures ranged from 36 to 51 years. The dimensions of the original sheet pile sections are known. One of the quay structures is located along a river. The salinity at all wharfs varied from low values at the surface to approx. 2 % at the bottom (also in the river outflow). The measured average corrosion rates were in the same order as the design values in the European code. However, the results indicate increased corrosion rates about one meter below the mean water surface and {{at the level of the}} propellers from the ships berthing the most frequented of the inspected wharfs, 3 to 6 meters below water surface. The tolerances of steel sheet thicknesses – usually in the order of ± 6 % – are often neglected when investigating the remaining thickness in steel sheet piles. A simple calculation model shows that the sheet pile must be almost 50 years of age before an accurate estimation on the corrosion rate can be made, considering the tolerances, if the true original sheet <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> is not known...|$|R

The inputs used in {{the run of the}} LLP 99 model were: • single soil layer, • very high flexural stiffness of pile (1, 000, 000 kN/m 2). • pile width = 0. 3 m (i. e. wooden pile), • shear strength in the absence of lateral stress (for unconsolidated sand 150 kN/m 2 was used), • effective unit weight of soil (15 kN/m 3), • active lateral effective stress coefficient (used 0. 426 based on coefficient of earth pressure at rest for sand with = 35 °), • neutral lateral effective shear stress coefficient (used default – 1), • passive lateral effective stress coefficient (= 1 / active lateral stress coefficient = 2. 35), and • stroke displacement between active and passive stress (used default 0. 02 m). Loading steps of 1 kN were applied at 1 m above the pile interception with the pre-scour bed level. The moment for each loading step is based on a maximum scour hole depth of 3. 5 m, hence the moment arm is 4. 5 m (i. e. moment = 4. 5 kNm for each loading step). The depth of pile was varied in order to determine an <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> depth for securing LWD. The pile deflection was limited for all pile depths considered (Table 7). For piles constructed 1 m below the maximum scour depth, the piles should not deflect more than 1 cm under the bankfull flow. In practice we would recommend that piles be driven an extra metre to account for any underestimation in maximum scour depth. The recommended pile depth is, therefore, the maximum depth of scour (3. 5 m) plus 2 m, or 5. 5 m from the pre-scour bed level for securing in-stream wood. Table 7.

The present study was performed to improve the knowledge resulting from all the previous magnetotelluric (MT) studies focused particularly on characterizing the western border of the Rio de la Plata Craton. MT data were acquired along an approximately NW-SE 750 km profile at about 24 ºS, from the Sub Andean Ranges in the province of Salta (NW) to the boundary Formosa Province frontier (SE) next to Paraguay River. Distortion and structure dimensionality analysis indicates that MT responses are two-dimensional with a NS strike orientation, consistent with the regional geological strike. A 2 D inversion of the data provided a model showing a sharp lateral discontinuity, possibly associated with cratonic structures. The high resistivity (> 5000 ohm-m) observed, from about the middle of the profile toward its eastern end, may be interpreted as the terranes accreted to the Río de la Plata Craton during Neoproterozoic to Cambrian times, or even as the Río de la Plata Craton itself.

40|$|A {{field test}} has been {{undertaken}} to investigate changes to in situ Mercia Mudstone at the pile soil interface after installation of four 5. 5 m long 350 mm diameter CFA piles. The test investigated whether a remoulded zone exists, {{the extent of}} the zone, changes caused by remoulding and the effect of the installation method. The piles and surrounding soil were excavated after installation to a depth of just under 2 m. The sections of pile and surrounding soil were returned to the laboratory where a variety of detailed observations at both micro and macroscopic scales were undertaken, together with chemical and mineralogical analysis. It was found that a remoulded zone existed in all piles but that this varied in thickness both laterally and vertically around a pile. Across all <b>piles</b> the maximum <b>thickness</b> observed was 55 mm. The average thickness, fabric and texture were all affected by installation method. A distinctive vertically orientated fabric was observed in which up to four vertically orientated layers could be distinguished. There was evidence of changes in texture/fabric, structure, colour, mineralogy and chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{theoretical}} {{analysis and}} experimental result, the principle {{as well as}} the interaction between pile and soil, the design parameters of composite foundation with cement-fly ash-gravel piles (CFG piles for short) are optimized, which are pile length, pile diameter, pile spacing, <b>pile</b> strength and <b>thickness</b> of cushion layer, in order to put forward the reasonable design parameters for reaching economic and reasonable target. Through the optimized analysis, it is put forward that bearing stratum of pile tip should select a relatively better soil layer, the diameter of CFG pile is usually appropriately to select between 350 mm and 500 mm, it is usually appropriately to select larger pile spacing under the permissible range between 3 d and 5 d being ruled by standard, it is appropriately to enlarge the pile diameter to reduce the requirement of pile strength in high rise and super high rise building which requiring bearing capacity of single pile is high, and the thickness of cushion layer is appropriately to select between 0. 4 and 0. 6 times of the pile diameter...|$|R
40|$|Liquefaction {{is one of}} {{the leading}} seismic actions to cause {{extensive}} damage to buildings and infrastructure during earthquakes. In many historic cases, plastic hinge formations in piles were observed at inexplicable locations. This project investigates the behaviour of piled foundations within soils susceptible to liquefaction using numerical analysis carried out in Abaqus in terms of plastic hinge development. Three different soil profiles were considered in this project by varying the thickness of both the liquefiable and non-liquefiable layers, pile length, free and fixed head pile conditions. Modelling a single pile as a beam-column element carrying both axial and El-Centro record earthquake loading produced results of the seismic behaviour of piles that could be assessed by Force-Based Seismic Design (FBSD) approaches. The displacements and deformations induced by dynamic loads were analysed for piles affected by liquefaction and the results used to demonstrate the pile capacity and discuss the damage patterns and location of plastic hinges. Parametric studies generally demonstrate that plastic hinge formation occurs at the boundaries of the liquefiable and non-liquefiable layers; however, the location can be affected by a variety of factors such as material properties, <b>pile</b> length and <b>thickness</b> of liquefying soil layer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT 3 -D Modeling of Piled Raft Foundation Anup Sinha, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2013 Piled-raft-foundation {{is a new}} concept, {{which has}} {{received}} increasing recognition in recent years. Current design practice is based on conventional group pile or block failure theory, that ignore the bearing contribution from the raft. Moreover, the pile group theory is incapable of predicting the differential settlement of the raft, which is beyond the capability of any available analytical method in the literature. The objective of this thesis is to develop analytical models capable to predict the settlement of each individual pile in the group under the raft. Accordingly, the differential settlement within the pile raft can be estimated. In this investigation, three independent models will be developed to perform as follows; first, the load sharing model that estimates the load components of the raft and the pile group in the system, the second model is to estimate the maximum settlement {{of the top of}} the raft and the third model is to estimate the differential settlement among the pile-raft-foundation. To develop these analytical models, the three dimensional numerical models developed in ABAQUS platform, was extensively used. The extent of stress influence zone, sensitivity analysis of the governing parameters, time increment of the analysis step were performed in advance. The modified Drucker – Pager cap plasticity was used to model the soil continuum. The influence of pile cross-sectional shape (square, octagonal and circular) on soil bearing behavior was examined to check the suitability of using the 8 -noded hexahedron 3 D brick element. Parametric studies were performed to observe the influence of raft and pile geometry (e. g length, size, spacing of <b>pile</b> and <b>thickness</b> of raft) on the foundation bearing behavior. The raft bearing contribution and its top deflection pattern under various loading and pile-raft configuration were also investigated. The multiple regression analysis technique, using statistical software MINITAB, along with the theory of solid mechanics was used to develop the analytical models for load sharing, maximum and differential settlement. Design theories and recommendation for future work are presented. ...|$|R
