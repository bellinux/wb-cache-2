40|$|A high {{resolution}} electron spectrometer {{has been used}} to demonstrate experimentally that both thermal (T varying from ~ 300 - 700 K) and photo (λ ~ 350 nm) stimulation can enhance the field-induced <b>hot-electron</b> <b>emission</b> from a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) microstructure. A detailed analysis of electron energy spectra has provided relationships between temperature and such emission parameters as current, spectral half-width and spectral shift. These studies have also provided valuable information about electron transport in the MIM structure and the electron energy distribution in the metal-insulator interface in immediate proximity to the vacuum...|$|E
40|$|A high {{resolution}} UHV electron spectrometer, incorporating a recently developed energy-selective mapping capability, {{has been used}} to analyse the emission images of localized sites on the surface of copper electrodes. The present paper outlines the operational principale of this new technique and reports on the spatially-resolved, electron energy spectral data recently obtained with it. These findings are shown to broadly confirm the existence of a field-induced <b>hot-electron</b> <b>emission</b> mechanism FIHEE that originates at MIM (metal-insulator-metal) surface microstructures and is responsible for the prebreakdown currents that flow between vacuum-insulated high-voltage electrodes in the field range 6 - 30 MV/m...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} lacomit {{dielectric}} films on the emission properties of microemitters has been studied. It is observed that such films enhance field electron emission from metal-insulator-vacuum (M-I-V) microstructures. It is {{found that this}} cathode switches-on at low applied fields and acquires a subsequent reversible I-V characteristics and reasonably stable emission currents. Energy distribution measurements performed with a retarding potential energy analyser and with a high resolution electrostatic deflection electron energy analyser show that the distribution is broadened and shifted significantly to lower energy. These characteristics have been qualitatively {{explained in terms of}} a <b>hot-electron</b> <b>emission</b> mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of field {{emission}} electron source has been developed. In this paper, the construction, characteristics and behaviour of tungsten micropoint emitters coated with a sub-micron layer of hydrocarbon using a TEM with poor (~ 10 - 3 torr) vacuum conditions are described. The hydrocarbon coating has been verified using the X-Ray energy dispersive analysis technique of a SEM. The technical capabilities and potential of the {{new type of}} electron source are {{compared with those of}} other comparable composite micropoint field emitters and other types of electron sources currently in use. The emission properties presented here include I-V characteristics, emission images and electron energy spectra of this type of composite micropoint emitters. The effect on the behaviour and characteristics of baking the coated emitters at temperatures ranging between 140 ° C and 350 ° C is also studied. The behaviour of the emitter has been interpreted in terms of a field-induced <b>hot-electron</b> <b>emission</b> mehism associated with metal-insulsator-vacuum (M-I-V) regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the measurements obtained from the of field emission of electrons from composite metal-insulator (M-I) micropoint cathodes, using {{the combination of a}} high resolution electron spectrometer and a field emission microscope, has been presented. Results obtained describe the reversible current-voltage characteristic, emission images and electron energy distribution measurements of both thin and the optimum thick coatings. The observed effects, e. g. the threshold switch-on phenomena and the field-dependence of the F. W. H. M. and energy shift of the electron spectra have been identified in terms of a field-induced <b>hot-electron</b> <b>emission</b> (FIHEE) mechanism resulting from field penetration in the insulating film where conducting channels are formed. The theoretical implications accounts for the channels field intensification mechanism and the conduction properties with applied field, and the F. W. H. M. dependence on electron temperature. The control of the emission process at low fields by the M-I contact junction and at high fields by the bulk properties of the insulator have also been accounted for. These experimental and theoretical findings {{have been shown to be}} consistent with recently published data on M-I microstructures on broad-area (BA) high-voltage electrodes...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the X-ray {{variability}} patterns and correlations of the radio and X-ray fluxes in all spectral states of Cyg X- 1 using X-ray data from RXTE/ASM, CGRO/BATSE, and Swift/BAT. In the hard state, the dominant spectral variability is a changing of normalisation with fixed spectral shape, while in the intermediate state the slope changes, with a pivot point around 10 keV. In the soft state, the low energy X-ray emission dominates the bolometric flux which is only loosely correlated with the high energy emission. In black hole binaries in the hard state, the radio flux is generally found to depend on a power of the X-ray flux, F_R ~ F_X^p. We confirm this for Cyg X- 1. Our new finding is that this correlation extends to the intermediate and soft states provided the broad-band X-ray flux in the Comptonization part of the spectrum (excluding the blackbody component) is considered instead of a narrow-band medium-energy X-ray flux. We find an index p= 1. 7 +- 0. 1 for 15 GHz radio emission, decreasing to p= 1. 5 +- 0. at 2. 25 GHz. We conclude that the higher value at 15 GHz {{is due to the}} effect of free-free absorption in the wind from the companion. The intrinsic correlation index remains uncertain. However, based on a theoretical model of the wind in Cyg X- 1, it appears to be close to 1. 3, which, in the framework of accretion/jet models, implies that the accretion flow in Cyg X- 1 is radiatively efficient. The correlation with the flux due to Comptonization emission indicates that the radio jet is launched by the hot electrons in the accretion flow in all spectral states of Cyg X- 1. On the other hand, we rule out the X-ray jet model. Finally, we find that the index of the correlation, when measured using the X-ray flux in a narrow energy band, strongly depends on the band chosen and is, in general, different from that for either the bolometric flux or the flux in the <b>hot-electron</b> <b>emission.</b> Comment: MNRAS, in press, 16 page...|$|E
