40|$|This study applies Jungian {{psychological}} type {{theory to}} assess and to interpret the expectations of cathedral visitors. The Visitor Expectations Type Scales were developed among 35 individuals trained and qualified as type practitioners and then tested among a sample of 157 visitors who also completed the Francis Psychological Type Scales. The data demonstrated: the coherence and internal consistency reliability of the Visitor Expectations Type Scales; the particular <b>emphases</b> <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> cathedral visitors on introverted expectations, feeling expectations, and perceiving expectations; and the complex relationship between visitor expectations (conceptualised in psychological type categories) and their personal psychological type profile. The Visitor Expectations Type Scales are commended as providing a more valid assessment of the psychographic segmentation of cathedral visitors than could be provided simply by the administration of a recognised measure of psychological type. Such assessment has implications for the marketing and management of cathedrals within the tourism industry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a basis for}} a tentative framework for guiding future research into principals' identity construction and development. It is situated {{in the context of}} persisting <b>emphases</b> <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> government policies on the need for technocratic competencies in principals as a means of demonstrating success defined largely as compliance with demands for the improvement in student test scores. Often this emphasis is at the expense of forwarding a broader view of the need, alongside these, for clear educational values, beliefs and practices that are associated with these. The framework is informed by the theoretical work of Wenger and Bourdieu as well as recent empirical research on the part played by professional identity and emotions in school leadership. In the paper we highlight different lines of inquiry and the issues they raise for researchers. We argue that the constructions of school leadership identities are located in time, space and place, and emotions reflect complex leadership identities situated within social hierarchies which are part of wider structures and social relations of power and control...|$|R

50|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} in Germany, {{dating back to the}} medieval era, of highlighting the importance of gospel readings through polyphonic musical settings of gospel texts. They became an increasingly popular genre from the 16th century onwards and were intended for use in Lutheran church services. They could thus be written in either Latin or German.

Upon publication of Was bleibt, West German critics such as Frank Schirrmacher argued that Wolf failed to criticize the authoritarianism of the East German Communist regime, whilst others called her works [...] "moralistic". Defenders have recognized Wolf's role in establishing a distinctly East German literary voice. Fausto Cercignani's study of Wolf's earlier novels and essays on her later works have helped promote awareness of her narrative gifts, irrespective of her political and personal ups and downs.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the dilemma facing the art teacher {{as a liberal}} educator. The author first reviews the evolu-tion of liberal education from ancient times, through the Renaissance to modern times and discusses, through an extensive bibliography, ancient and modern theories which have impacted {{on the concept of}} “liberalism, ” ex-amining notions such as tolerance, individualism and autonomy which constitute the pillars of liberalism. The author {{discusses the}} contributions of philosophers and sociologists such as Thomas Hobbes, John Stuart Mill, Isaiah Berlin, and Will Kymlicka and then examines the two main approaches to liberalism: philosophical liber-alism and political liberalism. The different <b>emphases</b> <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> these two approaches, on the individual and the group respectively, form the basis of the dilemma which faces the art teacher as a liberal educator. In order to understand the dilemma, the author draws a parallel between the two approaches {{and the role of the}} traditional art studio master and art educator. The goals of the studio master, who is devoted to the development of the in-dividual, accord with philosophical liberalism, while those of the art educator, who is obliged to adhere to the demands of a school system, accord with political liberalism, which stresses equality for all. The ideal, says the author, resides in an amalgam of the two approaches and is symbolized in the term “artist-teacher ” but she asks whether it is possible to truly merge the two approaches, at the same level, in the teaching process...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{reflection}} upon a central tension within discourse analysis. On the one hand, {{the use of the}} word discourse signals a desire to understand social interaction as it emerges for the people engaged in that interaction, yet on the other hand, the word analysis signals that language use will be studied in terms that are external to the sense-making of its participants. The discussion focuses in particular on critical discourse analysts, motivated by emancipatory goals, for it is for them that the tension is most acute. The paper proposes that greater theoretical <b>emphasis</b> be <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> critical discourse scholars on the analyst’s interpretative labour. In particular, it argues that a more hermeneutic discourse analysis can begin to turn this central problem into a strength...|$|R

50|$|The parasite-stress theory, {{otherwise}} known as pathogen stress, is where a parasite or disease stresses the development of organisms, leading {{to a change in}} their mate preference and choice. In societies with a high prevalence of parasites or pathogens greater <b>emphasis</b> is <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> the members of that society, on the physical attractiveness/good looks of their mates or potential mates, compared to members of societies with a lower prevalence of parasites or diseases who put less emphasis on physical attractiveness. It indicates that physical attractiveness is a way in which humans can determine resistance to parasites, as it's believed that parasites and diseases would worsen the look of those who are suffering or have suffered from a disease, and would also limit the number of high-quality pathogen-resistant mates.|$|R
40|$|Learning {{styles of}} {{marketing}} students {{have changed over}} the years. Changes have also occurred in <b>emphases</b> <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, uni-versities, schools, and departments on meeting student learn-ing needs. This study measures the pedagogical preferences of marketing seniors and alumni and relates them to a global attitude toward the marketing major. This approach {{may be used in}} any marketing program as a potential attitudinal enhancement mechanism, since key pedagogies can be identi-fied. In turn, the motivation and learning potential of pedagogies can be evaluated. Results indicate an association between in-class activities and overall attitude toward the marketing major. Higher education is now being held accountable in ways that were all but unseen in the past. Assessment is now a bell-wether term, and accrediting agencies are increasingly turn-ing to quality enhancement and continuous improvement. Within business education, the American Assembly of Colle-giate Schools of Business (1994) has adopted new standards that are process and outcomes based and centered on a busi-ness school’s mission. Within this rubric, marketing pro-grams have also developed mission statements and accompa-nying goals and objectives. Whether these goals and objectives are actualized is a function of both inputs (e. g., pedagogy) and outcome assessments. For many business schools and marketing programs, goals and objectives are being developed that recognize student-centered learning and its enhancement through the creation of positive learning environments. To help actualize these goals, business educa-tion in many institutions, most notably the California State University system, is beginning to formally consider Chickering and Gamson’s (1987) seven principles of teach-ing and learning. One of these principles is that good teaching practice respects diverse ways of learning. Following this lin...|$|R

40|$|Although over $ 600 {{million is}} spent on {{advertising}} each year by Australian gambling industries, minimal {{research has been conducted}} into the advertising of gambling products and services, either in Australia or overseas (Griffiths, 2003). In the absence of conclusive research to underpin policy, governments and gambling industries in Australia have taken a variety of approaches monitoring advertising of gambling. Restrictions vary both by jurisdiction and by gambling sector. In Queensland, the advertising of gambling is guided by the voluntary QLD Responsible Gambling Code of Practice. Advertising and promotions are identified in the Code as one ‘Priority Action Area’ where gambling providers can ‘promote responsible practices’ and encourage ‘informed decision making by consumers’ (Queensland Treasury, 2002). This paper reports on an investigation into newspaper advertising of gambling in Queensland. It used content analysis to compare eight newspapers from four regions in the state to identify and compare key characteristics of newspaper advertisements of gambling products and venues, both before (2001) and after (2003) the introduction of the Code. This paper found that there was a significant {{decrease in the number of}} advertisements published in 2003 compared to 2001; that there was a decrease in the <b>emphasis</b> <b>placed</b> on gambling <b>by</b> clubs, hotels and casinos, but an increased <b>emphasis</b> <b>placed</b> on gambling <b>by</b> bingo and lottery operators between 2001 and 2003.
