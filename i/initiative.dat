Of the remaining 629 <b>initiatives</b> for which we did not receive survey responses, 481 were JIEDDO <b>initiatives.</b> JIEDDO officials attribute their low survey returns for reasons including that C-IED <b>initiatives</b> are currently not fully identified, catalogued, and retrievable; however, they expect updates to their information technology system will correct this deficiency. Our survey also identified 45 different organizations that DOD is funding to undertake these 1, 340 identified <b>initiatives.</b> Some of these organizations receive JIEDDO funding while others receive other DOD funding. We documented $ 4. 8 billion of DOD funds expended in fiscal year 2011 in support of C-IED <b>initiatives,</b> but this amount is understated because we did not receive survey data confirming DOD funding for all <b>initiatives.</b> As an example, at least 94 of the 711 responses did not include funding amounts for associated C-IED <b>initiatives.</b> Further, the DOD agency with the greatest number of C-IED <b>initiatives</b> identifiedJIEDDOdid not return surveys for 81 percent of its <b>initiatives.</b> ...|$|R
