500|$|Critics {{have also}} commented on {{other aspects of}} the episode. In 2016, Caroline Bologna from The Huffington Post praised the episode for showing [...] "a joyful {{depiction}} of breastfeeding" [...] and for normalizing it to a wider audience. Bologna contrasted the scene with the lack of images of breastfeeding in contemporary children's television, writing that the show had a [...] "positive legacy" [...] and proved that [...] "this topic was deemed perfectly suitable for a children's show 20 years ago". Priscilla Blossom of the motherhood website Romper.com also praised the scene as addressing reproductive health, along with the portrayal of Tommy's premature birth and time in a neonatal intensive care unit. In their essay [...] "What <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mother?</b> Gay and Lesbian Perspectives on Parenting", scholars Jack Drescher, Deborah F. Glazer, Lee Crespi, and David Schwartz analyzed [...] "Mother's Day" [...] as an extension of psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott's theories on early childhood.

Tracy realizes he needs to be with Angie, but changes his mind and goes to a strip club. After returning home and in order to stay there, Tracy decides to wear his dog's shock collar on himself. Tracy then sends Kenneth to take his place at Liz's party. Unbeknownst to Kenneth, Tracy's dog has followed him to the bachelorette party. Kenneth bursts in Liz's home with Tracy's dog right behind him, resulting in the staff hiding from the dog after it attacks them.

500|$|A {{major theme}} in Traveling Shoes, one that many critics overlook, is Angelou's {{love for her}} son. [...] The theme of {{motherhood}} is one of Angelou's most consistent themes throughout her series of autobiographies, although it does not overwhelm this book {{as it does in}} Gather Together in My Name and Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. [...] Motherhood is present in many of the book's subthemes—her relationship with her houseboy Kojo, her delight in being called [...] "Auntie" [...] by many African children, and her feelings toward [...] "Mother Africa". [...] Traveling Shoes begins with Guy's accident, his long recovery, and his mother's reaction to it, thus universalizing the fear of every parent—the death of a child. [...] The main character <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> of a grown son, so liberation from the daily responsibilities of motherhood is emphasized, but it is complicated by the recognition that part of motherhood is letting go, something Angelou struggles with. [...] Confrontations between Angelou and Guy are minimal, consisting of their conflict over his choice of dating a much-older woman and of his demands for autonomy after she returns from the Genet tour. [...] Angelou seems to vacillate between wanting to supervise him and wanting to let go throughout this book. [...] In this way, as Lupton says, the motherhood theme, like the identity theme, is [...] "dual in nature".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} {{motherhood}} is also explored in the episode. According to Elyce Rae Helford, {{in her book}} Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television, Mrs. Peacock functions as a being who has been reduced [...] "to all female functions" [...] by her sons. [...] She is [...] "the grotesquely willing mother who has lost any sense of individual purpose" [...] other than {{to do anything for}} her children. Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club writes that [...] "Scully’s sympathy for a mother that she imagines to be persecuted is turned violently on its head, to reveal a monster whose priorities are not quite so straightforward." [...] The episode {{is also one of the}} first to explore Scully's desire to become a mother. Booker states that the episode presents the dual nature of Scully's [...] "modern desire for motherhood", as opposed to Mrs. Peacock's [...] "perverted notion of family". Helford writes that the entry predicts [...] "Scully's fate as the mother of 'immaculately' (technologically) conceived and monstrous progeny". In the fifth season, Scully indeed learns that she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother,</b> albeit accidentally, after her ova was harvested following her abduction in second season, and an alien/human hybrid named Emily is the result. With the revelation that Scully is pregnant at the end of the seventh season finale, [...] "Requiem", the concept revolving around Scully as a mother took center stage in seasons eight and nine with the birth of baby William.|$|E

500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill.
