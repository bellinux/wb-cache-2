5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair),</b> while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E
500|$|In the bus, Alekry's {{shirt was}} pulled {{over his head}} and, {{while he was still}} hand-cuffed, {{security}} officers continued kicking and beating him for about an hour, until he fell to the floor. Nevertheless, the beating continued and Alekry reported that a police officer told him: [...] "If you bleed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> with your dirty blood I will beat you to death!" [...] When an ambulance arrived, police allowed him and three other detainees to be taken to hospital. He arrived at the SMC at 6:00am, with severe injuries to his back, chest and face and underwent facial surgery a few days later.|$|E
60|$|I turned round <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> and {{regarded}} Mabane reproachfully.|$|E
60|$|I {{stood on}} one foot, as it were, as I sat <b>in</b> <b>my</b> rickety <b>chair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must think}} it over," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr. Letts, {{with a wave}} of his hand. [...] "Betty is only nineteen, and, as head of the family, I don't think she can marry without my consent. I'm not sure, but I don't think so. Anyway, if she does, I won't have her husband here sitting <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chairs,</b> eating off <b>my</b> tables, sleeping <b>in</b> <b>my</b> beds, wearing out my stair-rods, helping himself----" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{closed the}} door. Lady Angela was {{lounging}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> easy <b>chair</b> {{with a slight}} smile upon her lips.|$|R
60|$|I saw {{the look}} in her face, and my heart ached for her. I leaned forward <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> with my mind at ease {{for the first}} time since the receipt of my son's letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I'll lay a {{thousand}} it was!' I shouted, rising <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> And the company stared, and Lady Pembroke vowed I had gone mad.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} forgotten, then," [...] she said softly. [...] "Come and sit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{favourite}} <b>chair</b> and {{rest for a}} few moments. I am sure that you must be tired." ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped <b>in</b> {{front of}} <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> and stood {{looking down at}} me with an {{expression}} in which I read a contemptuous amazement.|$|R
60|$|I was in {{a dilemma}} from which {{there seemed to be}} no escape. Lady Angela had seated herself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> easy <b>chair</b> and was keeping her face averted from me. The Duke stood between us.|$|R
6000|$|... 'While we {{were getting}} it back again the parrot, which was in its cage, let out a squawk. Honest, I jumped a foot <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "What, {{you have}} got up!" [...] she said. [...] "You are better, then. You may sit you down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> on the hearthstone, if you will." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{lay back}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> {{and stared at}} him. Was this, then, another suitor of Yvonne de Canaples, and were all men mad with love of her? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> non-rotary {{revolving}} <b>chair</b> and nodded gently, like a mandarin, at my paste-pot.|$|R
6000|$|She {{comes from}} the past and revisits my room, [...] She looks as she then did all beauty and bloom; [...] So smiling and tender, so fresh and so fair, [...] And yonder she sits <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cane-bottomed <b>chair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|When {{the candles}} burn low, and the company's gone, [...] In {{the silence of}} night as I sit here alone-- [...] I sit here alone, but we yet are a pair-- [...] My Fanny I see <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cane-bottom'd <b>chair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I sat up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> The {{appearance}} of his twin-brother {{in the story}} was a complication in itself. Two criminals escaped from the Assizes, instead of one! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak of the Devil," [...] whispered La Fosse in my ear, and, {{moved by}} the words and by the {{significance}} of his glance, I turned <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{waited for}} a little while. I sighed and leant back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "It is {{perfectly}} simple," [...] I smiled, [...] "now that we have cool heads." ...|$|E
6000|$|I ran home, {{clutching}} the ten delicious, crisp hundred pounds, and the dear little fifty which {{made up the}} account. I flew through the streets again. I got to my chambers. I bolted the outer doors. I sank back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> great <b>chair,</b> and slept. [...] .|$|R
6000|$|It was but {{a moment}} she sat in this place, [...] She'd a scarf on her neck, and {{a smile on her}} face! [...] A smile on her face, and a rose in her hair, [...] And she sat there, and bloom'd <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cane-bottom'd <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|On Monday I rose early, {{and went}} out for a bit of air before the scene with Mr. Dix. Returning, I saw a coach with his Lordship's arms on the panels, and there was Comyn himself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> great <b>chair</b> at the window, where he had been {{deposited}} by Banks and his footman. I stared as on one risen from the dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed, I won't," [...] {{repeated}} Mrs Denman; [...] "how can I? Just {{think of}} the situation. Sitting <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> in dishabille, when a man--a Man, Miss Dee--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, turning uneasily <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> {{and at last}} {{hitting on}} a bright {{masculine}} expedient, [...] "I'll tell you what must be done. She must get married." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was leaning}} back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair,</b> with a {{satisfied}} soul, and nibbling at some raisins, while I slowly drank my coffee, when the outer door opened, and Uncle Chipperton entered.|$|E
6000|$|He hung {{about the}} house, not caring to do much, except taking me out <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Bath <b>chair</b> or languidly reading the most {{exciting}} books he could get;--but there was no great stock of sensation then, except the Byronic, {{and from time to}} time one of my parents would exclaim, 'Clarence, I wonder you can find nothing more profitable to occupy yourself with than trash like that!' ...|$|R
60|$|I walked homewards {{across the}} park. The {{carriage}} {{had gone from}} the private road, and Ray was alone when I entered. It {{was impossible to tell}} what had happened from his expression. He sat stretched out <b>in</b> <b>my</b> easy <b>chair,</b> smoking furiously, and his face was impassive. Grooton served us with dinner, and he ate and drank with only a few curt remarks. But afterwards, when I was deep <b>in</b> <b>my</b> work, he suddenly addressed me.|$|R
60|$|He sat <b>in</b> <b>my</b> deck <b>chair,</b> a cigar half {{consumed}} in his white, dexterous-looking fingers. The {{light of the}} swinging lamp fell on his white hair; he stared through the little window out at the starlight. I sat {{as far away from}} him as possible, the table between us and the revolvers to hand. Montgomery was not present. I did not care to be with the two of them in such a little room.|$|R
60|$|Great Scott! But {{here the}} girl turned and stomped {{off and the}} matter ended. I lay back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> gasping with horror. My wife and family {{regarded}} me in wonder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most preposterous!" [...] I exclaimed, {{and then}} {{suddenly}} realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> {{and stared at him}} in blank amazement.|$|E
60|$|When, then, I had {{finished}} my supper, I drew <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chair</b> {{a little closer}} to Mr. Reverie's and, having scribbled my wants on the Landlady's slate, turned my attention to the talk.|$|E
60|$|Pursuing my idea as I {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> wooden <b>chair,</b> {{and looked at}} Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather an {{extraordinary}} girl. For I called to mind now, that she was equally accomplished {{in the terms of}} our trade, and the names of our different sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I shall. Something is {{expected}} of me. I am {{to keep up the}} honour of the family; but it really {{seems to me that the}} best way of doing so would be to sit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> uncle's arm <b>chair</b> and go to sleep as he did." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{child is}} not mine as the first was, [...] I cannot sing it to rest, I cannot lift it up fatherly [...] And bliss it upon my breast: Yet it lies <b>in</b> <b>my</b> little one's cradle [...] And sits <b>in</b> <b>my</b> little one's <b>chair,</b> And {{the light of the}} heaven she's gone to [...] Transfigures its golden hair.|$|R
