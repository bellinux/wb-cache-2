Ant community is one of the soil biotic components affected on changes in physical and chemical properties of soils. This study aims to analyze the community of ants on peat lands with <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> from a young age to old age (oil <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> of 2, 10, 15, 19 and 23 years). In this study, the stand ages of oil palms also represent the reclamation ages of peatland. The study showed peat lands with <b>stands</b> of oil <b>palms</b> from a young age to old age have different physical and chemical properties of soil. Ant communities in the five study sites varied in terms of species richness, density, diversity and similarity index. Species diversity (the number of ant species) on peat land with oil <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> of a young age (2 years) and old age (19 and 23 years) was higher than in the location of <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> with age of 10 and 15 years that were periodically flooded. Ant density on land with <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> of a young age (2 years) was higher and significantly different compared with other stand locations (10, 15, 19 and 23 years). Ant abundance was positively correlated with the thickness of the peat and the levels of N, P, K, Ca and Mg of peat soil. Ant species of Solenopsis sp was the dominant invasive species population in almost all of oil <b>palm</b> <b>stand</b> lands. Diversity index of ant community tended to be higher in land with old <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> and was an indication that the equilibrium level of the ant community structure in the this location is higher than in the palm land with young age.

40|$|Copernicia tectorum is a palm {{that grows}} in large populations on {{seasonally}} flooded savannas in the Caribbean region of Colombia, where its stems and expanded leaves {{are used in}} construction, and its unexpanded leaves are used to make handicrafts. We studied abundance and population structure in 34 plots of 20 × 10 m (0. 68 ha) of three localities (Plato, Córdoba and Magangué) at the Mompox Depression, an inner delta formed by the confluence of four large rivers. We recorded growth and mortality of 164 palms of different size classes over 13 months, and additionally we estimated seedling and juvenile mortality in two 10 x 10 m plots within the same sites. Data analysis using Kolgomorov-Smirnov (KS), Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were made on Statgraphics Plus and SPSS. We related the structure and dynamics of the <b>palm</b> <b>stands</b> to flood intensity. Copernicia tectorum has the fastest leaf production rate recorded for any palm (19 - 23 leaves/year in subadults and adults), and a short life span of ca. 46 years.
