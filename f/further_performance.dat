25|$|When Kirkpatrick gave a <b>further</b> <b>performance</b> of the sonata at the Town Hall the {{following}} month, it was reviewed by multiple mainstream publications, including Time, The New York Sun, and The New Yorker. It marked {{a turning point}} in the public recognition of Ives and his works. It also marked {{a turning point in}} Kirkpatrick's own career, much of which was subsequently devoted to collaborating with Ives and documenting his work.|$|E
25|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 21 April 1715. Looking at the rich scoring of three instrumental groups and a five-part choir, John Eliot Gardiner {{suggests that the}} cantata was not performed in the court's small , but in the town church St. Peter und Paul, where the ducal family evidently at times attended services. Bach later {{performed the}} cantata several times in Leipzig in a slightly modified form. There is proof of performances for the years 1724 and 1731; a <b>further</b> <b>performance</b> in 1735 is probable as well. Since the Weimar tuning of the organ, which served as a reference for the string instruments, was probably a third higher than the standard tuning tone in Leipzig, Bach had to either leave out {{the voices of the}} reed instruments or rewrite them for the Leipzig performances, or to replace the parts by different instruments.|$|E

500|$|Since his {{youthful}} Last Days of Pompeii, Bush had not attempted to write opera, {{but he took}} up the genre in 1946 with a short operetta for children, The Press Gang (or the Escap'd Apprentice), for which Nancy supplied the libretto. This was performed by pupils at St Christopher School, Letchworth, on 7 March 1947. The following year he began a more ambitious venture, a full-length grand opera recounting the story of Wat Tyler, who led the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. [...] Wat Tyler, again to Nancy's [...] libretto, was [...] submitted in 1950 to the Arts Council's Festival of Britain opera competition, {{and was one of}} four prizewinners – Bush received £400. The opera was not taken up by any of the British opera houses, and [...] was first staged at Leipzig Opera in 1953. It was well received, [...] retained for the season and ran again in the following year; there was a <b>further</b> <b>performance</b> in Rostock in 1955. [...] Wat Tyler did not receive its full British [...] premiere until 19 June 1974, when it was produced [...] at Sadler's Wells; as of 2017, this remains the only professional [...] staging of a Bush opera in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Georgescu's {{career as}} a cellist {{came to an end}} late in World War I. [...] He was interned for a time in Berlin as an enemy alien; {{although}} the local artistic community quickly obtained his release, Georgescu was still obligated to contact the police twice daily. [...] More seriously, as he traveled to an engagement in 1916, a railway carriage door was closed on his hand, causing a painful injury that ultimately precluded his <b>further</b> <b>performance</b> on the cello. [...] As that chapter in his life closed, however, a new one opened; Richard Strauss and Arthur Nikisch both advised him to take up conducting, advice that he quickly followed after coaching with the latter. [...] Not long after a private appearance as conductor at the home of Franz von Mendelssohn, Georgescu made his public debut in that capacity on February 15, 1918, leading the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in Tchaikovsky's Pathétique Symphony, Grieg's Piano Concerto, and Richard Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks. [...] There followed a year of performances with that ensemble, notable, inter alia, for including Claudio Arrau's Berlin debut.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>further</b> <b>performance</b> {{enhancement}} {{came with}} the squadron's transition to the P-3C AIP version of the Orion in the late 1990s. [...] VP-1 successfully deployed with this aircraft to the Persian Gulf from June to December 1999, operating it from Diego Garcia, Masirah, Manama, Bahrain, and Doha, Qatar. [...] Quite unusually, the squadron deployed a pair of aircraft to support NATO's Kosovo Force with armed flights in the Adriatic Sea. [...] The following year, back at home, the squadron participated in RIMPAC, a multi-national exercise in the Pacific Ocean, while preparing crews on the AIP aircraft. [...] The squadron's next deployment came in 2001, {{and in addition to}} normal antisubmarine warfare missions, the squadron was active in the search and role efforts in several exercises. [...] These included participation in the Hong Kong Search and Rescue Exercise and the Maritime Sea-Surveillance Exercise. [...] The latter was the first trilateral exercise involving the Philippines, Thailand, and the United States. [...] Antisubmarine exercises included work with the Republic of Singapore Navy, Royal Australian Navy (Operation Tandem Thrust), the Royal Thai Navy (Operation Cobra Gold), and [...] battle group and [...] amphibious readiness group.|$|E

60|$|From {{the first}} the new {{government}} handled affairs with a certain greatness of spirit. Indeed, {{it was inevitable that}} they should act greatly. From the first they had to see the round globe as one problem; it was impossible any longer to deal with it piece by piece.

On this capacity to grasp and wield the whole round globe their existence depended. There was no scope for any <b>further</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E

The {{lady with}} whom you were so good as to make me acquainted is a {{beautiful}} specimen of the English garden-flower, the product of high cultivation and much tending; a tall, delicate stem with the head set upon it in a manner which, as a thing seen and remembered, should doubtless count for us as a gift of the gods. She's the perfect type of the object raised or bred, and everything about her hangs together and conduces to the effect, from the angle of her elbow to the way she drops that vague, conventional, dry little 'Oh!' which dispenses with all <b>further</b> <b>performance.</b> That degree of completeness is always satisfying. But I didn't satisfy her, and she didn't understand me. I don't think they usually understand." ...|$|E
