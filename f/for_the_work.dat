5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he saw this as poor reward <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> he had put in at Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in {{the withdrawal of the}} proposal, but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> to be carried out.|$|E

5|$|By 1908 {{there were}} calls for another Royal Commission into Western Australia's penal system. Truth {{newspaper}} repeatedly criticised Fremantle Prison between 1903 and 1910, {{with much of}} the blame placed on the comptroller general and superintendent. Allegations included that new offenders still were not separated from older ones, that regulations were systemically broken, and that prisoners were not paid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> they did.|$|E
5|$|Despite all the improvements, serious {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} 1999 when {{the bank of}} the drain was breached near Pinchbeck. Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded, and a review of the flood defences was then carried out. The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was not available, and so no work was done at the time.|$|E
5|$|Developed in part {{through the}} {{suggestions}} of Hergé's friends Bernard Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke, Destination Moon was produced following Hergé's extensive research into the possibility of human space travel – a feat that {{had yet to be}} achieved – with the cartoonist seeking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> to be as realistic as possible. During the story's serialisation, Hergé established Studios Hergé, a Brussels-based team of cartoonists to aid him on the project. Hergé concluded the story arc begun in this volume with Explorers on the Moon, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have praised the illustrative detail of the book, but have expressed mixed views of the narrative.|$|E

5|$|During May 2009, {{the repairs}} were {{reported}} to be almost complete and new sea trials were planned for 15–20 June. By October 2009, the work had still not been completed due to the shipyard's electrical supply having been disconnected.

5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had {{to be added to}} support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and did not deliver it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E

5|$|Eureka was {{published}} in a small hardcover edition in March 1848 by Wiley & Putnam priced at 75 cents. Poe persuaded George Palmer Putnam, who had previously taken a chance on Poe by printing his only novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket in England, to publish Eureka after claiming this work {{was more important than}} Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity. Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Poe suggested an initial printing of at least one million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which 500 were sold that year. Other accounts say that Poe requested 50,000 copies, and 500 were printed. Poe was given in advance the full payment of $14 from the publisher.|$|E
5|$|Following Thomas Williams's {{sentence}} of one year's hard labor for publishing The Age of Reason in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included {{it in an}} edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of The Age of Reason in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.|$|E

He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption.
