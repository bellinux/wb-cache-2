50|$|It is also {{possible}} to form air-tight seal between a pair of otherwise unpressurizable flanges using a <b>flat</b> <b>gasket</b> made out of a special electrically conductive elastomer. Two plain cover flanges may be mated without such a gasket, but the connection is then not pressurizable.|$|E
50|$|It is {{obviously}} essential for any piston engine {{to seal the}} joint between block and head. This is usually done {{by means of a}} head gasket, a <b>flat</b> <b>gasket</b> {{on the surface of the}} block. In early engines, the high pressures and high temperatures made this a difficult trial for the materials of the day and gasket failures were common. The junk head requires no head gasket and is sealed by piston rings inside the cylinder bore, as for the power piston.|$|E
40|$|Butt joint tool {{vacuum vessel}} {{has been built}} at C&H Enterprise, Inc. Leak {{checking}} and loading tests were taken place at the factory. The conductor could not be pumped down better than to 500 mtorr and therefore we could not check the sealing mechanism of the seal around conductor. But {{the rest of the}} vessel, including the <b>flat</b> <b>gasket,</b> one of the difficult seals worked well, no indication of leak at sensitivity 1 e- 7 l*torr/sec. The load test showed fully functional system of the load mechanism. The conductors were loaded up to 2200 kgf (21560 N) and the pressure between the butts was uniform with 100 % of the contact proved by pressure sensitive film. The status of the butt joint tool development is reported...|$|E

50|$|John Crane still {{offers the}} {{mechanical}} packing and gasket products {{upon which the}} Crane Packing Company built its success. Each year, the company manufactures some 238,900 miles of braided packing- almost enough to reach the moon- along with <b>flat</b> <b>gaskets</b> and live-load packing for valves.|$|R
40|$|Bolted flange {{connections}} with metal gasket {{have been used}} at higher pressure under higher temperature condition. Assembly procedures and tightening methods the connections including some types of metal gasket is empirically. Generally, {{it is known that}} the bolt preload which is required for satisfying an indicated leak rate in the connections including the metal gasket is not higher than that of the connections including sheet gaskets and spiral wound gaskets. However, no research for the evaluating the sealing performance in the bolted {{flange connections}} with metal gaskets has been conducted. In this paper, the leakage tests for the bolted flange connections with the metal <b>flat</b> <b>gasket</b> were conducted in the case where the maximum internal pressure of 7 MPa and a bending moment are applied, where the leak rate is measured using the pressure dro...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of surface {{roughness}} appearing on a turned sealing surface on compressive stress and compressive force of copper gaskets (a fiat gasket, a ring joint gasket and a copper wire gasket) was studied. The results obtained can be summarized as follows : (I) In {{the case of a}} <b>flat</b> <b>gasket</b> or a ring joint gasket, in order to ignore both the surface roughness appearing on a turned sealing surface and the cross section of gasket, the compressive stress for sealing had to be nearly equal to 1. 3 times the tensile strength of the copper gasket. (2) In the case of a ring joint gasket or a copper wire gasket, the values of maximum heigh roughness, in which the minimum compressive force for sealing applied, were found in the region between 2 μm and 20 μm or not less than 110 μm respectively...|$|E
40|$|Three {{pairs of}} aluminium-brass 100 -rnm-bore flange models with {{different}} surface fiishes {{of the joint}} faces {{have been subjected to}} known bolting forces and internal pressures up to seven times the rated pressure at room temperature. Hard and soft <b>flat</b> <b>gaskets</b> were used and {{it was found that the}} joint efficiency was independent of gasket material, surface fiiish. and initial bolt tension. Surface strains on the outer surfaces of the tubes and flange rings were measured with electrical-resistance strain gauges where these could be fitted. These results are also presented. The flanges did not fail; tests ended when the loose steel rings touched owing to excessive deformation, so that the gaskets were preyented from sealing. ...|$|R
50|$|The junk {{head was}} only widely used with sleeve valve engines. These sealed {{on the inside}} of the sleeve, also sealing the sleeves {{themselves}} from the combustion pressure. It would also have been difficult to arrange a <b>flat</b> head <b>gasket</b> on the top of the moving sleeves.|$|R
5000|$|Bugattis are noticeably {{focused on}} design. Engine blocks were hand scraped {{to ensure that}} the {{surfaces}} were so <b>flat</b> that <b>gaskets</b> were not required for sealing, many of the exposed surfaces of the engine compartment featured guilloché (engine turned) finishes on them, and safety wires had been threaded through almost every fastener in intricately laced patterns. Rather than bolt the springs to the axles as most manufacturers did, Bugatti's axles were forged such that the spring passed though a carefully sized opening in the axle, a much more elegant solution requiring fewer parts. He famously described his arch competitor Bentley's cars as [...] "the world's fastest lorries" [...] for focusing on durability. According to Bugatti, [...] "weight was the enemy".|$|R
25|$|The {{distance}} between the sheets in the spiral channels is maintained by using spacer studs that were welded prior to rolling. Once the main spiral pack has been rolled, alternate top and bottom edges are welded and each end closed by a <b>gasketed</b> <b>flat</b> or conical cover bolted to the body. This ensures no mixing of the two fluids occurs. Any leakage is from the periphery cover to the atmosphere, or to a passage that contains the same fluid.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fin keel}} is {{of cast iron}} with a double resin coating to prevent {{corrosion}} and is of a hydrodynamic design supplying maximum lift with good stability. The keel is mounted to the hull and has a separate moulded keel grid that provides greater strength in this area. The keel is attached with [...] stainless steel flat head bolts, nuts and <b>flat</b> washers. No <b>gasket</b> is used to mount the keel as the mating surfaces are well matched. Keels are mounted at the factory using a silicone marine sealer between the keel and hull.|$|R
40|$|A {{stainless}} steel, Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) chamber, {{featuring a}} large vertical rectangular port (53 ”W by 16 ”H), has been fabricated {{to house the}} one-meter magnet assembly of a newly installed undulator insertion device for beamline X- 25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source. To achieve UHV, the new chamber {{is equipped with a}} differential ion pump, NEG pump, nude ion gauge, residual gas analyzer, and an all metal roughing valve. Temperature of the magnet assembly is maintained below 90 oC during vacuum bake. The large rectangular port cover is sealed to the main flange of the chamber using a one-piece <b>flat</b> aluminum <b>gasket</b> and special sealing surfaces developed exclusively by Nor-Cal Products, Inc. The large flange provides easy access to the gap of the installed magnet girders for in situ magnetic measurements and shimming. Special window ports were designed into the cover and chamber for manipulation of optical micrometers external to th...|$|R
40|$|All-metal joints {{are widely}} used in the vacuum systems of {{particle}} accelerators. The most common ConFlat® design consists of a <b>flat</b> soft copper <b>gasket</b> captured between two stainless steel flanges with sharp edges (knives). The gasket is plastically deformed and a high contact pressure develops around knives to obtain leak tightness. For large accelerators, a high reliability and a cost-optimized design are required. A smooth internal transition between flanges is needed for the RF waveguides of the compact linear collider (CLIC), with limited deformation of the inner part of the gasket. We present the study of a flange meeting these requirements. First the finite element analysis (FEA) of the Stanford linear accelerator center (SLAC) X-band all-metal joint, which has a similar specification, is shown. Some drawbacks, such as non-homogeneous sealing properties, are highlighted. Then, a new joint design is described. FEA results are presented and are compared with experimental measurements carried out on prototypes...|$|R
