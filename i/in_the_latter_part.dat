5|$|Settlement of Labrador {{followed}} a similar pattern, with the interior being settled only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of the 20th century {{with the development}} of the iron ore mines at Wabush, hydroelectric generation at Churchill Falls and the military base at Goose Bay.|$|E
5|$|From the 11th century, many Tibetan {{saints and}} eminent figures came to Taktsang to meditate, {{including}} Milarepa (1040–1123), Pha Dampa Sangye (died 1117), the Tibetan yogini Machig Labdrön (1055–1145) and Thangton Gyelpo (1385–1464). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of the 12th century, the Lapa School {{was established in}} Paro.

5|$|Norwich Market (also {{known as}} Norwich Provision Market) is an outdoor market {{consisting}} of around 200stalls in central Norwich, England. Founded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of the 11thcentury to supply Norman merchants and settlers {{moving to the}} area following the Norman conquest of England, it replaced an earlier market a short distance away. It has been in operation on the present site for over 900years.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell {{examined}} and catalogued around 10,000 barrows and advanced the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory fieldwork influenced much British archaeology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of his 20th century, while his willingness to pay attention to other sources of information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be ahead of his time.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{rates of}} high {{political}} participation were eventually restricted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> nineteenth century. A gradual shift from slave to free labor, made abolition seem inevitable. This created a growing fear among both {{rural and urban}} elites that emancipated slaves would acquire the property necessary to secure the right to vote.|$|R

5|$|Smith {{published}} numerous compilations of songs, {{including two}} six-volume textbook series, which were widely {{used throughout the}} United States. Most of her writings were focused on children's voices and contained short songs written with attention paid to the limited range and short attention span of children.

5|$|The 1967 Marine Broadcasting Offences Act officially outlawed {{offshore}} stations, but unlicensed radio continued, {{moving from}} ships and sea-based platforms to urban areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of the 1960s (they were already illegal under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949).

50|$|The {{player can}} choose which camp to join, {{although}} quests get increasingly linear and {{the distinctions between}} different factions wane <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> game. The major difference is that Swamp Camp members cannot become mages, because they are limited to 4 magic circles (out of 6). However, they gain access to magic earlier.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{story is}} mainly narrated by Hope Adams an Expiso half-demon with other events being narrated by Lucas Cortez, a sorcerer. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> story the narrating is more evenly {{distributed}} {{between the two}} characters. Chapters narrated by Hope are given chapter titles while those narrated by Lucas are given chapter numbers.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, planar chiral {{metamaterials}} (PCMs) {{with single}} or multiple layers {{will be considered}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts.</b> Since PCMs are not bi-isotropic chiral media, one should be careful when describing their chiral responses. For example, circular polarisation states are no longer eigenstates of PCMs even though they exhibit optical activity and circular dichroism. Theoretical anlaysis on PCMs {{can be found in}} Ref. [25].|$|R
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{portion of the}} harbour is the three enormous arches (the fourth original arch was walled in) of a large arsenal built in the late 12th century and enlarged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> 15th century.

5|$|Arafat {{was born}} to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where {{he spent most of}} his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, he embraced Arab {{nationalist}} and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Returning to Cairo, he served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.|$|E
5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E

Velocity decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early parts of SSEs and recoveries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts</b> of SSEs were reported in previous studies; however, we did not detect any velocity recoveries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> period.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the formal}} start of naming, {{tropical}} cyclones were often named after places, objects, or saints' feast days {{on which they}} occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired until it was revived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins {{as well as the}} Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> of the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul.|$|E
5|$|Béart {{is given}} an {{ethereal}} quality by Lubtchansky's cinematography and lighting, and she subtly portrays Marie's detachment and vulnerability. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>part</b> {{of the film}} Béart is dressed in grey and looks tired and wan, showing Marie's ageing and angst. Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part. Radziwiłowicz's performance allows the viewer to sympathise with Julien despite the character's initial dislikeable nature. Brochet as Madame X has a cool ease and grace.|$|E

However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>parts</b> of his book, he granted theological and mystical value to indexes measuring inner unity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jewish nation, thus protesting actively against the creators of <b>the</b> Orthodox-Neolog schism <b>in</b> Hungarian Jewry.|$|R
