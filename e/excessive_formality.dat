60|$|What {{you would}} hardly believe is that, {{when he first}} came up, he was a person of great {{physical}} attractions. He is now grown fat, but in those days was extremely handsome. He reminded one of those colossal statues of Apollo in which the god is represented with a feminine roundness and delicacy. He was very tall and had a magnificent figure. It was so well-formed for his age that one might have foretold his precious corpulence. He held himself with a dashing erectness. Many called it an insolent swagger. His features were regular and fine. He had a great quantity of curling hair, which was worn long, with a sort of poetic grace: I am told that now he is very bald; and I can imagine that this must be a great blow to him, for he was always exceedingly vain. I remember a peculiarity of his eyes, which could scarcely have been natural, but how it was acquired I do not know. The eyes of most people converge upon the object at which they look, but his remained parallel. It gave them a singular expression, as though he were scrutinising the inmost thought of the person with whom he talked. He was notorious also for the extravagance of his costume, but, unlike the aesthetes of that day, who clothed themselves with artistic carelessness, he had a taste for outrageous colours. Sometimes, by a queer freak, he dressed himself at unseasonable moments with <b>excessive</b> <b>formality.</b> He is the only undergraduate I have ever seen walk down the High in a tall hat and a closely-buttoned frock-coat.|$|E

While the use of SPA was articulated, few researchers have attempted to review how SPA is being implemented by the construction practitioners in real situations. This research study explored {{the effect of the}} SPA on resolving construction disputes through both literature and court cases reviews. Court cases in the State of Victoria, Australia, that are related to the use of SPA were identified from the Australasian legal information institute (Austlii) database system. Findings from relevant referred journal articles, industry, and government reports are compared with those recorded in the identified court cases. Four key features that characterize the use of SPA in the State of Victoria are identified: (1) Strengthening the position for adjudication as a fast tracking process, (2) clarifying the role of adjudicator, (3) avoiding <b>excessive</b> legal <b>formality,</b> and (4) addressing the geographical difference. Findings of this study reveal that there are inconsistencies within the assumptions made by the scholars regarding the effect of SPA on industry&# 039;s practice of dispute resolution.

Diante do exame perfunctório se verifica que a crise não é somente operacional, ocasionada pelo desaparelhamento do Judiciário, pelo processo, suas excessivas formalidades e por outros motivos apontados pelo meio jurídico. Embora presentes, a {{principal}} causa é de ordem institucional, pois trata do exercício de um dos três Poderes de Estado, que já não se apresenta em sintonia com a teoria clássica da separação dos poderes do século XVIII, em face da nova sociedade e da decorrente alteração dos fins do Estado. O Poder Judiciário vem evoluindo no sentido de administrar a Justiça e prestar a jurisdição de forma substancial, com base na concretização da Constituição, especialmente dos Direitos Fundamentais, o que leva, pelo menos aparentemente, a ditar o Direito e imiscuir-se na atividade política, em contradição à teoria clássica da separação dos poderes. De outro lado, nosso sistema de governo presidencialista, com a hegemonia do Poder Executivo, depõe contra a independência do Judiciário ao centralizar a cooptação dos componentes da mais Alta Corte e ingerir na formação dos Tribunais Superiores. Agora com a adoção do controle externo do Poder Judiciário, aumenta a concentração de poderes no Executivo, fazendo frente à pletora de competência que a Constituição atribuiu ao Poder Judiciário. A conclusão é de que a perda é da sociedade, com a subversão do regime democrático. A história dos países mais desenvolvidos está a indicar o caminho do consenso, como sendo o de um novo agenciamento de poderes, adotando-se o sistema parlamentarista e um Tribunal Constitucional independente. The {{objective of the}} research is {{the analysis of the}} installed and crescent crisis of the Judicial Power in Brazil and the reform that intend to solve it. In front of the perfunctory we verify that the crisis is not just operational, caused by the lack of apparatus of the Judicial, by the process, its <b>excessive</b> <b>formalities</b> or other reasons pointed by the judicial environment. Although present, the main cause is from institutional order, because it’s about the prosecution of one of the three Powers of the State, which already is not shown in sintony with the classic theory of the separation of the powers from the XVII century, in regard to the new society and the current alteration of the finality of the State. The Judicial Power has been developing in the sense of managing the Justice and render the jurisdiction in a substantional way, based on the realization of the Constitution, specially the Fundamental Rights, that takes us, at least apparently, to dictate the Law and insert itself in the political activity, in contradiction to the classic theory of the separation of the Powers. On the other hand, our presidential government system, with the hegemony of the Executive Power, deposes against the independence of the Judicial centralizing the political choice of the components of the Highest Court and ingests the formation of the Superior Courts. Now with the adoption of the external control of the Judicial Power, raises the concentration of the powers in the Executive, initiating the exuberance of competence that the Constitution attributed to the Judicial Power. The conclusion is that the lost is of the society, with the subversion of the democratic regime. The history of the well developed countries is pointing the way of consensus, as been the way of a new placement of the powers, adopting the parliamentary system and a independent Constitutional Court...|$|R
500|$|Queen Victoria and Prince Albert made Windsor Castle their {{principal}} royal residence, despite Victoria complaining {{early in her}} reign that the castle was [...] "dull and tiresome" [...] and [...] "prison-like", and preferring Osborne and Balmoral as holiday residences. The growth of the British Empire and Victoria's close dynastic ties to Europe made Windsor the hub for many diplomatic and state visits, assisted by the new railways and steamships of the period. Indeed, {{it has been argued}} that Windsor reached its social peak during the Victorian era, seeing the introduction of invitations to numerous prominent figures to [...] "dine and sleep" [...] at the castle. Victoria took a close interest in the details of how Windsor Castle was run, including the minutiae of the social events. Few visitors found these occasions comfortable, both due to the design of the castle and the <b>excessive</b> royal <b>formality.</b> Prince Albert died in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle in 1861 and was buried in the Royal Mausoleum built at nearby Frogmore, within the Home Park. The prince's rooms were maintained exactly as they had been at the moment of his death and Victoria kept the castle in a state of mourning for many years, becoming known as the [...] "Widow of Windsor", a phrase popularised in the famous poem by Rudyard Kipling. The Queen shunned the use of Buckingham Palace after Albert's death and instead used Windsor Castle as her residence when conducting official business near London. Towards the end of her reign plays, operas and other entertainments slowly began to be held at the castle again, accommodating both the Queen's desire for entertainment and her reluctance to be seen in public.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{evolution}} and current {{purpose of the}} political offence exception {{for the purpose of}} determining whether there is a continuing role for the exception. It concludes that there is a continuing need for the exception. The thesis examines the coexistence in international law and policy between the demand for international public order, as characterized by the system of extradition laws and treaties, and the need to safeguard the rights of the individual, as reflected in the political offence exception to extradition, international refugee protection and the practice of asylum. There are a number of concerns with the political offence exception as currently applied, namely: (1) Designation of inappropriate acts as political offences; (2) <b>Excessive</b> rigidity and <b>formality</b> by some courts; (3) Excessive judicial discretion; (4) Over-emphasis on efficacy of the act in question; (5) Excessive political influence on decision-making. The thesis proposes an alternative political offence exception test with the following five criteria: (1) the individual should be involved in a dispute concerning political control over the state; (2) the individual should be part of a group which is involved in such a struggle and the act in question must be done in furtherance of that struggle; (3) the exception should not apply to heinous crimes such as crimes against humanity; (4) certain acts such as hijacking should be automatically excluded; (5) there should be proportionality between means and ends.

While any attempt to provide additional options for would-be-litigants is, of course, laudable, the dangers inherent in classifying disputes for different kinds of treatment must also be explored in depth. If mediation merely adds another level of proceedings to an already complex process, few economies may be reaped. This article seeks to advance understanding about the mediation process and the prevalent mediation model {{in the context of}} workplace disputing. Although it highlights the successful incorporation of mediation into the legal framework of countries such as New Zealand, it nevertheless urges caution on the part of UK policy makers who may be seduced into utilising mediation to facilitate settlement for predominantly tactical reasons. ...|$|E

However, a deeper analysis of his works can reveal an essential link between theory and reality. In particular, the formal approach to the juridical theory is strictly correlated with a strong democratic view. Moreover, the Kelsenian criticism of the most important concepts of constitutional law and of the traditional theory of the State {{is at the same time}} a hard criticism of their conservative nature. For these reasons, the pure theory of law paradoxically seems to be neither pure, nor apolitical. However, this profitable ambiguity is one of the most interesting sides of Kelsen’s theory and made this theory particularly appropriate to describe the intricate appearance of our society...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{main goal}} of the thesis is to compare the legal basis of {{compensation}} for corporal damages and compensated types of damages linked to corporal damages in the Czech and French legal systems. It aims not only to evaluate the benefits {{of each of the}} systems for victims but thereof to evaluate the ability of each system to counterbalance on the one hand the opportunity of the judge to consider the circumstances of each individual case and the sums therefore awarded, on the other hand the predictability of decisions for victims, without the <b>excessive</b> <b>formality</b> of the decision. At the end I consider the French legal institutions linked to this issue that could be the source of inspiration for the Czech legal practice. In the first chapter, I compare the theoretical basis of legal responsibility in both chosen legal systems and its influence on legal practices of compensation for corporal damages. These theoretical differences have essential consequences for practices of compensation for corporal damages in both legal systems. An example of this fact are different requirements for proving the causation link or the different role of application of the liability because of things that have essential consequences to victims' status in a case of disputes over compensation for corporal damages.

40|$|This paper explores {{proportionality}} {{analysis as}} a constitutional standard that allows courts {{to engage in}} a public conversation, especially with the legislature. This conversation would consider the concept, structure and normative force of fundamental rights, the way in which two or more rights compete and collide, and as to how a particular disagreement about rights can be addressed. What is particularly appealing {{is the way in which}} this approach to proportionality analysis does not prescribe any legitimate means ‘per se’. It is relational because it must apply the means to achieve a particular aim in a real situation and decide if the sacrifice applied to a particular right is proportionate. This may eventually offer better public engagement with judicial arguments and endorse judicial independence by rendering the decision more structured, open and transparent. A further aim of this paper is to fulfill the knowledge gap about the migration of proportionality analysis as a rights adjudication mechanism to Latin America and, at the same time, make a claim for a context-sensitive approach. The hope is that judiciaries will learn from recent pitfalls that occurred under authoritarian regimes in Latin America where decisions were based upon <b>excessive</b> <b>formality</b> and disregard of relevant factors involved in rights claims. The recent adoption of proportionality analysis by the Mexican Supreme Court in 2007 has created the option of a new appraisal of its migration to Latin America...|$|E

Em seu desenvolvimento, relata que existe uma industrialização do ensino jurídico e que o fato de haver lucro com esse fenômeno gerou imobilidade por parte dos doutrinadores e acentuação de ausência de crítica nos métodos utilizados em sala de aula. Aborda, igualmente, que, em decorrência dessa imobilidade, as decisões judiciais se estagnaram em seu modo de aplicação, baseando-se em teses mecânicas e na própria jurisprudência, que não passa de um endosso ao que já é história. Aduz, ainda, que o excesso de formalidade, ao invés de padronizar a instrumentalidade nos atos processuais, acentua de modo incisivo a diferença entre o entendimento de quem aplica e de quem sofre a aplicação do direito.

40|$|In Crawford v. Washington (2004), the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} “testimonial” {{statements}} are the core, perhaps exclusive, {{concern of the}} Confrontation Clause. The Court began a process of defining the testimonial-statement concept but did not develop a comprehensive definition. In Crawford, the Court concluded that a statement was testimonial, which was tape recorded and obtained from a criminal suspect who was in police custody, had been given warnings under Miranda v. Arizona (1966), and was being interrogated by known governmental agents using what the Court termed “structured” questioning. One of the definitions the Court explicitly presented as a possible model was highly formal and formalistic, and the fact pattern in Crawford, as briefly described above, would have fit within such a restrictive and wooden formulation of the concept. 	I use the terms formal and formalistic. By formal, I mean a requirement about the physical form of the statement (written, recorded, etc.), {{which is at the}} heart of the definition proposed by Justice Thomas in White v. Illinois (1992), and/or the formality of the proceedings where that statement was secured. By formalistic, I mean a relatively wooden adherence to a set formula rather than a functional approach based on the protective purposes of the Confrontation Clause. These two concepts are related but distinct: in my view, neither <b>excessive</b> <b>formality</b> nor formalism are demanded by Crawford nor are they consistent with its basic intuition about the role of the Clause. 	In Davis v. Washington (2006), the Court applied the Crawford testimonial-statement approach to two additional types of statements, one of which it found to be within the definition and the other outside it. The Court again declined to provide a comprehensive definition of the concept, and it left a large number of questions unanswered about its dimensions. However, it did reject some of the most formal and formalistic elements of what was possible after Crawford. 	Davis gave us a somewhat softened definition for the testimonial statement concept. Specifically, its holding and the additional explanatory language of Justice Scalia’s opinion for the eight-justice majority, often in direct or implicit response to Justice Thomas’ dissent advocating adherence to formality, has softened the formality of the definition. Davis’ expanded coverage and the modest flexibility it allows in applying the professed definition has also had the effect of softening its formalism. Both developments are quite positive, but unfortunately the opinions leave it entirely unclear whether the Court will continue in this direction. 	These changes in the formality and formalism of the testimonial statement concept and their implications are the subject of this essay. My analysis also leads to some further general observations. I question whether the term “testimonial” accurately describes the definition the Court is developing and whether that definition is as faithful to textual and originalist sources as Justice Scalia insists...|$|E

O trabalho tem como objetivo problematizar a experi??ncia dos Juizados Especiais Federais (JEFs) a partir deste paradoxo. Em face do aumento do n??mero de conflitos, consequ??ncia do modelo econ??mico-jur??dico neoliberal, o judici??rio adota mecanismos capazes de absorver a crescente demanda por justi??a. Para tanto, institui vias jurisdicionais alternativas, como os JEFs, al??m de outras medidas voltadas ?? informaliza????o do judici??rio. O procedimento dos juizados se diferencia daquele existente na justi??a comum, principalmente, devido ??s seguintes caracter??sticas: informalidade, celeridade, simplicidade, oralidade e consenso, caracter??sticas que a doutrina, de modo acr??tico, denomina como ?princ??pios dos Juizados Especiais?. Estas caracter??sticas s??o consideradas positivamente por significativa parte da doutrina, pois perfilam um modelo de justi??a mais pr??ximo dos cidad??os. Contudo, deve-se fazer uma ressalva: a excessiva informalidade p??e em risco a garantia ao devido processo, o que pode tornar o procedimento inconstitucional. O direito em geral, bem como o Poder Judici??rio em especial, sofrem influxos (in) diretos do discurso eficientista neoliberal, devido ?? influ??ncia paranormativa exercida tanto pelos ??rg??os de fomento econ??mico (Banco Mundial), como pelos grupos formados por grandes empresas privadas. O Estado incorpora as recomenda????es provenientes destes atores para que as leis e a justi??a n??o sejam um obst??culo aos investimentos econ??micos. Um exemplo disso ?? a Emenda Constitucional 45 / 2004, que adere ??s recomenda????es contidas no Documento T??cnico 319 S de autoria do Banco Mundial. O modelo de justi??a neoliberal exige que o judici??rio seja eficiente, produtivo e previs??vel para que os atores econ??micos possam adotar um comportamento estrat??gico e seus interesses n??o sejam obstaculizados pela burocracia judici??ria. Desse modo, a preocupa????o com a efici??ncia se sobrep??e ?? preocupa????o com a qualidade (efetividade) da presta????o jurisdicional. Estas tend??ncias s??o significativamente percept??veis no ??mbito dos JEFs. Quando os ju??zes interpretam os ?princ??pios dos Juizados Especiais? por um vi??s eficientista, o procedimento ?? informalizado para consagrar um modelo de justi??a pautado pelo mercado e n??o para concretizar um modelo de justi??a de proximidade, voltado ?? efetiva????o dos direitos constitucionais. A compreens??o dos princ??pios a partir da hermen??utica filos??fica de Hans-Georg Gadamer, do direito como integridade de Ronald Dworkin e da teoria da decis??o judicial de Lenio Streck impede uma interpreta????o pragm??tico-eficientista do procedimento dos JEFs, assim como desmitifica a ideia de que os crit??rios dos Juizados podem ser considerados princ??pios. A partir destas aproxima????es, os crit??rios dos juizados n??o podem ser aplicados de modo discricion??rio e devem assumir a condi????o de textos jur??dicos, cujos sentidos ser??o determinados de acordo com o caso concreto em an??lise, conjuntamente com as pr??ticas jur??dicas adotadas pela comunidade, de modo que o conjunto de pr??ticas jur??dicas forme um todo coerente. Este ?? o caminho para a democratiza????o do acesso qualificado ?? justi??a, compromissado com respostas constitucionalmente adequadas. The Brazilian contemporary legal scenario {{is going through}} the dilemma of being efficient or effective. Efficiency forges a model of justice which is primarily concerned with the promptness of adjudication, while effectiveness forges a model of justice in which the main concern is the fulfillment of constitutional fundamental rights. This study aims to problematize the experience of Special Federal Courts (SFCs) considering this paradox. With {{the increasing number of}} conflicts, which are a consequence of the neoliberal economical- jurisdictional model, the legal system has adopted mechanisms that are able to absorb the growing demand for justice. In order to cope with this context, it has instituted alternative legal means such as the SFCs, besides other measures, aiming at the informalization of the legal system. The procedure of these SFCs is different from that in common justice mainly due to the characteristics of informality, celerity, simplicity, orality and consensus which the doctrine, uncritically, denominates as ???principles of the Special Courts???. These characteristics are positively considered by {{a significant part of the}} doctrine since they profile a model of justice more identified with citizens. However, it should be noted that <b>excessive</b> <b>formality</b> can put the right to the due process under risk, making the procedure unconstitutional. Law, in general, as well as the Judiciary, in special, suffer (in) direct inflows of the neoliberal efficiency discourse due to the pararegulatory influence made either by the economic fostering institutions (World Bank) and the groups made up of important private companies. The government incorporates the recommendations proposed by these institutions and groups so that the laws and legal system do not become an obstacle to economic investments. An example of this is the Constitutional Amendment 45 / 2004, which follows the recommendations of the Technical Paper 319 S by the World Bank. The neoliberal legal model demands efficiency, productivity and predictability from the judiciary so that the economic actors can adopt a strategic behavior and that their interests do not suffer any obstacles by the judiciary bureaucracy. Therefore, the concern with efficiency overlaps the concern with the effectiveness of adjudication. These tendencies are significantly perceptible in the scope of SFCs. When judges interpret the ???principles of Special Courts??? through an efficiency perspective, the procedure is informalized to acclaim a model of justice based on the market and not on a model of proximity justice concerned with the promotion of constitutional rights. The understanding of the principles from philosophical hermeneutics by Hans-Georg Gadamer, of law as integrity by Ronald Dworkin and the theory of judicial decision by Lenio Streck impedes a pragmatic- efficiency procedure of the SFCs, as well as demystifies the idea that the criteria of courts can be considered principles. Through these approaches, the criteria of courts cannot be applied in a discretionary manner and should assume the condition of legal texts whose meanings are determined according to the case under analysis along with legal practices adopted by the community so that the set of legal practices is coherent. This is the way for the democratization of a qualified access to justice committed with obtaining answers that are constitutionally appropriate...|$|E
