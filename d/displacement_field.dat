The <b>displacement</b> <b>field</b> contains a signed integer and if the value of the integer is positive, if the branch is taken then the program counter is incremented. If the value of the integer is negative, then program counter is decremented if the branch is taken. The range of a branch thus is ±1 Mi instructions, or ±4 MiB. The Alpha Architecture was designed with a large range as part of the architecture's forward-looking goal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOptical full-field {{measurement}} methods are now widely applied in various domains. In general, the <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> {{can be directly}} obtained from the measurement, however in mechanical analysis strain fields are preferred. To extract strain <b>fields</b> from noisy <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> is always a challenging topic. In this study, a finite element method for smoothing <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> and calculating strain fields is proposed. An experimental test case on a holed aluminum specimen under tension is applied to validate this method. The heterogeneous <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> are measured by digital image correlation (DIC). By this proposed method, the result shows that the measuring noise on experimental <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> can be successfully removed, and strain fields can be reconstructed in the arbitrary area...|$|R
40|$|Metastable SiGe {{films were}} grown by MBE on Si (001) {{substrates}} and annealed to promote {{varying degrees of}} partial relaxation. X-ray diffraction reciprocal-space analysis was then used to monitor the structural evolution of the <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> of the dislocation array with increasing misfit density. The diffuse-x-ray-scattering patterns of the dislocated heterolayers were compared with lineal- misfit densities determined by defect etching, leading to the develop a geometric model which provides a framework for understanding the early-stage evolution of the <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> of the dislocation array, and which also explicitly links diffuse x-ray intensity to misfit density. At low misfit density, the diffuse intensity arises from two-dimensional <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> associated with single-nonoverlapping dislocations. As misfit density increases, the <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> of individual dislocations increasingly overlap producing three-dimensional displacements. The evolving diffuse intensity reflects the transition from 2 -D to 3 -D <b>displacement</b> <b>fields.</b> Finally, it is demonstrated that the diffuse x-ray intensity of the strained epilayer {{can be used to}} accurately measure lineal misfit- dislocation densities from 400 to 20, 000 lines/cm...|$|R
25|$|This {{instrument}} {{contains a}} suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of Titan's atmosphere. Accelerometers measured forces in all three axes as the probe descended through the atmosphere. With the aerodynamic properties of the probe already known, {{it was possible to}} determine the density of Titan's atmosphere and to detect wind gusts. The probe was designed so that {{in the event of a}} landing on a liquid surface, its motion due to waves would also have been measurable. Temperature and pressure sensors measured the thermal properties of the atmosphere. The Permittivity and Electromagnetic Wave Analyzer component measured the electron and ion (i.e., positively charged particle) conductivities of the atmosphere and searched for electromagnetic wave activity. On the surface of Titan, the electrical conductivity and permittivity (i.e., the ratio of electric <b>displacement</b> <b>field</b> to its electric field) of the surface material was measured. The HASI subsystem also contains a microphone, which was used to record any acoustic events during probe's descent and landing; this was the first time in history that audible sounds from another planetary body had been recorded.|$|E

[...] The terms current in his time for a capacitor were condenser (suggesting that the [...] "electric fluid" [...] could be condensed out) and leyden after the Leyden jar, an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage. [...] Heaviside preferred the analogy of a mechanical spring under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring.

40|$|Abstract. Shape {{comparisons}} of {{two groups of}} objects often have two goals: to create a classifier to separate the groups and to provide information that shows differences between classes. We examine {{issues that are important}} for shape analysis in a study comparing schizophrenic patients to normal subjects. For this study, non-linear classifiers provide large accuracy gains over linear ones. Using volume information directly in the classifier provides gains over a classifier that normalizes the data for volume. We compare two different representations of shape: <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> and distance maps. We show that the classifier based on <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> outperforms the one based on distance maps. We also show that <b>displacement</b> <b>fields</b> provide more information in visualizing shape differences than distance maps. ...|$|R
