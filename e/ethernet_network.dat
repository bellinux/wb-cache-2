40|$|Ethernet is a {{dominant}} {{local area network}} (LAN) technology from last three decades. Today most LANs are switched <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks.</b> Spanning tree protocol is a vital protocol for smooth operation of switched <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks.</b> However the current standard of spanning tree protocol for Ethernet – commonly known as Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol or in short RSTP – is highly susceptible to classical count-to-infinity problem. This problem adversely effects the network convergence time, depending upon how long count-to-infinity situation persists in the network, and thus leads to network congestion and packet loss. In the worst case, even forwarding loops may be induced that further enhances the network congestion. Thus, the dependability of RSTP controlled <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> are highly questionable due to its vulnerability against the count-to-infinity problem. This paper first discusses the count-to-infinity problem in spanning tree controlled <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks,</b> in general and in RSTP controlled <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks,</b> in particular. Then this paper proposes a simple solution to overwhelm this problem efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{protection}} switching technology is widely {{adopted in the}} fiber-optical transmission equipments based on TDM(Time Division Multiplexing), such as PDH, SDH/SONET. A variety of {{protection switching}} algorithms for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> and the progress of standardization are summarized in the document. There are several kinds of protection switching algorithms for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks,</b> such as STP, RSTP, MSTP and etc. However, since Ethernet signal move through detour route, it causes much time to recover. Accordingly, {{it is difficult to}} secure a usability of <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> and QOS(Quality of Service). Also, if the protection switching protocol standardized by IEEE and ITU-T is used, it remains a inherent network switching time for protection. Therefore, a specific protection switching algorithm for Ethernet are needed for seamless and stable operation of <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> service for Distribution Automation System(DAS). A reliable protection algorithm with no switching delay time is very important to implement Self-healing service for DAS. This study of FPGA based protection switching algorithm for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> shows that in case of faults occurrence on distribution power network, immediate fault isolation and restoration are conducted through interaction with distribution equipments using P 2 P(Peer to Peer) communication for protection coordination. It is concluded that FPGA based protection switching algorithm for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> available 0 ms switching time is crucial technolog...|$|R

40|$|Fast-recovery from link {{failures}} is a well-studied {{topic in}} IP networks. Employing fast-recovery in <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks</b> is complicated as the forwarding {{is based on}} destination MAC addresses, which {{do not have the}} hierarchical nature similar to those exhibited in Layer 3 in the form of IP-prefixes.

In this paper, we develop three alternatives for achieving fast recovery from single link failures in <b>Ethernet</b> <b>networks.</b> All three approaches provide guaranteed recovery from single link failures.
