50|$|A {{higher rate}} of {{incidence}} of shopping addiction in women was {{pointed out in the}} first research works on the subject, so much so that it was considered a “women problem”. Some researchers thought that this was a specifically female manifestation of problems of depression or obsessive-compulsive disorders. Others, from a psychoanalyst point of view, thought that it was a problem very similar to kleptomania and they related it to sexual repression to explain the high rate of incidence in women. Research carried out in the last century confirmed this difference although disagreeing on the scope. Other hypotheses have been stated to explain these differences. For example, people more easily develop addictions to behaviours they normally undertake and most home purchasing is still done by women. Since shopping is for many women one of their most usual activities, as obligation or as entertainment, it easily becomes an important mechanism of escape, facing other problems and ending up being an addiction. Another possible cause is that the most striking cases of shopping excesses are usually related to clothes, shoes, cosmetics and accessories, products which relate to physical appearance and are more frequently bought by women. The excessive purchase of other products such as electronic, computer or D.I.Y ones, accessories of cars, etc., that are frequently done by men usually goes unnoticed.This appraisal has been confirmed by research on different products bought by addicted women and men. Several studies (Flaber, O´Guin and Krych in1987, Scherhorn 1990, and McElroy in 1994),agree that women spend more on clothes, footwear, perfumes and, in general terms, men tend to spend more on sports <b>equipment,</b> <b>car</b> accessories and electronic products. The 1999 European Report established that women are drawn by activities like going shopping or window shopping, spending time in malls, escorting other people shopping. Moreover, they more frequently use shopping as a means of facing states of sadness, depression or downheartedness. However, the Report does not indicate significant {{differences between men and women}} related to economic self-control or impulsive purchase.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to the 1930 {{formation}} of Ohio's Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban, {{a number of}} struggling Indiana interurban lines were combined to create the new Indiana Railroad. In 1931, the IRR ordered interurbans from the Pullman and American Car and Foundry based upon the Cincinnati Car Company Red Devil design but with improvements. More aluminum was used, and a heavier Commonwealth truck design was adopted to allow more stability at speed. The IRR operated multiple car coupled trains from Indianapolis south to Louisville, so the new IRR lightweights had couplers and a rounded rear end, unlike the Red Devil's squared rear end. The round end allowed coupled car operation around tight curves in town streets. IRR abandoned operations in 1941, and LVT purchased IRR parlor car #55 to replace former Red Devil car 1004 lost in a fire due to 1004's malfunctioning electric car heater at Philadelphia and Western's King Manor station. (The fire also burned the station.) Car 55 arrived on the LVT property in IRR's bright [...] "traction orange" [...] paint scheme and LVT's Fairview shopmen humorously labeled it the [...] "Golden Calf." [...] The shop crew changed the former parlor seating to coach seating and repainted the exterior with LVT's white with red trim (called by the LVT a dramatic [...] "Picador Cream and Mountain Ash Scarlet") and numbered it LVT 1030. It stood out from its former C&LE Red Devil brothers by having more tapered front windows and the round rear end. LVT also replaced the IR Commonwealth trucks with the Cincinnati Car Company's ABC-74D trucks (bogies) salvaged from the 1004. They retained the interior club arrangement, but installed a refrigerator at the first left side window. Transit company officials introduced No.1030 to the public on September 14, 1941 and on October 3, 1941, the luxury car entered the revenue service on the Liberty Bell Route. Passenger traffic increased steadily during World War II and more passenger capacity was needed, so December 1941 and May 1942, several side-facing individual chairs were removed and replaced by forward and rearward facing sofas {{in order to increase}} the seating capacity from thirty to thirty-six. The original IR car design placed the motorman's controls on the left side, but the controller and brake stand were moved to the center by the LVT and a passenger loading door was added at the left front to provide southbound passenger access to the left side Norristown platform. This door was also used at Lansdale and Souderton on northbound trips to allow passengers to unload curbside rather than into the street. Although the frequent stops and occasional steep grades (the climb from Souderton's Broad Street to Summit street was severe) were more demanding on traction motors than Ohio's had been, the former Red Devils and the 1030 performed well until LVT abandonment in 1951. As company earnings severely declined due to post World War 2 diminishing ridership, seriously disabled cars were often set aside, not repaired, and cannibalized for parts for other <b>equipment.</b> <b>Car</b> 1030 is now preserved and operating at the Seashore Trolley Museum.|$|E

Although the trend of highway user crashes with rail equipment is showing a decrease in numbers, much has yet to be done to improve the safety of HRGCs. Unlike highway traffic crashes, a significantly high percentage of vehicle-rail crashes lead to fatality and injury to vehicle users. For example, data in the past 8  years (2005 – 2012) indicate that 8.55  % of vehicle-rail crashes were fatal and 26.68  % resulted in injury [2]. However, in the case of highway traffic crashes, the percentage of fatal crashes is not more than 2  % [1].|$|E

A process quality management has become an integral part of organizations’ management, so the process quality implementation methods and solutions improvement, is still the subject of scientific hearings. There is a lack in methodology how to assess construction processes quality, how to improve organizations work quality, what decisions should be taken. Was raised problematic question - based on what criteria, should be evaluated the organization’s construction quality processes? Quantitative clients’ and qualitative company’s employee’s survey analysis results identified construction process quality assurance problem areas: workers in construction, who are responsible for the construction process quality does not always work qualitatively; there are service performance disturbances, employees does not always have enough time for the work to do on time; sometimes crashes equipment, machinery; accures tensions in work; also there are lack of discounts for the price and quality balance sheet; customers expect fully realized construction quality, new <b>equipment,</b> <b>car</b> park, information technologies; the workers do not communicate through e - communications channels. Identified construction process quality improvement directions. Proposed systematically improve the quality of the construction processes by acquiring more and better quality materials, equipment, machinery, improving the quality of work. When the employees constantly have the need to improve their performance, process quality. By increasing labor productivity, construction projects will become profitable. By improving construction work processes, projects quality implementation will increase net profitability. It is proposed also to upgrade or install a new informational system in order to analyze construction processes quality, evaluate and enter data, in order to prepare reports.

Departament of Social medicine, Faculty of Public Health, Kaunas University of Medicine. -Kaunas, 2005. - P. 83 Aim of {{the study}} - {{evaluate}} patient’s attitude towards the elements of marketing at Outpatient Polyclinic of Panevėžys region local administration. Objectives: 1) to investigate the existing patients satisfaction of marketing mix elements; 2) to investigate the evaluation of marketing mix elements according to patients social – demographic characteristics; 3) to estimate patients general level of satisfaction, repeated intention to use services; 4) to form basic direction of marketing improvement at polyclinic. Methods. The study {{was carried out in}} August, 2004. Questionnaires were used. 435 questionnaires were given out, 410 questionnaires were given back (frequency of response – 94, 2). Likert’s five-point scale was used to investigate the satisfaction. Data was analysed using SPSS (version 10), Windows Microsoft Excel. Results. Experienced doctors (average 4, 52), registration (4, 51), physical evidence of polyclinic (4, 13), information in the press (3, 39) are the most important factors for respondents while choosing a medical institution. The respondents who seldom come to a medical institution are likely to come here again (4, 51). The respondents who are signed at polyclinic for ≤ 10 years would recommend it to their acquaintances (4, 11). Satisfaction, according to health care marketing mix elements: ·Respondents are satisfied with doctor’s attention (3, 79), responses to questions (3, 71), advice (3, 52). Presentation of learning material (2, 89), prices of prescribed medicine (2, 91), explaining the influence on disease (3, 04) were the lovest evaluated subjects. Most respondents trust their doctors and are satisfied with doctors and nurses work. ·Those who paid for services were less satisfied with responses about their health. ·Respondents are most satisfied with doctor’s calls to homes (4, 07) but least satisfied with registration (3, 66), working hours of polyclinic (3, 90). ·Subjects such as the location of polyclinic (3, 68), the clothing of doctors and nurses (3, 84), the lighting of rooms (3, 68) were estimated on average. The reasons of dissatisfaction: diagnostic equipment (3, 20), the physical evidence of rooms (3, 49), the parking place (2, 58). ·Information from a doctor is the most important source of information about polyclinic. Information about polyclinic in mass media is important to one third respondents. Conclusions: 1. The most important subject for patients is a doctor, registration, the physical evidence of polyclinic, information in the press. The more frequently patients visit polyclinic, the more dissatisfied with the registration and working hours they are. The linger respondents are signed at polyclinic, the more dissatisfied with instructions on prescribed medicine, registration ant the temperature of the rooms they are; 2. With the rise of average income patients become less satisfied with doctor’s instuctions on prescribed medicine, registration, payment for services, diagnostic <b>equipment,</b> <b>car</b> parking place. Elderly respondents are less satisfied with doctor’s advice and registration. Information in the press or on TV is more important to the residents of Panevėžys region; 3. Most respondents are going to use services and recommend the polyclinic; 4. It is recommended to segment patient according to social – demographic characteristics, investigate the satisfaction of each segment according to marketing mix elements, create marketing programmes increasing the attractiveness of polyclinic to patients...|$|E
