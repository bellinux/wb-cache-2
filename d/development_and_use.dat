The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} {{public opinion}} surveys {{there is strong}} support {{for a variety of}} methods for addressing the problem of energy supply. These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of such technologies. It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.|$|E

Through the 1950s Avondale had monitored its sheep flocks {{as part of the}} research into Dwalganup strain of clover as a livestock feed and its effect on ewe fertility. On into the 1960s and 1970s Avondale was involved with the breeding and trial of various cereal crops for use within Western Australia. Since the early 1980s Avondale has focused on environmental and sustainable farming along with farm income supplemental alternatives like marron farming.|$|E

He also became an adviser to the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), which was responsible for the military aspects on nuclear weapons. Over the following two years, he became {{a consultant to}} the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), a member of the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, {{a consultant to the}} newly established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{and a member of the}} Scientific Advisory Group of the United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology. The T3 was later marketed internationally {{with the help of the}} UK Trade & Investment's passport initiative– a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.|$|E

5|$|The <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> of {{the term}} Wicca within {{contemporary}} Paganism has been a recurring topic of discussion {{in the field of}} Pagan studies. The majority of academics and independent scholars use the first, more inclusive definition. Given its historical status and prevalent usage within Paganism, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White thought it the logical and easier choice for academia, although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines Wicca. Among those who have used the former definition are American sociologist Margot Adler, literary scholar Chas S. Clifton, and religious studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly, while others such as the Britons Graham Harvey and Ronald Hutton failed to make their usage clear. To deal with this problem in future, Doyle White urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work.|$|E
