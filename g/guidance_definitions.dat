30|$|The MDR values did {{not change}} when more {{additives}} than those categorized as ‘HAZ’ or ‘CLP’ (i.e. those categorized only as ‘>  10 % STU’ or not assigned to any category based on available data) were additionally taken into account (Fig.  2 d). This finding indicates that the consideration of all additives does not improve the predictability of product toxicity, and hence is clearly not necessary. It further shows that the ‘>  10 % STU’ criterion alone is too conservative for the identification of additives as relevant for a CBA. Hence, {{with regard to the}} draft <b>guidance</b> <b>definition</b> of relevant components, this finding for seven water-based wood preservative products demonstrates that the consideration of a.s. from other product types (here: preservatives) and solvents (unless categorized as ‘HAZ’ or ‘CLP’) was not necessary to predict the overall aquatic toxicity of the product.|$|R

30|$|Current {{harmonized}} guidance {{dictates that}} the hold times for drug substance intermediates, product intermediates, and bulk product are systematically established, {{but does not}} fully address the specific requirements for the bulk hold time stability study. The reason for this lack of flexibility is that the <b>guidance</b> <b>definition</b> of the date of manufacture is “the date when active ingredients are combined with other ingredients” for shelf life derivation. However, alternative methods of shelf life can be derived using “the date of stable intermediate being further processed for downstream process” instead of the date of manufacture. To be able to establish an alternative shelf life, stability studies that can establish sequential bulk hold times for drug substance intermediates, product intermediates, as well as bulk product are required. This can be achieved during the development phase encompassing Phase I-III IND/CTA and NDA/WMA filing and the derived alternative shelf life methodology made applicable for later bulk manufacturing process.|$|R
30|$|None of {{the three}} {{tentative}} categories defined {{in the present study}} covers exactly the definition of SoC that should be included in a mixture assessment according to the draft guidance [13] (Biocidal Products Regulation Volume IV Environment—Assessment and Evaluation, Parts B + C). However, none of the additives in these products was suspected of synergistic interaction, identified as candidate PBT or vPvB substances [17], or listed in the Water Framework Directive as priority pollutant with an established EQS. Consequently, the necessity of including such additives in a CBA could not be experimentally verified in the present study. Hence, the only additives to be considered in the 21 products according to the draft <b>guidance</b> <b>definition</b> were a.s. from other PT (some preservatives at very low concentrations), solvents (on a case-by-case basis) and hazardous or dangerous additives that resulted in the product being classified as hazardous or dangerous. In the following, the predicted product toxicity based on the tentative categories will be compared to experimentally observed toxicity, taking also into account the SoC definition of the draft guidance as far as possible.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To develop formal consensus-based {{guidance}} {{for the management}} of myasthenia gravis (MG). Methods: In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment {{guidance for}} MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology was used to develop consensus <b>guidance</b> statements. <b>Definitions</b> were developed for goals of treatment, minimal manifestations, remission, ocular MG, impending crisis, crisis, and refractory MG. An in-person panel meeting then determined 7 treatment topics to be addressed. Initial guidance statements were developed from literature summaries. Three rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to attain consensus on guidance statements modified on the basis of panel input. Results: Guidance statements were developed for symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatments, IV immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, management of impending and manifest myasthenic crisis, thymectomy, juvenile MG, MG associated with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, and MG in pregnancy. Conclusion: This is an international formal consensus of MG experts intended to be a guide for clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide...|$|R

40|$|A new {{analytical}} formulation {{is presented}} to approach low-thrust trajectories design, {{in the framework of}} a <b>guidance</b> law <b>definition</b> for an automated spacecraft to rendezvous and serve multiple active targets. The formulation exploits polar coordinates, avoiding the need of either Keplerian or equinoctial elements. To minimize the low thrust maneuver cost to approach the targets an integer number of revolutions is imposed together with a constant transversal thrust to focus on orbital energy gain for phasing. The here proposed analytical formulation is the basis of a first algorithm, fast and straightforward, well-suited for preliminary global cost assessment in multiple targets rendezvous scenarios. A second algorithm, numerically settled, is also presented, to further optimize the attainable guidance profile trajectories which may open the door to enhanced guidance strategies. The combination of the two offers on one side a good initial guess which helps containing the computational cost of the numerical search for optimal guidance, ensuring, on the other hand, fast and reliable solutions. Performance and results are discussed on the study case of a single spacecraft to serve multiple GEO satellites without loss of generality...|$|R
40|$|The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 is the {{cornerstone}} of the United States’ efforts to combat the involvement of U. S. companies and individuals in corruption abroad. Enforced by both the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the Act targets companies and individuals that pay bribes to “foreign officials,” a nebulous category of persons that includes everyone from foreign cabinet members to janitors at companies only partially owned by a foreign state. After only sporadic enforcement {{in the early years of}} the Act’s existence, the SEC and DOJ now bring many cases annually. This increased enforcement has raised the ire of the business community, and many commentators have criticized the government for haphazard enforcement and unclear <b>guidance.</b> The <b>definition</b> of “foreign official,” which has always been deliberately broad and vague, has particularly vexed many companies. This Note proposes a creative amendment to the Act to solve this problem, not by changing the definition of “foreign official” but by requiring in-country State Department employees to provide country-specific guidance on who is-—and who is not—-a bona fide “foreign official” in a given place...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA growing {{interest}} in rhinosinusitis in recent years resulted in two European Position Papers in Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyposis (EP 3 OS) documents, published in 2005 and 2007, respectively. The latter {{is intended to be}} a state-of-the art review for specialists and general practitioners, updating the current knowledge on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis, proposing the <b>guidance</b> for <b>definitions</b> and outcome measurements in research and providing an evidence-based review of the available treatments. The present article briefly discusses the guidelines for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) diagnoses, as well as treatment recommendations provided by that document. Recent, epidemiological PROSINUS study of ARS, carried out in Spain, is also briefly reviewed, with special emphasis on Cyclamen europaeum extract use in ARS treatment. A new treatment approach is proposed, based on Cyclamen europaeum extract use in ARS and in the postoperative management of patients with CRS and nasal polyps undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery, which is associated with clinically confirmed, significant improvement of patients’ symptoms, nasal endoscopic signs and patient satisfaction in comparison to saline. These results are thought to be connected with nasal drainage-facilitating and paranasal sinuses-cleaning activities of the extract...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, {{the use of}} anti-EGFR {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{is restricted}} to Kirsten RAS (KRAS) wild-type colorectal tumors. Information on the KRAS status of the patients tumor is thus key for clinical practice; however, there is little <b>guidance</b> or <b>definition</b> on which KRAS mutations to assess and how to assess them. To ensure the consistency {{and the quality of}} KRAS test results in Europe, an interlaboratory control network needs to be set up. This pilot study aimed to identify the variables that need to be assessed in a quality control scheme and to provide a first assessment in a selected set of laboratories. Fourteen different tumor cases were circulated between 13 laboratories by a central laboratory acting as the referent for the mutation status determination. This study illustrated that of 13 experienced laboratories that perform KRAS testing only ten correctly identified the KRAS in all 14 cases that were circulated. There was no harmonization in DNA isolation and KRAS mutation detection method between the laboratories. These results indicate that future standardization is needed in KRAS mutation detection methodology. An expansion of the European Society of Pathology KRAS program could identify areas of difficulty in KRAS testing and provide the basis for harmonization...|$|R
40|$|The {{wind power}} {{industry}} has grown {{rapidly in the}} UK to meet EU targets of sourcing 20 % of energy from renewable sources by 2020. Although wind power is a renewable energy source, there are environmental concerns over increasing numbers of wind farm proposals and associated cumulative impacts. Individually, a wind farm, or indeed any action, may have minor effects on the environment, but collectively these may be significant, potentially {{greater than the sum}} of the individual parts acting alone. EU and UK legislation requires a cumulative impact assessment (CIA) as part of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). However, in the absence of detailed <b>guidance</b> and <b>definitions,</b> such assessments within EIA are rarely adequate, restricting the acquisition of basic knowledge about the cumulative impacts of wind farms on bird populations. Here we propose a conceptual framework to promote transparency in CIA through the explicit definition of impacts, actions and scales within an assessment. our framework requires improved legislative guidance on the actions to include in assessments, and advice on the appropriate baselines against which to assess impacts. Cumulative impacts are currently considered on restricted scales (spatial and temporal) relating to individual development EIAs. We propose that benefits would be gained from elevating CIA to a strategic level, as a component of spatially explicit planning...|$|R

OMB <b>guidance</b> describes the <b>definition</b> for each of four assurance levels, of which level 1 is the highest and level 4 the lowest level of assurance. The traditional mode of authentication system asserts the following three elements as the foundation of authentication: “something you know,” “something you have,” and “something you are”. The first of these, “something you know,” is the knowledge factor (e.g., a password, a PIN), while “something you have” is the possession factor (e.g. an ID badge or cryptographic key) and “something you are” is the inherence factor (a fingerprint, other biometric data).|$|R

ICOMOS encourages the use of extant designations. The Orkney example highlights the difficulties in marrying the specific aims and consultative requirements embedded in such extant statutory designations with the requirements of the World Heritage Site. The authors encourage extreme caution in using extant designations for this purpose. Instead, they recommend an aspiration to boundaries that are designed {{to meet the needs of}} the Site and are workable through the local planning framework: their formal designation in development plans; and the use, where relevant, of supplementary guidance to bridge the gap between the date of inscription of the World Heritage Site and the formal revision of existing plans...|$|R
40|$|A “worldization” {{process of}} the {{education}} system started during the later years of the last millennia.

One of the phenomena related to the context of globalization is the decentralization of the education systems, in which the process is paired with the generation of policies that promote education management independence. Through this context, we analyze the role that globalization plays on the emergence of supranational policies. How have these processes of decentralization occurred, in which way is the dissemination mechanism promoted, and what is the incidence of veto players in the positioning of an educational public policy, and its supranational, national and sub national dissemination...|$|R

Indeed, for existing platforms, it is permissible to have limited individual component failures, provided the reserve strength against overall system failure remains acceptable. This system {{was used to determine}} the life expectancy of a platform used in the Gulf of Mexico for ten years, which was to be accordingly modified and installed on a new site off Congo. The analysis showed that a service life of ten years was feasible without need for strengthening.

40|$|International manuals in {{economic}} statistics have traditionally provided <b>guidance</b> about concepts, <b>definitions,</b> classifications, coverage, valuation, recording data, aggregation procedures, formulas, and so on.

The Manual will benefit users of export and import price indices (XMPIs), such as government and academic economists, financial experts, and other informed users. XMPIs are key statistics for policy purposes. They attract much attention from the media, governments, and the public in most countries.

This Manual is therefore also intended to promote greater understanding of the properties of XMPIs.
