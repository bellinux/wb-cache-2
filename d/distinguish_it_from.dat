5|$|LEMS usually {{occurs in}} people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age. The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> myasthenia gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.|$|E

Its elongated, tapered head ends in a beak-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and its beak is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's forelimbs have two visible claws on each flipper.|$|E

5|$|The Ancient Greek term acra {{was used}} to {{describe}} other fortified structures during the Hellenistic period.

5|$|The {{outside of}} the mantle may be any color, {{typically}} red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> a secular mantle. David Johnson suggested that the mantle of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use ermine, to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops. Above the mantle is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a processional cross and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (archimandrite or hegumen) should display a veiled abbot's staff to <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the bishop's staff.|$|E

5|$|Banksia grossa, {{commonly}} known as the coarse banksia, is a species of shrub in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Southwest Australia. It is one of fourteen species of banksia of the series Abietinae, all of which bear predominantly cylindrical or oval inflorescences. Collected in 1965, it was described in 1981 by Alex George. Its thick leaves and large seeds <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> other members of the Abietinae, and are the basis of its species name.|$|E
5|$|Baorangia bicolor, {{also known}} as the two-colored bolete or red and yellow bolete after its {{two-tone}} coloring scheme of red and yellow, is an edible fungus in the genus Baorangia. It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a less dramatic bruising coloration change in the stem {{over a period of several}} minutes are identifying characteristics that <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the similar poisonous species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.|$|E

It is written on 297 parchment leaves and contains the entire New Testament except the Book of Revelation.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} flower heads and growth from rhizomes <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> E.vaginatum, {{which has a}} single flower head and grows from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2–12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E

5|$|Outer space, also simply called space, {{refers to}} the {{relatively}} empty regions of the universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies. Outer space is used to <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at {{what is known as}} the heliopause.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} Parkinson’s disease as a synucleiopathy (due to an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain) to <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease where the brain accumulates tau protein. Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.|$|E
5|$|Several {{periods of}} Protestant Christian revival nurtured a {{proliferation}} of new religious movements in the United States. In {{the latter half of}} the 19th century these included what came to be known as the metaphysical family: groups such as Christian Science, Divine Science, the Unity School of Christianity and (later) the United Church of Religious Science. From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New Thought, in part to <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the more authoritarian Christian Science.|$|E
