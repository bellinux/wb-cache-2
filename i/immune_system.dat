5|$|Although the {{polyclonal}} response confers advantages on the <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> in particular, greater {{probability of}} reacting against pathogens, it also increases chances of developing certain autoimmune diseases {{resulting from the}} reaction of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> against native molecules produced within the host.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{can result}} in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either {{be the result of}} a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> which is activated by the innate response. Here, the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

40|$|Artificial <b>Immune</b> <b>Systems</b> are {{computational}} algorithms {{which take}} their {{inspiration from the}} way in which natural <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> learn to respond to attacks on an organism. This paper discusses how such a system can be used as an alternative to genetic algorithms as a way of exploring program-space in a system similar to genetic programming. Some experimental results are given for a symbolic regression problem. The paper ends with a discussion of future directions for the use of artificial <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> in program induction...|$|R

5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{and go on}} to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E
5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> {{as well as its}} inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> mankind has developed.|$|E
