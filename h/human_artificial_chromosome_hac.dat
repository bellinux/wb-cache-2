That is, instead of 46 chromosomes, the cell could have 47 with the 47th being very small, roughly 6-10 megabases (Mb) in size instead of 50-250 Mb for natural chromosomes, and able to carry new genes introduced by human researchers.

Recent reports show that HACs are useful gene transfer vectors in expression studies and important tools for determining human chromosome function. HACs have been used to complement gene deficiencies in human cultured cells by transfer of large genomic loci also containing the regulatory elements for appropriate expression.

40|$|We {{previously}} used a <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> with {{a synthetic}} kinetochore {{that could be}} targeted with chromatin modifiers fused to tetracycline repressor to show that targeting of the transcriptional repressor tTS within kinetochore chromatin disrupts kinetochore structure and function. Here we show that the transcriptional corepressor KAP 1, a downstream effector of the tTS, can also inactivate the kinetochore. The disruption of kinetochore structure by KAP 1 subdomains does not simply result from loss of centromeric CENP-A nucleosomes. Instead it reflects a hierarchical disruption of the outer kinetochore, with CENP-C levels falling before CENP-A levels and, in certain instances, CENP-H being lost more readily than CENP-C. These results suggest that this novel approach to kinetochore dissection may reveal new patterns of protein interactions within the kinetochore...|$|E
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>HACs)</b> {{provide a}} unique {{opportunity}} to study kinetochore formation and to develop a new generation of vectors with potential in gene therapy. An investigation into the structural and the functional relationship in centromeric tandem repeats in HACs requires the ability to manipulate repeat substructure efficiently. We describe here a new method to rapidly amplify human alphoid tandem repeats of a few hundred base pairs into long DNA arrays up to 120 kb. The method includes rolling-circle amplification (RCA) of repeats in vitro and assembly of the RCA products by in vivo recombination in yeast. The synthetic arrays are competent in HAC formation when transformed into human cells. As short multimers can be easily modified before amplification, this new technique can identify repeat monomer regions critical for kinetochore seeding. The method may have more general application in elucidating the role of other tandem repeats in chromosome organization and dynamics...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate {{the advantages of}} HAC vectors for reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Two HAC vectors (iHAC 1 and iHAC 2) were constructed. Both carried four reprogramming factors, and iHAC 2 also encoded a p 53 -knockdown cassette. iHAC 1 partially reprogrammed MEFs, and iHAC 2 efficiently reprogrammed MEFs. Global gene expression patterns showed that the iHACs, unlike other vectors, generated relatively uniform iPS cells. Under non-selecting conditions, we established iHAC-free iPS cells by isolating cells that spontaneously lost iHAC 2. Analyses of pluripotent markers, teratomas and chimeras confirmed that these iHAC-free iPS cells were pluripotent. Moreover, iHAC-free iPS cells with a re-introduced HAC encoding Herpes Simplex virus thymidine kinase were eliminated by ganciclovir treatment, indicating that the HAC safeguard system functioned in iPS cells. Thus, the HAC vector could generate uniform, integration-free iPS cells with a built-in safeguar...|$|R

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutation in the extremely large dystrophin gene (2. 4 Mb). We herein report the development of a HAC vector containing the entire human dystrophin gene (DYS-HAC) that is stably maintained in mice and human immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (hiMSCs). The DYS-HAC was transferred to mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, and isoforms of the DYS-HAC-derived human dystrophin in the chimeric mice generated from the ES cells were correctly expressed in tissue-specific manner. Thus, this HAC vector containing the entire dystrophin gene with its native regulatory elements is expected to be extremely useful for future gene and cell therapies of DMD...|$|R
40|$|The {{centromere}} is {{a specialized}} chromosomal region {{that serves as}} the assembly site of the kinetochore. At the centromere, CENP-A nucleosomes form part of a chromatin landscape termed centrochromatin. This chromatin environment conveys epigenetic marks regulating kinetochore formation. Recent work sheds light on the intricate relationship between centrochromatin state, the CENP-A assembly pathway and the maintenance of centromere function. Here, we review the emerging picture of how chromatin affects mammalian kinetochore formation. We place particular emphasis on data obtained from <b>Human</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> biology and the targeted engineering of centrochromatin using synthetic HACs. We discuss implications of these findings, which indicate that a delicate balance of histone modifications and chromatin state dictates both de novo centromere formation and the maintenance of centromere identity in dividing cell populations...|$|E

This HAC exhibits normal kinetochore protein composition and mitotic stability. Targeting of several tet-repressor (tetR) fusions into the centromere {{had no effect on}} kinetochore function. However, altering the chromatin state to a more open configuration with the tTA transcriptional activator or to a more closed state with the tTS transcription silencer caused missegregation and loss of the HAC. tTS binding caused the loss of CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C, and H 3 K 4 me 2 from the centromere accompanied by an accumulation of histone H 3 K 9 me 3.

40|$|Human {{polyclonal}} antibodies (hPABs) {{are useful}} therapeutics, {{but because they}} are available only from human donors, their supply and application is limited. To address this need, we prepared a <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> vector containing the entire unrearranged sequences of the human immunoglobulin (hIg) heavy-chain (H) and lambda (lambda) light-chain loci. The HAC vector was introduced into bovine primary fetal fibroblasts using a microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) approach. Primary selection was carried out, and the cells were used to produce cloned bovine fetuses. Secondary selection was done on the regenerated fetal cell lines, which were then used to produce four healthy transchromosomic (Tc) calves. The HAC was retained at a high rate (78 - 100 % of cells) in calves and the hIg loci underwent rearrangement and expressed diversified transcripts.

Although a HAC theoretically incorporates multiple gene expression cassettes of unlimited DNA size, its application {{has been limited}} because the conventional gene-loading system accepts only one gene-loading vector (GLV) into a HAC. We report a novel method for the simultaneous or sequential integration of multiple GLVs into a HAC vector (designated as the SIM system) via combined usage of Cre, FLP, Bxb 1, and QC 31 recombinase/integrase. As a proof of principle, we first attempted simultaneous integration of three GLVs encoding EGFP, Venus, and TdTomato into a gene-loading site of a HAC in CHO cells. These cells successfully expressed all three fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, microcell-mediated transfer of HACs enabled the expression of those fluorescent proteins in recipient cells. We next demonstrated that GLVs could be introduced into a HAC one-by-one via reciprocal usage of recombinase/integrase. Lastly, we introduced a fourth GLV into a HAC after simultaneous integration of three GLVs by FLP-mediated DNA recombination. The SIM syste...|$|R

HAC are important vectors for investigating the organization {{and structure of the}} kinetochore, and gene complementation. HAC have so far been obtained in immortalized or tumour-derived cell lines, but never in stem cells, thus limiting their potential therapeutic application. In this work, we modified the herpes simplex virus type 1 amplicon system for efficient transfer of HAC DNA into two hESc. The deriving stable clones generated green fluorescent protein gene-expressing HAC at high frequency, which were stably maintained without selection for 3 months. Importantly, no integration of the HAC DNA was observed in the hESc lines, compared with the fibrosarcoma-derived control cells, where the exogenous DNA frequently integrated in the host genome. The hESc retained pluripotency, differentiation and teratoma formation capabilities. This is the first report of successfully generating gene expressing de novo HAC in hESc, and is a significant step towards the genetic manipulation of stem cells and potential therapeutic applications...|$|R

Recently, we generated a HAC with a conditional centromere, which includes the tetracycline operator (tet-O) sequence embedded in the alphoid DNA array. This conditional centromere can be inactivated, loss of the alphoid tet-O (tet-O HAC) by expression of tet-repressor fusion proteins. In this report, we describe adaptation of the tet-O HAC vector for gene delivery and gene expression in human cells. A loxP cassette was inserted into the tet-O HAC by homologous recombination in chicken DT 40 cells following a microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT). The tet-O HAC with the loxP cassette was then transferred into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and EGFP transgene was efficiently and accurately incorporated into the tet-O HAC vector. The EGFP transgene was stably expressed in human cells after transfer via MMCT. Because the transgenes inserted on the tet-O HAC can be eliminated from cells by HAC loss due to centromere inactivation, this HAC vector system provides important novel feature...|$|R
40|$|In a {{comparative}} study, {{we show that}} <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> vectors based on alpha-satellite (alphoid) DNA from chromosome 17 but not the Y chromosome regularly form HACs in HT 1080 human cells. We constructed four structurally similar HAC vectors, two with chromosome 17 or Y alphoid DNA (17 alpha, Yalpha) and two with 17 alpha or Yalpha and the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus (HPRT 1). The 17 alpha HAC vectors generated artificial minichromosomes in 32 - 79 % of the HT 1080 clones screened, compared with only approximately 4 % for the Yalpha HAC vectors, indicating that Yalpha is inefficient at forming a de novo centromere. The 17 alpha HAC vectors produced megabase-sized, circular HACs containing multiple copies of alphoid fragments (60 - 250 kb) interspersed with either vector or HPRT 1 DNA. The 17 alpha-HPRT 1 HACs were less stable than those with 17 alpha only, and these results may influence the design of new HAC gene transfer vectors...|$|E

40|$|A <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> vector was {{constructed}} from a 1 -Mb {{yeast artificial chromosome}} (YAC) that was selected based on its size from among several YACs identified by screening a randomly chosen subset of the Centre d’Étude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) (Paris) YAC library with a degenerate alpha satellite probe. This YAC, which also included non-alpha satellite DNA, was modified to contain human telomeric DNA and a putative origin of replication from the human β-globin locus. The resultant HAC vector was introduced into human cells by lipid-mediated DNA transfection, and HACs were identified that bound the active kinetochore protein CENP-E and were mitotically stable {{in the absence of}} selection for at least 100 generations. Microdissected HACs used as fluorescence in situ hybridization probes localized to the HAC itself and not to the arms of any endogenous human chromosomes, suggesting that the HAC was not formed by telomere fragmentation. Our ability to manipulate the HAC vector by recombinant genetic methods should allow us to further define the elements necessary for mammalian chromosome function...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{construction}} of BAC-based <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>HACs)</b> requires optimization of each key functional unit {{as well as}} development of techniques for the rapid and reliable manipulation of high-molecular weight BAC vectors. Here, we have created synthetic chromosome 17 -derived alpha-satellite arrays, based on the 16 -monomer repeat length typical of natural D 17 Z 1 arrays, in which the consensus CENP-B box elements are either completely absent (0 / 16 monomers) or increased in density (16 / 16 monomers) compared to D 17 Z 1 alpha-satellite (5 / 16 monomers). Using these vectors, we show {{that the presence of}} CENP-B box elements is a requirement for efficient de novo centromere formation and that increasing the density of CENP-B box elements may enhance the efficiency of de novo centromere formation. Furthermore, we have developed a novel, high-throughput methodology that permits the rapid conversion of any genomic BAC target into a HAC vector by transposon-mediated modification with synthetic alpha-satellite arrays and other key functional units. Taken together, these approaches offer the potential to significantly advance the utility of BAC-based HACs for functional annotation of the genome and for applications in gene transfer...|$|R

Recently, MMCT was applied to transfer MACs/HACs carrying entire chromosomal copies of genes for genes function studies and has potential for regenerative medicine. However, a safe and efficient MMCT technique remains an important challenge. The original MMCT protocol includes treatment of donor cells by Colcemid to induce micronucleation, where each chromosome becomes surrounded with a nuclear membrane, followed by disarrangement of the actin cytoskeleton using Cytochalasin B to help induce microcells formation. In this study, we modified the protocol and demonstrated that replacing Colcemid and Cytochalasin B with TN- 16 + Griseofulvin and Latrunculin B in combination with a Collage/Laminin surface coating increases the efficiency of HAC transfer to recipient cells by almost sixfold and is possibly less damaging to HAC than the standard MMCT method.

While <b>HACs</b> are maintained stably, the segregation mechanisms of HACs have not been investigated in detail. To analyze HACs in living cells, we integrated 256 copies of the Lac operator into a precursor yeast <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (YAC) containing α-satellite DNA and generated green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged HACs in HT 1080 cells expressing a GFP-Lac repressor fusion protein. Time-lapse analyses of GFP-HACs and host centromeres in living mitotic cells indicated that the HAC was properly aligned at the spindle midzone and that sister chromatids of the HAC separated with the same timing as host chromosomes and moved to the spindle poles with mobility {{similar to that of the}} host centromeres. These results indicate that a HAC composed of a multimer of input α-satellite YACs retains most of the functions of the centromeres on natural chromosomes. The only difference between the HAC and the host chromosome was that the HAC oscillated more frequently, at higher velocity, across the spindle midzone during metaphase. However, this provides important evidence that an individual HAC has the capacity to maintain tensional balance in the pole-to-pole direction, thereby stabilizing its position around the spindle midzone...|$|R

We previously described a synthetic HAC {{that can be}} easily eliminated from cell populations by inactivation of its conditional kinetochore. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this HAC, which has a unique gene acceptor site, for delivery of full-length genes and correction of genetic deficiencies in human cells. A battery of functional tests was performed to demonstrate expression of NBS 1 and VHL genes from the HAC at physiological levels. We also show that phenotypes arising from stable gene expression can be reversed when cells are “cured” of the HAC by inactivating its kinetochore in proliferating cell populations, a feature that provides a control for phenotypic changes attributed to expression of HAC-encoded genes. This generation of human artificial chromosomes should be suitable for studies of gene function and therapeutic applications...|$|E

We also developed an HSV- 1 hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) HAC vector, which generated functional HPRT-expressing HACs that complemented the genetic deficiency in human cells. The transduction efficiency of the HSV- 1 HAC amplicons is several orders of magnitude higher than lipofection-mediated delivery. Studies on HAC stability between cell types showed important differences that have implications for HAC development and gene expression in human cells. This is the first report of establishing gene-expressing HACs in human cells by using an efficient, high-capacity viral vector and by identifying factors {{that are involved in}} cell-type-specific HAC instability.

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have great potential for gene therapy, as such cells can be generated from the individual's own tissues, and when reintroduced can contribute to the specialized function of any tissue. As a proof of concept, we show herein the complete correction of a genetic deficiency in iPS cells derived from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model (mdx) mice and a human DMD patient using a HAC with a complete genomic dystrophin sequence (DYS-HAC). Deletion or mutation of dystrophin in iPS cells was corrected by transferring the DYS-HAC via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT). DMD patient- and mdx-specific iPS cells with the DYS-HAC gave rise to differentiation of three germ layers in the teratoma, and human dystrophin expression was detected in muscle-like tissues. Furthermore, chimeric mice from mdx-iPS (DYS-HAC) cells were produced and DYS-HAC was detected in all tissues examined, with tissue-specific expression of dystrophin. Therefore, the combination of patient-specific iPS cells and HAC-containing defective genes represents a powerful tool for gene and cell therapies...|$|E

We previously developed HAC vectors from the normal human chromosomes using a chromosome engineering technique. However, endogenous genes were remained in these HACs, limiting their therapeutic applications. In this study, we refined a HAC vector without endogenous genes from human chromosome 21 in homologous recombination-proficient chicken DT 40 cells. The HAC was physically characterized using a transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning strategy followed by sequencing of TAR-bacterial <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> clones. No endogenous genes were remained in the HAC. We demonstrated that any desired gene can be cloned into the HAC using the Cre-loxP system in Chinese hamster ovary cells, or a homologous recombination system in DT 40 cells. The HAC can be efficiently transferred to other type of cells including mouse ES cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. The transferred HAC was stably maintained in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, tumor cells containing a HAC carrying the suicide gene, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK), were selectively killed by ganciclovir in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>HAC)</b> {{are small}} {{functional}} extrachromosomal elements, which segregate correctly during each cell division. In human cells, they are mitotically stable, however when the HAC are transferred to murine cells they show an increased and variable rate of loss. In some cell lines the HAC are lost over {{a short period}} of time, while in others the HAC become stable without acquiring murine DNA. Results In this study, we linked the loss rate to the position of the HAC in the murine cell nucleus with respect to the chromocenters. HAC that associated preferentially with the chromocenter displayed a lower loss rate compared to the HAC that are less frequently associated. The chromocenter acts as a hub for the deposition of heterochromatic markers, controlling centromeric and pericentromeric DNA replication timing and <b>chromosome</b> segregation. The <b>HAC</b> which localized more frequently outside the chromocenters bound variable amounts of histone H 3 tri-methylated at lysine 9, and the high level of intraclonal variability was associated with an increase in HAC segregation errors and delayed DNA replication timing. Conclusion This is a novel result indicating that HAC segregation is closely linked to the position in the murine nucleus and gives important insight for HAC gene expression studies in murine cells and establishing murine models of human genetic disease. </p...|$|R

To monitor which cells took up constructs and subsequently formed stable clones under blasticidin S (BS) selection, a CMV/EGFP expression cassette was inserted into a HAC construct based on chromosome 5 alpha satellite DNA (142 kb). Lipofection into HT 1080 cells {{resulted in a}} small proportion of cells exhibiting bright green fluorescence on day 1. Areas containing such early green cells were marked, and plates monitored over 2 weeks. In only one out of 41 marked areas, a viable clone developed. In the remaining 40 areas, the green cells ceased division at 1 - 8 cells. In contrast, outside the marked areas, 16 stable clones formed which did not exhibit green fluorescence during the first cell divisions, but all cells of each became green around day 4 - 6. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of isolated clonal lines demonstrated low copy HAC formation without integration. We conclude that transient expression of an EGFP marker on HAC DNA is not a suitable means for the identification of the proportion of transfected cells which are capable of forming viable clones. One explanation could be that the high copy number required to consistently detect transient EGFP expression (Schindelhauer and Laner, 2002) impairs viability and clone formation.

In the present study, we introduced genes packaged into chromatin into target cells using a <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> and analyzed regulation of {{gene expression}}. The human β-globin gene cluster was built into an HAC (globin-HAC) and introduced into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT); the adult-type human β-globin gene was expressed in bone marrow and spleen cells of the transgenic mice. In vitro differentiation of ES cells into mouse erythrocytes indicated that the natural sequential expression of ε, γ and β-globin genes was reproduced on the globin-HAC. Combination of MMCT and a novel chromosome transfection technique allowed transfer of globin-HAC from HT 1080 cells into the human leukemia cell line K 562, and from K 562 cells back into HT 1080 cells. Expression of the γ-globin gene, repressed in HT 1080 cells, was activated in K 562 cells without any processes of differentiation into adult erythroid cells, and was completely repressed again in HT 1080 cells when transferred back from K 562 cells.

We then introduced the cells for the treatment of a neurodegenerative disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The HAC-MSCs were transplanted via the fourth cerebral ventricle (CV) or intravenous (i. v.) infusion at various ages of recipient mice. Littermate- and sex-matched mice underwent a sham procedure. Compared to the controls, there was an encouraging trend of increased life span via CV transplantation and delayed onset in i. v. infusion 60 days after transplantation. Further, we confirmed a statistically significant increase in life span via CV transplantation at 100 days. This effect was not seen in mice transplanted with MSCs lacking the HAC. We successfully enhanced the trophic potential of the MSCs using the HAC. This strategy could be a promising direction for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E

We observed that the HACs in murine cells bound centromere protein C (CENP-C), a marker of active centromeres, and were detected under selection but rapidly lost when selection was removed. These results suggest that the HACs maintain at least a partially functional centromere complex in murine cells, but other factors are required for stability and segregation. <b>Artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> containing mouse centromeric sequences may be required for better stability and maintenance in murine cells...|$|R
40|$|The viral E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase ICP 0 protein has {{the unique}} property to temporarily localize at interphase and mitotic centromeres early after infection of cells by the {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1). As a consequence ICP 0 induces the proteasomal degradation of several centromeric proteins (CENPs), namely CENP-A, the centromeric histone H 3 variant, CENP-B and CENP-C. Following ICP 0 -induced centromere modification cells trigger a specific response to centromeres called interphase Centromere Damage Response (iCDR). The biological significance of the iCDR is unknown; so is the degree of centromere structural damage induced by ICP 0. Interphase centromeres are complex structures made of proximal and distal protein layers closely associated to CENP-A-containing centromeric chromatin. Using several cell lines constitutively expressing GFP-tagged CENPs, we investigated {{the extent of the}} centromere destabilization induced by ICP 0. We show that ICP 0 provokes the disappearance from centromeres, and the proteasomal degradation of several CENPs from the NAC (CENP-A nucleosome associated) and CAD (CENP-A Distal) complexes. We then investigated the nucleosomal occupancy of the centromeric chromatin in ICP 0 -expressing cells by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion analysis. ICP 0 expression either following infection or in cell lines constitutively expressing ICP 0 provokes significant modifications of the centromeric chromatin structure resulting in higher MNase accessibility.

40|$|International audienceThe viral E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase ICP 0 protein has {{the unique}} property to temporarily localize at interphase and mitotic centromeres early after infection of cells by the {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1). As a consequence ICP 0 induces the proteasomal degradation of several centromeric proteins (CENPs), namely CENP-A, the centromeric histone H 3 variant, CENP-B and CENP-C. Following ICP 0 -induced centromere modification cells trigger a specific response to centromeres called interphase Centromere Damage Response (iCDR). The biological significance of the iCDR is unknown; so is the degree of centromere structural damage induced by ICP 0. Interphase centromeres are complex structures made of proximal and distal protein layers closely associated to CENP-A-containing centromeric chromatin. Using several cell lines constitutively expressing GFP-tagged CENPs, we investigated {{the extent of the}} centromere destabilization induced by ICP 0. We show that ICP 0 provokes the disappearance from centromeres, and the proteasomal degradation of several CENPs from the NAC (CENP-A nucleosome associated) and CAD (CENP-A Distal) complexes. We then investigated the nucleosomal occupancy of the centromeric chromatin in ICP 0 -expressing cells by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion analysis. ICP 0 expression either following infection or in cell lines constitutively expressing ICP 0 provokes significant modifications of the centromeric chromatin structure resulting in higher MNase accessibility. Finally, using <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>HACs),</b> we established that ICP 0 -induced iCDR could also target exogenous centromeres. These results demonstrate that, in addition to the protein complexes, ICP 0 also destabilizes the centromeric chromatin resulting in the complete breakdown of the centromere architecture, which consequently induces iCDR...|$|R

The vector that transferred the OTC cDNA into Gelsinger’s liver mimicked the human adenovirus type 5 (1). Even with critical adenoviral disease-causing regions deleted (E 1 and E 5), the virus still proved troublesome. Gelsinger experienced a systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failures that left him comatose two days before he died (2). Three years later, two boys treated with therapy for X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), the “bubble boy ” disease, devel-oped leukemia (3). The delivered DNA integrated into the host LMO 2 gene, which naturally plays a role with cell division. Leukemia developed because over-stimulated mitotic events caused extra-proliferated white blood cell growth. Cases such as these in which gene therapy has turned fatal show that technol-ogy has not proven to be safe enough for human trials—and therefore, better techniques in gene therapy must be developed and mastered. The FDA has approved approximately 300 gene therapy experiments since 1990 (3). Current re-search on the <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> has shown that HAC therapy avoids {{the problems associated with}} older gene therapy techniques. As its own chromosome, “cousin 47 ” does not present naked DNA that could randomly integrate into the host genome. Instead, it promotes its own replicatio...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{arrangement}} of chromatin {{is linked to}} the regulation of nuclear processes. One striking aspect of nuclear organization is the spatial segregation of heterochromatic and euchromatic domains. The mechanisms of this chromatin segregation are still poorly understood. In this work we investigated the link between the primary genomic sequence and chromatin domains. We analyzed the spatial intranuclear {{arrangement of}} a <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> in a xenospecific mouse background in comparison to an orthologous region of native mouse chromosome. The two orthologous regions include segments that can be assigned to three major chromatin classes according to their gene abundance and repeat repertoire: (i) gene-rich and SINE-rich euchromatin, (ii) gene-poor and LINE/LTR-rich heterochromatin and (iii) gene-depleted and satellite DNA-containing constitutive heterochromatin. We show using FISH and 4 C-seq technologies that chromatin segments ranging from 0. 6 to 3 Mb cluster with segments of the same chromatin class. As a consequence, the chromatin segments acquire corresponding positions in the nucleus irrespectively of their chromosomal context thereby strongly suggesting that this is their autonomous property. Interactions with the nuclear lamina, although largely retained in the HAC, reveal less autonomy. Taken together, our results suggest that building of a functional nucleus is largely a self-organizing process based on mutual recognition of chromosome segments belonging to the major chromatin classes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Towards {{the goal}} of {{producing}} fully human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs or hIgGs) in transchromosomic (Tc) cattle, we previously reported that Tc cattle carrying a <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>HAC)</b> comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain (hIGH), kappa-chain (hIGK), and lambda-chain (hIGL) germline loci produced physiological levels of hIgGs when both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chains, bIGHM and bIGHML 1, were homozygously inactivated (bIGHM 2 / 2, bIGHML 12 / 2; double knockouts or DKO). However, because endogenous bovine immunoglobulin light chain loci are still intact, the light chains are produced both from the hIGK and hIGL genomic loci on the HAC and from the endogenous bovine kappa-chain (bIGK) and lambda-chain (bIGL) genomic loci, resulting {{in the production of}} fully hIgGs (both Ig heavy-chains and light-chains are of human origin: hIgG/hIgk or hIgG/hIgl) and chimeric hIgGs (Ig heavy-chains are of human origin while the Ig light-chains are of bovine origin: hIgG/bIgk or hIgG/bIgl). To improve fully hIgG production in Tc cattle, we here report the deletion of the entire bIGL joining (J) and constant (C) gene cluster (bIGLJ 1 -IGLC 1 to bIGLJ 5 -IGLC 5) by employing Cre/loxP mediated site-specific chromosome recombination and the production of triple knockout (bIGHM 2 / 2, bIGHML 12 / 2 and bIGL 2 / 2; TKO) Tc cattle.

40|$|The {{development}} of safe and efficient gene delivery systems in pluripotent {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESc) is essential to realising their full potential for basic and clinical research. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop an efficient, non-integrating gene expression system in pluripotent hESc using <b>human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>HAC).</b> Similar to endogenous <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>HAC</b> are capable of gene expression, replication and segregation during cell division. Unlike retroviral-mediated gene delivery vectors, HAC do not integrate into the host genome and can encompass large genomic regions for the delivery of multiple genes. Despite the advantages HAC offer, their use has been limited due to laborious cloning procedures and poor transfection efficiencies, and thus only studied in immortalised and tumour-derived human cell lines. In this study, the high transduction efficiency of herpes simplex virus type- 1 (HSV- 1) amplicons was utilised to overcome the described difficulties and delivered HAC vectors into pluripotent hESc. Analysis of stable hESc clones showed that de novo gene-expressing HAC were present at high frequencies ranging from 10 - 70 % of metaphases analysed, without integrating into the genome. The established HAC contained an active centromere, and were stably maintained without integration or loss in the absence of selection for 90 days. Stable HAC-containing hESc clones retained their pluripotency as demonstrated by neuronal differentiation, in vitro germ layer and teratoma formation assays. HAC gene expression persisted, with some variation, post-differentiation in the various deriving cell types. This is the first report of successful de novo HAC formation in hESc for gene expression studies. These findings show potential for delivering high-capacity genomic constructs safely and efficiently into pluripotent cells for the purpose of genetic manipulation and ultimately patient-specific somatic gene therapy.

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract De novo <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> expressing genes have been generated in {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESc) and are maintained following differentia-tion into other cell types. <b>Human</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>HAC)</b> are small, functional, extrachromosomal ele-ments, which behave as normal chromosomes in human cells. De novo HAC are generated following delivery of alpha satellite DNA into target cells. HAC are charac-terized by high levels of mitotic stability and are used as models to study centromere formation and chromosome organisation. They are successful and effective as gene expression vectors since they remain autonomous and can accommodate larger genes and regulatory regions for long-term expression studies in cells unlike other viral gene delivery vectors currently used. Transferring the essential DNA sequences for HAC formation intact across the cell membrane has been challenging {{for a number of}} years. A highly efficient delivery system based on HSV- 1 amplicons has been used to target DNA directly to the ES cell nucleus and HAC stably generated in human embryonic stem cells (hESc) at high frequency. HAC were detected using an improved pro-tocol for hESc chromosome harvesting, which consis-tently produced high-quality metaphase spreads that could routinely detect HAC in hESc. In tumour cells, the input DNA often integrated in the host chromo-somes, but in the host ES genome, it remained intact. The hESc containing the HAC formed embryoid bodies, generated teratoma in mice, and differentiated into neu-ronal cells where the HAC were maintained. The HAC structure and chromatin composition was similar to the endogenous hESc chromosomes. This review will dis-cuss the technological advances in HAC vector delivery using HSV- 1 amplicons and the improvements in the identification of de novo HAC in hESc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Human</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Chromosomes</b> (<b>HACs)</b> are {{potentially}} useful vectors for gene transfer studies and for functional annotation {{of the genome}} because of their suitability for cloning, manipulating and transferring {{large segments of the}} genome. However, development of HACs for the transfer of large genomic loci into mammalian cells has been limited by difficulties in manipulating high-molecular weight DNA, {{as well as by the}} low overall frequencies of de novo HAC formation. Indeed, to date, only a small number of large (> 100 kb) genomic loci have been reported to be successfully packaged into de novo HACs. Results We have developed novel methodologies to enable efficient assembly of HAC vectors containing any genomic locus of interest. We report here the creation of a novel, bimolecular system based on bacterial <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (BACs) for the construction of HACs incorporating any defined genomic region. We have utilized this vector system to rapidly design, construct and validate multiple de novo HACs containing large (100 – 200 kb) genomic loci including therapeutically significant genes for human growth hormone (HGH), polycystic kidney disease (PKD 1) and ß-globin. We report significant differences in the ability of different genomic loci to support de novo HAC formation, suggesting possible effects of cis -acting genomic elements. Finally, as a proof of principle, we have observed sustained ß-globin gene expression from HACs incorporating the entire 200 kb ß-globin genomic locus for over 90 days in the absence of selection. Conclusion Taken together, these results are significant for the development of HAC vector technology, as they enable high-throughput assembly and functional validation of HACs containing any large genomic locus. We have evaluated the impact of different genomic loci on the frequency of HAC formation and identified segments of genomic DNA that appear to facilitate de novo HAC formation. These genomic loci may be useful for identifying discrete functional elements that may be incorporated into future generations of HAC vectors. </p...|$|R
