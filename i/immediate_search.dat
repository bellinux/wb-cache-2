Although five cases were heard by two judges at that point, any judge could have secured {{potential}} evidence without waiting for the combining of the cases. Opposition parties criticized the lack of immediate action, attributing it to government-appointed chief of prosecutors Alejandra Gils Carbó. Several neighbours reported on April 17 that documentation was removed from the Madero Center (the alleged location of La Rosadita) over a several-hour period; a search and seizure was conducted the following day. Casanello requisitioned security-camera tapes to ascertain if documents were removed before the operation, and the investigation suggested that information may have been erased from computers between the first program and the search-and-seizure operation. It was discovered that Austral Construcciones (owned by Lázaro Báez and operating with large sums of money) was a client of La Rosadita and its telephones had Báez on speed dial. The son of Daniel Pérez Gadín (Báez's accountant) was identified in the security tapes as one of the men removing papers, boxes and file folders before the search and seizure; Casanello opened a separate investigation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a hypothetical scenario of public {{response to a}} large regional earthquake on the southern section of the San Andreas Fault. Conclusive social and behavioral science research over decades has established that the behavior of individuals in disaster is, on the whole, controlled, rational, and adaptive, despite popular misperceptions that people who experience a disaster are dependent upon and problematic for organized response agencies. We applied this knowledge to portray the response of people impacted by the earthquake focusing on actions they will take during and immediately following the cessation of the shaking including: <b>immediate</b> response, <b>search</b> and rescue, gaining situational awareness through information seeking, making decisions about evacuation and interacting with organized responders. Our most general conclusion is that the actions of ordinary people in this earthquake scenario comprised {{the bulk of the}} initial response effort, particularly in those areas isolated for lengthy periods of time following the earthquake...|$|R

We employ unitarized Higgs Effective Theory amplitudes previously computed coupling the two photon channel to the EWSBS. We {{work in the}} Effective Photon Approximation and examine both e-e+ collisions at energies of order 1 - 2 TeV (as relevant for future lepton machines) and pp collisions at LHC energies. Dynamically generating a spin- 0 resonance around 1. 5 TeV (by appropriately choosing {{the parameters of the}} effective theory) we find that the differential cross section per unit s, p_t^ 2 is is of order 0. 01 fbarn/TeV^ 4 at the LHC. Injecting a spin- 2 resonance around 2 TeV we find an additional factor 100 suppression for p_t up to 200 GeV. The very small cross sections seem to put these photon-photon processes, though very clean, out of reach of <b>immediate</b> future <b>searches.</b> Comment: 29 pages, 25 plot...|$|R

This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of [...] "lying quiet," [...] but insisted upon making <b>immediate</b> <b>search</b> for the [...] "corpse of the murdered man."--This was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the time, that it was [...] "a singular expression, to say no more." [...] This remark of 'Old Charley's,' too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask, very impressively, [...] "how it happened that young Mr. Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy uncle's disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was 'a murdered man.'" [...] Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd, and especially between [...] "Old Charley" [...] and Mr. Pennifeather--although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no means a novelty, for no good will had subsisted between the parties for {{the last three or four}} months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr. Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle's house, of which the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion [...] "Old Charley" [...] is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. He arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all--merely muttering a few words about [...] "taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity,"--a natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten.|$|E
50|$|The two-factor {{theory of}} emotion, states that emotion {{is based on}} two factors: {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive label. The theory was created by researchers Stanley Schachter and Jerome E. Singer. According to the theory, when an emotion is felt, a physiological arousal occurs and the person uses the <b>immediate</b> environment to <b>search</b> for emotional cues to label the physiological arousal. This can sometimes cause misinterpretations of emotions based on the body's physiological state. When the brain does not know why it feels an emotion it relies on external stimulation for cues on how to label the emotion.|$|R

The first two structures {{have been widely used}} for indexing general set-valued data. We make some modifications to make them more suitable for indexing frequent itemsets. The CFP-tree structure is specially designed for storing frequent itemsets. We add a pruning technique based on length- 2 frequent itemsets to make it more efficient for processing superset queries. We study the performance of the three structures in supporting five types of containment queries: exact match, subset/superset <b>search</b> and <b>immediate</b> subset/superset <b>search.</b> Our results show that no structure can outperform other structures for all the five types of queries on all the datasets. CFP-tree shows better overall performance than the other two structures...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{the support}} in primary {{education}} that student-designed games enhance student contextualisation {{of skills and}} tactics, {{there has been little}} support in secondary education, nor any empirical research exploring these claims. This paper attempts to rekindle these beliefs and explores the use of student-designed games in an English secondary school. Aim: To provide a detailed account of classes of secondary students designing their own games, and to investigate their responses to the games-making process. Method: Two classes of boys (aged 14 – 16) at a school in England participated in the study. Each class was divided into three teacher-selected teams and attended one lesson per week, each lasting 40 minutes, for seven weeks. Lessons were adapted to give students four phases of development: a 2 -week library-based planning and wiki construction phase; a 1 -week outdoor modification and wiki update phase; three weeks of trials of the games with a wiki refinement phase; and a 1 -week game and wiki finalization phase. In this time frame the pupils involved were challenged to design an invasion game that would be played in a subsequent unit. Data consisted of: teacher post-teaching reflections, interviews between a professor-researcher and the on-site participants, observations and analysis of wikis. Data analysis occurred on three levels. The first aspect was immediate and ongoing by the teacher-researcher to meet the ‘on the spot’ learning needs of his students. Secondly, the professor-researcher aided the teacher-researcher in systematic collection, organisation and analyses. Thirdly, peer debriefing occurred in which the research team analysed and critiqued the data during the collection and writing processes. Results: We found that students ‘bought into’ the process of games-making, were afforded an inclusive voice and worked as teams. Furthermore they engaged in <b>immediate</b> <b>searches</b> for innovation which were influenced by popular media, and shared ideas and learning with others to a degree that allowed them to exclude problematic skills. However, there was student frustration induced by watching others failing to properly play these games. Conclusions: We concluded that student-designed games ‘freed’ children to define competition at their own developmental level. This paper shows that by trusting pupils and supporting them to be creative in the games that they play it is possible to gain an insight into the processes by which students apply their knowledge about physical education...|$|R
