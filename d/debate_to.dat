5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{suffrage}} and publishing work, Gordon was well-known in California political circles, and even received 200 votes for State Senate in 1871. This positioned her, along with fellow suffragette Clara Shortridge Foltz, to manage the lobbying campaign for the Woman Lawyer's Bill, which granted women the right to practice law in California in January 1878. Gordon used her position as a journalist covering the <b>debate</b> <b>to</b> stay in touch with lawmakers and lobby the governor for the final signature.|$|E
5|$|In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia {{began to}} make moves to secede from that territory.

5|$|Dacey {{became a}} senior party {{figure in the}} late 1890s and began to work on {{political}} strategy to win support in suburban seats and from white-collar voters. He stood in opposition to his party's support for the Premiership of Sir George Reid and instead threatened to resign if the party did not switch its support to William Lyne's Protectionist Party. At a Labor Party conference in 1899, the party executive decided to put forward the protectionism/free trade <b>debate</b> <b>to</b> a referendum of all party members, despite Dacey's campaigning. Dacey's standing in the Labor Party continued to grow: he was the party's treasurer from 1901 to 1910 and on the Party Central Executive in 1912.|$|E
5|$|SASO decided after a <b>debate</b> <b>to</b> remain non-affiliated with NUSAS, {{but would}} {{nevertheless}} recognise the larger organisation {{as the national}} student body. One of SASO's founding resolutions was to send a representative to each NUSAS conference. In 1970 SASO withdrew its recognition of NUSAS, accusing it of attempting to hinder SASO's growth on various campuses. SASO's split from NUSAS was a traumatic experience for many white liberal youth who had committed themselves {{to the idea of}} a multi-racial organisation and felt that their attempts were being rebuffed. The NUSAS leadership regretted the split, but largely refrained from criticising SASO. The government—which regarded multi-racial liberalism as a threat and had banned multi-racial political parties in 1968—was pleased with SASO's emergence, regarding it as a victory of apartheid thinking.|$|E
