5|$|In 1954, Takechi {{followed}} Susugigawa with a noh-kyōgen {{version of}} Junji Kinoshita's Yūzuru. Yūzuru {{is one of}} the most successful Japanese post-World War II plays, having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949. Composer Ikuma Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952. Since its premiere, Dan's opera has been performed more than 550 times, making it possibly the most popular opera written in Japanese. Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi's production of the play. Dan combined the noh-style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus. On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi-directed kyōgen, <b>Higashi</b> wa <b>Higashi</b> (East is East), a parody of the kyōgen style. Among the innovations Takechi made in this play was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all-male kyōgen cast. In the ultra-conservative noh and kyōgen communities, simply appearing in a rival school's production could result in an actor's excommunication from the profession. Because of the public attention drawn through Takechi's relentless publicity work and communication with the media, punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, redback spiders {{were found}} in Fukuoka, Japan. Over 700 have been found near the {{container}} terminal in Hakata Bay, Fukuoka City. Dispersal mechanisms within Japan are unclear, but redbacks {{are thought to have}} spread by walking or by being carried on vehicles. In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the <b>Higashi</b> Ward of Fukuoka City. As Japan previously had no dangerous spiders, signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.|$|E

The intrinsic viscosity data of the resulting polyamide were found to be strongly dependent on the matrix used as well as on its molecular weight...|$|R
5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale when {{he stopped}} working as a journalist in 1996. The story was rejected {{in the final round}} of the 1997 , which took place in March 1998, because of its controversial content. Masao <b>Higashi,</b> {{who took part in the}} award's preliminary selection committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students killing each other being too reminiscent of the Kobe child murders committed the previous year. Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} plan—drafted {{under the}} direction of the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Toyoda Soemu—called for Yamato and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting the U.S. troops landing on the west of the island. Yamato and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then beach themselves between <b>Higashi</b> and Yomitan and fight as shore batteries until they were destroyed. Once the ships were destroyed, their surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon ship and fight U.S. forces on land. Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which would render them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from US carrier-based aircraft. In preparation for executing the plan, the assigned ships left Kure for Tokuyama, Yamaguchi, off Mitajiri, Japan, on 29 March. However, despite obeying orders to prepare for the mission, Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō—commander of the Ten-Go force—still refused to actually order his ships to carry it out, believing the plan to be futile and wasteful.|$|E
5|$|Through the 2000s (decade), most Lexus {{sedan and}} SUV {{production}} {{has occurred in}} Japan at the Tahara plant in Aichi and Miyata plant in Fukuoka. In addition to the Tahara factory, Lexus vehicles have been produced at the Miyata plant (Toyota Motor Kyushu, Inc.) in Miyawaka, Fukuoka, <b>Higashi</b> Fuji plant (Kanto Auto Works, Ltd.) in Susono, Shizuoka, and Sanage plant (Toyota Boshoku Corp.; Araco) in Toyota City, Aichi. Front-wheel drive cars, such as the ES and HS, are produced in the Fukuoka Prefecture. The Kokura plant in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, which opened in 2008, is a dedicated hybrid production site for Lexus models such as the gasoline-electric RX. The North American–market RX 350 (since the 2004 model year) is produced at the Cambridge plant (Toyota Canada, Inc.) {{in the city of}} Cambridge, in Ontario, Canada, which is the first Lexus production site located outside Japan. In late 2015, Lexus started to assemble North American-spec ES 350 sedans at the Georgetown plant (TMMK, Inc.).|$|E

50|$|Black Swan {{proposed}} a three-way mind meld to restore each man to their correct personal states, but doublecrossed them. Outlaw returned {{in time to}} help fight the Black Swan, who had now absorbed both Alex and Deadpool's powers to augment himself. Even though Alex called <b>Higashi's</b> favour in and surrounded Swan with hitmen, this proved to be fruitless, so Alex devised a new plan. After Taskmaster and Outlaw distracted him, Deadpool pinned Swan to Taskmaster's explosives-laden van and Alex ignited it. Alex then reversed Black Swan's absorption, but also gave him the memories of being caught in the bomb explosion in Germany. The group then repeatedly shot the Black Swan {{to make sure he}} was dead. The body was taxidermied and carried around by each couple (Taskmaster and Sandi, Alex and Inez) as a prop while they went on vacation.|$|R

Acquiring {{a large number of}} 54 souls, {{including}} Kotoha's, Utakasane reveals the souless bodies have a day to live before falling back into the Sanzu River so that he wouldn't be destroyed before his mission is complete. However, Genta planted a Modikara on Utakasane that not only forces him back to the mortal realm when Ebi Orgami is brought to life, but also to keep him from utilizing his Hundred Separation move. He is destroyed by the Shinkengers, Utakasane is destroyed by Daikaioh <b>Higashi's</b> Lobster Claw Professional Payback. The effects of his Soul Remove technique are the basis of the Uwan (うわん) of Japanese myth. Voiced by Mitsuki Saiga (Saiga Mitsuki).|$|R
5|$|Wolves in Japan became extinct {{during the}} Meiji {{restoration}} period, an extermination known as ōkami no kujo. The wolf was deemed {{a threat to}} ranching, which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on January 23, 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called <b>Higashi</b> Yoshiro). The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves, which colonized the Korean Peninsula and Japan, before it separated from mainland Asia, 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaidō, thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago. Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island dwarfism 7,000–13,000 years ago {{in response to these}} climatological and ecological pressures. C. l. hattai (formerly native to Hokkaidō) was significantly larger than its southern cousin C. l. hodophilax, as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey, as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{opposition}} {{to the creation of}} the Ōtani-ha, and a number of other controversies and disputes such as the Ohigashi schism, several new <b>Higashi</b> Hongan-ji branches came into existence such as the Higashiyama Honganji, founded in Kyoto in 1996 by Otani Korin, and the Tokyo <b>Higashi</b> Honganji, whose current leader is Otani Koken. Despite, or perhaps even because of, this climate of instability, the <b>Higashi</b> Honganji movement has also produced a significant number of controversial but influential thinkers, such as Soga Ryōjin, Kiyozawa Manshi, Kaneko Daiei and Akegarasu Haya, amongst others.|$|E
25|$|The largest <b>Higashi</b> Hongan-ji grouping, the Ōtani-ha has {{approximately}} 5.5 million members, {{according to}} statistics.|$|E
50|$|Today, Tsutsumi Hōzan-ryū only {{exists in}} Australia, brought {{there by the}} late Jan de Jong. His son, Hans de Jong, states {{that his father was}} {{instructed}} in the art from 1927-1945 by two Japanese brothers, S. Saito (8th dan), and K. Saito (7th dan), in Indonesia, in the 1920s and 30’s. Both of these men were students of Tsutsumi Masao. A further indication of its legitimacy is that the modern Tsutsumi Hōzan-ryū Jujutsu practiced in Australia does indeed resemble Tsutsumi’s art as depicted in <b>Higashi’s</b> book, with the signature leg techniques, long since removed from judo. The art in Australia is a goshin jutsu (self-defence art) and hence is not taught in the traditional kata forms seen in most koryu jujutsu. Instead, a kata/randori mix is used, referred to as Shinken Shobu no Kata ("form of true/live fighting"). This may be an influence from judo, although it is claimed to be a traditional characteristic of Tsutsumi Hōzan-ryū. Hence, {{the current state of the}} art is more gendai budō (modern martial art) as opposed to Koryu (classical). The majority of teachers in Australia do not claim to be teaching Koryu, but simply self-defence jujutsu.|$|R

25|$|The Shinshū Honbyō, the {{mausoleum}} of Shinran, is {{now owned by}} the Ōtani-ha but is still commonly called <b>Higashi</b> Honganji (東本願寺) by Kyoto visitors and locals. The massive Goei-dō (also known as Mie-dō), or Founder's Hall Gate, is often {{one of the first}} things one sees walking north from JR Kyōto Station. Nearly identical to the Nishi Hongan-ji head temple in layout, it too features an Amida-dō, and a larger Mie-dō. The Mie-dō at <b>Higashi</b> Hongan-ji dates from 1895 and vies with a number of other structures for the claim of largest wooden building in the world.|$|E

25|$|The soul {{collective}} {{continued to}} tour and record, {{adding to the}} lineup drummer Ichiraku Yoshimitsu and guitarist <b>Higashi</b> Hiroshi. Several non-Acid Mothers shootoff bands formed, including Floating Flower, Nishinihon, and Tsurbami, while The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. played at sold-out shows and festivals all over North America, Japan, and Europe in the 2000s (decade). In 2002, the soul collective released four albums and two EPs in a three-month span while touring the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, including South by Southwest in Austin, being selected {{as one of the}} top three groups performing.|$|E
25|$|Hyperammonemic {{encephalopathy}} {{was reported}} by Katano Hiroyuki of the Nagoya City <b>Higashi</b> General Hospital in early 2002 in a patient who had been stable on primidone monotherapy for five years before undergoing surgery for astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor. Additionally, her phenobarbital levels were inexplicably elevated post-surgery. This is much more common with the valproates than {{with any of the}} barbiturates. A randomized controlled trial whose results were published in the July 1985 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine found that primidone was more likely to cause impotence than phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital. Like phenytoin, primidone is rarely associated with lymphadenopathy. Primidone can also cause vomiting; this happens in 1.0–0.1% of users.|$|E
25|$|The foreign {{settlement}} at Kobe {{quickly became}} {{home to many}} British residents, including many lovers of their country's national sport. The Hyōgo Cricket Club was founded on January 19, 1870, around the main members {{of a team of}} foreign residents that had played a game on October 16 of the previous year against a British army team. The club changed its name in 1871 to the Kobe Cricket Club (KCC). For a long time, the KCC was unable to secure enough members or playing ground to undertake any conspicuous activity, but after May 1877, when the future <b>Higashi</b> Yūenchi park was completed, the club became quite active, playing games in the park seemingly every week. Beginning in 1893, the club also played games of baseball. The KCC continued to operate until World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{to commemorate}} the tenth anniversary of Acid Mothers Temple, a new group called Acid Mothers Temple & the Cosmic Inferno was formed, {{starting}} their first European tour in June, and consisting of Kawabata, <b>Higashi</b> Hiroshi, Tabata Mitsuru, Okano Futoshi, and Shimura Koji and releasing several albums. Acid Mothers Temple SWR continued to tour as well. Acid Mothers Temple & the Incredible Strange Band was formed in 2006 by Tsuyama Akiko, Suhara Keizo, Aiko, Tsuyama Atsushi, and Kawabata Makoto. Kitagawa Hao joined The Cosmic Inferno as vocalist, though she left the soul collective after touring the United States in mid-2007.

25|$|Lemuel Clayton was a Halifax councillor, silk spinner {{and one of}} the co-founders of Bankfield Museum in 1887. He was {{a member}} of the Literary and Philosophical Society, had {{travelled}} the world and amassed a collection of curios, and these curios were some of the first exhibits shown in the museum. One of the curios was a stone carving of a baby which he acquired in 1886 from the <b>Higashi</b> Honganji temple at Kyoto. It was not appropriate for him to take home one of these stone babies which were images intended to bring luck to childless women, but Clayton convinced the jūshoku to allow him to have one, after insisting that he was not a missionary. So in 1887 yet another image of a baby was added to the number already in Bankfield House's decorations while the childless Elizabeth Akroyd was still alive and her husband had died the same year.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the onset}} of the Meiji {{restoration}} period in 1868, wolves had a benign rather than noxious place in Japanese culture and folklore. Wolves were, however, occasionally hunted. Wolf bounties (shōkin) first appeared in Morioka where horse predation by wolves was frequent. Domain lords would pay 700 mon for males, and 900 for females, though peasants received much less. Wolves in Japan became extinct during the Meiji restoration period, an extermination known as ōkami no kujo. The wolf was deemed a threat to ranching which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. Starting August 1875, the Iwate Prefecture government offered bounties (shōreikin) of 7¥ for male wolves and 8 for females. In 1878 in Sapporo, it was decided to set higher bounties for wolves than bears in order to further motivate the ethnic Ainu people into killing wolves, which were once considered sacred to them. Hokkaido experienced significant development during this period and the Hokkaido wolf also suffered from resulting environmental disruption. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on 23 January 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called <b>Higashi</b> Yoshiro). The carcass was bought by a man working for the Duke of Bedford, and was subsequently put on display in the British Museum of Natural History.|$|E
