25|$|In {{a report}} by {{scientists}} commissioned by the ICC it was shown that Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar and Indian bowler R. P. Singh were seen to extend their <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> by a negative angle {{with respect to the}} upper arm. This phenomenon, also known as hyperextension, can give the illusion of throwing. In the report it was seen that R. P. Singh maintained this negative angle throughout his delivery stride, while Akhtar sometimes bowled a quicker delivery by flexing this hyperextension. These actions are not considered to be chucking as they are due to the distinctive architecture of their elbows, possibly a congenital condition. Since these cricketers have no control over this hyperextension, any degree of hyperextension (past zero) is not included in the 15 degree extension tolerance threshold.|$|E
500|$|When swimming, otariids rely {{on their}} fore-flippers for {{locomotion}} in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs of otariids are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> greater mechanical advantage; the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers. Phocids and walruses swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side, while their fore-flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species leap out of the water, which may allow then to travel faster. In addition, sea lions are known to [...] "ride" [...] waves, which probably helps them decrease their energy usage.|$|E
500|$|Semi-aquatic mammals, like pinnipeds, {{have two}} pairs of {{flippers}} {{on the front and}} back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body. Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it easier for them to slip through water. They also lack arrector pili, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim. They rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> greater mechanical advantage; the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers. Other semi-aquatic mammals include beavers, hippopotamuses, otters and platypuses. Hippos are very large semi-aquatic mammals, and their barrel-shaped bodies have [...] skeletal structures, adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Elbow</b> <b>joint</b> {{is one of}} the body's {{important}} joints, most of {{the activities}} of the human body are inseparable from the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint,</b> and including taking and holding movements. In order to increase the workspace of <b>elbow</b> <b>joint,</b> a novel <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> rehabilitation parallel robot based on 2 -DOF orthogonal spherical parallel mechanism is proposed. First, the position inverse solution equation of <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> is established. Further, the workspace of <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> is analyzed. The optimal structural parameters are obtained by use of the objective function of optimization method. Finally, the virtual prototype of <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> rehabilitation parallel robot is designed using optimal structural dimensions parameters...|$|R
40|$|Title: Methods of {{prevention}} in hyperextension {{trauma to the}} elbow of the handball goalkeeper. Objectives: The main objective of this thesis is {{to determine whether the}} muscle strengthening exercises stabilizers of the elbow affect the stability of the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> and also draw attention to the issue of hyperextension trauma to the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> of the handball goalkeeper. Another objective is to evaluate the possibility {{of prevention}} of hyperextension trauma to the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> of the handball goalkeeper. Methods: Rating angular deviations observed in the elbow before and after completing the intervention. Deviations were recorded using a 3 D analysis system Qualysis and were processed in software Qualisys Track Manager. Results: Strengthening the dynamic stabilizers of the elbow helps to improve stability of the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> load into hyperextension. Active exercise {{can be used as a}} possible prevention of hyperextension trauma to the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> of handball goalkeepers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the most {{effective}} ways of grip strength measurement in people who have dementia. 22 Alzhehimer's disease patients and 11 normal elderly women were tested in this study. Two types of dynamometers, the Smedley dynamometer (s-type) and the Jammer hand dynamometer (j-type), were used in this study. We examined s-type with <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> flexion, s-type with <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> extension and j-type with <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> flexion. We also considered of the relationship with swallowing disorder. As a result, Alzhehimer's disease patients have weaker grip strength, and subjects with low cognitive function are more susceptible to being influenced by the measurement techniques. There was a trend that with <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> extension, they had weaker grip strength than with <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> flexion. It suggests that visual information to see their hands when they manipulate the hand dynamometer is useful to measure the reliable grip strength of dementia. This result indicates using Smedley dynamometers with <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> flexion is a suitable way to measure grip strength in Alzhehimer's disease patients. Swallowing function also correlated with measurement grip strength among them...|$|R
500|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the forelimbs held struggling prey while it was killed by the tyrannosaur's enormous jaws. This hypothesis may be supported by biomechanical analysis. Tyrannosaurus rex forelimb bones exhibit extremely thick cortical bone, which have been interpreted as evidence that they were developed to withstand heavy loads. The biceps brachii muscle of an adult Tyrannosaurus rex was capable of lifting [...] by itself; other muscles such as the brachialis would work along with the biceps to make elbow flexion even more powerful. The M. biceps muscle of T.rex was 3.5 times as powerful as the human equivalent. A Tyrannosaurus rex forearm had a limited range of motion, with the shoulder and <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> allowing only 40 and 45 degrees of motion, respectively. In contrast, the same two joints in Deinonychus allow up to 88 and 130 degrees of motion, respectively, while a human arm can rotate 360 degrees at the shoulder and move through 165 degrees at the elbow. The heavy build of the arm bones, strength of the muscles, and limited range of motion may indicate a system evolved to hold fast despite the stresses of a struggling prey animal. In the first detailed scientific description of Tyrannosaurus forelimbs, paleontologists Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith dismissed notions that the forelimbs were useless or that Tyrannosaurus rex was an obligate scavenger.|$|E

50|$|An armlock in {{grappling}} is {{a single}} or double joint lock that hyperextends, hyperflexes or hyperrotates the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> or shoulder joint. An armlock that hyperflexes or hyperrotates the shoulder joint {{is referred to as}} a shoulder lock, and an armlock that hyperextends the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> is called an armbar. Depending on the joint flexibility of a person, armlocks that hyperrotate the shoulder joint can also hyperrotate the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint,</b> and vice versa.|$|R
2500|$|In human anatomy, the biceps, also biceps brachii (...) , is a two-headed muscle {{that lies}} on the upper arm between the {{shoulder}} and the elbow. Both heads arise on the scapula and join to form a single muscle belly which {{is attached to the}} upper forearm. While the biceps crosses both the shoulder and <b>elbow</b> <b>joints,</b> its main function is at the elbow where it flexes the forearm and supinates the forearm. [...] Both these movements are used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps unscrews the cork (supination), then it pulls the cork out (flexion).|$|E
2500|$|To become flippers, {{the limbs}} had changed considerably. The limbs were very large, each {{about as long}} as the trunk. The forelimbs and hindlimbs {{strongly}} resembled each other. The humerus in the upper arm, and the thighbone in the upper leg, had become large flat bones, expanded at their outer ends. The <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> and the knee joints were no longer functional: the lower arm and the lower leg could not flex in relation to the upper limb elements, but formed a flat continuation of them. All outer bones had become flat supporting elements of the flippers, tightly connected to each other and hardly able to rotate, flex, extend or spread. This was true of the ulna, radius, metacarpals and fingers, as well of the tibia, fibula, metatarsals and toes. Furthermore, in order to elongate the flippers, the number of phalanges had increased, up to eighteen in a row, a phenomenon called hyperphalangy. The flippers were not perfectly flat, but had a lightly convexly curved top profile, like an airfoil, to be able to [...] "fly" [...] through the water.|$|E
