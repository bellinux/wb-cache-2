5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, {{but it was not}} my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, {{drinking}} his mistress's health in Nantes brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E
25|$|I am very {{disappointed}} that {{this decision was}} not communicated to me personally {{but that it was}} faxed to my lawyers. I find it shameful that, after so many years of good cooperation and after all <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for the team, I am being treated as a fax number.|$|E
60|$|To {{say that}} I was {{astonished}} at what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> would not express my entire feelings. I was amazed, and could hardly credit my own eyesight. Yet there he lay, the blood {{flowing from the}} end of his nasal organ. He was completely knocked out, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> the deed. <b>I</b> did not fear for consequences. I felt justified in what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> But <b>I</b> wondered how Duncan would stand the punishment.|$|R

6000|$|Quilla made no answer, and I {{thought that}} she was angry and would go away. But she did not; indeed, she sat herself down upon the stone at my side and covered her face with her hands as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> and began to weep as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> Now in my turn I asked her: ...|$|R
25|$|I still {{care about}} {{everything}} I care about. But I don't {{know how to}} write another song about a greedy arsehole ruining the planet. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it. I started writing about the damage {{of war and the}} environment, but as you drill down deeper, move closer to the core of the heart, there are so many great stories to be had which aren't literally talking about a problem.|$|E
25|$|I {{confess to}} God Almighty, before the whole company of heaven, and to you, my {{brothers}} and sisters, that I have sinned in thought, word, and deed; in what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and in what I have failed to do, by my fault, by my fault, by my most grievous fault; wherefore I pray God Almighty to have mercy on me, forgive me all my sins, and bring me to everlasting life. Amen.|$|E
25|$|Let no man {{write my}} epitaph; for as no {{man who knows}} my motives dare now vindicate them, let not {{prejudice}} or ignorance, asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, and my memory in oblivion, until other times and other men can do justice to my character. When my country takes her place among {{the nations of the}} earth, then and not till then, let my epitaph be written. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
60|$|From Little Britain I went, with my {{check in}} my pocket, to Miss Skiffins's brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins's brother, the accountant, going {{straight}} to Clarriker's and bringing Clarriker to me, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement.

25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My {{heart goes out to}} my family at a time like this. Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions down my throat – no one.|$|E
25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> already.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

60|$|On the morrow I {{resolved}} to leave Toulouse--to quit this province wherein so much had befallen me and repair to Beaugency, there {{to grow old}} in misanthropical seclusion. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with Courts, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with love and with women; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> it seemed to me, with life itself. Prodigal had it been in gifts that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not sought of it. It had spread my table with the richest offerings, but they had been little to my palate, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nauseated quickly. And now, when here in this remote corner of France it had shown me the one prize <b>I</b> coveted, it <b>had</b> been swift to place it beyond my reach, thereby sowing everlasting discontent and misery in my hitherto pampered heart.|$|R

[...] When asked about the Poverty Subcommittee's findings, Clark said that more {{resources}} needed to be allocated to the War on Poverty. He also said that the United States needed a [...] "reawakening of a conscience." [...] The entire subcommittee sent a letter to President Lyndon B. Johnson about their discoveries, writing about [...] "conditions of malnutrition and widespread hunger...that {{can only be described as}} shocking." ...|$|E

500|$|After its {{publication}} {{he wrote to}} his aunt Maria Clemm saying, [...] "I have no desire to live since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> Eureka. I could accomplish nothing more."

500|$|In a 1926 article {{written for}} the NEA News Service, he responded to those who asked him how the [...] "Shaughnessy System" [...] worked so well. He said, [...] "If there is a 'Shaughnessy system' at Tulane, if it has any 'secret,' two words tell the whole story—common sense.

500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: [...] "Whatever <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done...</b> getting hooked on heroin {{is not one of}} them." [...] He {{explained}} that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with.
