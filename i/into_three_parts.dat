5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav left Rus' again, {{dividing}} his dominion <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts,</b> each under {{a nominal}} rule {{of one of}} his sons. At the head of an army that included Pecheneg and Magyar auxiliary troops, he invaded Bulgaria again, devastating Thrace, capturing the city of Philippopolis, and massacring its inhabitants. Nikephoros responded by repairing the defenses of Constantinople and raising new squadrons of armored cavalry. In the midst of his preparations, Nikephoros was overthrown and killed by John Tzimiskes, who thus became the new Byzantine emperor.|$|E
5|$|Jo-ha-kyū is {{incorporated}} in traditional five-play program of Noh. The first play is jo, the second, third, and fourth plays are ha, and the fifth play is kyū. In fact, the five categories discussed below were created so that the program would represent jo-ha-kyū when one play from each category is selected and performed in order. Each play can be broken <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts,</b> the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. A play starts out in a slow tempo at jo, gets slightly faster at ha, then culminates in kyū.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} Saturday afternoon was split <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts.</b> The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 18th or lower. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver {{set a time}} within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 17. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position.|$|E

The eastern section {{of the house was}} demolished in 1850, but reconstructed in the mid-1950s for office use. Buckingham House was the London residence of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos. It was rebuilt in the 1790s by Sir John Soane and sold by the Buckingham estate in 1847. The house was demolished in 1908 {{to make way for the}} Royal Automobile Club.|$|E
5|$|Candide {{contains}} thirty episodic chapters, {{which may}} be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions, separated by the protagonist's hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, {{the first half of}} Candide constitutes the rising action and the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels, which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts</b> each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in the Americas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.|$|E
5|$|Geologically the East Riding {{district}} is split <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts.</b> The western {{part is the}} eastern section of the Vale of York with the southern extension into the Humberhead Levels. In this area there is a belt of sandstones overlain by glacial and lake deposits formed {{at the close of}} the last ice age. The middle part is the Yorkshire Wolds, a chalk formation which extends from the Humber at North Ferriby to the coast at Flamborough Head, a chalk headland. The south-east of the {{district is}} the low-lying coastal plain of Holderness, which faces east to the North Sea, and to the south drains into the Humber estuary. South of Flamborough Head is Bridlington, which features several beaches, and at the far south-east of the district is the Spurn peninsula.|$|E

5|$|No Game No Life was {{conceived}} during the serialization of A Dark Rabbit Has Seven Lives. Kamiya's original idea was a fantasy setting with battles; since he disliked drawing battles, he {{replaced it with}} games. He had intended to turn the idea into a manga series, but an unspecified illness made him unfit to handle the workload. While hospitalized for treatment, the author imagined how his idea would work as a light novel, and settled for that medium instead. Kamiya began writing the first volume and was advised to break it <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts</b> due to its length. In the middle of writing the second volume, Kamiya moved to his home country, Brazil, for further treatment for his ailment; {{in order to meet}} the volume's deadline, his wife drew some of the illustrations in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Phase I's {{flagship}} project was the 63rd Street–Southeast Queens line, which would stretch {{from the existing}} 57th Street subway station in Midtown Manhattan to the existing Laurelton LIRR station in Springfield Gardens. The construction of this line was to be split up <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts.</b> The first part, Route 131–A, would run from Sixth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan below 63rd Street and the East River to Northern Boulevard. The next part, Route 131–B, the Super–Express Bypass Line, would continue along the LIRR right-of-way to Forest Hills. And finally, Route 131–D, the Southeastern Queens Line, would build {{a branch of the}} Queens Boulevard Line at Briarwood through Downtown Jamaica to Springfield Gardens via the LIRR's Atlantic Branch, with a ramp to eliminate the Jamaica Avenue elevated structure in Downtown Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{got under}} way on Saturday {{afternoon}} with new rules in place. Just as in years before, the qualifying procedure was divided <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts,</b> with the first part (Q1) running for 16 minutes and {{the second and third}} parts (Q2 and Q3) being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively. All twenty-two cars contested the first part, with seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3. However, in a change of rules, drivers were now eliminated during the session, with the slowest runner at a given point being taken out from contention every ninety seconds, beginning seven minutes into Q1, six minutes into Q2 and five minutes into Q3.|$|E

The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. The session was held in dry weather conditions but dark clouds meant that there was a risk of further rain showers. With limited dry running in the final practice session grip, levels rose as qualifying progressed.|$|E

5|$|The {{successes of}} the 1st Ukrainian Front during the first nine days of the battle meant that by 25 April, they were occupying large swathes of the area south and {{south-west}} of Berlin. Their spearheads had met elements of the 1st Belorussian Front west of Berlin, completing the investment of the city. Meanwhile, the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army in 1st Ukrainian Front made contact with the 69th Infantry Division (United States) of the United States First Army near Torgau, on the Elbe River. These manoeuvres had broken the German forces south of Berlin <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts.</b> The German IX Army was surrounded in the Halbe pocket. Wenck's XII Army, obeying Hitler's command of 22 April, was attempting to force its way into Berlin from the south-west but met stiff resistance from 1st Ukrainian Front around Potsdam. Schörner's Army Group Centre was forced {{to withdraw from the}} Battle of Berlin, along its lines of communications towards Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} the Venetians {{decided to send}} troops against the Ottoman advances. Skanderbeg {{gathered}} 13,400 men, among whom were many Venetians, to launch {{an assault on the}} Ottoman besieging camp, who had taken command once Mehmed left Albania after the construction of Elbasan. Skanderbeg had split his army <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts</b> and surrounded the besiegers. Ballaban was killed during the fighting and the Ottoman forces were left without a commander and a depleted force which was surrounded. Afterwards the Albanian-Venetian forces completed the rout by killing the remaining Ottoman forces before they could escape by way of Dibër. The victory was well received by both Albanians and Italians. This did not signal the end of the war, however, as soon after, Skanderbeg took up some assaults on Elbasan after being urged to by Venice, but was not able to take the fortress due to lack of artillery. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors, which led Mehmed to begin another campaign against the Albanians. This would result in another siege on Krujë.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time as the group was {{rejected}} by Nintendo, Romero was approached by Scott Miller of Apogee Software, who wanted him to publish more levels for his previous Pyramids of Egypt—an adventure game where the player navigates mazes while avoiding Egyptian-themed traps and monsters—through Apogee's shareware model. Miller was pioneering a model of game publishing where part of a game would be released for free, with the remainder of the game available for purchase from Apogee. Romero said he could not, as Pyramids of Egypt was owned by Softdisk, but that it did not matter as the game he was now working on was much better, and sent Miller the Mario demo. Miller was impressed, and the Ideas from the Deep agreed to create a new game for Apogee before Christmas of 1990—only a few months away—split <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts</b> to match Apogee's shareware model of giving away the first part for free to attract interest in the whole. Hall suggested a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme, and developed a short introduction that convinced the team to make Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand's opponents, under Piccinino's main command, {{tried to}} open battle with Skanderbeg, but due to the {{combined}} strength of Albanian and Neapolitan forces, they withdrew from the Andrian fields to Acquaviva delle Fonti. News of Piccinino's retreat reached Venice who {{sent a message to}} Francisco Sforza. Skanderbeg then marched to Taranto, where Giovanni Orsini was prince. Orsini tried again to dissuade Skanderbeg from marching against him, but Ferdinand was wary of Orsini's faithfulness, so Skanderbeg continued raiding Orsini's territory. He split his army <b>into</b> <b>three</b> <b>parts,</b> one under Moisi Arianit Golemi, the other under Vladan Gjurica, and the last under his command. He led attacks against Ferdinand's enemies in three directions without halt, thoroughly exhausting them. During the month of October, Skanderbeg continued to pillage Orisini's territory from his bases at Barletta and Andria since the Angevins were not present; Ferdinand meanwhile mopped up in Calabria, where he recaptured Cosenza and Castrovillari. At this point, Orsini asked Skanderbeg for a truce which the Albanian rejected. On 27 October, Skanderbeg reported that he had captured the town of Gisualdo. Piccinino then asked Skanderbeg to discontinue his campaign which Skanderbeg exuberantly accepted, believing that peace was near.|$|E
