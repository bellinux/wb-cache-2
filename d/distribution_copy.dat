40|$|Video {{content is}} quite unique from its storage {{footprint}} perspective. In a video distribution environment, a master video file {{needs to be}} transcoded into different resolutions, bitrates, codecs and containers to enable distribution {{to a wide variety}} of devices and media players over different kinds of networks. Our experiments show that when 8 mas-ter videos are transcoded into most popular 376 formats (derived from 8 resolutions and 6 containers), transcoded versions occupy 8 times more storage than the master video. One major challenge with efficiently storing such con-tent is that traditional de-duplication algorithms cannot detect significant duplication between any 2 versions. Trans-coding on-the-fly is a technique in which a <b>distribution</b> <b>copy</b> is created only when requested by a user. This technique saves storage but at the expense of extra compute cost and latency resulting from transcoding after a user request is received. In this paper we develop cost metrics that allow us to compare storage vs. compute costs and suggest when a transcoding on-the-fly solution can be cost effective. We also analyze how such a solution can be deployed in a practical storage system using access pattern information or a variant of ski-rent [1] online algorithm when such in-formation is not available. 1...|$|E

Two anomalous measurements were noticed in data for borehole UZ- 14 during {{a comparison of the}} published data with that in DTN GS 931208314211. 049, and with the original borehole logs.

40|$|Sorting {{has long}} been used to {{organize}} data in preparation for further computation, but sort computation allows some types of computation to be performed during the sort. Sort aggregation and sort distribution are the two basic forms of sort computation.

An aggregate operation can be any operation that is both associative and commutative, i. e., any operation whose result does not depend on the order of the operands or the order in which the operations are performed.
