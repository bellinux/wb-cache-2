5|$|<b>España,</b> Alfonso XIII, and Jaime I {{served in}} the 1st Squadron of the Spanish Fleet, which became the Training Squadron in the 1920s. They all saw action during the Rif War in the early 1920s {{supporting}} Spanish ground forces in North Africa. <b>España</b> ran aground in August 1923 and the Navy could not salvage her; she instead broke up under tidal forces. Alfonso XIII was renamed <b>España</b> in 1931 after her namesake, King Alfonso XIII was forced into exile. The two surviving ships served {{on opposite sides of}} the Spanish Civil War, and both were destroyed during the conflict. <b>España</b> struck a naval mine laid by her own side in on 30 April 1937 and sank, and Jaime I was destroyed by an internal explosion in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|The Navy Law of 7 January 1908 {{authorized}} {{construction of}} <b>España.</b> She was laid {{down at the}} Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval shipyard in Ferrol on 6 December 1909. She was launched on 5 February 1912, and completed on 23 October 1913. After their completion, <b>España</b> and her sisters, Alfonso XIII and Jaime I, the three battleships formed the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Spain remained neutral after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, so <b>España</b> and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war. In mid-1915, <b>España</b> crossed the Atlantic to represent Spain at the opening ceremonies for the Panama Canal. Since the major European navies were occupied with World War I, only Spain and Portugal sent ships to the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|<b>España</b> {{served in}} the 1st Squadron after her commissioning, along with her two sisters. Spain {{remained}} neutral during World War I, so the Spanish fleet did not see action during the conflict. <b>España</b> provided gunfire support during the Rif War in the early 1920s. During these operations, she ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas, Morocco in August 1923. The Navy was unable to raise the ship, and severe storms destroyed the wreck in 1924, which led the Navy to abandon her.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{after the}} {{overthrow}} of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake battleship was renamed <b>España.</b> In the mid-1930s, the Spanish Navy considered modernization programs for the two surviving battleships, but none came to fruition, primarily {{as a result of}} the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The two ships found themselves on opposite sides during the conflict; <b>España</b> served on the side of Francisco Franco's Nationalists, and Jaime I fought for the Republicans. <b>España</b> was used for coastal bombardment and to enforce the blockade of Republican ports, while Jaime I unsuccessfully attempted to disrupt the blockade, though neither ship engaged the other. In August 1936, Jaime I was attacked and moderately damaged by Nationalist bombers; while undergoing repairs in Cartagena, she was destroyed by an internal explosion in June 1937. <b>España</b> was sunk on 30 April 1937 after striking a mine laid by her own side off the coast of Santander in northern Spain.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the guns}} from the first <b>España</b> were {{recovered}} and employed in coastal fortifications, some of which remained in service until 1999. Six of Jaime Is 12-inch guns were also salvaged and similarly employed after she was broken up in the 1940sthey too remained in service until they were decommissioned in the mid-1990s. The second <b>España</b> was never raised, and her wreck was discovered in the early 1980s. Several expeditions to survey the wreck took place between February and May 1984.|$|E

5|$|As a Professional Continental team, Cofidis {{needed to}} be {{selected}} by the organizers {{of any of the}} Grand Tours in order to participate. They were selected to ride the Tour de France and the Vuelta a <b>España,</b> but not the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|Avuis Adrian R. Huber {{believed}} that Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, Adriano Baffi, and Fabio Baldato {{had a great}} {{chance to win a}} stage in the race. Notable sprinter Mario Cipollini did not participate in the race as he was still recovering from injuries sustained in the second stage at the Vuelta a <b>España.</b>|$|E
5|$|Euskaltel-Euskadi has {{in their}} history been reticent to ride the Giro d'Italia, favoring the Tour de France and the Vuelta a <b>España</b> instead. After first {{indicating}} a reluctant willingness to participate as per the requirements of holding a ProTeam license, the team later stated that they intended to seek overall victory in the race with Antón. Antón was named {{as the leader of}} the squad, which included Nieve, Oroz, Isasi, Aramendía, Azanza, Cazaux, Sesma and Minguez to ride in support. Antón tempered the expectations somewhat, saying that a stage win would be nice, as would General Classification success should it come, but that he was only banking on riding for the overall at the Vuelta a <b>España.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{ended his}} first season at Barcelona by winning the 2011–12 Copa del Rey, 2011 Supercopa de <b>España,</b> 2011 UEFA Super Cup and the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, {{notching}} 15 goals and 20 assists in 48 appearances and four best midfielder awards.|$|E

5|$|Messi {{opened the}} 2017–18 season by {{converting}} a penalty in Barcelona's 1–3 first leg home defeat to Real Madrid in Supercopa de <b>España.</b> Thereby, Messi also extended his El Clásico goalscoring record {{with the goal}} being his 24th official and 25th overall.|$|E
5|$|Outside fences in <b>España</b> avenue were {{completely}} covered with tall sawali (woven bamboo matting), while the concrete walls on all other {{sides of the}} Campus remained high, preventing view between the internees and the outside world. The years of Japanese occupation were years of great suffering for the internees.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2012 Tour, Wiggins's highest {{finishes}} in a Grand Tour were {{third in the}} 2011 Vuelta a <b>España</b> and fourth in the 2009 Tour (later promoted to third after Lance Armstrong's result was annulled in October 2012). Wiggins had shown his form in the lead-up to the Tour by winning the general classifications in three stage races in the 2012 season: the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie and the Dauphiné. As a time trialist, Wiggins {{was thought to be}} the rider most suited to the race's course. The 2011 Tour winner Evans came back from an illness earlier in the season to win the two-day Critérium International and place third at the Dauphiné. The 2010 Vuelta a <b>España</b> winner Nibali had shown his form in the lead-up to the Tour by winning the Tirreno–Adriatico stage race.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} <b>España</b> {{in an attempt to}} lighten her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from <b>España</b> were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed <b>España</b> in April 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} one of 22 to receive an invite to the Vuelta a <b>España.</b> After having first been named only as a reserve, the {{returning}} Alexander Vinokourov {{was named to the}} squad five days before the race began.|$|E

5|$|Though spokespeople for {{the team}} first denied any plans to sign Armstrong, Bruyneel commented two days later during the then-ongoing Vuelta a <b>España</b> that he had spoken to Armstrong about his return, and could not imagine him riding for any team but Astana. On September 24, Armstrong signed with Astana.|$|E
5|$|A second Navy Law {{was passed}} in 1912 named the Plan de la Segunda Escuadra (Second Squadron Plan). It called for, among several other ships, three dreadnoughts to {{supplement}} the <b>España</b> class. These dreadnoughts were named the Reina Victoria Eugenia class. They were to be in laid down in 1914 and 1915 and completed around 1920.|$|E
5|$|After Mission San Fernando Rey de <b>España</b> was {{established}} in 1797, the administrators there realized they would need more land for agriculture and livestock, and they looked north to the Santa Clarita Valley to establish their estancia, or mission rancho. Subsequently, the Tataviam who had been living there were relocated to the Mission, where they were baptized and put to work. The Estancia de San Francisco Xavier was built in 1804 at the confluence of Castaic Creek and the Santa Clara River.|$|E

Barça finished the season by beating the previous year's Champions League winners Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win their third Champions League title and completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish team. The team {{went on to win}} the 2009 Supercopa de <b>España</b> against Athletic Bilbao and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk, becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble.

5|$|<b>España</b> was {{the only}} member of the class {{completed}} by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, though she did not see action, as Spain remained neutral for the duration of the war. In August 1914, she participated in the opening ceremonies for the Panama Canal. Alfonso XIII joined her in August 1915 in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. In late 1921, Jaime I was finally completed. Throughout the early 1920s, the three ships served in the Training Squadron. During this period, Spain became involved in the Rif War in Morocco; all three ships saw action during the conflict, primarily by providing artillery support to Spanish ground forces engaging the Rif rebels. In August 1923, while bombarding Rif positions, <b>España</b> ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas. A lengthy salvage operation failed to free the ship, and in November 1924, the stress of repeated tidal battering broke the wreck in half.|$|E
5|$|He {{restarted}} {{competition at}} the Vuelta a <b>España,</b> aiming to regain his form for the world championships.
