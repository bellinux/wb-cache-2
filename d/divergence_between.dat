40|$|This work {{presents}} a parametrized family of divergences, namely Alpha-Beta Log- Determinant (Log-Det) <b>divergences,</b> <b>between</b> positive definite unitized trace class operators on a Hilbert space. This is a generalization of the Alpha-Beta Log-Determinant <b>divergences</b> <b>between</b> symmetric, positive definite matrices to the infinite-dimensional setting. The family of Alpha-Beta Log-Det divergences is highly general and contains many divergences as special cases, including the recently formulated infinite dimensional affine-invariant Riemannian distance and the infinite-dimensional Alpha Log-Det <b>divergences</b> <b>between</b> positive definite unitized trace class operators. In particular, {{it includes a}} parametrized family of metrics between positive definite trace class operators, with the affine-invariant Riemannian distance and the square root of the symmetric Stein divergence being special cases. For the Alpha-Beta Log-Det <b>divergences</b> <b>between</b> covariance operators on a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), we obtain closed form formulas via the corresponding Gram matrices.

5|$|The {{three primary}} {{branches}} of Crocodilia had diverged {{by the end}} of the Mesozoic.

Although the first known crocodyloids appeared in the Maastrichtian (around 72.1–66.0 million years ago), that lineage must have been present during the Campanian, and the earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms, which indicates that the time of the actual <b>divergence</b> <b>between</b> the three lineages must have been a pre-Campanian event.|$|E

5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic <b>divergence</b> <b>between</b> populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55mya) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older <b>divergence</b> <b>between</b> lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.|$|E

5|$|Pacific {{populations of}} the false {{catshark}} were once regarded as a separate species, P. acrales. However, morphological comparisons have failed to find any consistent differences between P. microdon and P. acrales, leading {{to the conclusion that}} there is only one species of false catshark. The closest relatives of the false catshark are the gollumsharks (Gollum). Pseudotriakis and Gollum share a number of morphological similarities. Phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes has found that the amount of genetic <b>divergence</b> <b>between</b> these taxa is less than that between some other shark species within the same genus. This result suggests that the many autapomorphies (unique traits) of the false catshark evolved relatively recently, and supports the grouping of Pseudotriakis and Gollum together in the family Pseudotriakidae.|$|E

Wilson's majority, albeit slim, denied Thorpe the role of kingmaker, leaving the Liberals without a clear role; as Dutton observes, apart from being neither Conservative or Labour, the Liberals lacked a distinctive identity and their policies were largely unknown to the public. A further problem for the party was the <b>divergence</b> <b>between</b> its activists, who were radicals well {{to the left of the}} official party, and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled Conservatives.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public.

Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the <b>divergence</b> <b>between</b> the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments.

5|$|Lice {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, Pediculus and Pthirus: head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis), body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis), and pubic lice (Pthirus pubis). Human head and body lice (genus Pediculus) share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus Pthirus) share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that Pediculus and Pthirus are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same common ancestor. The age of <b>divergence</b> <b>between</b> Pediculus and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, host-parasite cospeciation events are likely.|$|E
5|$|Many colonists, however, had {{developed}} a different conception of the empire.

After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all. Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth, by 1774 American writers such as Samuel Adams, James Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.|$|E
