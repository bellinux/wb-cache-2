40|$|The Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety) Regulations 1988 is {{the major}} driver {{for the use of}} {{chemical}} flame retardants (FRs) in soft furnishings marketed in the UK. While these regulations specify the level of flame retardancy required, they do not specify how such levels should be achieved. Consequently, it remains unclear which FRs are present in UK soft furnishings. This is important not only to help assess what FRs we may be exposed to currently, but which FRs are currently entering the waste stream with concomitant potential for release into the environment. To address this data gap, concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> and a range of chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were measured in samples of domestic and office waste soft furnishings products entering the UK waste stream in 2011 and 2012. This preliminary study measured the FR content of: carpets (n = 4), curtains (n = 7), mattress fabrics (n = 2), furniture foam (n = 9), and furniture upholstery textiles (n = 10). Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> were not found at significant concentrations (below detection limits in most samples) in any of the twenty two analysed products. In contrast, 7 of the 9 furniture foam samples were treated with tris(2 -chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) at a mean concentration of 1. 9 % w/w, with another single foam sample containing tris(1, 3 -dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) at 1. 1 and 0. 5 % respectively. By comparison, PBDE concentrations are within the range reported previously for UK indoor dust [18], rather than the percent by weight levels required to impart flame retardancy...|$|E

30|$|Within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) {{for some}} {{chemicals}} in biota (EQSbiota) have been set, and measures {{have to be}} taken by the member states if an EQS is exceeded [2]. The European Commission has strengthened the significance for monitoring bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms by amending the EQS directive in August 2013 [3]: The directive states that ‘very hydrophobic substances accumulate in biota and are hardly detectable in water even using the most advanced analytical techniques. For such substances, EQS should be set for biota‘. As a consequence, in addition to hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorobutadiene and mercury, EQSbiota have been set for eight new priority substances or substance groups. These include polybrominated diphenyl ethers, fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dicofol, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and its derivatives, dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD),</b> as well as heptachlor and heptachlorepoxide.

30|$|Some {{of those}} {{intentional}} chemical additives in plastics with toxic and {{endocrine disrupting properties}} might be present at levels of 1000 – 500, 000  mg/kg (ppm). This {{is the case of}} polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) used as flame retardants in plastics, polyurethane foams and textiles; tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) 14 [40], used as flame retardant in epoxy, vinyl esters and polycarbonate resins; or <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD),</b> used in polystyrene foam (EPS/XPS) or di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in PVC. It is also recognised that such chemicals can be found as particularly prominent contaminants in marine species collected from areas in which flame retardant-treated plastics are in use. For example, elevated HBCDD levels were found in oysters from aquaculture farms at which EPS/XPS buoys containing HBCDD were present [46]. The observation that high levels of the y-HBCDD isomer, which dominates commercial mixtures of this flame retardant [47, 48], can be detected in fish in some European waters [49], indicates that direct exposure to technical HBCDD present in the polymer matrix can also be a relevant exposure pathway for fish, as well as the wider environmental exposure to the more stable α-HBCDD.|$|E
30|$|To {{improve the}} {{detection}} of potential EA-EDs, we identified more structural alerts by systematic inspections of the chemical structures of substances with endocrine activity, for example, brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) and <b>hexabromocyclododecanes</b> (<b>HBCDDs)</b> that are antagonists in EA receptor-binding assays [22]. Furthermore, we looked for possible refinements of established structural alerts. The phenolic ring structure is {{an essential element of}} many EA-EDs; however, without further specifications it is not an indicative structural alert. Established “phenol” alerts explicitly address, for example, DES, biphenylols, or parabens [4, 5, 7].

Comparison with previous data, suggests that temporal trends in contamination with EFRs and legacy FRs reflect changes in production and use of such compounds as a result of bans and restrictions on the use of legacy FRs. Using inter alia a simple, single compartment, steady state pharmacokinetic model, human exposure to FRs via air inhalation, dust ingestion and diet was estimated for different age groups and the relative importance of each exposure route to overall exposure assessed under different exposure scenarios. Concentrations of target EFRs were detected for the first time in UK human milk samples (n= 35).

Characterization was completed using published chiral liquid chromatography (LC) methods and elution profiles, as well as X-ray crystallography, and the isolated fractions were definitively identified. Additionally, the resolution of the enantiomers, along with two minor components of the technical product (δ- and ε-HBCDD), was investigated on an analytical scale using both LC and pSFC separation techniques, and changes in elution order were highlighted. Baseline separation of all HBCDD enantiomers was achieved by pSFC on an analytical scale using a cellulose-based column.

This study has undertaken a large-scale investigation around an industrialized coastal area of China, exploring the concentrations, spatial distribution and diastereoisomer profiles of HBCDD in 188 surface soils from 21 coastal cities in North China. The detection frequency was 100 % and concentrations of total HBCDD in the surface soils ranged from 0. 123 to 363 ng g− 1 and averaged 7. 20 ng g− 1, showing its ubiquitous existence at low levels. The spatial distribution of HBCDD exhibited a correlation with the location of known manufacturing facilities in Weifang, suggesting the production of HBCDD as major emission source. Diastereoisomer profiles varied in different cities. Diastereoisomer compositions in soils were compared with emissions from HBCDD industrial activities, and correlations were found between them, which has the potential for source identification.

HBCDD has been mainly used in flame-retarded expanded (EPS) and extruded (XPS) polystyrene foams for insulation in the construction industry. Most of these products will become a part of the construction and demolition (C&D) waste at the end of their life cycle (30 - 50 years) which is typically disposed of into landfills or incineration. However, the recycling of this material takes quite a low share compared with landfill and incineration. Consequently, high environmental risks will exist in these disposal approaches due to the HBCDD in C&D waste. Currently, XPS or EPS products containing HBCDD in the construction industry have not reached the end of their life cycle in most countries. Relatively little attention has been paid to this emergency issue by either the government or public. Furthermore, C&D waste is most likely disposed of by direct dumping, simple stacking, or open burning in developing countries.

40|$|<b>Hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> is a {{brominated}} {{flame retardant}} (BFR) and major additive to polystyrene foam thermal insulation that has recently been listed as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention. During a 2013 / 2014 field analytical survey, we measured HBCDD content ranging from 0. 2 to 2. 4 % by weight in 98 polystyrene samples. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses indicated that expandable (EPS) and extruded (XPS) polystyrene foams significantly differed in the α/γ HBCDD isomer ratio, with a majority of α and γ isomers in XPS and EPS, respectively. Interestingly, this technique indicated that some recent materials did not contain HBCDD, but demonstrated bromine content when analysed with X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Further investigation by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was able to discriminate between the BFRs present. In addition to confirming the absence or presence of HBCDD in polystyrene samples, high-field NMR spectroscopy provided evidence {{of the use of}} brominated butadiene styrene (BBS) as copolymer in the production of polystyrene. Use of this alternative flame retardant is expected to cause fewer health and environmental concerns.

The pooled samples were covering the time period 1980 to 2004, with emphasis on samples from the last ten years. The temporal trend of PBDEs must be expressed on a congener basis since the development of the individual PBDE congener concentrations differ. BDE- 47, - 99 and - 100 concentrations reached a peak in the mid 1990 ’s and are now clearly showing decreasing levels.

HBCDD was quantified in all the individual eggs collected {{the last day of}} experiment at concentrations ranging between 0. 47 and 1361  ng g(- 1) fw, according to a lognormal distribution. The ingestion of XPS in degraded rearing buildings is thus a plausible cause of on-farm egg contamination by HBCDD which should be strictly avoided...|$|E
40|$|Although gas {{and liquid}} {{chromatography}} {{have emerged as}} dominant separation techniques in environmental analytical chemistry, these methods do not allow for the concurrent analysis of chemically diverse groups of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). There are also {{a small number of}} compounds which are not easily amenable to either of these traditional separation techniques. The main objective of this thesis was to address these issues by demonstrating the applicability of packed column supercritical fluid chromatography (pSFC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) in various aspects of environmental chemistry. First, pSFC/MS analytical methods were developed for legacy POPs (PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs) as well as the emerging environmental contaminant Dechlorane Plus (DP), and issues relating to the ionization of target analytes when pSFC was coupled to MS were explored. Novel APPI and APCI reagents (fluorobenzene and triethylamine) were optimized and real samples (water and soil) were analyzed to demonstrate environmental applicability. The possibility of chiral and preparative scale pSFC separations was then demonstrated through the isolation and characterization of thermally labile <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> stereoisomers. The analytical pSFC separation of the α-, β-, and γ-HBCDD enantiomers as well as the δ and ε meso forms was shown to be superior to results obtained using a published LC method. Finally, technical mixtures of phosphorus flame retardants (RBDPP, BPA-BDPP, and DOPO; a group of related compounds which are challenging to analyze concurrently) were examined using multiple analytical techniques and pSFC was found to be the only method which facilitated the accurate determination of the components of all 3 mixtures. This thesis confirms the potential of pSFC/MS as a fast, green, and cost effective means of separating and analyzing environmental contaminants...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} use of chemicals in countless consumer products has resulted in human exposure to several persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Sufficient knowledge about their chemical composition properties and environmental faith is required, {{to be able to}} proper risk assess and regulate the substances. Significant data gaps exist regarding knowledge of actual exposure to humans and toxicological effect data. The objective of this thesis was to add human exposure data of a few POPs from four case studies. The analytes discussed in this thesis are polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDDs/PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD).</b> Three European populations were studied. Milk was analysed from a group of women, who were accidentally exposed to high levels of 2, 3, 7, 8 -TetraCDD (TCDD) in Seveso, 1976. Still today, twice as high TCDD levels were recorded in the milk, compared to background concentrations. Serum was analysed from mothers and their infants from The Netherlands. Cord serum contained equal amounts of POPs as in mother’s blood, indicating non-hindered placenta transfer. Serum analysed from Swedish men and women with a high fish intake had elevated PCB and PCB metabolite (OH-PCB) levels. Additionally, butter was collected worldwide and shown to be a suitable matrix for dairy product survey of POPs. The exposure levels in the four papers were compared to recently reported exposure levels in Europe. It is indicated in the thesis that the PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs toxic equivalency (TEQ) levels are of concern, i. e. the ratio between threshold levels for adverse health effects and TEQ exposure levels is lower than requested margin of safety. Average levels of PBDE/HBCDD in the European population are estimated to be of no concern today, but for individuals with intakes at the 95 th percentile are the current margins of safety small...|$|E
40|$|The project "A {{comparative}} assessment of {{persistent organic pollutants}} and their metabolites, with emphasis on non-traditional contaminants, in the West-Nordic and the Baltic Proper environments (CAPNE) " {{was funded by the}} Nordic Council of Minister in the years 2004 to 2006. The aim was to analyse environmental pollution in guillemot (Uria aalge) eggs from the West-Nordic and compare to the Baltic Region to estimate the pollution burden in the biota. High levels of most chlorinated pollutants were found in the Baltic region where the major distribution pattern showed a 5 - 20 times higher concentrations of chlorinated compounds compared to locations in the West-Nordic, Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland. The exception was HCB, showing a more equal distribution between all sampling locations. Another exception is the bis(4 -chlorophenyl) sulfone (BCPS) with high levels in samples from the Baltic Region compared to almost non-detectable levels found in samples from the West-Nordic region. The polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) showed only a slightly different distribution pattern between the Baltic and the West-Nordic guillmot eggs, whereas the <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> is similar to the chlorinated compounds with major differences between the Baltic proper and West-Nordic locations. Methoxylated PBDEs, which mainly are considered to be naturally produced, were only detected in samples from the Baltic Region. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have a distribution pattern completely different from both chlorinated and brominated compounds and without any obvious relations within the group of perfluorinated compounds. Different groups, carboxyl acids, sulfonates and sulfoneamides, have different distribution pattern making it difficult to explain sources and emission. Two major questions need to be answered after this study, why is the HCB and PBDE distribution different from the other chlorinated or brominated compounds and which are the main sources and distribution routes of perfluorinated compounds. We would recomend further studies. adressing these questions in the West-Nordic...|$|E
40|$|The {{brominated}} {{flame retardant}} <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> was added to Annex A {{of the list of}} persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of the Stockholm Convention. Thus, production and use of HBCDD will be banned, and the recycling of HBCDD-containing foam waste will be restricted. In reaction a special polymeric {{brominated flame retardant}} (PolyFR) was developed to replace HBCDD in expanded and extruded polystyrene foams for building and construction applications. A decision has to be made at some future time whether expanded and extruded polystyrene foam waste is to be subjected to incineration (with HBCDD) or to recycling (without HBCDD). Therefore, an appropriate and rapid field method is required to distinguish between foams containing HBCDD and foams free from HBCDD. Here we present a screening method for identifying HBCDD containing expanded and extruded polystyrene foams. The test principle is {{based on the fact that}} PolyFR (a brominated polymeric macromolecule) is not extractable whereas HBCDD (a low molecular weight substance) is extractable. Following rapid extraction of HBCDD the brominated flame retardant is identified and quantified via bromine analysis using a handheld X-ray fluorescence instrument. The method was applied successfully to 27 expanded and extruded polystyrene foam samples (foams and extruded polystyrene foam raw materials), which were provided without any information about the applied flame retardant. The presence of HBCDD was confirmed for all HBCDD-positive samples in the test. A robustness test revealed a high degree of correctness and a high repeatability for the test system: samples containing HBCDD and HBCDD-free samples were identified correctly with relative standard deviations of quantitative results below 14 %. Moreover, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy test results agree well with HBCDD determinations performed in a laboratory with a gas chromatograph coupled to a flame ionisation detector...|$|E
40|$|The legacy {{flame retardants}} (LFRs) polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) and <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD),</b> together with six emerging flame retardants (EFRs) were measured in United Kingdom (UK) human milk collected in 2010 (n = 25) and 2014 – 15 (n = 10). These data {{are the first}} report {{of the presence of}} EFRs in UK human milk. The most abundant EFR was β-tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (DBE-DBCH) (average = 2. 5 ng/g lw; geometric mean = 1. 5 ng/g lw), which is comparable to the concentrations of the most abundant LFRs i. e. BDE 47 and α-HBCDD at 2. 8 and 2. 1 ng/g lw, respectively (geometric mean = 2. 1 and 1. 7). The estimated median dietary intake of ΣEFRs by UK nursing infants was 18 ng/kg bw/day. EFRs were also measured in UK foodstuffs with β-DBE-DBCH again the predominant compound detected, accounting – on average – for 64. 5 ± 23. 4 % of ΣEFRs. Average estimated dietary intakes of ∑ EFRs in the UK were 89 and 26 ng/day (1. 3 and 2. 6 ng/body weight/day) for adults and toddlers, respectively. Concentrations of Σtri-hexa BDEs in our UK food samples exceeded those reported in UK samples from the same food categories collected in 2003 – 04 and 2006. Despite this and our recent report elsewhere of significant temporal declines in concentrations of BDE 209 in UK indoor dust (p 0. 05) were observed between concentrations of Σtri-hexa BDEs, BDE 209 and HBCDDs in human milk sampled in 2010 and those obtained in 2014 – 15.

40|$|The remote sub-Arctic/Arctic {{environment}} has due to human activities become a sink for organohalogen contaminants (OHCs). These OHC include traditional contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDTs and technical mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), all {{included in the}} Stockholm Convention list of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Other OHCs, currently under evaluation to be included among the POPs i. e. short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> are also found in these environments {{as well as a}} whole range of other OHCs. The main objective of this thesis is to increase the knowledge about the presence of OHCs in a high trophic Arctic shark species, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus). The Greenland shark is an opportunistic feeder, occasionally feeding {{at the top of the}} Arctic marine food chain. Furthermore may this species have a life span in excess of 100 years and is probably among the oldest of any fish species. These traits make the shark prone to accumulate elevated concentrations of OHCs. This has shown to be true for the Greenland sharks studied and most of the targeted OHCs were determined in the species. The highest concentrations were observed for the DDTs, ranging up to 26 μg/g fat. Other OHCs reported that are of special interest are SCCPs and brominated flame retardants used as replacement products to PBDEs; pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) and 1, 2 -bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE). Also a range of OHCs whose origin is assumed to be natural, were shown to be present in Greenland sharks. This thesis is stressing the fact that even though the use of certain OHCs has been banned for decades they are still present at high concentrations in the deep waters of the Arctic. Therefore it is of major importance to continue to monitor the fate of traditional and emerging OHCs in the environment, and for this purpose the Greenland shark is an excellent species.

40|$|Adding {{chemicals}} to materials to decrease flammability can be dated back to {{as early as}} 450 BC when the Egyptians used alum to reduce flammability of wood. Almost 2500 years later brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are used to prevent ignition of textiles, electronics and polymers. BFRs in major use today are polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), including derivatives. There have been three industrial PBDE mixtures produced. Extensive scientific reporting has shown increasing concentrations of PBDEs in wildlife and in humans. This in combination with reports on their physico-chemical characteristics and chemical reactivity have led to {{that two of the}} PBDE products have been classified as being persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, which has led to legislative measures, in e. g. EU, Norway and the USA. The availability of pure reference standards is a prerequisite for much toxicologically related research. Hence the main objective of this thesis was to develop additional methods for synthesis of highly brominated diphenyl ethers. Further, to quantify and identify photolysis products of decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) and to perform a case study regarding PBDE exposure in aircrafts. Synthesis of highly brominated BDE congeners by perbromination of mono- or diaminodiphenyl ethers followed by diazotization of the amino group(s) and introduction of hydrogen(s) in the molecules is a convenient route for synthesis of some octaBDEs and all nonaBDEs. Selective bromination of diaminodiphenyl ether, followed by diazotization of the amino groups and substitution with bromines yielded a hexaBDE or a heptaBDE which were then further brominated to octaBDE congeners. Even though several studies have been performed on photolysis of decaBDE a new study with a more quantitative approach was performed as part of this thesis. Debrominated PBDE products were identified and quantified and a marker PBDE for UV degradation of DecaBDE was identified i. e., 2, 2 ’, 3, 3 ’, 5, 5 ’, 6, 6 -octabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 202). Polybrominated dibenzofuranes, methoxlated brominated dibenzofuranes, pentabromophenol and hydroxylated bromobenzenes were also detected. The PBDEs accounted for approximately 90 % of the total amount of substances in each sample and the PBDFs for about 10 %. Also, a case study on potential exposure to PBDEs in humans travelling long distances by aircraft was done. It was shown that PBDE concentrations in dust onboard aircrafts may be high and increased PBDE serum levels were indicated in a majority of the travellers. The present thesis has contributed to make higher brominated diphenyl ethers available as reference standards, allowing better quantitative assessments possible regarding both abiotic studies and exposure assessments. New toxicological testing can also be pursued...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study collates and synthesises UK data on {{environmental}} levels of POP-BFRs published between 1999 and March 2015. Target POP-BFRs are: the {{polybrominated diphenyl ether}} (PBDE) formulations Penta-BDE, Octa-BDE, and Deca-BDE (the latter as a candidate Stockholm Convention POP), as well as <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD).</b> Environmental compartments covered include: sediments (freshwater and marine), atmospheric deposition (both measured directly and inferred from sediment core data), soil, herbage, outdoor air, indoor air, indoor dust, freshwater (rivers and lakes), human tissues (blood serum and milk), wildlife, and the human diet. Temporal trends in contamination were examined for evidence of environmental responses to regulatory and voluntary actions banning/restricting the manufacture and use of POP-BFRs. Good evidence exists that – with some exceptions – concentrations of Penta-BDE congeners like BDEs- 47 and 99 have responded well to the use restrictions introduced in the mid- 2000 s. However, it appears that human body burdens of these contaminants {{do not appear to}} have responded in a similar way, as levels in UK human milk in 2010 – 2012, are not discernibly different to those reported in 2002 – 03. The evidence for HBCDD and BDEs- 183 and 209 is less abundant, but signs exist that absolute concentrations of BDE- 183 are falling in the UK environment. With respect to BDE- 209, evidence from analysis of lake sediment core and UK diet samples, suggests that levels have yet to respond discernibly to the more recent curbs on manufacture and use of Deca-BDE. The limited evidence for HBCDD is strongly consistent with a declining trend in environmental contamination with this chemical. Broadly, examination of the UK database in an international context, suggests UK levels are generally within the range of those found in other industrialised countries. Interestingly, while UK concentrations of BDE- 209 in abiotic matrices such as indoor dust, are at the high end of those reported globally; concentrations in UK human milk are amongst the lowest reported to date. This suggests that the bioavailability of BDE- 209 from indoor dust is likely very low. An environmental budget was estimated for the UK burden of POP-BFRs. As with previous comparable exercises for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated dioxins, the majority (> 90 %) of the UK burden of POP-BFRs resides in soil. Moreover, the POP-BFR burden identifiable as present in the UK environment is much lower than data on production and use of POP-BFRs in Europe. This may be explained by POP-BFRs: (a) undergoing environmental transport away from the UK; (b) undergoing environmental degradation; (c) remaining in use; and (d) entering the waste stream. While the UK database appears relatively strong for some environmental compartments and POP-BFRs – e. g. BDEs- 47 and - 99 are well-characterised in the human diet, indoor air/dust, and human milk – substantial gaps exist for BDE- 209 and HBCDD in air (indoor and outdoor), herbage, and soil...|$|E
40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} are {{a diverse group}} of chemicals, whose common points are that they all contain bromine and are all use to retard the {{combustibility}} of commercial goods. Two substances &# 8211; decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaDBE) and Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBP-A; this will be the subject of a separate Background Document) &# 8211; account for about 50 % of world use of brominated flame retardants. Two other polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PolyBDE) &# 8211; octabromodiphenyl ether (OctaDBE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (PentaDBE) &# 8211; are used commercially, but in much smaller quantities than DecaBDE. <b>Hexabromocyclododecane</b> (<b>HBCDD)</b> is also used in large volumes. Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) have also been used, but production was stopped in September 2000. Some PolyBDE are toxic, especially those with smaller molecules. PentaDBE may disrupt the oestrogenic system. PBB have similar effects to polychlorinated biphenyls, and may also produce hypothyroidism. Some of these chemicals are bioaccumulated. Brominated flame retardants were given priority in the 1992 OSPAR Action Plan, and therefore included in 1998 in the List of Chemicals for Priority Action. The quantities of PolyBDE used in the EU in 1994 were estimated as: DecaBDE (8 210 tonnes) as a general-purpose flame retardant, especially in polymers, polypropylene fabric and other textiles (other than clothing fabrics); OctaBDE (2 550 tonnes) in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastics (often used for casings of electrical and electronic equipment), nylon and other plastics and in adhesives and coatings; PentaBDE (125 tonnes) mainly in flexible polyurethane foam for furniture, as well as epoxy and phenolic resins, some polyesters and textiles. About 9 200 tonnes of HBCDD was used in the EU in 1999, 85 % of it in polystyrene. Since the products containing these chemicals are widely dispersed, their possible release from waste disposal routes may be of concern, together with their potential role in producing dioxins and furans during waste incineration. The degradation of DecaBDE to the more toxic and bioaccumulative lower levels of PolyBDE is also of concern. The overwhelming majority of samples of marine biota have not shown detectable quantities of DecaBDE; however, OctaBDE has been found in fish and molluscs (up to 325 &# 956;g/kg wet weight) and PentaBDE has been found in fish and marine mammals (up to 7 700 &# 956;g/kg in white-beaked dolphins). All these chemicals have been found in river or marine sediments. Action so far has been mainly through voluntary commitments by industry {{within the framework of the}} OECD. The risk assessment for PentaBDE under the EC existing substances regulation has concluded that risk reduction measures are needed. The PolyBDEs are proposed to be included as priority hazardous substances in the list of priority substances under the EC Water Framework Directive. The action recommended is: to support the inclusion of PBB in the draft EC Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment; to support early EC harmonised restrictions on PentaBDE; to await the completion of the EC risk assessment of OctaBDE, DecaBDE and HBCDD and seek appropriate risk-reduction strategies in the light of it; to support appropriate provision on PolyBDE in the draft EC Directives on Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment and on Restrictions on Certain Hazardous Substances in Electric and Electronic Equipment; to develop an OSPAR monitoring strategy for these chemicals; to review by OSPAR in 2003 of the need for further OSPAR measures to supplement the eventual EC measures; and to ask other relevant international forums to take account of the background document. A monitoring strategy for Certain Brominated Flame Retardants has been added to this background document...|$|E
