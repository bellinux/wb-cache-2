This exhibition included works created from 1968 to 1986 from three series, The Glassworks, The Tentmakers and The Plate and Coil Shop. Factories she visited or worked at included J & E Hall, Dartford (APV Products Ltd) which made escalators and salination systems, the Plate and Coil Shop, and the <b>Fettling</b> <b>Shop.</b> Many of her sculptures are done in bronze or terracotta bas-reliefs.|$|E
40|$|The {{mortality}} {{experienced by}} {{a cohort of}} 10, 491 United Kingdom steel foundry workers during the period 1946 - 85 has been investigated. These workers were all male operatives first employed {{in any one of}} the 10 participating foundries in 1946 - 65; all had worked in the industry for a minimum period of one year. Compared with the general population of England and Wales, statistically significant excesses relating to cancer mortality were found for cancer of the stomach (E = 77. 4, O = 106, SMR = 137) and cancer of the lung (E = 229. 2, O = 441, SMR = 147). A statistically significant deficit was found for cancer of the brain (E = 19. 4, O = 10, SMR = 51). Involvement of occupational exposures was assessed by the method of regression models and life tables (RMLT). This method was used to compare the duration of employment in the industry, in "dust exposed" jobs, in "fume exposed" jobs, in foundry area jobs, in <b>fettling</b> <b>shop</b> jobs, and in foundry area or <b>fettling</b> <b>shop</b> jobs, of those dying from cancers of the stomach and lung with those of all matching survivors. The RMLT analyses provided evidence of an occupational involvement in the risk of death from lung cancer from work in the foundry area or <b>fettling</b> <b>shop,</b> and weaker evidence of an occupational involvement in the risk of death from stomach cancer from work in the foundry area...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{describe}} cause specific mortality among steel foundry workers and to determine if {{any part of the}} experience may be due to occupation. DESIGN [...] Historical prospective cohort study. SETTING [...] Nine steel foundries in England and one in Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] 10, 438 male production employees first employed in the period 1946 - 65 and with a minimum period of employment of one year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Observed and expected numbers of deaths for the period 1946 - 90. RESULTS [...] Compared with the general population of England and Wales, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for all causes and all neoplasms were 115 (observed deaths (Obs) 3976) and 119 (Obs 1129) respectively. Statistically significant excesses were found for cancer of the stomach (Obs 124, expected deaths (Exp) 92. 5, SMR 134, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 111 - 160) and cancer of the lung (Obs 551, Exp 378. 3, SMR 146, 95 % CI 134 - 158). A raised SMR (153) was also found for non-malignant diseases of the respiratory system. Classifications of jobs attracting either higher dust or higher fume exposures did not usefully predict these increased SMRs. Poisson regression was used to investigate risks of mortality from all cancers, cancer of the stomach, cancer of the lung, and non-malignant diseases of the respiratory system associated with duration of employment in the foundry area, the <b>fettling</b> <b>shop,</b> the foundry area/fettling shop, and the industry in general. Monotonic dose-response relations were not found, although there were positive trends for lung cancer and employment in the foundry area/fettling shop (1. 0, 1. 21, 1. 44, 1. 26) and for diseases of the respiratory system and employment in the <b>fettling</b> <b>shop</b> (1. 0, 1. 37, 1. 18, 1. 35). CONCLUSIONS [...] Confident interpretation of the causes of the raised SMRs was not possible. There was limited evidence of an occupational role in the excesses of lung cancer and diseases of the respiratory system. Smoking history was shown, in an indirect way, to be an unlikely explanation...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Foundry {{comprised}} moulding <b>shops,</b> casting bays, <b>fettling</b> <b>shops</b> {{and machine}} shops, all suitable for castings {{up to three}} tons weight. Although larger castings were made by mixing metal from all the sources these were machined and finished outside. The remainder of the site comprised the Fabrication Shops, three bays laid out {{for the production of}} welded fabrications and heat exchangers. Following World War II a new laboratory block was added adjacent to the Sheffield Road entrance. This comprised facilities for Chemical Analysis, Physical Testing, Non-Destructive Testing, Mechanical Testing and Metallography. This facility also had its own small machine shop, for making mechanical test pieces, and a reference library / conference facility.|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} {{crystalline silica}} and other atmospheric contaminants in foundries {{is a well}} recognised hazard. However, the ultrafine dust component in foundry environments has been poorly characterised and there is increasing concern regarding cardio-respiratory disease risks. At present, no generic exposure criteria exist for ultrafine particles which may arise from hot processes, grinding and combustion. Fine and ultrafine airborne particle concentrations in a large ferrous foundry were measured {{over a period of}} four days using a contour mapping approach, as well as some personal sampling. Number and gravimetric concentrations in various regions were assessed with direct reading instrumentation on a trolley (P-Trak, DustTrak and HandiLaz multichannel particle counter). There was considerable variability in daily results probably reflecting process conditions and sources (such as core shop, furnace area pouring line, barrel line and <b>fettling</b> <b>shop).</b> The highest five-minuted average ultrafine concentration was recorded in the core shop (GM = 2. 11 Ã— 105 pt/cc), with lower values recorded in the pouring line, shakeout and fettling areas. Similar trends were seen for PM 2. 5 with highest values again in the core shop (GM = 0. 3 mg/m 3). The highest respirable quartz concentration was found in the shakeout area (0. 1 mg/m 3). In general, airborne dust was well controlled by enclosure and LEV. These results are generally consistent with the literature and suggest that contour mapping for ultrafine particles is an appropriate strategy for more specific evaluation of sources and dust control systems.
