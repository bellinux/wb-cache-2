40|$|Portugal’s main trade {{partners}} have been Spain, Germany and France. In this paper we analyse the <b>intra</b> industry <b>trade</b> {{in the manufacturing}} industry between Portugal Spain, Portugal-France, Portugal Germany, Portugal-Ireland and Portugal-Greece. We also present the results of <b>intra</b> industry <b>trade</b> (IIT) between Portugal and the European Union. The innovation, technological progress, human capital, and scale economies {{are some of the}} explicative variables of the <b>intra</b> industry <b>trade</b> phenomena. This type of trade is associated with the product differentiation. We consider the panel data models, which are commonly used in the literature, and the recent GMM estimator. One of the objectives {{of this paper is to}} verify the estimated models of <b>intra</b> industry <b>trade</b> (IIT), horizontal <b>intra</b> industry <b>trade</b> (HIIT), and vertical <b>intra</b> industry <b>trade</b> (VIIT), and to also verify if the results obtained are different for the partners in analysis. The second objective is to test if the relationship between HIIT and VIIT is determinate by comparative advantages. The third propose is to analyse the results for IIT,HIIT and VIIT with the GMM estimator, and to observe if the models have autocorrelation or specification problems. We will use the m statistics test of Arellano and Bond (1991) and the methodology of Blundell and Bond (1998, 2000) to estimated the models. ...|$|R

40|$|Since reforms {{implemented}} in 1994, vocational {{education and training}} (VET) in Norway has been integrated and standardized as part of upper-secondary education. When young people enter upper-secondary education {{at the age of}} 15 or 16, they can choose either a vocational programme or a general academic programme. The standard model in vocational programmes is 2 years of school-based education, followed by 2 years of apprenticeship training. However, in practice, only a minority follow the standard route and acquire a <b>trade</b> <b>certificate</b> within 4 years. The average age upon completion of a vocational programme in Norway is 28 years, which is {{among the highest in the}} OECD. The purpose of this study was to explore personal trajectories within the Norwegian context to gain a better understanding of why people choose to obtain a <b>trade</b> <b>certificate</b> as young adults, instead of following the standardized route, drawn up by policy makers. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 34 people who obtained a <b>trade</b> <b>certificate</b> when they were aged between 25 and 35 years. The study showed that the opportunity to acquire formal VET qualifications through workplace learning provides an important second chance for many young adults in Norway. Based on the findings, we argue that policy makers need to see educational achievement in a long-term perspective and to design institutional structures that support learning opportunities at work, as well as in formal educational settings.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to find out}} the “No Maghreb ” cost as {{untapped}} opportunities of <b>intra</b> regional <b>trade</b> and to check the existence of comparative advantages in the Maghreb region. We use panel data with gravity model to study the relationship between total exports and factors affecting them, as well as, the exports by sector and their determinants for a sample of 57 countries, between, 1980 - 2007. The goal is to point out the total exports potential as a proxy of the “No Maghreb ” cost. The study also allows establishing whether there are comparative advantages among the region countries. The results show the weak level of <b>intra</b> regional <b>trade</b> comparing to its potential. They also demonstrate that Maghreb countries have similarities and disparities according to some comparative advantages. This contributes to encourage <b>intra</b> regional <b>trade</b> and improve trade perspectives in Maghreb...|$|R
