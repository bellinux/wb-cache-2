40|$|International audienceA recent {{method for}} {{modeling}} folds uses a fold frame with coordinates {{based on the}} structural geology of folds: fold axis direction, fold axial surface and extension direction. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> geometry can be characterised by rotating <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame by <b>the</b> pitch of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> axis in <b>the</b> axial surface and the angle between <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> foliation and <b>the</b> axial surface. These rotation angles can be expressed as 1 D functions of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame coordinates. In this contribution we present methods for extracting and automatically modeling <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometries from structural data. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles used for characterising <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry can be calculated locally from structural observations. <b>The</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles incorporate the structural geology of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> and allow for individual structural measurements to be viewed {{in the context of}} <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> structure. To filter out the effects of later <b>folding</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> rotation angles are plotted against the coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> frame. Using these plots the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> can be interpolated directly from structural data where we use a combination of radial basis function and harmonic analysis to interpolate and extrapolate <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry. This contribution addresses a major limitation in existing methods where <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> geometry was not constrained from structural data. We present two case studies: a proof of concept synthetic model of a non-cylindrical fold and an outcrop of an asymmetrical <b>fold</b> within <b>the</b> Lachlan <b>Fold</b> belt at Cape Conran, Victoria, Australia...|$|R

5|$|Cleveland {{held its}} {{training}} camp at Bowling Green University, {{as it did}} the year before. The Browns played one preseason game in late August against the Baltimore Colts, a new AAFC team formed to replace the Miami Seahawks after the Seahawks <b>folded.</b> <b>The</b> Browns scored their first points on a drive in the second period. A 14-yard run by fullback Marion Motley set up a 25-yard touchdown throw by quarterback Otto Graham to end Mac Speedie. Cleveland scored three more touchdowns in the game, all of them following Colts passes the Browns intercepted. One {{of them was a}} pass by Graham to end Dante Lavelli in the third quarter, and another was a rush by halfback Edgar Jones. Paul Brown pulled most of the Browns' starters from the game as the team built up a three-touchdown lead. Backup end Bob Cowan scored a fourth Cleveland touchdown in the final quarter on a pass from backup quarterback Ermal Allen, and the Browns won 28â€“0. Following the victory, the Browns faced the Buffalo Bills in the regular-season opener at Cleveland Stadium to begin their defense of the AAFC championship.|$|E
5000|$|The general {{assembly}} hereby establishes a recommended procedure for <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> of <b>the</b> state flag by two people. The procedure is as follows:With <b>the</b> flag unfolded, <b>fold</b> <b>the</b> flag {{in half lengthwise}} so that the points of the flag are aligned. <b>Fold</b> <b>the</b> flag in half lengthwise a second time to form a long strip with the red disc facing <b>the</b> ground. Next, <b>fold</b> <b>the</b> pointed end back onto itself to form a rectangle. These steps entail three folds.Starting on the end formed by <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> of <b>the</b> pointed end back onto itself, fold two inches of the flag onto itself for a flag with a three-foot hoist and a five-foot fly, or another appropriate width of fold for a flag of a different size. Repeat <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> a total of fourteen times, alternating <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> in a fan-like manner.The result is a total of seventeen folds symbolizing that Ohio was the seventeenth state admitted to the Union. Finally, neatly and snugly wrap the remaining length of flag around the fan-folds to form a compact rectangle.|$|R

5|$|In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was {{purchased}} by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release <b>folded</b> <b>the</b> Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the D rules to date, and served {{as the basis for}} a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5 was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.|$|E
5|$|The 49ers in the 1950s {{used the}} T formation, {{sometimes}} referred to as a full house backfield, which deployed a quarterback, fullback, and two halfbacks. Such a formation was common at the time at both the college and professional levels, as teams sought to emulate the success the Chicago Bears had with the formation over the previous decade. The Million Dollar Backfield began its construction in 1948 with the team's signing of speedy fullback Joe Perry. In 1951 the 49ers drafted quarterback Y. A. Tittle. Tittle had played the previous three seasons with the Baltimore Colts, and became available in that year's draft after the Colts <b>folded.</b> <b>The</b> next year the 49ers drafted halfback Hugh McElhenny in the first round. McElhenny proved to be an explosive play-maker and was recognized as the NFL's rookie of the year in 1952. All three were invited to play in the Pro Bowl for 1953, comprising the starting offensive backfield for the West. The final piece came in 1954, when John Henry Johnson joined the team. Johnson became known for his powerful running and his blocking, which served to compliment the finesse of Perry and McElhenny.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Roller Mills {{building}} {{is not in}} Princes Street itself, but rather lies {{at the foot of}} Manor Place, close to its intersection with Princes Street. It stands {{at the edge of a}} small area of parkland called the Market Reserve, at the opposite edge of which is the city's main bus depot. This area was swampland when the first European settlers arrived in Dunedin, but was reclaimed and did host a regular market for a few years from the 1870s. The market was not well-supported, however, and eventually <b>folded.</b> <b>The</b> bus depot is located on the site of the city's 1902 Tram workshops. The Market Reserve also contains a children's playground and, at the edge closes to the Crown Roller Mills Building, a small monument dedicated to Otago workers who have lost their lives while at work. This simple bluestone memorial was erected in 2003 by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions on a site donated by the Dunedin City Council.|$|E

5|$|Facing {{competition}} {{as varied as}} television and football, baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster. That year, the Major League Baseball Players Association was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years. No major league team had been located west of St. Louis until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The majors' final all-white bastion, the Boston Red Sox, added a black player in 1959. With {{the integration of the}} majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league <b>folded</b> <b>the</b> following year. In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team, and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped Roger Maris break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball. Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961â€“62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.|$|E
5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New Yorkâ€“New Jerseyâ€“Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes <b>folded</b> <b>the</b> Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E
