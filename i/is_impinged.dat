40|$|In this paper, {{the plastic}} {{crushing}} response is studied for an aluminum foam block of varying cross-section under impact. The {{influence of the}} gradient on the cross-section is investigated. Based on the one-dimensional shock theory, an analytical model is proposed to investigate an impact scenario, in which a foam block with a gradient in its cross-section together with a rigid mass impinges onto a rigid target. Because {{of the change in}} the cross-sectional area along the length, two possible deformation modes may appear, namely the double shock mode and the single shock mode. When the largest cross-section <b>is</b> <b>impinged,</b> two compaction zones in the foam block are found, while only one compaction zone appears from the impinged end when the smallest cross-section <b>is</b> <b>impinged.</b> Of particular interests are the absorbed energy and the force transmitted to the target. The analysis reveals that the energy absorption capacity is weakened with a negative gradient while positive gradient has no influence on the energy absorption capacity of the graded foam. An experiment was then designed to investigate the behavior of the graded foam block under impact. The rigid mass together with the foam block was fired from a gas gun barrel, and its speed was measured before it collided onto the rigid target. The deformation history of the specimen was recorded by a high-speed video camera. Image analysis was employed to obtain the velocity of the impinging mass during the process. Observation of the deformation profile demonstrates the two basic deformation modes described in the analytical modeling...|$|E

Cultured juveniles (yearlings and older, larger fish), and wild adults were observed. Three mean approach bottom water velocities (30. 5 cm, 61, and 91 cm/s) {{were used in}} tests with no orifice in the rack; other tests observed sns at 61 cm/s approach velocity to the rack with an orifice (1 m 2 opening) in the rack. Underwater video camera and TIRIS PIT systems monitored sns movement and behavior at the bar rack. Most sns were oriented tail downstream when they were 60 cm upstream from the rack, so fish were backing down the flume. Initial movement at the rack of some fish in all age classes was to swim upward. No adult or older juvenile <b>was</b> <b>impinged</b> or entrained during any approach velocity. No yearling <b>was</b> <b>impinged</b> at 30. 5 cm/s, but 7. 7 â€“ 12. 5 % <b>was</b> <b>impinged</b> at 61 cm/s, and 33. 3 â€“ 40. 0 % <b>was</b> <b>impinged</b> at 91 cm/s. The entrainment of yearlings at the three approach velocities follow: 4. 3 â€“ 9. 1 % at 30. 5 cm/s, 7. 1 â€“ 27. 8 % at 61 cm/s, and 66. 7 â€“ 80. 0 % at 91 cm/s. Number of sns tracked at the rack with the orifice and the number (%) that entered the orifice follows: 21 yearlings tracked and six (28. 6 %) entered the orifice; 17 older juveniles tracked and 7 (41. 2 %) entered the orifice; nine adults tracked and zero entered. All of the 13 fish entering the orifice approached on or just above the bottom. Four swam headfirst downstream through the orifice, the remainder (nine sns) went tailfirst. Six of 13 fish swam in and out (upstream) of the orifice, the remainder swam one-way downstream through the orifice. Some juveniles (even yearlings) will enter an orifice with no attraction flow.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} the noise reduction performance of piezoelectric smart panels featuring piezoelectric shunt damping. A piezoelectric smart panel is a plate structure {{on which a}} piezoelectric patch with an electrical shunt circuit is attached. When an incidence sound <b>is</b> <b>impinged</b> on the panel structure, the structure vibrates and the attached piezoelectric patch produces electrical energy, which is effectively dissipated as heat via an electrical shunt circuit. Since the energy dissipation strongly depends on the vibration mode of the panel structure, many patches are required for multiple vibration modes. Instead of using multiple piezoelectric patches, a single piezoelectric patch is {{used in conjunction with}} blocked shunt circuit for multimode shunt damping. Modeling, shunt parameter tuning, and implementation of the blocked shunt circuit on the panels are explained.

In order to streamline gas flow, the sidewall at which the flow in the Ekman layer <b>is</b> <b>impinged,</b> is tilted. The axisymmetric laminar flow and heat transfer in the reactor are simulated using the incompressible ideal gas model. For the conventional vertical sidewall, the flow recirculation forming in the corner region could be expanded into the interior to distort the upstream flow. The numerical results show that this unfavorable phenomenon inducing back flow could be dramatically suppressed by tilting the sidewall at a certain range of angle. The assessment of deviation in deposition rate based on the characteristic isotherm illustrates that the sidewall tilting may expand the domain of stable plug-like flow regime toward higher pressure.
