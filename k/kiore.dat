5|$|Tuatara {{were once}} {{widespread}} on New Zealand's main North and South Islands, where subfossil remains {{have been found}} in sand dunes, caves, and Māori middens. Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32offshore islands free of mammals. The islands are difficult to get to, and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused tuatara to disappear from the mainland. However, <b>kiore</b> (Polynesian rats) had recently become established on several of the islands, and tuatara were persisting, but not breeding, on these islands. Additionally, tuatara were much rarer on the rat-inhabited islands. Prior to conservation work, 25% of the total tuatara population had become extinct in the past century.|$|E
5|$|The {{first factor}} in {{the decline of the}} kakapo was the arrival of humans. Māori {{folklore}} suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago. Subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura before and during early Māori times. Māori hunted the kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into cloaks. They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. Due to its flightlessness, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the kakapo was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the Polynesian rat or <b>kiore,</b> which the Māori brought to New Zealand. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for kakapo. Although the kakapo was extinct {{in many parts of the}} islands by the time Europeans arrived, including the Tararua and Aorangi Ranges, it was still present in the central part of the North Island and forested parts of the South Island.|$|E

25|$|Extinction {{was caused}} by {{persecution}} (mainly for specimens), land use changes, {{and the introduction of}} predators such as cats and stoats. It was generally accepted until the late 20th century that the species' disappearance was due to competition by introduced predators for the <b>kiore,</b> or Pacific rat, a favorite prey of the laughing owl (an idea originally advanced by Walter Buller). However, since the <b>kiore</b> is itself an introduced animal, the laughing owl originally preyed on small birds, reptiles and bats, and later probably utilized introduced mice as well. Direct predation on this unwary and gentle-natured bird seems much more likely to have caused the species' extinction. A comprehensive review of the species' decline and disappearance is presented by Williams & Harrison (1972).|$|E

25|$|Although the weta had native predators in {{the form}} of birds (especially the weka and kiwi), reptiles, and bats before the arrival of humans, {{introduced}} species such as cats, hedgehogs, rats (including <b>kiore)</b> and mustelids have caused a sharp increase in the rate of predation. They are also vulnerable to habitat destruction caused by humans and modification of their habitat caused by introduced browsers. New Zealand's Department of Conservation considers 16 of the 70 species at risk. Programmes to prevent extinctions have been implemented since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The {{most current}} {{reliable}} evidence strongly indicates that initial settlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 CE {{at the end}} of the medieval warm period. Previous dating of some <b>kiore</b> (Polynesian rat) bones at 50–150CE has now been shown to have been unreliable; new samples of bone (and now also of unequivocally rat-gnawed woody seed cases) match the 1280 date of the earliest archaeological sites and the beginning of sustained deforestation by humans. Māori oral history describes the arrival of ancestors from Hawaiki (the mythical homeland in tropical Polynesia), in large ocean-going waka. Migration accounts vary among tribes (iwi), whose members may identify with several waka in their genealogies (whakapapa). In the last few decades mitochondrial DNA research has allowed an estimate to be made of the number of women in the founding population—between 50 and 100. There is limited evidence of return, or attempted return voyages, from archaeological evidence in the Kermadec Islands.|$|E

2500|$|The Archaic {{period is}} {{remarkable}} {{for the lack}} of weapons and fortifications so typical of the later [...] "Classic" [...] Māori, and for its distinctive [...] "reel necklaces". From this period onward, some 32 species of birds became extinct, either through over-predation by humans and the <b>kiore</b> (rat) and kurī (dog) they introduced; repeated burning of the grassland that changed their habitat, or climate cooling, which appears to have occurred from about 1400–1450. The early Māori enjoyed a rich, varied diet of birds, fish, seals and shellfish. Moa were also an important source of meat. According to Professor Allan Cooper, the people slaughtered to extinction most of the various lost species within 100 years [...]|$|E
6000|$|Of the {{existence}} of truly indigenous land mammals in New Zealand there is at present no positive evidence, {{but there is some}} reason to believe that one if not two species may be found there. The Maoris say that before Europeans came to their country a forest-rat abounded and was largely used for food. They believe that their ancestors brought it with them when they first came to the country; but it has now become almost, if not quite, exterminated by the European brown rat. What this native animal was is still somewhat doubtful. Several specimens have been caught at different times which have been declared by the natives to be the true <b>Kiore</b> Maori--as they term it, but these have usually proved on examination to be either the European black rat or some of the native Australian rats which now {475} often find their way on board ships. But within the last few years many skulls of a rat have been obtained from the old Maori cooking-places, and from a cave associated with moa bones; and Captain Hutton, who has examined them, states that they belong to a true Mus, but differ from the Mus rattus. This animal might have been on the islands when the Maoris first arrived, and in that case would be truly indigenous; while the Maori legend of their [...] "ancestors" [...] bringing the rat from their Polynesian home may be altogether a myth invented to account for its presence in the islands, because the only other land mammal which they knew--the dog--was certainly so brought. The question can only be settled by the discovery of remains of a rat in some deposit of an age decidedly anterior to the first arrival of the Maori race in New Zealand.[118] ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Kiore</b> (Rattus exulans), a rat, {{are one of}} the top predators of D. heteracantha, preying {{mostly on}} juveniles. <b>Kiore</b> prey on the Weta during the night. An {{increase}} of the <b>Kiore</b> population occurred after the feral cats were eradicated. As saddlebacks prey on the Weta during the day, wetapungas are thus under constant predation pressure. There is evidence suggesting that these rats {{have a negative impact on}} the population of these Weta, as is commonly the case with invasive rodents. The removal of the <b>Kiore</b> in 2004 was a success. The population size grew back each year and a four-fold increase was reported six years after the removal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fruit and}} seeds of P. costata are very {{palatable}} to rats. Research in New Zealand {{has shown that}} the eating of the fruit and the destruction of the seeds by <b>kiore</b> (Pacific rats) has substantially reduced the population of the tree and significantly altered the composition of coastal forest of the northern North Island. <b>Kiore</b> were introduced by Māori sometime in the last 1,000 years and became widespread on the three main islands, and reached many of the offshore islands. Tawāpou seedlings and saplings are now rare on the mainland and on off-shore islands where <b>kiore</b> are present, and abundant on islands where they are absent. Where <b>kiore</b> are present, it is rare to find tawāpou seeds that have not had their kernels removed. <b>Kiore</b> eat the flesh from freshly fallen tawāpou fruit but tend to take the seeds to 'husking stations' where they remove the kernels. As many as 1,400 discarded husks have been found at a single site. The number of juvenile trees increases markedly on islands from which <b>kiore</b> have been removed. [...] "The apparent thoroughness with which <b>kiore</b> find and eat the kernels before the seed germinates shows that <b>kiore</b> can substantially reduce seedling numbers… Numbers of tawāpou, and the proportion of tawāpou trees in forest vegetation, will increase after rat eradication on any island that still retains tawāpou trees" [...] (Campbell et al., 1999:280). Norfolk Island also has various species of rats, which no doubt contributes to the endangered status of P. costata there.|$|E

50|$|The {{fruit and}} seeds of N. apetala are {{palatable}} to rats. Research in New Zealand {{has shown that}} the eating of the seeds by <b>kiore</b> (Pacific rats) substantially reduces the population of the tree. <b>Kiore</b> were introduced by Māori sometime in the last 1,000 years and became widespread on the three main islands, and reached many of the offshore islands. At present, Coastal maire is quite a rare tree on the mainland, but this research indicates that it is probable that before the introduction of <b>kiore,</b> {{it would have been a}} much more common component of the coastal forests of the northern North Island. Seedlings or saplings of N. apetala are uncommon or rare on off-shore islands such as Hen Island and Lady Alice Island where <b>kiore</b> are present, and abundant on islands such as Tawhiti-rahi and Aorangi in the Poor Knights group where they are absent. Three years after the eradication of <b>kiore</b> from Cuvier Island, seedlings of N. apetala became common near mature trees. However, the scarcity of fruiting trees on modified islands slows seed dispersal and population recovery. (Campbell et al., 1999:282-4).|$|E
50|$|The next {{intervention}} was eradication in 1993 of the Polynesian rat, known to Māori as <b>kiore,</b> which was destroying seedlings and competing with birds for food. The <b>kiore</b> {{were killed by}} an aerial drop of poisoned bait, which was controversial due to its lack of planning and the effect on other wildlife. For instance, 90% of pukeko on the island were killed.|$|E

50|$|The Māori, {{who were}} the first human {{settlers}} of New Zealand, introduced the kurī and the <b>kiore,</b> a Polynesian dog and rat. The <b>kiore,</b> along with mammals introduced later by Europeans, would cause a major significant adverse impact on indigenous species. One of the greatest negative ecological impacts of the early Māori people was the wholesale burning of forests, {{for the purpose of}} hunting and killing birds. Greater than the bird population decimations was the deforestation of vast tracts of land; approximately half of the native forests of New Zealand were lost within several hundreds of years following initial Māori settlement from the combination of wood harvesting and forest burning. Rāhui is a form of protection of natural resources that Maori implemented as a conservation measure as well as other reasons.|$|E

Risk to black petrel survival from a one-off event/events is significant due to limited habitat for breeding / i.e. a single site on Hirakimata on Great Barrier Island (for example fire, storm damage or predator invasion at main colony).|$|E
