25|$|In {{addition}} to the missile armament options, the Typhoon also carries a specially developed variant of the Mauser BK-27 27mm cannon armament that was developed originally for the Panavia Tornado. This is a single-barrel, electrically fired, gas-operated revolver cannon with a new linkless feed system, capable of <b>firing</b> <b>up</b> to 1700 rounds per minute. There was a proposal on cost grounds in 1999 to limit this gun-armament fit to the first 53 batch-1 aircraft destined for the RAF, only {{on the basis that}} the guns would be used as ballast and not used operationally, but this decision was reversed in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and <b>firing</b> <b>up</b> the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E

25|$|After seeing Negan kill {{two members}} of his own party, Rick vows to the Saviors' leader that he will kill him someday. Unfazed, Negan drags Rick to the group's RV, viciously announcing that he will be back and if Rick isn't with him, his men have {{permission}} to kill the rest of Rick's gang. After taunting Rick, Negan drives off and brings the RV to a stop near one of the Saviors' roadblocks by an overpass, amid a horde of walkers in thick morning fog. Negan then tosses Rick's axe onto the RV's roof and orders Rick to retrieve it before pushing him out of the RV. Amidst the heavy fog and smoke, Rick scrambles for safety on the RV's roof and sees a walker body dangling from the overpass. He has flashbacks to Abraham's and Glenn's deaths, but Negan becomes impatient for Rick to return and starts <b>firing</b> <b>up</b> through the roof. Rick jumps to the hanging corpse, but slips and falls, dropping the axe. As the walkers swarm around him, Negan fires onto the walkers, giving Rick the chance to collect the axe and return to the RV.|$|E
500|$|Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 {{that using}} Twitter for [...] "literate communication" [...] is [...] "about {{as likely as}} <b>firing</b> <b>up</b> a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad". In September 2008, the {{journalist}} Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into [...] "a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating {{and ought to be}} shared with the world". One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis. Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that [...] "the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} {{persistent}} rumors of clashes among the musicians during the session. Douglas' version is that Mingus complained about Roach's playing, {{then left the}} studio mid-session, taking his bass with him. Ellington caught up with Mingus on the street outside and persuaded him to return. Ellington's account was slightly different – the reason for Mingus leaving was the same, but he was persuaded to return at the elevator. Another version is that Mingus was upset because Ellington did not use any of Mingus' compositions for the recording. Duke's son, Mercer Ellington, stated that the trio had a contract with United Artists for two albums, {{but they could not}} be persuaded to record together again. Critic Thomas Cunniffe suggests that, listening to the tracks in the order in which they were recorded, [...] "one can easily hear the tension building during the uptempo numbers", and that Mingus' temporary departure probably occurred after playing [...] "Money Jungle", which [...] "represents the apex of the group's inner tension, with Mingus plucking the strings with his fingernails, Roach <b>firing</b> <b>up</b> the music with polyrhythms and Ellington laying down highly dissonant chords".|$|E

2500|$|The SG 550 series rifles have a [...] {{long sight}} radius and are {{equipped}} with iron sights adjustable for both windage and elevation. The sights {{are similar to those}} on some Heckler & Koch weapons, such as the HK G3 or HK MP5. The sights consist of a rear, rotating diopter drum soldered to the receiver and a hooded front post installed in the gas block. The rear sight has an open notch setting marked [...] "1" [...] designed for immediate <b>firing</b> <b>up</b> to 100 m but also contains apertures with settings [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] and [...] "4" [...] corresponding to 200, 300 and 400 m firing ranges.

For night use, the dedicated [...] "1" [...] notch setting in the rear sight drum is provided with two self-luminous tritium-powered inserts fitted laterally {{on each side of the}} notch and additionally in a flip-up post attached to the foresight. When firing rifle grenades the front sight hood is aligned with the uppermost edge of the grenade's warhead, this provides an estimated point of impact up to 75 m. The rifle grenades intended for this purpose were FN/Luchaire Type 58-N bullet-though anti-tank grenades.|$|E

The 3rd Division attacked on the right with the 76th Brigade, which reached the first objective near the Hardecourt–Guillemont road {{on the right and}} Lonely Trench on the left, some troops also reaching the road beyond. A battalion of the 9th Brigade on the left advanced a short distance before being stopped, which exposed the troops further south to flanking fire from the north and forced them to withdraw. The troops on the right flank were engaged by German machine-gunners, <b>firing</b> <b>up</b> the slope from the right and began to dig in. French troops had taken more of Maurepas and advanced either side of the village, gaining touch with the British on their left. Attempts to capture the north end of Lonely Trench and a bombing attack from the north failed and the left battalion of the 9th Brigade was caught in cross-fire, when it attacked the German trenches south-east of Arrow Head Copse, only a few parties briefly reaching the objective. The second stage of the attack was suspended.|$|E
