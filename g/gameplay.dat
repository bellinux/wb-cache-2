5|$|Space Invaders {{has been}} remade on {{numerous}} platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include ported and updated {{versions of the}} original arcade game. Ported versions generally feature different graphics and additional <b>gameplay</b> options—for example, moving defense bunkers, zigzag shots, invisible aliens, and two-player cooperative <b>gameplay.</b> Ports on earlier systems like the Atari home consoles featured simplified graphics, while later systems such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and PlayStation featured updated graphics. Later titles include several modes of <b>gameplay</b> and integrate new elements into the original design. For example, Space Invaders Extreme, released on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, integrated musical elements into the standard <b>gameplay.</b> A spin-off for WiiWare, Space Invaders Get Even, allows players to control the aliens instead of the laser cannon.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} <b>gameplay,</b> Famitsu enjoyed the {{tactical}} <b>gameplay</b> and new elements, along with appreciating the thrill {{induced by the}} permanent death mechanic.

Chapman positively noted the improvements made since the release of Fire Emblem, along with positively noting the multiplayer options. Kasavin praised the deep strategy <b>gameplay,</b> and positively noted that it was geared towards players of various ages and skill levels.

Knight enjoyed the <b>gameplay</b> experience, but was mixed to negative {{about the lack of}} true innovations, feeling that it was an overly similar experience to earlier Fire Emblem games. Bramwell enjoyed the <b>gameplay</b> despite getting frustrated at the permanent death mechanic, and positively noted the nuances in character customization. Parkin stated that it was quite easy to spend large amounts of time creating the perfect strategy, and that restarting a level after a character died or going to one of the EXP maps to boost character levels was extremely tempting. In the latter case, he noted it might upset the game's intended difficulty. Marrow enjoyed his time with the game, and praised the additional features that made playing easier for newcomers.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of development, Soma Bringer {{was to be a}} standard role-playing game. During early testing, it was seen that typical role-playing games were not well suited to the DS' limited hardware and controls, so they adjusted the <b>gameplay</b> to its current form as an action role-playing game. After positive feedback from this, the team went ahead. The move to being an action role-playing game enabled the incorporation of cooperative multiplayer: the team wanted to focus as much as possible on the combat and related gimmicks over environmental puzzles. Rather than a separate mode, multiplayer was incorporated into the main story. The development cycle differed greatly from previous Monolith Soft titles. In Takahashi's earlier games, the scenario was written first then the <b>gameplay</b> was tailored to fit. For Soma Bringer, the <b>gameplay</b> was finalized first, and the scenario was built around the locations, dungeons, and mechanics the team had created. Also in contrast to earlier Monolith Soft titles was the lack of lengthy cutscenes, which could not be incorporated into the game with the DS' limited hardware. Instead, the team used the real-time graphics and <b>gameplay</b> models for equivalent scenes.|$|E

Being able to evaluate how people play a game is a crucial component for detecting gamers strategies in videogames. One of the main problems in player strategy detection is whether attributes selected to define strategies correctly detect the actions of the player. In this paper, we will study a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game. In RTS the participants make use of units and structures to secure areas of a map and/or destroy the opponents resources. We will extract real-time information about the players strategies at several <b>gameplays</b> through a Web Platform. After gathering enough information, the model will be evaluated in terms of unsupervised learning (concretely, KMeans). Finally, we will study the similitude between several <b>gameplays</b> where players use di erent strategies...|$|R
