5|$|A {{standard}} {{match between}} Daivari and Tommy Dreamer followed with The Great Khali accompanying Daivari {{to the ring}} but was ejected from ringside early on for interfering. After Daivari won the match using a roll-up, Khali came {{back out to the}} ring and gave Dreamer a chokebomb. EMTs came out to help Dreamer get up, but he ended up getting up on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> headed backstage.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Azzimani to the Olympics, was a {{group of}} eight {{schoolchildren}} from Woippy, a suburb of the French city Metz. Azzimani had organised the trip for the children, who were from an area which saw rioting following the death of a man fleeing police in January 2010. He said in an interview prior to the games that the trip for the children was more important than <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> related it to being introduced to being introduced to skiing on a school trip of his own at the age of six years old.|$|E
5|$|Another figure by {{the name}} of Skaði who appears in the first chapter of Völsunga saga. In the chapter, this Skaði—who is male—is the owner of a thrall {{by the name}} of Breði. Another man, Sigi—a son of Odin—went hunting one winter with the thrall. Sigi and the thrall Breði hunted {{throughout}} the day until evening, when they compared their kills. Sigi saw that the thrall's kills outdid <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> so Sigi killed Breði and buried Breði's corpse in a snowdrift.Byock (1990:35).|$|E

6000|$|And {{what is this}} other, greater impulse? It is {{the desire}} of the human male to build a world: not [...] "to build a world for you, dear"; but to build up out of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> self <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> belief <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> effort {{something}} wonderful. Not merely something useful. Something wonderful. Even the Panama Canal would never have been built simply to let ships through. It is the pure disinterested craving of the human male to make something wonderful, out of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> head <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> self, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> soul's faith <b>and</b> delight, which starts everything going. This is the prime motivity. And the motivity of sex is subsidiary to this: often directly antagonistic.|$|R

5|$|Beilhart {{became friends}} with C. W. Post, who was a patient at the sanitarium, but Post was healed by a Christian Science faith healer, Mrs Elizabeth K. Gregory. In 1892, Post started La Vita Inn, a sanitarium of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> brought Beilhart on as an associate. The two men took {{instruction}} in Christian Science. Both Post and Beilhart rejected {{the doctrine of the}} religion but they embraced the view that illness was an illusion and could be overcome by mental suggestion, prayer, and self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale had by then {{proceeded}} to research the matter on <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> came to the independent conclusion that the accusations were entirely concocted. Late in 1901, he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu, {{taken up by the}} Ilfov County court. On the first day, Caion excused himself as sick, while Stoenescu recused himself, taking the prosecution's side. For these reasons, the trial was held without a jury.|$|E

5|$|During his {{association}} with the Duo-Art company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 piano rolls of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> others' music using a wooden robot designed to play a concert grand piano via an array of precision mechanical fingers and feet; replayings {{of many of these}} rolls have subsequently been recorded on to compact disc. This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Grieg's Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|He drilled {{with the}} company, before classes, in the {{graveyard}} of nearby St. Paul's Chapel.

5|$|Higson {{stated that}} he was {{instructed}} by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations of Bond, except the original Fleming version. As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice as well as <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> Fleming's childhoods. In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, 1826, Crittenden married Maria Knox Todd, a widow {{who was the}} {{daughter}} of Judge Harry Innes.

Todd's daughter Catherine married her stepbrother, Crittenden's son Thomas; their son, John Jordan Crittenden III, was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Maria Knox Todd Crittenden died on September 8, 1851 of an unknown illness.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{subsequently}} designed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> other goaltenders' masks. He was not {{the first}} NHL goaltender known to wear a face mask. Montreal Maroons' Clint Benedict wore a crude leather version in 1930 to protect a broken nose, but Plante introduced the mask as everyday equipment, and it is now mandatory equipment for goaltenders.|$|E

5|$|Tauranac, an {{engineer}} at heart, {{started to feel}} his Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble he {{could not afford to}} take on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> began to look around for an experienced business partner. He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E
5|$|The {{dimensions}} of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking out of <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> speaking as a man, through his Son, disclosing {{the depths of}} man.... And this meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, so we may join in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.|$|E

Later he was required to defend himself in these matters before the Virginia General Assembly. Though he was officially cleared of wrongdoing, the incidents tarnished his reputation and highlighted the style of his living in Richmond. Meanwhile, Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter, Eleanor Rosalie, on May 4, 1804.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun, a Turkish soldier, {{had managed}} to become {{governor}} of Egypt in 868. By using the country's immense wealth to raise an army of <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> exploiting the instability of the central Abbasid government, over the next years he became de facto autonomous, although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliph—for most of his reign the powerless al-Mu'tamid—and to forward some tax revenue to the central government. Ibn Tulun's power made him a major rival to the real power behind the Abbasid throne, al-Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq. The latter tried in 877 to wrest Egypt from Ibn Tulun, but the attempt failed spectacularly, and {{in the following year}} Ibn Tulun extended his area of control over Syria up to the border zone with the Byzantine Empire in the north and up to Raqqa in the western Jazira in the east, immediately adjacent to the Abbasid metropolitan province of Iraq.|$|E
