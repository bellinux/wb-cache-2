Age, their sex, years on Extension staff, FTE group, Research and Extension Centers, years served on the Extension board, size of community and site where one resides were variables selected to test research hypotheses formulated for this study. ^ Theoretical concepts used to support this study were the Congruence Model of Organizational Behavior with a model identifying three problems of change based on {{the components of the}} organizational model. ^ The Climate <b>for</b> <b>Change</b> Survey, developed by the researcher was used to measure climate <b>for</b> <b>change.</b> The 63 statement survey was mailed and returned by 153 agents, 12 administrators and 237 board members. ^ Factor analysis of data collected retained 26 of the original statements relating to the four climate <b>for</b> <b>change</b> dimensions. Reliability analysis resulted in Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha of. 9192 for the Climate <b>for</b> <b>Change</b> Survey. Face validity was established by five University of Nebraska professors representing evaluation, program development and administration. ^ Statistical analysis used to interpret the data was a multivariate analysis of variance using Wilks lambda with a univariate output to determine which of the dimensions of change were statistically significant. ^ Hypotheses testing showed a significant difference (1) among Extension agents, administrators and board members and the four climate <b>for</b> <b>change</b> dimensions, (2) between agents and non-agent chairs and the need <b>for</b> <b>change,</b> openness to <b>change</b> and potential <b>for</b> <b>change,</b> (3) between male and female agents and the need <b>for</b> <b>change</b> and openness to change, (4) among agents from the five Research and Extension Centers and openness to change, (5) among board members from the five Research and Extension Centers and the need <b>for</b> <b>change</b> and potential <b>for</b> <b>change.</b> ^ Recommendations included a replication of this study with another state Extension staff going through organizational changes using the Climate <b>for</b> <b>Change</b> Survey and further development of the Climate <b>for</b> <b>Change</b> Survey. ...|$|R

5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
