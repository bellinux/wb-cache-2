Since micro aneurysm detection is decisive in diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading. Grading performance of computer aided DR screening system highly depends on MA detection. In this {{paper we propose a}} MA detector that provides remarkable results from both aspect. The earlier systems used manual methods for detecting microanuersym that caused increase in obtaining wrong results. so an ensemble based system is being used which contains a combination of pre-processing and candidate extractors.

The {{problem is that they}} need it in structured formats so that they can use it in automated business processes. In the literature, there are many proposals to infer information extractors. They build on machine learning techniques that attempt to infer a pattern in the HTML or XPath sources. To the best of our knowledge, no-one has ever explored using datamining techniques on DOM trees. In this paper, we report on a methodology that builds on datamining CSS features and a few other DOM features. Our results prove that this methodology is promising.

40|$|Crude oil {{is a major}} natural {{resource}} and the mainstay of any country that have it in abundance; its sole disadvantage is its tendency of spilling to the environment. Kenaf {{has been found to}} be a good absorbent for physical clean-up and treatment of oil spillage both on land and water surfaces. Kenaf absorbs the oil thus making it soaked and the absorbed oil can however be recovered using appropriate technology. The aim of the research work is to design and construct an oil extractor to remove and recover the absorbed oil from kenaf bast and core. The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), worm shaft (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), oil and cake outlet, hopper, conical restrictor, pulley and transmission belts. The worm shaft was tapered to build up pressure as it travels across the length of the barrel and it conveys, grinds, presses and squeezes oil out of kenaf into the oil outlet via the oil collection tray. The residual cake from where the oil was extracted is extruded out of the cake outlet in form of briquettes. The oil <b>extractor</b> <b>machine</b> was evaluated in compliance with Philippines Agricultural Engineering Standard PAES 230 and 231 : 2005 and the results showed a percent kenaf recovery of 60 %, extraction efficiency of 62. 2 %, throughput capacity of 36. 5 kg/hr and an extraction loss of 37. 8 %. The extraction efficiency varies with the moisture content of the soaked kenaf bast and core. The operation of the machine does not require any technical-know-how and the machine can be easily maintained as it has the tendency of self-lubricating the extraction chamber due to presence of oil in the input materials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Finding {{a vacant}} {{parking lot in}} urban areas is {{time-consuming}} and, thus, not satisfying for potential visitors or customers. Efficient car-park routing systems could support drivers to get an optimal parking lot immediately. Current systems detecting vacant parking lots are either very expensive due to hardware requirement for each parking lot or do not provide a detailed occupancy map. In this paper, we propose a video-based system for low-cost vacant parking space detection. A wide-angle lens camera is used in combination with a desktop computer. Different feature <b>extractors</b> and <b>machine</b> learning algorithms were evaluated in order to retrieve accurate state information {{for each of the}} observed parking lots. We found a combination of feature extractors and classifiers which properly solved the given task. Our final system, incorporating temporal integration, reached an accuracy of 99. 8 %. ...|$|R
5000|$|Caseless rounds {{are limited}} {{by the fact that}} the {{cartridge}} body is primarily a propellant, and structural properties are secondary to the combustion properties. The primary issue is one of extraction. While caseless ammunition eliminates the need to extract a fired case, unfired caseless rounds must be extractable to unload the firearm or to clear a misfire. With metallic cases, this ability is provided by a rim or <b>extractor</b> groove <b>machined</b> into the rear of the case. Even in completely plastic bodied cartridges, such as the Activ brand shotgun shells, a thin metal ring is molded into the rim to provide support for the extractor. [...] A secondary issue is that ammunition in use can be exposed to air, water, lubricants, and solvents. Primer and propellant in caseless rounds is unprotected, while cartridge cases provide a high degree of protection.|$|R
50|$|The {{cartridge}} {{is said to}} be rimless if the <b>extractor</b> groove is <b>machined</b> {{into the}} head of the case so the rim is the same diameter as the adjacent part of the case. Most modern automatic firearms use rimless cartridges. Straight-walled rimless cartridges often headspace on the forward lip of the cartridge as shown in the diagram {{at the top of this}} article. This necessitates careful attention to consistent case length. Bottle-necked rimless cartridges may headspace on the conical shoulder between the narrow neck and the larger diameter portion of the case.|$|R

40|$|The Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) {{has been}} {{effectively}} applied as an unsupervised non-linear feature <b>extractor</b> in many <b>machine</b> learning applications. However, {{with a time}} complexity of O(n 3), the practicality of KPCA on large datasets is minimal. In this paper, we propose an approximate incremental KPCA algorithm which allows efficient processing of large datasets. We extend a linear PCA updating algorithm to the non-linear case by utilizing the kernel trick, and apply a reduced set construction method to compress expressions for the derived KPCA basis at each update. In addition, we show how multiple feature space vectors can be compressed efficiently, and how approximated KPCA bases can be re-orthogonalized using the kernel trick. The proposed method is justified through experimental validations. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates rule {{extraction}} from recurrent neural networks, {{which takes}} the form of automated construction of models of an underlying network. Typically the models are expressed as finite state machines and they should mimic the network while being more intelligible. It is argued that rule extraction allows a deeper and more general form of analysis than other, more or less ad hoc, methods which are typically applied after the training of the recurrent networks. The first part of this thesis reviews and analyses the development of related techniques. The second part presents a novel algorithm, the Crystallizing Substochastic Sequential <b>Machine</b> <b>Extractor</b> (CrySSMEx), which efficiently generates a sequence of increasingly refined stochastic finite state models of an underlying system. Novel features of CrySSMEx include, for example, freedom from parameters, deterministic extraction, a hierarchical vector quantizer, and a stochastic finite state model which can be constructed also when some data is missing. Experiments show that CrySSMEx is, compared to other methods, applicable to a wider range of problems (such as high-dimensional or chaotic dynamic systems). Finally, the field is discussed from a more theoretica...|$|R
