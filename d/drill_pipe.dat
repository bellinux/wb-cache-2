500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E

2500|$|In one journalist's words,"The well {{had barely}} punched {{into the main}} {{producing}} reservoir a mile below the surface when a mighty surge of pressure shot the drilling mud up through the pipe and [...] into the air.

5000|$|The {{top drive}} allows the {{drilling}} rig to drill the longer section of a stand of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> in one operation. A rotary table type rig can only drill 30 ft (single <b>drill</b> <b>pipe)</b> sections of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> whereas a top drive can drill 60 - 90 ft stands (double and triple <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on {{the drilling rig}} size. Handling longer sections of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> enables a drilling rig to make greater daily progress because up to 90 ft can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer [...] "connections" [...] to add another 30 ft of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> Another advantage of top drive systems is time efficiency. When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore {{for the length of}} the kelly in order to add one more length of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> With a top drive, the draw works only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints. Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while drilling fluid is not being pumped.|$|E

Other BHA components can include a mud motor, measurement while drilling (MWD) apparatus, stabilizers, and various specialty downhole tools.

40|$|Deep {{drilling}} using a rigid drillstring {{requires the}} assembly and disassembly of multiple <b>drill</b> <b>pipes.</b> The interfaces between these pipes provide {{a challenge for}} automation because they must transmit large drilling forces and movements while, at the same time, minimise the actions and forces that are needed to make or break the interface. A geometry which can address these requirements has been suggested by the authors. This approach would use a push-and-twist bayonet system to engage <b>drill</b> <b>pipes,</b> with torque transmission through the bayonet studs. A variety of L-shaped and T-shaped bayonet paths have been proposed to ensure that separation of specific <b>drill</b> <b>pipes</b> can be achieved {{through a combination of}} clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation and single-point clamping. Sustained drills into a variety of media are used to show that percussive impulses are transmitted across the interface, whilst ensuring that the drill interface is able to withstand the shock loading associated with hammer-drilling.
