5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene,</b> {{of which it is}} the hallmark sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a hallmark of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due to infection, signs that the infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
25|$|Doctors at the Scottish Hospital at Royaumont made {{numerous}} important discoveries, {{although their}} contribution {{was not always}} acknowledged and their work required rediscovery. Dr Savill presented to the Royal Society of Medicine in 1916 her work {{in the use of}} X-rays to diagnose the presence of <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene</b> infection before the bacteriological reports could and before the advent of symptoms. This work was not widely accepted and in 1917 she expressed a desire that other radiologists consider this work to confirm her conclusions. Dr. Ivens presented on a similar topic and both Dr. Ivens and Dr. Savill's presentations were reviewed in the British Medical Journal. In related work, Dr E. J. Dalyell published in the British Medical Journal in 1917 about the presence of B. oedematiens in <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene.</b> Subsequent work on the use of X-ray for the diagnosis of <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene</b> do not refer to the work of SMH doctors. Among other work, Dr Henry wrote an MD thesis on the treatment of wounds that she presented in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Romalis first {{observed}} {{the results of}} illegal abortions in 1960, {{when he was in}} medical school. He was assigned the case of a young woman who had died of a septic abortion after using a folk remedy slippery elm bark. It often contains spores of the bacteria that cause <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene,</b> which is what had killed the young woman. She developed an overwhelming infection. An autopsy showed multiple abscesses throughout her body, in her abdomen, liver, lungs, and brain. Romalis never forgot that case.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} {{required for}} hyperbaric oxygen treatment {{consists of a}} pressure chamber, which may be of rigid or flexible construction, and a means of delivering 100% oxygen. Operation is performed to a predetermined schedule by trained personnel who monitor the patient and may adjust the schedule as required. HBOT found early use {{in the treatment of}} decompression sickness, and has also shown great effectiveness in treating conditions such as <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene</b> and carbon monoxide poisoning. More recent research has examined the possibility that it may also have value for other conditions such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, but no significant evidence has been found.|$|E
25|$|From about July 1942 {{to about}} September 1943, {{experiments}} {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of sulfonamide, a synthetic antimicrobial agent, were conducted at Ravensbrück. Wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with bacteria such as Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens (a major causative agent in <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene)</b> and Clostridium tetani, the causative agent in tetanus. Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels {{at both ends of}} the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound. Infection was aggravated by forcing wood shavings and ground glass into the wounds. The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August, near Vaslui, Dadashev's tank {{attacked}} German positions. The tank's fire reportedly destroyed 6 anti-tank {{guns and}} 16 machine gun and mortar emplacements, killing their crews. Dadashev was wounded, {{but continued to}} drive. After running out of shells, the tank crew reportedly took shelter around the tank. Dadashev used the machine gun to reportedly kill eight German soldiers. These actions {{were reported to have}} caused a German retreat. Dadashev was seriously wounded in his left shoulder on 14 September and died of <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene</b> at the 576th Field Surgical Hospital on 17 September 1944. He was buried in Stremț. On 24 March 1945, he was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin.|$|E
25|$|Doctors at Royaumont also {{undertook}} cutting-edge research, {{focusing on}} the treatment of <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene.</b> The doctors found X-ray and bacteriology for diagnosis and surgical debridement of affected tissue and antiserum therapy to be especially effective. Doctors at the facility believed the collaboration of different specialties was important in fighting infection and avoiding excess amputations. The hospital had a mobile X-ray car manufactured by Austins and purchased for £300. Installation of the X-ray equipment was assisted by Marie Curie and included water and electrical sources independent {{of the rest of}} the facility. The X-ray car was highly coveted; other hospitals in the area occasionally utilized it and the British military attempted to impound and keep the car for itself. In spite of their work, Dr. Ivans was restricted in her ability to publish and present her results. In 1918 she had to obtain permission from General Célestin Sieur of the French military medical services to publish her results, and she was not allowed to present her work directly to the Société de Chirurgie de Paris, her work being instead presented by a third party.|$|E
500|$|Hyperbaric (high-pressure) {{medicine}} uses special oxygen chambers {{to increase}} the partial pressure of [...] around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. Carbon monoxide poisoning, <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene,</b> and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes addressed with this therapy. Increased [...] concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene,</b> so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in the blood. Increasing the pressure of [...] {{as soon as possible}} helps to redissolve the bubbles back into the blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the lungs.|$|E
500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} {{can result}} from puncture of parts of the respiratory or gastrointestinal systems. [...] Particularly {{in the chest and}} neck, air may become trapped as a result of penetrating trauma (e.g., gunshot wounds or stab wounds) or blunt trauma. Infection [...] (e.g., <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene)</b> can cause gas to be trapped in the subcutaneous tissues. Subcutaneous emphysema can be caused by medical procedures and medical conditions that cause the pressure in the alveoli of the lung to be higher than that in the tissues outside of them. [...] Its most common causes are pneumothorax and a chest tube that has become occluded by a blood clot or fibrinous material. [...] It can also occur spontaneously due to rupture of the alveoli with dramatic presentation. [...] When the condition is caused by surgery it is called surgical emphysema. The term spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema is used when the cause is not clear.|$|E

Misdiagnosis can occur in up to 30% of people with suspected lower-extremity cellulitis, leading to 50,000 to 130,000 unnecessary hospitalization and $195 to $515 million in avoidable healthcare spending annually in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In 1913, a second-class {{surgeon at}} Filantropia Hospital, Gomoiu {{published}} {{a piece on}} [...] "the radical treatment of vaginal hydrocele" [...] in the French journal Lyon Chirurgical, and his opening lesson on [...] "small surgery" [...] (Mica chirurgie). That year, he also performed his military obligation by accompanying the ambulatory health service sent to the Ottoman Empire during the Second Balkan War and performing surgery within the unit. In parallel, he studied craniometry, publishing a study of 24 craniums in Revista Științelor Medicale, then as a booklet, and following up in 1915 with Cercetări asupra perimetrului cranian ("Researching the Cranial Perimeter"). The same years saw his many conferences at the Surgical Society printed in several editions, alongside separate studies of skin cancer, the sympathetic nervous system in the abdomen, <b>gas</b> <b>gangrene</b> of the thorax, and gastrostomy techniques. In 1916, he and Ionescu together discovered the link between stellate ganglion removal and sympathectomy.|$|E
