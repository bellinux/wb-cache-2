The Special <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> is the unit of account of the IMF and represents a claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias.

40|$|The subject under {{consideration}} is the conception {{and significance of}} special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> and {{the main reason for}} the introduction of the new international monetary unit. Also indicated is the fundamental difference between the <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> and the spacial <b>drawing</b> <b>rights.</b> To meet the need as and when it arises for supplement to existing reserve assets the Fund is authorized to allocate special <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> to members that are participants in the Special Drawing Account. The new international unit, commonly known as SDR (Special <b>Drawing</b> <b>Rights)</b> or gold paper was introduced in January 1970. It's parity is 0, 88671 g of fine gold, thus equal to the US dollar. It is expressed in dollars but not US dollars. It is issued by the IMF. The grounds for issuing is mutual committance {{of the participants in the}} Special Drawing Account, to use the SDR as a means of payment in international settlement of payments. The introduction of SDR constitutes a further step in demonetization of gold, but does not yet mean its full demonetization. SDR is demonetized gold, despite its parity in gold. Here gold plays the role of a yardstick of international measure of values. The introduction of SDR has positive influence on international liquidity thanks to the possibility for supplement to existing reserve assets. Though reducing it does not however, eliminate all the difficulties of those countries which have a long-standing debit balance of payments.

50|$|See <b>drawing,</b> <b>right.</b> The stackfreed {{consists}} of a stiff spring arm (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an eccentric cam (D), usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the spring arm against the cam exerts a retarding force on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with {{the thickness of the}} cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the retarding force it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the retarding force gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed spring aided the weakened mainspring.|$|E
5000|$|A ground dipole {{functions}} as an enormous vertically oriented loop antenna (see <b>drawing,</b> <b>right).</b> It {{consists of two}} widely separated electrodes (G) buried in the ground, connected by overhead transmission cables to a transmitter (P) located between them. The alternating current from the transmitter (I) travels in a loop through one transmission line, kilometers deep into bedrock from one ground electrode to the other, and back through the other transmission line. This creates an alternating magnetic field (H) through the loop, which radiates ELF waves. Due to their low frequency, ELF waves have a large skin depth and can penetrate a significant distance through earth, so it doesn't matter that half the antenna is under the ground. The axis of the magnetic field produced is horizontal, so it generates vertically polarized waves. The radiation pattern of the antenna is directional, a dipole pattern, with two lobes (maxima) in {{the plane of the}} loop, off the ends of the transmission lines. [...] In the U.S. installations two ground dipoles are used, oriented perpendicular to each other, to allow the beam to be steered in any direction by altering the relative phase of the currents in the antennas.|$|E

5000|$|Low power triodes have a {{concentric}} construction (see <b>drawing</b> <b>right),</b> {{with the}} grid and plate as circular or oval cylinders surrounding the cathode. The cathode is a narrow metal tube down the center. Inside the cathode is a filament called the [...] "heater" [...] {{consisting of a}} narrow strip of high resistance tungsten wire, which heats the cathode red-hot (800 - 1000 °C). This type is called an [...] "indirectly heated cathode" [...] The cathode is coated {{with a mixture of}} alkaline earth oxides such as calcium and thorium oxide which reduces its work function so it produces more electrons. The grid is constructed of a helix or screen of thin wires surrounding the cathode. The plate is a cylinder or rectangular box of sheet metal surrounding the grid. It is blackened to radiate heat and is often equipped with heat-radiating fins. The electrons travel in a radial direction, from the cathode through the grid wires to the plate. The elements are held in position by mica or ceramic insulators and are supported by stiff wires attached to the base, where the electrodes are brought out to connecting pins. A [...] "getter", a small amount of shiny barium metal evaporated onto the inside of the glass, helps maintain the vacuum by absorbing gas released in the tube over time.|$|E
