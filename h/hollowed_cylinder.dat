In this paper, Image-Based Distance Measuring System (IBDMS) is proposed for measuring the dimensions of short <b>hollow</b> <b>cylinders</b> with only one exposure.

As a result, maximal image contour of an unknown short <b>hollow</b> <b>cylinder</b> picture can be obtained so as to achieve measuring results with highest resolution at each time. To allow for vertical adjustment, we came up with a new method for distinguishing between vertical and non-vertical image contour region captured by video camera, resulting in better linear relation for transformation between pixel counts and distance.

The proposed method can measure the inner diameter, height, and thickness of the short <b>hollow</b> <b>cylinder</b> with one exposure by using a single digital camera.

The piston resonance mode is especially important in the motion response of a <b>hollow</b> circular <b>cylinder.</b> In many cases, the heave response at the piston resonance mode is large, and its resonant frequency can be predicted using the empirical formula of Fukuda (1977).

40|$|Surface stress, {{which is}} always {{neglected}} in classical elastic theories, has recently emerged as {{a key role in}} the mechanics of highly deformable soft solids. In this paper, the effect of surface stress on the deformation and instability of soft <b>hollow</b> <b>cylinder</b> are analyzed. By incorporating surface energy density function into the constitutive model of a hyper-elastic theory, explicit solutions are obtained for the deformation of soft <b>hollow</b> <b>cylinder</b> under the conditions of uniform pressure loading and geometric everting. It is found that surface tension evidently alters the deformation of the soft cylinder. Specifically, the surface stiffness resists the deformation, but the residual surface stress is inclined to larger deformation. Effects of surface stress on the instability of the soft <b>hollow</b> <b>cylinder</b> is also explored. For both the pressure loading and geometric everting conditions, significant changes in critical condition of the creases are found by varying the surface parameter. The results in this work reveal that surface energy obviously influences both the deformation and the instability of soft <b>hollow</b> <b>cylinder</b> at finite deformation. The obtained results will be helpful for understanding and predicting the mechanical behavior of soft structures accurately. Comment: 27 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
