5|$|At this point, Spielberg {{considered}} {{returning to}} direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> a screenplay based on Quint's Indianapolis speech. Because of his contract for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, {{he would not be}} able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers. Production designer Joe Alves (who would direct Jaws 3-D) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it. The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America, partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film Bug and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series Night Gallery. Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated waterskier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script. He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script. Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.|$|E
5|$|King Henry died on 6 July 1189 {{and his son}} Richard I was crowned on 3 September. The {{succession}} of a new monarch eventually allowed a truce in the dispute between the Canterbury monks and their archbishop, as Henry had been {{a supporter of the}} archbishop's scheme. Before the truce could be <b>hammered</b> <b>out,</b> Baldwin appointed Norreis as prior of Christ Church in October 1189 as another move in the quarrel over the Hackington project. In November the cathedral chapter secured a compromise that included the abandonment of the scheme and Norreis's dismissal from office. The agreement came at a council held by Richard in late November 1189 at which the monks agreed to let the king settle the dispute over the Hackington project if the archbishop would withdraw Norreis' appointment. Norreis's fellow monks considered him a traitor to their cause, and his reputation was that of someone with few morals. He was also known for ingratiating himself with those in power, including the justiciar Geoffrey fitzPeter. Many of the details concerning Norreis' career at Christ Church come from the works of Gervase of Canterbury, as well as the collection of letters known as the Epistolae Cantuarienses.|$|E

25|$|The steel-pan {{is created}} by {{hammering}} a 55-gallon drum to produce the full chromatic range of scale notes. After the drum is hammered {{into the shape of}} a concave bowl, individual notes are grooved out into the bowl of the drum. The traditional steel-pan was <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> by hand, but with the instrument gaining popularity and worldwide demand, manufacturers have experimented with more efficient methods including Spinforming, Flowforming, Aquaforming and Marforming. A typical pan contains 2½ octaves, with each note being a <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> groove in the pan that produces a distinct note.|$|E

Hence, government policies were generally perceived as centre-left, reflecting the centrist policies of the INC.|$|E

25|$|By 1979, the ACB was {{in desperate}} {{financial}} straits {{and faced the}} prospect of fighting an opponent who had seemingly bottomless cash resources. In two seasons, the combined losses of the two biggest cricket associations, New South Wales and Victoria, totalled {{more than half a}} million dollars. However, Packer too was feeling the financial pinch – many years later, WSC insiders claimed that the losses he incurred were very much higher than the amounts quoted at the time. During March of that year, Packer instigated a series of meetings with then chairman of the ACB board, Bob Parish, which <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> an agreement on the future of Australian cricket.|$|E
25|$|By 1992, Slovak {{calls for}} greater {{autonomy}} effectively blocked the daily {{functioning of the}} federal government. In the election of June 1992, Klaus's Civic Democratic Party won handily in the Czech lands {{on a platform of}} economic reform. Vladimír Mečiar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia emerged as the leading party in Slovakia, basing its appeal on fairness to Slovak demands for autonomy. Federalists, like Havel, were unable to contain the trend toward the split. In July 1992, President Havel resigned. In the latter half of 1992, Klaus and Mečiar <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> an agreement that the two republics would go their separate ways {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E

25|$|The March 1934 auto {{industry}} agreement {{paved the way}} for new legislation which did away with the toothless NLB, but which only worsened the problems of the labor movement. With the steel strike deadline approaching, the steel industry was gearing up for war with the AA. But the Wagner bill, which might have averted a strike by establishing stronger protections for workers, had little chance of passing. Again Roosevelt intervened. He called a conference at the White House on June 12 at which AFL president William Green was one of the attendees. A compromise bill was <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> which authorized the president to create one or more new labor boards to enforce Section 7(a) by conducting investigations, subpoenaing evidence and witnesses, holding elections and issuing enforcement orders.|$|E
25|$|They worked two {{styles of}} pieces: cast pieces and pieces <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> of sheet metal. Fewer pieces of cast {{jewellery}} have been recovered. It {{was made by}} casting the metal onto two stone or clay moulds. The two halves were then joined together, and wax, followed by molten metal, {{was placed in the}} centre. This technique had been practised since the late Bronze Age. The more common form of jewellery was the hammered sheet type. Sheets of metal would be hammered to thickness and then soldered together. The inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work. Different techniques, such as using a stamp or engraving, were then used to create motifs on the jewellery. Jewels may then be added to hollows or glass poured into special cavities on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} web {{theory was}} put into concrete plan form by the Air War Plans Division: Kenneth Walker, Laurence S. Kuter and Haywood S. Hansell, led by Harold L. George. The plan was submitted for approval to the Joint Army-Navy Board in mid-1941 as AWPD-1, standing for Air War Plans Division, plan number one. A refinement to AWPD-1 came in August 1942 after eight months of direct American involvement in World War II. The new plan was called AWPD-42 and was submitted to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Neither AWPD-1 nor AWPD-42 were approved as combat battle plans or strategies—they were simply accepted as guidelines {{for the production of}} materiel necessary to carry out the plans intended or subsequent plans. Finally in 1943, a plan was <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> in meetings between American and British war planners. The industrial web theory would be put into practical plan form with the Anglo-American Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO).|$|E

25|$|During 1955 and 1956 UMNO, the MCA and the British <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> a {{constitutional}} settlement for {{a principle of}} equal citizenship for all races. In exchange, the MCA agreed that Malaya’s head of state would {{be drawn from the}} ranks of the Malay Sultans, that Malay would be the official language, and that Malay education and economic development would be promoted and subsidised. In effect this meant that Malaya would be run by the Malays, particularly since they continued to dominate the civil service, the army and the police, but that the Chinese and Indians would have proportionate representation in the Cabinet and the parliament, would run those states where they were the majority, and would have their economic position protected. The difficult issue of who would control the education system was deferred until after independence. This came on 31 August 1957, when Tunku Abdul Rahman became the first Prime Minister of independent Malaya.|$|E
25|$|The AWPD {{went beyond}} {{offering}} basic production requirements and provided instead a comprehensive air plan {{which was designed}} to defeat the Axis powers. The plan, AWPD-1, was completed in nine days. The plan emphasized using heavy bombers to carry out precision bombing attacks as the primary method of defeating Germany and her allies. A year later, after the United States became directly involved in World War II, AWPD delivered a second plan—AWPD-42—which slightly changed the earlier plan to incorporate lessons learned from eight months of war. Neither AWPD-1 nor AWPD-42 were approved as combat battle plans or war operations; they were simply accepted as guidelines for the production of materiel and the creation of necessary air squadrons. Finally in 1943, an operational aerial warfare plan was <b>hammered</b> <b>out</b> in meetings between American and British war planners, based on a combination of British plans and those from the AWPD, to create the Anglo-American Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO).|$|E

The BCCI governing council meeting was held on 28 Nov 2010 at Nagpur to decide the fate of Kochi franchisee. BCCI president Shashank Manohar said the board needed more time to discuss the issue and to take legal opinion and that the final decision on Kochi Tuskers Kerala will be taken on the BCCI governing council meeting at Mumbai on 5 December 2010. After much speculation it was finally announced by the BCCI that it was satisfied with the agreements signed by the franchise owners and the team would participate in the 2011 IPL Season.|$|E
