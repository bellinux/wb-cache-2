50|$|The {{eutectoid}} {{composition of}} austenite is approximately 0.76% carbon; steel with less carbon content (hypoeutectoid steel) will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallites {{that do not}} participate in the eutectoid reaction and cannot transform into pearlite. Likewise steels with higher carbon content (hypereutectoid steels) will form cementite before reaching the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point.</b> The proportion of ferrite and cementite forming above the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point</b> can be calculated from the iron/iron—carbide equilibrium phase diagram using the lever rule.|$|E

50|$|When the {{solution}} above the transformation point is solid, rather than liquid, an analogous eutectoid transformation can occur. For instance, in the iron-carbon system, the austenite phase can undergo a eutectoid transformation to produce ferrite and cementite, often in lamellar {{structures such as}} pearlite and bainite. This <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point</b> occurs at 727 C and about 0.76% carbon.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomena}} to {{be considered}} here constitute a particular case of the general question {{of the formation of}} a new solid phase from a chemical interaction between two adjoining phases, one of which acting as a substrate should be solid also, while the second one can indifferently assume any physical state, solid, liquid or gaseous (as in oxidation). The conditions under which nucleation becomes the rate-determining process in such reactions are analyzed in terms of the classical theory of nucleation. Quite often the growth of the new phase is proportional to the square-root of time indicating diffusion control; germination comes to play the preponderant role when the change in free energy ƊG is sufficiently small. When germination becomes very difficult, it may take place only at such high temperatures that diffusion ceases to play any significant role and the reaction assumes a quasi explosive character. While the presence of equilibrium <b>points,</b> <b>eutectoid</b> or oxide decomposition, provides the possibilty of making ƊG arbitrarily as small as desired, nucleation-control does not depend on such equilibrium points, the one necessary condition is that ƊG be small. Some practical aspects are considered...|$|R

50|$|In metallurgy, {{quenching}} is {{most commonly}} used to harden steel by introducing martensite, {{in which case the}} steel must be rapidly cooled through its <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point,</b> the temperature at which austenite becomes unstable. In steel alloyed with metals such as nickel and manganese, the eutectoid temperature becomes much lower, but the kinetic barriers to phase transformation remain the same. This allows quenching to start at a lower temperature, making the process much easier. High speed steel also has added tungsten, which serves to raise kinetic barriers and give the illusion that the material has been cooled more rapidly than it really has. Even cooling such alloys slowly in air has most of the desired effects of quenching.|$|E
5000|$|Steel Qualities and Quenchant: Blacksmith skill {{aside and}} {{specific}} heat treatment aside, the 1 versions (higher carbon) are harder, more wear resistant, more fragile {{and harder to}} forge, harder to sharpen, and harder to straighten.. The 3 versions (lower carbon, at the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point)</b> are not necessarily softer, but often tougher, easier to sharpen, and easier to make. Blue steel {{is more difficult to}} forge, sharpen, and straighten (because the [...] "soft" [...] steel covered by clay still hardens). To perform traditional water quench on this steel can exacerbate the formation of cracks because of its deeper hardening. White steel 1 is difficult to forge and to quench from its higher carbon and can become harder and more brittle than White 2. A water quench with these traditional steels and processes will result in a blade that is harder, stiffer, sharper with longer lasting sharpness but that is harder to sharpen and relatively less tough. An oil quench with the same steels will result in a blade that is marginally less hard, stiff, sharp with less lasting sharpness but that is easier to sharpen and more tough. The choice of quenchant depends on user preference of blade qualities.|$|E

40|$|During {{isothermal}} pearlitic {{transformation of}} high carbon austenite, {{the formation of}} proeutectoid phases precedes that of pearlite. Widmanstatten cementite is the major proeutectoid phase that forms at all temperatures. Within this constituent the precipitation of epsilon-Cu always occurs, together {{with the formation of}} stabilized coarse austenite entrapments. Within pearlitic cementite interphase precipitation of epsilon-Cu occurs at all transformation temperatures, while within pearlitic ferrite a banded interphase precipitation of epsilon-Cu occurs only at temperatures close to the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point.</b> As the temperature of the isothermal pearlitic transformation is lowered the formation of non-partitioned pearlitic ferrite is possible and epsilon-Cu precipitation only forms within this ferrite as a result of ageing occurring during prolonged isothermal holding. It was concluded that interphase precipitation of epsilon-Cu always occurred on the migrating austenite/cementite interphase boundaries, but epsilon-Cu interphase precipitation occurred on the migrating austenite/ferrite boundaries only at temperatures close to the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E

Using data from the literature for other Cu-based alloys, this result is shown to be general. In addition, it is shown that the martensitic structure changes from 18 R to 2 H when the ratio of conduction electrons per atom reaches the same value as the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point</b> in the equilibrium phase diagram.

40|$|A {{hypoeutectoid}} alloy (carbon composition {{less than}} eutectoid). The first phase formed upon cooling from the austenite phase field is proeutectoid ferrite. Due {{to the lower}} solubility of carbon in ferrite, carbon is partitioned into the remaining austenite. At the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point</b> the remaining carbon enriched austenite transforms to pearlite (a mixture of ferrite and cementite) which is the darker region of the micrograph. The proportion of pearlite is dependent upon the overall composition. The ferrite (light areas) {{is a good example}} of an allotriomorphic ferrite. This means that its shape does not reflect its internal crystalline symmetry as it nucleates on the austenite grain boundaries and hence follows the shape of the boundaries, the remaining austenite within the ferrite then transforms to pearlite, and is surrounded by the ferrite. ...|$|E
40|$|Prof., to whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed Key words: high magnetic field; Fe- 0. 76 %C alloy; microstructure Abstract. The present studies are to investigate the microstructure features during transformation from austenite to ferrite without and with magnetic field on Fe- 0. 76 %C alloy. It is found that the area fraction and numbers of proeutectoid ferrite grain {{as well as the}} lamellar spacing of pearlite in Fe- 0. 76 %C alloy increased considerably with the increase of magnetic field intensity. The reason is that, the magnetic field increases the driving force of proeutectoid ferrite nuclei and shifts the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point</b> to the side of high carbon content and high temperature, which increases the starting-temperature of the transformation from austenite to ferrite. The proeutectoid ferrite grains are elongated along the magnetic field direction, which can be explained as follows: the proeutectoid ferrite becomes the magnetic dipolar under high magnetic field, and then the polarized austenite atoms are much easier to diffuse into ferrite grains along the magnetic field direction. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{railway system}} has an {{important}} role in developed countries, it is possible to see, nowadays, passenger trains crossing the Old Continent and achieving impressive speeds in the East; at the same time, cargo wagons are hitting load-by-axle records in North America. Railway wheels are a critical component to this system, as any failure can lead to derailment, potentially causing financial loss and/or fatal accidents. The present work aims to analyze the mechanical properties of forged wheels manufactured according to the American standard AAR Class B (produced at the MWL Brasil facility), usually applied in passenger cars due its chemical composition (around the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point)</b> which achieves high mechanical resistance combined with moderated toughness. The mechanical tests to evaluate the mechanical strength, ductility, fracture toughness and hardness were performed in accordance with the European standard BS EN 13262 (location of sample and method test), as follows: tensile tests, impact tests, toughness tests and hardness Brinell tests (hardness survey/hardness map).

40|$|Currently, {{the trend}} {{around the world}} is to produce lighter wires with higher {{strength}} for long span bridge applications and the automobile tire industry. Increasing the carbon content in the steel is the most common way to achieve higher strength in these applications. The chosen steel in this study was SAE 1092. The advantage of this steel is its higher strength but the disadvantage is the formation of a brittle phase. In this type of hypereutectoid steel, the proeutectoid cementite precipitates along the austenite grain boundaries prior to the formation of the pearlite. As the amount of carbon increases above the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point,</b> more of this brittle phase precipitates. At the beginning of this work, two proeutectoid cementite networks were identified; one in the center and the other close {{to the surface of the}} wire rod. Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) was used to crytallographically define that proeutectoid cementite forms at certain grain boundaries of a given orientation. Dilatometric tests were carried out to verify the minimum cooling rate necessary to avoid the formation of the proeutectoid cementite. It was also used to verify the influence of the environment on the transformation of austenite and the precipitation of the proeutectoid cementite. Industrial experiments were also carried out in order to determine what conditions should be used to produce wire rods with large diameters and free of proeutectoid cementite network...|$|E

Nanocrystalline, metastable phases were found in both systems after firing in temperatures up to 900 ºC for several hours. Above 1000 ºC, the metastable phases gradually transformed to the structures expected by the equilibrium phase diagrams. In the MgO-TiO 2 system, a single phase with structure similar to the H. T. inverse spinel (qandilite) was formed from xerogels 500 ºC below the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point.</b> Furthermore, this phase tolerated a wide range of compositions, ranging from Mg/Ti = 1. 2 to 2. 0. In the Ti-rich side, orthorhombic (karrooite–like) solid solutions were found from xerogels at compositions ranging from Mg/Ti = 0. 5 to 0. 63. The stability of these phases was tested up to 1500 ºC for a period of 3 h. It was found that at maximum deviation from stoichiometry, the spinel–like structure is stable up to 700 ºC and the karrooite-like non-stoichiometric phases are stable up to 600 ºC. Annealed xerogels prepared by sol-gel coprecipitation from the alcoholates of Zr and Al showed a wide solubility range for alumina in nanocrystalline zirconia, up to about 26 mol-%, accompanied by stabilization of the high-temperature tetragonal and cubic zirconia phases.

40|$|The olivine {{phase of}} lithium iron {{phosphate}} (LixFePO 4) is a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. Some of its advantages {{are that it}} is nontoxic, highly stable, and inexpensive, but its low intrinsic electrical conductivity is a major disadvantage. LixFePO 4 has generally {{been described as a}} two-phase system as lithium is removed from or inserted into the material. However, the mechanism of lithium removal and the system's phase composition is still not fully understood, and is an area of interest. The two low-temperature phases, heterosite and triphylite, have previously been shown to transform to a single-phase disordered solid solution at temperatures above 200 °C. Here, the phase diagram for LixFePO 4 has been determined for different lithium concentrations and temperatures. This disordered phase is stable at relatively low temperatures. The proposed phase diagram resembles a eutectoid system, with <b>eutectoid</b> <b>point</b> at around x = 0. 6 and 200 °C. The kinetics of mixing and unmixing transformations, including the hysteresis between heating and cooling, will be shown. The enthalpy of this transition is at least 700 J/mol. Further thermostability studies of the material up to temperatures of 800 °C will also be discussed. Solid solution regions have also been indicated near the end compositions of x = 0 and 1 at room temperature. Measurements of the entropy (Delta S(x)) and enthalpy (Delta H(x)) of lithiation were performed, indicating the ranges of solid solution regions to be x 0. 85. In addition, the entropy of lithiation in between (0. 05 < x < 0. 85) changes gradually with x. This is unexpected, since Delta S(x)) should be constant in a two-phase region. There are several alternatives which could be causing this result. Further clarification of this topic could give additional information about the phase transformation occurring as LiFePO 4 is delithiated. The topic of dynamics in LixFePO 4 is also very relevant, especially since this material is now touted as an important high-rate capability cathode. The electronic and ionic conductivity of the new disordered solid-solution phase has generated widespread interest. The local electronic structure around iron ions in Li 0. 6 FePO 4 was studied by 57 Fe Mossbauer spectrometry at temperatures from 25 to 240 °C. The equilibrium two-phase triphylite plus heterosite material was compared to a disordered solid solution that was obtained by quenching from a high temperature. Substantial electronic relaxations were found in the disordered solid solution compared to the two-phase material at temperatures of 130 °C and above. Fluctuations in the electric field gradient and the isomer shift showed activation energies of 335 +- 25 meV and 600 +- 100 meV, respectively. It is suggested that these spectral relaxations are caused by the motions of Li+ ions. The activation energies from the isomer shift can be related to the material conductivity, giving values of 10 - 6 to 10 - 4 S/cm; 3 to 5 orders of magnitude higher than the measured value of 10 - 9 for fully lithiated LiFePO 4.
