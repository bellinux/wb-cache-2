40|$|The {{potential}} {{fate and}} behaviour of the herbicide isoproturon, under aerobic conditions, was studied in soil, chalk and groundwater from two sites on an unconfined aquifer in Hampshire, UK. A small but significant sorption potential for isoproturon was noted in the upper chalk, suggesting that some retardation would take place in transport through the chalk. The <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> of the samples was studied using laboratory microcosms. Very little <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> appeared to exist for isoproturon in the unsaturated zone of upper chalk 3 m below the soil surface. Wide variations in degradation rates between samples from the same depth was noted. A <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> was noted in the chalk from shallow depths under laboratory microcosm conditions at a pesticide concentration of 100 μg l− 1. Of the two sites examined, the most rapid and consistent degradation observed {{was associated with the}} groundwater rather than the chalk in the saturated zone. No significant isoproturon ring mineralisation occurred in the chalk or groundwater samples, implying that where isoproturon degradation does occur a by-product containing the phenyl ring will persist.

Many cosmopolitan areas including coastal environments are heavily impacted by PAH. This research investigates {{the isolation of}} PAH-degrading bacteria from burrow sediment of marine benthic macrofauna and their potential in bioremediation. Macrofaunal burrow sediment is biogeochemically distinct from bulk sediment and has high microbial activities. Samples were collected from a local uncontaminated cove and PAH <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> was measured by incubating sediment slurries with exogenous PAH. Burrow sediments from two polychaetes and a mollusc showed significantly higher PAH <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> than the bulk sediment. The <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> was sensitive to the oxygen level during incubation. Prolonged anoxia arrested the PAH degradation in the slurries however degradation resumed when oxygen became available.

In fact, the DOC that showed the highest bio- and photo-degradability, respectively, originated in the thawed permafrost layer. Our study sheds new light on the DOC composition of peat-permafrost directly upon thaw and suggests that past estimates of carbon-dioxide emissions from thawed peat permafrost may be biased as they have overlooked the initial mineralization potential of the exported DOC...|$|R

40|$|Phytoremediation is a {{promising}} low cost {{technology for the}} cleanup of contaminated sites. However, specific plants may promote degradation under one set of conditions but not under another, and knowledge limitations surrounding the mechanisms of phytoremediation hamper attempts at optimization. We addressed this issue by examining how exudates released by Elymus angustus (wildrye) and Medicago sativa (alfalfa), grown under hydrocarbon-stressed or non-stressed conditions, impacted the <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> of microbial communities in a weathered hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. <b>Degradation</b> <b>potential</b> was assessed using mineralization assays with 14 C-labeled hydrocarbons (hexadecane, naphthalene, phenanthrene) followed by DGGE of microbial communities and quantitative-PCR of genes associated with hydrocarbon degradation. All root exudates repressed hydrocarbon mineralization in soil microcosms, with exudates from hydrocarbon-stressed wildrye having the least repressive impact. Changes in <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> were not associated with changes in the dominant microbial community structure or with significant shifts in general microbial abundance. Degradation was, however, associated with functional changes in microbial communities. Mineralization of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was highly correlated with copy numbers of catechol 2, 3 dioxygenase and naphthalene dioxygenase, two genes involved in PAH degradation. Both gene copy numbers and mineralization parameters were significantly impacted by exudate composition, with specific compounds associated with either increased (acetate, alanine) or decreased (malonate) degradative capacity. The success of a given phytoremediation treatment is likely influenced by the relative amount of these and similar compounds within root exudates. 9 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} abundance, distribution, and <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> (in {{terms of}} degradation versus lack of degradation) for four xenobiotic compounds in an aerobic aquifer sediment {{have been examined}} in laboratory and field experiments. The xenobiotic compounds studied were benzene, toluene, o-xylene, and naphthalene (all at concentrations of approximately 120 micrograms/liter). The aerobic degradation experiments ran for approximately 90 days at 10 degrees C, which corresponded to the groundwater temperature. At {{the end of the}} experiment, the major part of the microbial biomass, quantified as acridine orange direct counts, was attached to the groundwater sediment (18 x 10 (6) to 25 x 10 (6) cells per g [dry weight], and only a minor part was unattached in the groundwater (0. 6 x 10 (6) to 5. 5 x 10 (6) cells per ml). Experiments involving aquifer sediment suspensions showed identical degradation potentials in the laboratory and in the field. However, laboratory experiments involving only groundwater (excluding aquifer sediment) showed less <b>degradation</b> <b>potential</b> than in situ experiments involving only groundwater, indicating that the manipulation or approach of the laboratory experiments could affect the determination of the degradation potentials. No differences were observed between the groundwater-only and the sediment compartments in the in situ experiments in the ability to degrade the compounds, but the maximum degradation rates were substantially lower in the groundwater-only compartment.

The mineralization rate was strongly affected by the matric potential (decreasing rate with decreasing matric potential) and by the initial distribution of the degraders (more aggregated distributions being associated with lower rates). The mineralization was diffusion-limited, as confirmed with a mathematical model. In wet conditions, extensive cell dispersal was observed for the flagellated wild type and, albeit to a lesser extent, for a nonflagellated mutant, partially relieving the diffusion limitation.

To this end, we characterized the composition of methanogenic and methanotrophic bacteria in samples taken from two regions of a municipal solid waste landfill that varied in age. A method combining polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and phylogenetic analysis was used for this purpose. 16 S rDNA sequence analysis revealed a rich assemblage of methanogens in both samples, including acetoclasts, H 2 /CO 2 -users and formate-users in the newer samples and H 2 /CO 2 -users and formate-users in the older samples, with closely related genera including Methanoculleus, Methanofollis, Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to clarify the possible roles of dissolved humic substances (HS) and dissolved organic matter (DOM). The possible roles of them are (1) they can deactivate the enzyme responsible for biodegradation (2) they can act as enzymatic substrate and (3) they can sequester the pollutant and protect it from enzymatic degradation. Degradation of phenanthrene using crude fungal ligninolytic enzymes from Agrocybe sp. CU 43 was slower with dissolved HS and Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) addition. Their enzyme activities using catechol assay were active in all conditions; therefore HS could not deactivate the enzymes. Four dissolved HS and DOM showed the capabilities to associate with phenanthrene and protect the contaminant from enzymatic degradation; consequently the phenanthrene bioavailability was decreased. The inhibitory effect of HS and DOM by competitive or linear mixed types suggest that HS and DOM could additionally be substrates for ligninolytic enzyme. Therefore, sorption and inhibitory effects of HS could be the possible mechanisms that govern enzymatic degradation rate of the pollutant in our system. Nature and extent of HS and DOM provide unique <b>degradation</b> <b>potentials</b> for aromatic organic pollutants.
