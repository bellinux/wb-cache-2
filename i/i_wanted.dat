5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to seek out. That's what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E

5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

5|$|According to some sources, Serbian king Peter <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> Tatiana as a bride for {{his younger}} son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the Serbian prime {{minister}} Nikola Pašić delivered {{a letter to}} Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but {{he noticed that the}} Serbian prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during a family dinner. Marriage negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I. Tatiana exchanged letters with Alexander during World War I and Alexander was distraught when he learned of her death.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to {{be almost}} like a photo album, so every single scene {{is kind of like}} a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E

5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to dispel that and get rid of that.

5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine.

I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange.

5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live.

5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me.

5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
