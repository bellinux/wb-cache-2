40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{attractive}} potential uses {{of ceramic materials}} as humidity sensors, some unavoidable drawbacks, including toxicity, poor biocompatibility, long response and recovery times, low sensitivity and high hysteresis have stymied {{the use of these}} materials in advanced applications. Therefore, in present investigation, we developed a capacitive humidity sensor using lead-free Ca,Mg,Fe,Ti-Oxide (CMFTO) -based <b>electro-ceramics</b> with perovskite structures synthesized by solid-state step-sintering. This technique helps maintain the submicron size porous morphology of the developed lead-free CMFTO <b>electro-ceramics</b> while providing enhanced water physisorption behaviour. In comparison with conventional capacitive humidity sensors, the presented CMFTO-based humidity sensor shows a high sensitivity of up to 3000 % compared to other materials, even at lower signal frequency. The best also shows a rapid response (14. 5 s) and recovery (34. 27 s), and very low hysteresis (3. 2 %) in a 33 %– 95 % relative humidity range which are much lower values than those of existing conventional sensors. Therefore, CMFTO nano-electro-ceramics appear to be very promising materials for fabricating high-performance capacitive humidity sensors...|$|E
40|$|In-situ neutron {{diffraction}} combined with AC impedance spectroscopy was applied successfully {{to investigate the}} correlation between crystal structure and electrical properties of the La 2 Mo 2 O 9 oxide ion conducting electrolyte material. Neutron diffraction patterns were collected {{as a function of}} temperature while the AC impedance spectra were recorded simultaneously using a modified sample environment to monitor the conductivity change of the sample. A close relationship between unit cell parameters and the bulk conductivity was observed, confirming that the oxygen transport is dependent on the lattice structure. With the transition from the low temperature alpha to the high temperature beta phase, expansion of the crystal structure makes more space available for oxygen transport, leading to a dramatic increase of the ionic conductivity. The successful application of this technique provides a new method to simultaneously investigate crystal structure and electrical properties in <b>electro-ceramics</b> in the future...|$|E
40|$|This paper details {{improvements}} of the d 33 {{coefficient for}} thick-film Lead–Zirconate–Titanate (PZT) layers. In particular, {{the effect that}} the powder milling process has on particle size, shape and distribution has been investigated. Ball milled, jet milled and attritor milled powders were obtained from Morgan <b>Electro-Ceramics</b> Ltd. These powders were mixed with various ratios of lead borosilicate glass in the range of 5 – 20 % by weight and an appropriate quantity of Electro-Science Laboratories (ESL) 400 solvent to formulate a screen printable thixotropic paste. The use of a polymer top electrode {{to reduce the number of}} firing cycles the PZT layer is subjected to was also investigated. The results show that the highest values of d 33 were obtained from the ball milled powder with 10 % glass content, but the most consistent results were obtained from the attritor milled samples. The samples printed with a polymer top electrode have shown an average increase of around 15 % in the value of d 33...|$|E
40|$|The {{prospect}} of using transition metals as primary dopants in ABO 3 -type perovskite high-temperature protonic conductors {{has not been}} extensively studied in literature so far. This work represents a pioneering effort in that direction, with a systematic investigation of homogeneous Co-doped Ba(Ce,Zr) O 3 (BCZC). The goal of this dissertation was to synthesize and characterize the novel class of <b>electro-ceramics</b> for simultaneous electrochemical (mixed protonic-electronic conductivity) and catalytic (CH 3 OH partial oxidation) activity for high-purity hydrogen production, with an aim towards understanding the influence of composition on micro-structural and functional properties. ^ A material belonging to the BCZC system was initially synthesized by oxalate co-precipitation and its phase composition, elemental composition, electrochemical properties, catalytic activity and stability investigated during {{the first phase of}} this dissertation. The synthesized material, homogeneous in powder form, was observed to be catalytically active towards hydrogen generation via CH 3 OH partial oxidation and displayed promising electrochemical properties in the presence of wet hydrogen. Results also indicated that the material developed an intricate micro-structure upon sintering that was prone to hydrolysis and reduction under wet hydrogen at elevated temperatures. ^ A series of materials belonging to the BCZC system, with varying Co doping and A:B cation mol ratios, were then synthesized by solid state reaction. Phase composition, electrochemical properties and catalytic activities of the materials were analyzed with respect to both parameters. Results indicated that sustained exposure to wet reducing atmospheres mitigated electrochemical and catalytic properties of the materials and that tailoring the composition could provide an optimum between stability and functionality. ^ This dissertation was driven by the hypothesis that the use of transition metals as primary dopants for ABO 3 -type perovskite protonic conductors would create a unique class of mixed-conducting <b>electro-ceramics</b> with added catalytic activity for achieving the objective of high-purity hydrogen production. Analysis of the BCZC system confirmed the hypothesis but material stability was observed to be a significant challenge in its implementation towards the overall objective. Based upon those findings, initial synthesis and electrochemical characterization of a different material belonging to the Fe-doped BaZrO 3 (BZF) system was carried out in order to establish successful resolution of material stability and to further explore the central hypothesis of this dissertation. ^ Overall, the present work introduces novel, transition metal-doped ABO 3 -type perovskite protonic conductors as potential bi-functional materials for simultaneous hydrogen generation and purification. The comprehensive structural and functional investigation of Co-doped Ba(Ce,Zr) O 3 also provides a basis for analyzing and optimizing other such systems in future. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{impedance}} spectroscopy (IS) is {{a versatile}} tool {{to study the}} effect of grains (bulk), grain boundaries and electrode-electrolyte interface on dielectric and electrical properties of <b>electro-ceramics.</b> This study only focuses the high frequency (1 kHz to 10 MHz) probe of bulk ferroelectric capacitance near ferroelectric phase transition temperature (FPTT). The PZTFW single phase and PZTFW-CFO composites, respectively, have been investigated to understand the microstructure-property relation. Keeping in mind the complex microstructure of both systems, low frequency (less than 1 kHZ) impedance investigation, which basically deals with grain boundaries and electrode-interfaces, has been ignored. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, microstructures, dielectric spectra, and impedance plots revealed two distinct phases, inbuilt compressive strain, small shift in dielectric maximum temperature, and two activation energy regions, respectively, in PZTFW-CFO composite compare to PZTFW ceramic. Addition of CFO in PZTFW medium purified the impurity phases present in the PZTFW matrix. The PZTFW-CFO composite shows flat dielectric behavior and high dielectric constant near FPTT at high frequency may be useful for tunable dielectric capacitors. The changes in bulk capacitance, relaxation time and constant phase element parameters have probed in the proximity of FPTT regions. Nyquist plot and modulus formalism show a poly-dispersive nature of relaxation, relate the activation energy (Ea) of oxygen vacancies, mainly responsible for the bulk capacitive conduction. A spiral kind of modulus spectra was observed at elevated temperatures and frequencies (greater than 2 MHz) suggests the possible experimental artifacts, have no physical reasons to explain.

40|$|La 2 Mo 2 O 9, {{as a new}} fast ionic conductor, {{has been}} {{investigated}} widely due to its high ionic conductivity which is {{comparable to those of}} the commercialized materials. However, little work has been reported on the oxygen transport and diffusion in this candidate electrolyte material. The main purpose of this project was to investigate oxide ion diffusion in La 2 Mo 2 O 9 and also the factors which could affect oxygen transport properties. Oxygen isotope exchange followed by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements were employed to obtain oxygen diffusion profiles. A correlation between oxygen ion transport and the electrochemical properties such as ionic conductivity was built upon the Nernst Einstein equation relating the diffusivity to electrical conductivity. In-situ neutron diffraction and AC impedance measurements were designed and conducted to investigate the correlation between crystal structure and oxygen transport in the bulk materials. Other techniques, such as synthesis, microstructure studies, and thermal analysis were also adopted to study the electrochemical properties of La 2 Mo 2 O 9. The results of the study on the effects of microstructure on oxygen diffusion in La 2 Mo 2 O 9 revealed that the grain boundary component {{played a significant role in}} electrochemical performance, although the grain size seemed to have little influence on oxygen transport. The oxygen isotope exchange in 18 O 2 was successfully carried out by introducing a silver coating on the sample surface, which solved the main difficulty in applying oxygen isotope exchange on pure ionic conductors. The ionic conductivity obtained from the diffusion coefficients was consistent with the result from AC impedance spectroscopy. The number of mobile oxygen ions was estimated to be 5 per unit cell. There was a difference of oxygen self diffusion coefficient when the isotope exchange was conducted in 18 O 2 and H 2 18 O. The activation energy of oxygen diffusion in humidified atmosphere was higher than that measured in dry atmosphere. It indicated that the humidified atmosphere had affected oxygen transport in the material. The studies on hydroxyl incorporation and transport explained the decreased oxygen diffusion coefficients in wet atmosphere and also suggested proton conductivity in La 2 Mo 2 O 9, which leads to further investigation on applications of La 2 Mo 2 O 9 as a proton conductor. In-situ neutron diffraction and AC impedance measurement revealed a close relationship between crystal structure and ionic conductivity. The successful application of this technique provides a new method to simultaneously investigate crystal structure and electrical properties in <b>electro-ceramics</b> in the future.
