40|$|Saliva is an {{alternative}} biologic specimen for drugs-of-abuse testing with several advantages over conventional matrices such as blood and urine (1, 2), e. g., weak bases tend to concentrate in saliva because its pH is usually more acidic than the pH of plasma.

40|$|I Abstract [Saliva or "oral fluid " {{has been}} {{presented}} as an alternative matrix {{in the establishment of}} drug exposure. The noninvasive collection of a saliva sample, which is relatively easy to perform and can be achieved under close supervision, {{is one of the most}} important benefits in a driving under the influence situation. Moreover, the presence of Ag-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in oral fluid is a better indication of recent use than when the drug is detected in urine, so there is a higher probability that the subject is experiencing pharmacological effects at the time of sampling. At 3 check points organized by the Swiss police in Bern, 61 drivers were tested for the presence of drugs of abuse using the <b>Drugwipe</b> 5 device. In parallel, oral fluid was collected with the Intercept DOA Oral Specimen Collection device and tested by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after methylation of THC (limit of quantitation 1 ng/mL).

40|$|AbstractThe {{question}} posed by this research involves how frequently one {{can expect to}} contact cocaine in day-to-day living experiences where drug use may not normally be suspected. Issues concerning contamination are germane to medico-legal investigators who evaluate the significance of drug test results in (1) questioned deaths, (2) public health concerns, (3) drugs crimes, and (4) drug use toxicological tests potentially caused by external contamination, such as hair, sweat, and skin swabs. Previous surface studies focus mainly on currency drug contamination; few have addressed other common surfaces. Public surfaces handled by {{a large number of}} people, such as building entrance door handles, bank currency dispensing machines, food store shopping carts, and service station fuel pumps within the New Haven, Connecticut metropolitan area were tested. Socio-economically, the distribution of items tested ranged from working-class to upper-middle class areas. Results were obtained using the Securetec <b>Drugwipe</b> II® which is an immunological, on-site test device. Precautions were taken to avoid carry-over and other potential contamination from handling including single-use latex gloves which were pre-tested as a negative control immediately before swabbing. Analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and in the laboratory to standardize conditions. <b>Drugwipe</b> II® limit of detection (LOD) is ∼ 50 ng. Test results revealed 78 % positive for cocaine substances as follows: fuel pump buttons for credit card authorization, 100 % positive (n= 10 individual locations); ATM machines for currency withdrawal, 100 % positive (n= 10 individual locations); grocery store shopping carts, 70 % positive; academic building entrance doors, 30 % positive (n= 10); and shopping mall entrance/exit doors, 100 % positive (n= 5). Forensic scientists and medico-legal investigators responsible for interpreting surface test results are cautioned to consider contamination before ascribing drug activity to a specific individual. For legal proceedings these results are indicative but not conclusive because immunological tests are considered presumptive and may react with the parent substance (cocaine), related compounds (benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methyl ester, ecgonine, nor-ecgonine, and cocaethylene) and immunologically similar materials...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of two on-site oral fluid testing devices on the market (Dräger DrugTest ® and <b>Drugwipe</b> ® 5). The on-site test results were compared with plasma (GC-MS) and oral fluid results (LC-MS-MS). A total of 178 Dräger DrugTests and 140 Drugwipes were performed. Unfortunately, no complete satisfactory results were obtained for either of both on-site devices for amphetamines and cocaine (sensitivity < 86 %, accuracy < 93 %). Also in the case of cannabis positive samples, no acceptable results were obtained (sensitivity < 51 %, accuracy < 60 %). Due to the limited number of opiate-positive samples, no statement can be made about this group of illicit drugs. In addition, comparison was performed between the oral fluid results and the analysed plasma samples and/or on-site urine tests. The analytical evaluation indicates a fairly good correlation of preserved oral fluid and plasma samples...|$|E
40|$|New {{technology}} {{is currently being}} marketed to rapidly test oral fluids for drugs of abuse {{at the point of}} collection (PC) C).

40|$|Oral fluid (OF) tests aid in {{identifying}} drivers {{under the influence}} of drugs. In this study, 17 heavy cannabis users consumed alcohol to achieve steady blood alcohol concentrations of 0 to 0. 7 g/L and smoked cannabis 3 h afterward. OF samples were obtained before and up to 4 h after smoking and on-site tests were performed (Drager DrugTest 5000 and Securetec <b>DrugWipe</b> 5 +). Maximum concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) immediately after smoking (up to 44, 412 ng/g) were below 4, 300 (median 377) ng/g 1 h after smoking and less than 312 (median 88) ng/g 3 h later with 5 of 49 samples negative, suggesting that recent cannabis use might occasionally not be detectable. An influence of alcohol was not observed. Drinking 300 mL variably influenced THC concentrations (median only 29. 6), which suggests that drinking does not markedly affect on-site test performance. Many (92) Drger tests performed 4 h after smoking were still positive, indicating sufficient sensitivity for recent cannabis use. Differences in the results of a roadside study with DrugTest 5000 (sensitivity 84. 8, specificity 96. 0, accuracy 84. 3) could be explained by a higher number of true negatives, differences between OF and serum and differences between occasional and chronic users...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of eight on-site oral fluid drug screening devices was studied in Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands {{as a part}} of the EU-project DRUID. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the reliability of the devices for testing drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs (DRUID). The {{performance of}} the devices was assessed by their ability to detect substances using cut-offs which were set at sufficiently low levels to allow optimal detection of positive DRUID cases. The devices were evaluated for the detection of amphetamine(s), cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines when the relevant test was incorporated. Methamphetamine, MDMA and PCP tests that were included in some devices were not evaluated since there were too few positive samples. The device results were compared with confirmation analysis results in oral fluid. The opiates tests appeared to perform relatively well with sensitivity results between 69 and 90 %. Amphetamines and benzodiazepines tests had lower sensitivity, although the <b>DrugWipe</b> test evaluated was promising for amphetamine. In particular, it is evident that the cannabis and cocaine tests of the devices still lack sensitivity, although further testing of the cocaine tests is desirable due to the low prevalence and low concentrations encountered in this study.

40|$|Consultable des del TDXTítol obtingut de la portada digitalitzada 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, «ecstasy») 3 ' is a 'psychedelic amphetamine' {{that has}} gained {{popularity}} {{over the past}} 20 years because {{of its ability to}} produce strong feelings of comfort, empathy, and connection to others. MDMA analysis in blood and urine samples have been consistently used for clinical pharmacology studies and forensic science cases. However, new developments in clinical toxicology require new analytical approaches and the use of alternative biological matrices for establishing whether individuals have consumed the drug, when and/or if they have been acting under the effect of the drug. It is postulated that MDMA physic-chemical properties: (i) pKa of around 9. 9 corresponding to a weak base that facilitates the transfer of MDMA from plasma (pH= 7. 4) to fluids/matrices with a favourable pH gradient, (ii) high liposolubility with volumes of distribution between 6 and 7 liters per kilogram, (iii) low protein binding, favour its distribution to biological matrices in humans. Several non-conventional biological matrices such as hair, sweat and saliva, because of drug accumulation due to its physico-chemical properties, might be of use for the detection of past and recent exposure to MDMA. Three different studies were set-up. The study 1 investigating the pharmacokinetics of MDMA in saliva after a single oral dose administration of 100 mg to eight healthy volunteers, the second investigating the pharmacokinetics of MDMA in sweat after a single dose administration of 100 mg to eight healthy volunteers, and finally a study on segmental analysis of MDMA in hair of thirteen drug consumers with different patterns of consumption [...] The first study evidenced that MDMA is excreted in saliva, after a single 100 mg dose administration, with concentrations (range 1728. 9 - 6510 µg/ml at 1. 5 h after drug intake) one order of magnitude higher than those observed in plasma (range 134. 9 - 223 µg/ml at 1. 5 h after drug intake) and following a time course kinetics which parallels that of plasma and that of subjective effects and psychomotor performance. On-site testing by <b>Drugwipe</b> device proved suitable to detect individuals under the influence of drug effects in the first 6 hours after drug intake by non-invasive and rapid collection of salivary specimens. The second study showed that MDMA appears in sweat and can be quantified already in the first few hours after a single dose administration, when subjective effects are apparent (concentration range 3. 2 - 1326 ng/pacth). This result makes: the sweat patch technology useful for monitoring MDMA accumulation in sweat at least during the 24 hours after a single administration, On-site sweat testing by <b>drugwipe</b> device suitable to detect individuals under the influence of drug effects by non-invasive and rapid collection of minute amounts of sweat. MDMA appears in hair from consumers (concentration range 1. 2 - 12. 6 ng/mg hair) and can be detected in hair segments corresponding to the last one, six and twelve month of repeated drug use. For this reason: Hair analysis of MDMA can be used to evaluate exposure or abstinence to the drug in the last months, hair concentration of MDMA in different hair segments can predict levels of drug use(r 2 = 0. 92) and can be eventually associated to chronic psychophysical effects induced by the repeated drug use. The measurement of MDMA in saliva is a valuable alternative to determination of plasma drug concentrations both in clinical and toxicological studies A common characteristic of the three different matrices is that the parent drug MDMA was always the principal, most abundant analyte detected, whose concentration could be associated with drug-induced effects and drug history. As already assessed, drug analysis in hair extends the information of drug consumption to a wider time-window than that of other non-invasive biological matrices, such as saliva and sweat. These latter two matrices can account for acute pharmacological effects induced by the drug, while results from hair testing can be used to assess repeated exposure to drug and eventual association with long term drug induced effects, such as neurotoxicity and psychological performance in the specific case of MDMA...|$|E
