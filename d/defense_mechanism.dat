Being a prey species, the primary <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism</b> of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E

Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both interspecific and intraspecific – in their aposematic coloration. This is surprising given the frequency-dependent nature of this type of <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{high level}} of stress in modern society poses a need to study family factors and {{resources}} {{for the development of}} children’s <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the current social environment. This study investigates correlations between maternal and child psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> using interviews, a structured clinical survey, projective drawing, and a projective game. Analysis of data from 240 people (120 children and 120 mothers) revealed specifics of the formation of psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> among children aged 4 to 12 years in child-mother relationships. We suggest that maternal and child <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have some isomorphic traits, but the level and quality of isomorphism changes with each age period of the child. Certain defensive mechanisms of mother and child appear with the same frequency. The child’s gender influences the correlation between the mother’s and child’s psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Initially, children are more likely to directly copy <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> observed from the mother’s behavior. As they grow older, they use defenses that they have learned consciously. Based on empirical data, we also found a correlation between the maturity of the maternal psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and specifics of child psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We propose that the maturity of maternal psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> has the greatest meaning for child psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> at the earliest stages of ontogenesis — it provides consistency between the mother’s own psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and the psychological <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that she teaches her child...|$|R
5|$|It {{is likely}} that a multicomponent, {{adaptive}} immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms {{that appear to be}} precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism,</b> called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism</b> of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E
50|$|Sigmund Freud {{proposed}} {{a set of}} <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in one’s body. These set of <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> occur so one can hold a favorable or preferred view of themselves. For example, in a particular situation when an event occurs that violates ones preferred view of themselves, Freud stated {{that it is necessary}} for the self to have some mechanism to defend itself against this unfavorable event; this is known as <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Freud’s work on <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> focused on how the ego defends itself against internal events or impulses, which are regarded as unacceptable to one’s ego.

5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism</b> has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E

We give a general insight into <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in psychoanalysis and how we transfer this theory to multi-agent systems. We describe the kinds of conflicts in the decision making process of software agents where the implementation of psychoanalytic <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> help to improve the stability of the system and to enhance the performance of the decision making unit. We explain different aspects and important notions which have to be obeyed while implementing <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in cognitive systems. Therefore, we provide some example detection rules to find conflicting data, conflicting drives, conflicting action plans, and conflicting intentions in cognitive systems. These detection rules help to exclude unreal input data from the environment by performing a reality check. <b>Defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which we implemented are repression, denial, and reaction formation.

25|$|A more {{recently}} suggested <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism</b> of infidelity attracting more attention and {{research is the}} idea that a particular social group will punish cheaters by damaging their individual reputation (Fisher et al., 2009). The basis for this suggestion {{stems from the fact that}} humans have an unmatched ability to monitor social relationships and inflict punishment on cheaters, regardless of the context (Scheuring, 2010). This punishment comes in many forms, one of which is social gossip about the behaviour. Social Gossip ostracizes the individual from the group by damaging his or her reputation. This damage will impair the future benefits that individual can confer from the group and its individuals (Scheuring, 2010). A damaged reputation is especially debilitating when related to sexual and emotional infidelity because it can limit future reproductive mate choices within the group and will cause a net fitness cost that outweighs the fitness benefit gained from the infidelity (Fisher et al., 2010). Such limitations and costs deter an individual from cheating in the first place. Support for this <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism</b> comes from fieldwork by Hirsch and his colleagues (2007) that found that gossip about extramarital affairs in a small community in Mexico was particularly prevalent and devastating for reputation in this region. Specifically, adultery was found to cause an individual to be disowned by their family, decrease the marriage value of his/her family, cause an individual to lose money or a job, and diminish future reproductive potential. In this community, men having extramarital were extremely tactful in that they desired to do so in private areas with lower prevalence of women connected to the community such as bars and brothels, both areas of which had a high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STI's). The fact that men in this community were more willing to risk their own physical well-being in order to engage in extramarital sexual activity reveals a strong desire to maintain their social reputations, thus offering support for social punishment as a <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism</b> for preventing infidelity.|$|E
