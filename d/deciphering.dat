5|$|The codex {{has played}} a key role in the <b>deciphering</b> of Mayan hieroglyphs. Dresden {{librarian}} Ernst Wilhelm Förstemann published the first complete facsimile in 1880. He deciphered the calendar section of the codex, including the Maya numerals used therein. Förstemann determined that these numbers, along with deities and day names, related to the Mayan calendar and the Mayan Long Count calendar. In the 1950s Yuri Knorozov used a phonetic approach based on the De Landa alphabet for decoding the codex, which was followed up in the 1980s by other scholars that did additional <b>deciphering</b> based on this concept.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} the <b>Decipher</b> genomic classifier in predicting metastasis from analysis of prostate needle biopsy diagnostic tumor tissue specimens. Materials and MethodsFifty-seven patients with available biopsy specimens were identified from a cohort of 169 men treated with radical prostatectomy in a previously reported <b>Decipher</b> validation study at Cleveland Clinic. A Cox multivariable proportional hazards model and survival C-index were used to {{evaluate the}} performance of <b>Decipher.</b> ResultsWith a median follow up of 8 years, 8 patients metastasized and 3 died of prostate cancer. The <b>Decipher</b> plus National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) model had an improved C-index of 0. 88 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 77 - 0. 96) compared to NCCN alone (C-index 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 64 - 0. 87). On multivariable analysis, <b>Decipher</b> was the only significant predictor of metastasis when adjusting for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen and biopsy Gleason score (<b>Decipher</b> hazard ratio per 10 % increase 1. 72, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 2. 81, P[*]=[*]. 02). ConclusionBiopsy <b>Decipher</b> predicted the risk of metastasis at 10 years post radical prostatectomy. While further validation is required on larger cohorts, preoperative knowledge of <b>Decipher</b> risk derived from biopsy could indicate the need for multimodality therapy and help set patient expectations of therapeutic burden...|$|R

5|$|Several highly {{acclaimed}} {{editions of}} Schubert's last sonatas are available, namely those of Bärenreiter, Henle, Universal, and Oxford University Press. These editions have, however, occasionally received some criticism {{for the wrong}} interpretation or notation of Schubert's intentions, {{on issues such as}} <b>deciphering</b> the correct pitches from the manuscript, notating tremoli, discriminating between accent and decrescendo markings, and reconstructing missing bars.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{supposed}} <b>deciphering</b> of the Egyptian alphabet in July and October 1835, Smith ostensibly translated {{the majority of}} the Book of Abraham in November 1835 and did some minor revisions in March 1842. In translating the book, Smith dictated and Phelps, Warren Parrish, and Frederick G. Williams acted as scribes. The complete work was first published serially in Times and Seasons in 1842, and was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of its Pearl of Great Price.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the <b>deciphering</b> of the Maya hieroglyphic script, {{scholars}} have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E
50|$|Most of the London {{fragments}} of the codex were <b>deciphered</b> and published by Constantin von Tischendorf in 1857; {{the rest of the}} codex with the Bristol fragments were <b>deciphered</b> by F. W. Gotch in 1881.|$|R

5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone {{proved to be the}} key to <b>deciphering</b> Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the code books proved to provide a {{significant}} advantage for the Royal Navy. The Admiralty had recently created a <b>deciphering</b> department known as Room 40 to process intercepted German wireless signals. With the code books and cipher key, the British were able to track the movements of most German warships; this information could {{be passed on to}} the Admiral John Jellicoe, the commander of the Grand Fleet. This allowed the British to ambush parts of or the entire German fleet on several occasions, most successfully at the Battles of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and Jutland in May 1916.|$|E

Perceval sold the estate to the Bristol merchant and member of parliament Richard Cole in 1582 and it was passed down to his descendants.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern {{scientific}} archaeology in the Maya region, with the meticulous work of Alfred Maudslay and Teoberto Maler. By the early 20th century, the Peabody Museum was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula. In the first {{two decades of}} the 20th century, advances were made in <b>deciphering</b> the Maya calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts. Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across the Maya region.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, <b>deciphering</b> it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E

5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in <b>deciphering</b> the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks.

5|$|Following {{break-out}} by the US 1st and 3rd Armies {{from the}} beachhead during the Battle of Normandy after Operation Cobra on 25 July 1944, Adolf Hitler ordered an immediate counterattack against Allied {{forces in the}} form of Operation Lüttich. Lieutenant General Omar Bradley—the commanding general of the US 12th Army Group—was notified of the counterattack in advance through signals intercepted via Ultra radio intercepts and <b>deciphering</b> and thus prepared his troops and their commanders to defeat this counteroffensive and to encircle as much of the Wehrmacht force as possible. By the afternoon of 7 August, Operation Lüttich had been defeated by concerted, large-scale fighter-bomber air strikes against the German tanks and trucks. In the process, forces of the German 7th Army became further enveloped by the Allied advance out of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The {{agents of}} the Catholic Church wrote {{detailed}} accounts of the Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire. This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America. In 1839, American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood. Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya {{to the attention of}} the world. The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of the Maya, and the first steps in <b>deciphering</b> Maya hieroglyphs.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two improve-ments to the beam search {{approach}} for solving homophonic substitution ciphers presented in Nuhn et al. (2013) : An im-proved rest cost estimation {{together with an}} optimized strategy for obtaining the or-der in which the symbols of the cipher are <b>deciphered</b> reduces the beam size needed to successfully <b>decipher</b> the Zodiac- 408 cipher from several million down to less than one hundred: The search effort is re-duced from several hours of computation time {{to just a few}} seconds on a single CPU. These improvements allow us to success-fully <b>decipher</b> {{the second part of the}} fa-mous Beale cipher (see (Ward et al., 1885) and e. g. (King, 1993)) : Having 182 differ-ent cipher symbols while having a length of just 762 symbols, the decipherment is way more challenging than the decipher-ment of the previously <b>deciphered</b> Zodiac- 408 cipher (length 408, 54 different sym-bols).
