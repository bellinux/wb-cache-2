We studied <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>bearing</b> estimates {{as a function of}} the parameters frequency, frequency bandwidth, SNR, and analysis window length using seismic signals recorded on a three-component high-frequency (> 50 Hz) seis-mic element (HFSE) located at the NORESS array in Norway. We found that the time-bandwidth product (TB) and SNR are the most important factors <b>in</b> reducing the <b>bearing</b> estimation error.

We also found that three-component signals contain bearing information at frequencies as high as 45 Hz when there is sufficient SNR in the signal. Bearing estimation performance can be significantly improved by the appropriate selection of signal parameters, such as window length and frequency. Since these parameters are usually unknown, we propose a parameter variation technique that extracts the best answer by first determining the bearing distribution {{as a function of the}} above parameters. The results of this study indicate that with a single three-component station and for high (__> 5) SNR, the parameter variation method can determine the bearings of events to within a standard deviation of 6 °, which is similar to the uncertainty <b>in</b> NORESS array <b>bearing</b> estimates for the same events...|$|R

40|$|The Terzaghi {{superposition}} assumption {{has been}} widely {{used to determine the}} bearing capacity of shallow footings. Although this assumption always errs on the safe side, a rigorous procedure to calculate the bearing capacity is still of engineering value. This paper presents such a procedure that is free from errors {{as a result of the}} superposition assumption. It demonstrates that the ultimate bearing capacity can be precisely expressed by the Terzaghi equation, except that the bearing capacity factor N y is dependent upon the surcharge ratio. A recently developed numerical method, i. e., the critical slip field method, is used to calculate the modification coefficient for modifying N y It is found that this modification coefficient increases with the surcharge ratio at small values of surcharge ratio and then remains constant for large values of surcharge ratio. However, the errors invoked by the superposition assumption do not exceed 10 %. On the basis of numerical calculations, a simple closed-form expression of the modification coefficient is proposed that yields the theoretically rigorous ultimate <b>bearing</b> capacity. <b>In</b> the later part of the paper, <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity calculations owing to the use of conventional procedures are analyzed. It is concluded that the continued use of conventional procedures is justified, but the inherent errors should not be neglected in assessing the performance of shallow foundations. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Many bat species live in groups, {{some of them}} {{in highly}} complex social systems, but the reasons for sociality in bats remain largely unresolved. Increased {{foraging}} efficiency through passive information transfer in species foraging for ephemeral insects has been postulated as a reason for group formation of male bats in the temperate zones. We hypothesized that benefits from group hunting might also entice tropical bats of both sexes to live in groups. Here we investigate whether Molossus molossus, a small insectivorous bat in Panama, hunts in groups. We use a phased antenna array setup to reduce <b>error</b> <b>in</b> telemetry <b>bearings.</b> Our results confirmed that simultaneously radiotracked individuals from the same colony foraged together significantly more than expected by chance. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that many bats are social because of information transfer between foraging group members. We suggest this reason for sociality to be more widespread than currently assumed. Furthermore, benefits from group hunting may also have contributed to the evolution of group living in other animals specialized on ephemeral food sources...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Texas A&M IMProved Accuracy from Combined Technology (IMPACT) lightning detector has been analyzed for 1997 and 1998 - 99 to determine detection characteristics. These characteristics include stroke detection efficiency as a function of range and azimuth, site errors, signal strength, attenuation coefficient, and peak current. Cloud-to-ground (CG) return stroke measurements from the IMPACT detector were compared to National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) measurements to determine these detection characteristics. Because the IMPACT detector's sensitivity was increased in 1998, was determined that a higher stroke detection efficiency occurred in 1998 - 99. The IMPACT sensor's signal strength amplitudes were also affected by the increased sensitivity. The sensor's range-normalized signal strengths (RNSS) were 1. 6 times higher in 1998 - 99 than in 1997. These were corrected using a calibration factor determined statistically from IMPACT and NLDN RNSS values. Results from peak current analyses show that the increased sensitivity caused a higher percentage of weak signals to be detected. Electromagnetic Gelds from CG lightning channels are attenuated with distance. Attenuation coefficients are a function of geographical area. A coefficient of 1. 14 was determined for the area 1000 km within the IMPACT detector location. A site error correction curve was used to correct for azimuthal <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>bearings</b> to CG stroke locations. Errors were reduced to less than 4 ? in most cases. The IMPACT detector uses a crossed-loop magnetic field antenna to determine stroke location bearings and magnetic field amplitudes. Analyzing sisal strengths revealed that strokes in the north-south direction had amplitudes approximately 20 % higher than strokes in the east-west direction. This {{is a result of the}} north-south loop of the antenna being more sensitive than the east-west loop. This condition also affected the detection efficiency of the IMPACT sensor as a function of range. Efficiency minima in the north and south directions predicted by theory are not present...|$|R

Eight of the moorings carried vector-measuring current meters (VMCMs), the ninth had an upward-looking ADCP. Coverage areas of the HF radars and moorings included diverse flow and sea-state regimes. Measurement depths were; 1 m for the HF radars, 5 m for the VMCMs, and 3. 2 m for the ADCP bin nearest to the surface. Comparison of radial current components from 18 HF radar–mooring pairs yielded rms speed differences of 7 – 19 cm s 21 and correlation coefficients squared (r 2) in the range of 0. 39 – 0. 77. Spectral analysis showed significant coherence for frequencies below 0. 1 cph (periods longer than 10 h). At higher frequencies no significant coherence was found, and noise levels corresponding to 6 cm s 21 rms were evident in the radar data. <b>Errors</b> <b>in</b> the radar <b>bearing</b> determination were found in 10 out of 18 comparisons, with a typical magnitude of 58 – 108, and a maximum of 198.

40|$|The {{seismic method}} <b>in</b> the {{ultimate}} <b>bearing</b> capacity of piles based on {{shear wave velocity}} measurement is a new technique in geotechnical engineering design. In this study, the value of shear wave velocity, Vs is being successfully used to formulate a theory to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of piles. This theory is adapted from the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundation proposed by Keceli. Keceli’s formula is adapted by equating the pile tip vertical resistance of the seismic formula to the end bearing capacity of the pile tip for each layer. The sum of half the vertical resistance of each layer is then equated to the total shaft resistance of the pile. The end tip is then added to the total shaft resistance to give the total ultimate pile bearing capacity of the pile. This study was conducted at three sites, two sites of residual soil located in Malaysia and one site of alluvial soil situated at Collierville, Tennessee, USA. The results of the adapted seismic formula were compared with the static pile bearing capacities calculated using conventional methods proposed by Meyerhof for the SPT-N values and the Schmertmann, Bustamante and Gianeslli method for the SCPTu values. The percentage <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the ultimate <b>bearing</b> capacity of the piles between the adapted seismic and the conventional methods for all the sites were found to be- 4. 77 %,- 3. 01 % and- 0. 93 % at Hulu Langat, Mutiara Damansara an...|$|R
