2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} the AW119 Koala {{has developed a}} reputation as one of the safest helicopters in its class. Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> {{are most}} useful in {{situations}} where critical infrastructure has been compromised or does not exist. Benefits of using a flexible storage system like <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> is their ability to be transported and set up quickly. GMA Cover Corp. advertises that their pillow shaped bladders are foldable at less than 5% of the total volume. [...] Other unique characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> are their high resistance to climatic conditions, which makes them useful for use in disaster zones and wartime desert operations.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> {{are used}} in various fields, such as agribusiness, public works, humanitarian, {{military}} and industrial areas. Standard tanks are designed for land based use and operations, but {{can be used in}} marine settings and in aviation given proper support. <b>Fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> are also commonly used in oil spill recovery operations.|$|R
50|$|High end <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> offer a {{high degree}} of {{protection}} of the stored liquids, ensuring the contents never come in contact with air. This ensures that there is no risk of evaporation or explosion due to gas formation. In order to prevent liquid contamination, a neutral barrier film is added to the <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder's</b> inner side.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, the 180th {{with four}} C-130H2 {{aircraft}} deployed to Kimhae International Airport, Republic of Korea {{in support of}} Operation Team Spirit 1989. During the exercise, the 180th flew challenging missions including tactical resupply, <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> missions, assault landings on short runways including landing on highway landing strips, numerous airdrop missions including both visual, high altitude and radar drop scenarios.|$|E
50|$|The early {{tanks were}} of welded {{aluminium}} structure with the sealing material applied as a composite layer on the outside. A major problem with welded aluminium tanks is weld decay and metal fatigue in the seams due to vibration in service. In response to this, the company started to develop flexible fuel bladders {{in the early}} 1940s. One of the earliest examples of this was a composite flexible <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> with self-sealing coatings for the Supermarine Spitfire MkIX.|$|E
50|$|Serling notices {{inconsistencies}} {{between the}} testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario (Matt Damon), the medic, praises Walden strongly. However, Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward {{and that he}} led the crew in combat and improvised the <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> weapon. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and unconscious throughout. Furthermore, {{the crew of the}} Black Hawk claim that they heard firing from an M16, but Ilario and Monfriez deny they had one.|$|E

50|$|EGMME {{had been}} {{certified}} as a pesticide by the EPA, {{but as the}} requirement changes raised the certification costs, DEGMME has no official pesticide certification. DEGMME is a potent solvent, and at high concentrations can damage <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> and filters. Long-term storage of FSII-fuel mixtures is therefore not recommended.|$|R
5000|$|Some Abrams were {{disabled}} by Iraqi infantrymen in ambushes employing short-range antitank rockets, {{such as the}} Russian RPG-7, {{during the}} 2003 invasion. Although the RPG-7 is unable to penetrate the front and sides, the rear and top are vulnerable to this weapon. Frequently the rockets were fired at the tank tracks. [...] Another was put out of action in the Battle of Baghdad after being struck by numerous medium caliber weapons, including 12.7mm rounds which ruptured a <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> stored on an external rack. This started a fire that spread to the engine.|$|E
5000|$|... 1998 : Narrow track era {{begins in}} Formula One, width of car reduced from 2 metres to 1.8 metres with teams now running rubber with grooves in (4 {{on the rear}} and 3 on the front) to reduce {{the speed of the}} cars, {{asymmetric}} braking banned, X-wings banned, single <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> mandatory, refueling connector must be covered, cockpit dimensions increased, side impact test now to use 100% more energy, tyre barrier effectiveness increased, pit lane must now have 100 m of straight running before first pit garage, increased use of pit lane lights alongside flags.|$|E
50|$|Later, Serling is {{assigned}} to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) {{should be the first}} woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and when the survivors were rescued the next day, Walden was reported dead.|$|E
50|$|Each {{austral summer}} a United States Coast Guard {{icebreaker}} busts a ship channel to Marble Point {{in order to}} deliver helicopter fuel. The ship usually can reach within about one-quarter of {{a mile from the}} beach. Fuel is then pumped ashore. Formerly, personnel pumped the aviation fuel into 20,000 gallon bladders for storage. However, the <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> were replaced with steel tanks.|$|R

5000|$|The DPV {{was built}} by Chenowth Racing Products, Inc. The German Volkswagen Kübelwagen was the first {{military}} Light Utility Vehicle based on the Volkswagen Beetle which uses rear-wheel rather than four-wheel drive for mobility. Volkswagen components were also {{the basis for the}} postwar dune buggy, and its layout is used in the DPV with rear-mounted air-cooled [...] Volkswagen engine. This makes the lightweight vehicle capable of accelerating from 0 to 30 mph (0-50 km/h) in only four seconds and able to travel at speeds of up to 80 mph (130 km/h). With its standard 21 gallon (79.5 litre) fuel tank, the DPV has a range of about 210 miles (338 km). An optional <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> can extend the range to over 1,000 miles (1,610 km). Payload capacity is 1500 lb (680 kg).|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{bladders}} or fuel storage bladders are collapsible, flexible storage bladders (also {{known as}} tanks) that provide temporary or long term storage for industrial liquids (e.g. fuels). These pillow shaped tanks {{are designed for}} large volume liquid transport, industrial chemicals, potable water, sludge, and fuel storage. Standard <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> tanks sizes range from 100 gal to 200,000 gal capacities and larger and custom fuel storage bladders and cells are available, although at sizes exceeding 50,000 gal there is an increased spill risk. To {{minimize the risk of}} leakage, {{and for the sake of}} containing a catastrophic spill, all fuel bladders should be housed in secondary containment. The use of fuel bladders without precautionary measures is risky and should not be undertaken. The fines involved with fuel spills are well known and the EPA has set clear guidelines for the use of secondary containment concerning fuel bladders.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the summer}} of 1972 the {{battalion}} participated in a massive disaster relief effort, Operation Saklolo conducted {{in the northern part}} of the Philippines. On 12 April 1975, 2/4 took part in Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Americans from Phnom Penh, Cambodia. On 29-30 April they took part in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon.

50|$|A wet wing is an {{aerospace}} engineering technique where an aircraft's wing structure is sealed {{and used as}} a fuel tank. Wet wings are also called integral fuel tanks. By {{eliminating the need for}} <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders,</b> aircraft can weigh less and the wing root bending moment caused by the lift generated by the wings in flight is decreased. This offers further reduction in weight by allowing structural components to be designed lighter as the components do not need to support larger forces.|$|R
5000|$|August 1979 [...] "Tuscaloosa" [...] {{boarded a}} {{contingent}} of Marines to transport to Okinawa for exercises in the Northern Training area. Part of that contingent of Marines were dropped off at the Mt. Fuji training area where a majority of that unit died in a fire caused by a typhoon washing out <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> which poured <b>fuel</b> into the living quarters. The [...] "Tuscaloosa" [...] later returned to White Beach, late September 1979 to transport Marines to Pusan South Korea.|$|R
50|$|On 27 February 1974, a Soviet Union An-24LR {{carrying}} {{a crew of}} 3 and 10 scientists on an ice-reconnaissance mission landed at Gambell due to fuel exhaustion in bad weather, causing a minor Cold War incident. Villagers, mostly Yupik Native Americans, provided space heaters and food. A U.S. Air Force C-130 flew in a load of <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> with JP-1 <b>fuel</b> from Anchorage to refuel the An-24, which departed at 7:30 pm. She dipped her wings in salute in a pass over the airfield, then returned to Soviet airspace.|$|R
50|$|Reactivated as a Tactical Air Command troop carrier squadron, 1953. Performed Troop Carrier {{missions}} using {{tactical transport}} aircraft until 1971 when inactivated. In 1965 the squadron received twelve modified C-130E-(I)s for special operations use and began training {{with the new}} airplanes in early 1966. The C-130E-(I)s were assigned to Detachment One, 779th Troop Carrier Squadron. The 779th tactical airlift squadron was placed on alert shortly after the USS Pueblo was captured by North Koreain January 1968.They were deployed to Tachikawa, Japan shortly thereafter. After a few days at Tachikawa they were deployed to Cam Ranh Bay Viet Nam where they flew supply and troop transport during the TET offensive. While at Cam Ranh enemy rockets were fired at the base from the overlooking hills striking fuel drums and a <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> but no damage was don to the C-130s parked nearby. In Early April 1968 they returned to Pope AFB, NC and were replaced in Cam Ranh Bay by the 778th tactical Airlift Squadron also from Pope AFB, NC. The detachment was re-designated as the 318th Special Operations Squadron in the late 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Following her refit, Dominant was homeported in Charleston SC {{along with}} her entire {{squadron}} (the other [...] "D" [...] ships) From there, they departed for another European cruise. Port hopping via Halifax Nova Scotia and St.Johns Newfoundland for topping off, she and her squadron sailed unescorted to Campbelltown Scotland. She carried insufficient fuel in her tanks for the crossing so a 2,500 gallon <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> was installed on her fantail. The squadron made it with fuel to spare. This {{was reported to have}} made US Naval history; an MSO crossing the Atlantic unescorted. The cruise continued to Denmark where the squadron was engaged in Operation Love Song, a NATO exercise and then on to Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Spain and into the Mediterranean. They continued in the Med for several months with a maintenance stop in Naples. The squadron recrossed the Atlantic, sailing from the Straits of Gibraltar to Charleston in company with a destroyer tender which had completed her assignment in Naples. Dominant and the [...] "D" [...] squadron arrived in Charleston in early spring of 1971 and was rumored to be taken out of service soon.|$|E
5000|$|The CBC interviewed Inuit {{from the}} region in April 2008, about their {{concerns}} with the plans.Jaypetee Palluq, an Igloolik resident who {{had been asked to}} serve on a Baffinland advisory committee, was concerned that the mine's operation would interfere with the traditional hunts for sea mammals, like walrus. He called on Baffinland to [...] "find an alternate shipping route to the mine, regardless of the cost." [...] Paul Quassa, Mayor of Igloolik, also expressed concern, over the effect of freighters on the ice used by the Walrus. He said the region was known for its highly prized aged, fermented walrus meat, a valuable export {{from the region}}.In August 2008 the CBC reported that Baffinland acknowledged three fuel spills.Baffinland's vice-president of sustainable development, Derek Chubb, asserted that the three spills were contained within [...] "secondary engineered containment facilities", {{and that there was no}} environmental damage. 5000 L of aviation fuel leaked from a <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> at the mine's port facilities on Milne Inlet. The other two leaks of 200 L, occurred near the mine site. Baffinland acknowledged that the leaks had been found months earlier, but had not been made public. Michael Nadler, the regional director general of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs speculated that mine officials may not have felt an obligation to publicly report the leaks because they believed there had been no damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{incident}} {{took place}} {{during the height of the}} Cold War era. An Alaska State Trooper and members of the Alaska National Guard from Nome were dispatched to provide security for the plane. The Soviet Embassy in Washington was aware of the diversion and contacted the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense and requested fuel for the stranded plane. A U.S. Air Force C-130 plane with <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> took on a load of JP-1 fuel at Anchorage and flew directly to Gambell, where it refueled the plane.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operation}} {{was designed as}} a complex two-night mission. On the first night, the aircraft would enter Iran in a remote coastal area 60 miles west of Chabahar, and fly to Desert One (...) via the Dasht-e Lut desert.

5000|$|Prior to {{the start}} of a patrol, it is the driver's {{responsibility}} to ensure the craft is correctly set up and ready for patrolling duties. Typically this will involve inflating the crafts four pontoons to the correct pressure with a hand/foot or electric pump. The motor is test run in a tank of fresh water to check full function and reliability before installation to the transom. The <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> is filled and installed along with a tow rope, rescue tube, two oars, and a blunt point knife as minimum. A check list is then filled in by the driver, after which the IRB may be signed on for patrol by radioing [...] "Surf Command". At this point other patrol members assist to move the craft to a suitable launching position on the beach. The IRB is typically set up in a location outside the safe swimming area defined by the patrol flags. Where applicable, the boat may be towed onto the beach by way of a tractor or small jeep and trailer.When performing a rescue, the driver must negotiate large surf breaks and possibly obstacles such as rocks or other swimmers to reach the patient. The crewperson helps the driver by keeping a lookout for the patient and hazards. They are also instrumental in keeping the IRB balanced when crossing surf breaks and turning rapidly. The crewperson is also primarily responsible for bringing the patient on board, often during extremely dangerous and rapidly changing conditions, and looking after their welfare while at sea.|$|E
5000|$|IRBs {{are made}} of rubber and consist of four {{inflatable}} tubes - two side tubes, a bow tube and a keelson tube. This specific feature coupled with the obvious {{fact that they are}} used in the water, has coined the term [...] "rubber duck" [...] or simply [...] "duck" [...] to describe an IRB. Typically the rubber is coloured a shade of red termed 'Rescue Red' although a particular make of craft manufactured by Arancia come in a shade of orange.They have a rigid floor piece and a rigid transom for fitting an outboard motor (usually 25 hp).This motor is capable of providing a maximum drive speed of between 25-30 knots on flat water. 2-Stroke fuel is stored in a flexible <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> and is secured by 4 clips to the floor in the bow. An IRB is crewed by two people - an IRB Operator/Driver and an IRB Crewman. The Operator sits on {{the lower half of the}} port side pontoon where he operates the outboard motor to control the boat. He has a single foot strap to help him stay in the boat. His left hand can hold on to a strap on the port side pontoon and his right hand operates the outboard motor by means of a tiller arm and throttle. The Crewman sits on the upper half of the starboard side pontoon. A handle is attached by a rope to the nose of the boat for him to hold with his left hand, while his right hand may hold a strap attached to the starboard pontoon. He balances the boat and allows it to go over large waves before they break without flipping. He also assists when going through a breaking wave, commonly referred to as [...] "punching-through". As of 2011 only one foot strap is available for a crew member.|$|E
5000|$|A {{total of}} eight {{individual}} airtight chambers comprise the F470. The main hull or gunwale contains five intercommunicating chambers, which {{are separated by}} internal baffles and valves. This means that a single leak will not result in loss of pressure throughout the boat, and that air can be bled between chambers to compensate for loss in one. Two additional chambers, located below the gunwale on either side and called [...] "speed skags," [...] provide cushioning for the boat's occupants and additional buoyancy in case of pressure loss in the hull. The final chamber is an inflatable keel tube which runs {{the length of the}} craft and gives the bottom of the hull a [...] "V" [...] shape, imparting directional stability and additional shock absorption. A wooden [...] "transom" [...] board at the stern provides a mounting point for the outboard engine(s). The deck (floor) is composed of four interlocking aluminum plates, which are fixed to the [...] "thrust board" [...] at the bow end and the transom at the stern. This rigid structure, spanning the entire internal area of the boat, prevents the hull from collapsing or [...] "taco-ing" [...] under power.A ready-for-use craft includes an outboard engine (two in some configurations); removable aluminium deckplates or roll-up slatted decking; paddles; a bow line for securing the docked boat and a [...] "righting" [...] line which is used to flip the boat in the event of capsizing. At the bow of the boat are storage bags for equipment (foot pumps, extra lines, etc.) and a special <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder,</b> which can be of either 6- or 18-gallon capacity and which feeds the engine via a flexible hose. Deflated and rolled up, the boat and all necessary equipment can easily fit into the bed of a small pickup. Most military CRRC's use a [...] two-stroke engine with a pumpjet propulsor, which consists of a shrouded impeller. This design reduces the risk of serious injury to personnel in the water when compared to the traditional open propeller. It also reduces the risk of the propulsion system being seriously damaged by submerged objects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station was}} moved in 1975 {{to the newly}} {{constructed}} Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome [...] wide by [...] high, with [...] steel archways. One served as the entry to the dome {{and it had a}} transverse arch that contained modular buildings for the station's maintenance, <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders,</b> power plant, snow melter, equipment and vehicles. Individual buildings within the dome contained the dorms, galley, rec, post office and labs for monitoring the upper and lower atmosphere and numerous other complex projects in astronomy and astrophysics. The station also included the Skylab, a box-shaped tower slightly taller than the dome. Skylab was connected to the Dome by a tunnel. The Skylab housed atmospheric sensor equipment and later a music room.|$|R
2500|$|From 1967 to 1975, {{the bulk}} of VMGR-152’s {{missions}} were directly in support of action in Southeast Asia. Detachments typically lasted five days, and operated out of Da Nang Air Base. [...] In addition to aerial refueling and Marine Logistic (MarLog)cargo missions, VMGR 152 'GVs' dropped flares in support of ground troop operations at night. [...] At its peak, the squadron was flying 900 missions a month and continued this high tempo of operations well into 1967. On 10 February 1968 a VMGR-152 KC-130F was hit by groundfire during landing at Khe Sanh, Quang Tri province.

50|$|A specially-trained coxswain sits at {{the stern}} (rear) {{of the boat and}} {{controls}} it via the tiller arm, attached to an outboard engine. The coxswain is considered the commander of the craft and is ultimately responsible for its operation, regardless of whether a senior-ranking individual is on board. Across from him sits the assistant coxswain, who relays hand signals from other boats and aids the coxswain as required. The remaining passengers (six raiders plus the two coxswains make up a full team) normally lay on and straddle the gunwale, keeping a low silhouette to help avoid detection and leaving room on the deck for weapons, equipment and (if necessary) additional <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders.</b>|$|R
