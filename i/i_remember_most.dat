5|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> of {{the video}} you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five {{different}} cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
500|$|Richard was nicknamed [...] "the Comet" [...] {{early in}} his career. When {{teammate}} Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard [...] "went in like a rocket" [...] {{as he approached the}} opposition goal, Richard was dubbed [...] "The Rocket" [...] by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the Montreal Star and Dink Carroll of the Montreal Gazette have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because [...] "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante declared {{it one of the most}} appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to [...] "the rocket's red glare" [...] referenced in [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Glenn Hall agreed: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying toward you with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying." ...|$|E

"For {{a sickening}} instant I {{thought that the}} bustle of my companions and the perfect respectability of all our dresses would {{overcome}} the policeman and induce him to let us pass. He wavered, so far as one can describe anything so solid as a policeman as wavering. I lurched suddenly forward and ran my head into his chest, calling out (if <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> correctly), 'Oh, crikey, blimey, Bill.'

2500|$|The U.S. Navy's all-time leading ace, Captain David McCampbell USN (Ret), scored all his 34victories in the Hellcat. He once {{described}} the F6F as [...] "... an outstanding fighter plane.

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> of it," [...] said Bartley. [...] "Well, I want {{to thank}} you, Halleck. You've saved me from disgrace,--from ruin, for all I know.

5000|$|... "I {{still can}} {{remember}} my first years. I was mischievous. I did {{things that would}} anger my mother and other people, but what <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the <b>most</b> is that in those days at 6 a.m. where the Torneos de Barrios (District Tournaments), {{and at that time}} I was in the field. I was the first to arrive and the last to leave" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{heard of}} that mutiny," [...] said Captain Folger. [...] "It was celebrated {{enough to make a}} noise even on our side of the Atlantic. If <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> rightly, <b>most</b> of the mutineers were caught on Otaheite and taken to England, being wrecked and some drowned on the way; the rest were tried, and some acquitted, some pardoned, and some hanged." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kozelek {{discussed}} his {{views of the}} album in the foreword of the 2002 and revised 2008 editions of his book of lyrics, Nights of Passed Over: [...] "... I know the Rollercoaster album is many people's favorite. But for me, it is {{and will always be}} the most difficult to get through. I hadn't heard it in years, and though there are some beautiful things I had forgotten about -- a delicate piano in [...] "Things Mean a Lot", the way the band brings life to [...] "Brown Eyes" [...] midway through, and the chorus of [...] "Strawberry Hill", which was sung by a group of strangers we gathered from outside the Divisadero Street studio where we were recording—what <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>most,</b> even when <b>I</b> look at the album's cover, is nine months of worry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ahuh! That's too bad. You oughtn't to hate work. Hard work {{makes for}} what I reckon you {{like in a}} man, but don't understand. As I look back over my life--an' let me say, young fellar, it's been a tough one--what <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> an' feel best over are the hardest jobs I ever did, an' those that cost the most sweat an' blood." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I gnawed bitter bark {{from young}} trees. I {{remember}} vaguely the eating of many green nuts, with soft shells and milky kernels. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> distinctly {{suffering from a}} stomach-ache. It may {{have been caused by}} the green nuts, and maybe by the lizards. I do not know. But I do know that I was fortunate in not being devoured during the several hours I was knotted up on the ground with the colic.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just the}} good, the {{exquisite}} things in life, {{that make me}} rebel against this life we are leading. It's because I've seen the streaks of gold that I know the rest for dirt. When I go cheating and scheming to my office, {{and come back to}} find you squandering yourself upon a horde of chattering, overdressed women, when I think that that is our substance and everyday and what we are, then it is <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> the deep and beautiful things.... It is impossible, dear, it is intolerable that life was made beautiful for us--just for these vulgarities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{be quite}} sure of it," [...] was the answer, and Geoffrey smiled upon her. [...] "What <b>I</b> shall <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> clearly is how much you risked to warn me, and that the safe {{completion}} of the work I have set my heart on is due to you.

5000|$|Hughes {{was born}} in Williamston, South Carolina; soon after her birth, her family {{relocated}} to Texas. While she was a voracious reader as a child, she didn't care for the canonical works. She's said, [...] "In high school and college, I was force-fed {{a lot of what}} is considered great literature.

50|$|My {{neighbor}} Mike Skinner introduced skateboarding to {{me around}} the age of three. He basically brainwashed me as a small child by pushing me around on his board when my mind was just developing. My first real board was a Sure-Grip that belonged to my sister, but the one <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the <b>most</b> from early on was a Ken Park. I had all the plastic accessories on it—plus Rip Grip and cut-up griptape in all different colors. But back then, {{the only things that}} mattered to me were the wheels. If I could roll, I was in business.|$|R
60|$|Away {{across the}} road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still afire. Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and there were more people about here, though none could give us news. For {{the most part they}} were like ourselves, taking {{advantage}} of a lull to shift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even for flight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses, some many feet across. I did not know what these were--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they deserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--a heap near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards Barnes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{to tell you that}} another theft has been committed. A gold pencil case has {{disappeared}} from my study table. I was using it after school. I left it on the table when I went for a stroll before dinner. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> distinctly laying it down among the pens. I went into my study ten minutes ago; and wanting to make a note as to this afternoon's work looked for the pencil and it was gone. The window was open as usual, and it is possible that tramps passing along the road may have come into the garden and have got in at the window. As {{in the case of the}} book I suspect no one, but two such occurrences as these are very uncomfortable for us all. I shall not propose any search this time, for had any of you taken it, which I cannot for a moment believe, he would not have been careless enough to put it in his pocket, or conceal it in his desk or boxes, but would have stowed it away somewhere where there would be no chance whatever of its being found. Now let us dismiss the subject and go on with our lessons." ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{instance}} {{which will}} bring {{me down to}} the end of my sixth year and the conclusion of this sad chapter. At this time we had a girl in the house, whose sweet face is one of a little group of half a dozen which <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> vividly. She was a niece of our shepherd's wife, an Argentine woman married to an Englishman, and came to us to look after the smaller children. She was nineteen years old, a pale, slim, pretty girl, with large dark eyes and abundant black hair. Margarita had the sweetest smile imaginable, the softest voice and gentlest manner, and was so much loved by everybody in the house that she was like one of the family. Unhappily she was consumptive, and after a few months had to be sent back to her aunt. Their little place was only half a mile or so from the house, and every day my mother visited her, doing all that was possible with such skill and remedies as she possessed to give her ease, and providing her with delicacies. The girl did not want a priest to visit her and prepare her for death; she worshipped her mistress, and wished to be of the same faith, and in the end she died a pervert or convert, according to this or that person's point of view.|$|E
60|$|We rode all day {{along the}} old Crook road where {{the year before}} we had {{encountered}} so many obstacles. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> of the road, but how strange it seemed to me, and what a proof of my mental condition on that memorable trip, that <b>I</b> did not <b>remember</b> all. Usually forest or desert ground I have traveled over I never forget. This ride, {{in the middle of}} October, when all the colors of autumn vied with the sunlight to make the forest a region of golden enchantment, was one of particular delight to me. I had begun to work and wear out the pain in my back. Every night I had suffered a little less and slept a little better, and every morning I had less and less of a struggle to get up and straighten out. Many a groan had I smothered. But now, when I got warmed up from riding or walking or sawing wood, the pain left me altogether and I forgot it. I had given myself heroic treatment, but my reward was in sight. My theory that the outdoor life would cure almost any ill of body or mind seemed to have earned another proof added to the long list.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2010, {{after seven}} years of research, Elder {{released}} the book Last Words of the Executed. The book includes a foreword by Studs Terkel. Described as an oral history of capital punishment in the United States, Last Words of the Executed documents the final statements of death row prisoners. Rob Warden, executive director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions, said, [...] "This is a powerful, haunting book." [...] In his foreword, Terkel wrote, [...] "What <b>I</b> will <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> about this book is its poetry in the speech of people at the most traumatic moment of their lives." ...|$|R
60|$|And it was, as <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it, a <b>most</b> {{exquisite}} night--a white poem, a frosty, starry lyric of light. It was one {{of those}} nights on which one might fall asleep and dream happy dreams of gardens of mirth and song, feeling all the while through one's sleep the soft splendour and radiance of the white moon-world outside, as one hears soft, far-away music sounding through the thoughts and words that are born of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We was poor, you know," [...] {{he said to}} George, [...] "and I know {{mother was}} often short of grub, but she was just kind. I don't never {{remember}} her whacking me; always spoke soft and low like; she was good, she was. She used to pray, you know, and what <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> is as the night afore she was took away to a hospital she says, 'Try and live honest, Bill; it will be hard, but try, my boy. Don't you take to stealing, however poor you may be;' and I aint," [...] Bill said earnestly over and over again. [...] "When I has seed any chap going along with a ticker handy, which I could have boned and got away among the carts as safe as ninepence, or when I has seed a woman with her purse a-sticking out of them outside pockets, and I aint had a penny to bless myself with, and perhaps nothing to eat all day, I have felt it hard {{not to make a}} grab; but I just thought of what she said, and I aint done it. As I told yer, I have often nabbed things off the stalls or out of the baskets or carts. It didn't seem to me as that was stealing, but as you says it is, I aint going to do so no more.

40|$|Martin called: Martin {{called at}} five o'clock. I was ay my desk wrting {{something}}. <b>I</b> can't <b>remember</b> what. <b>Most</b> likely something pointless, I didn't {{have too much}} trouble understanding him.

60|$|It {{was quite}} an {{ordinary}} interview in the Fareway Park but they talked easily together for some time: like takes to like, and they had many points of resemblance. Said Mr. Granville to me, when he and I sat at our supper that night, 'Miss Fareway is remarkably beautiful, sir, remarkably engaging. Don't you think so?' 'I think so,' said I. And I stole a glance at him, and {{saw that he had}} reddened and was thoughtful. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it <b>most</b> vividly, because the mixed feeling of grave pleasure and acute pain that the slight circumstance caused me was the first of a long, long series of such mixed impressions under which my hair turned slowly gray.|$|R
50|$|However, his {{big break}} {{happened}} in 1979 {{when he was}} cast as Tom Arnold, a cabin boy, in The Onedin Line.

I trust it isn't the infection of the walls themselves, nor of the refection (so scant last time) enjoyed within them. Is it some baleful effluence of your host? He will try and exercise next time some potent counter-charm--and meanwhile he rejoices that your devil is cast out.|$|R
60|$|It chanced {{the girl}} turned {{suddenly}} about, so that I saw her {{face for the}} first time. There is no greater wonder than the way {{the face of a}} young woman fits in a man's mind, and stays there, and he could never tell you why; it just seems it was the thing he wanted. She had wonderful bright eyes like stars, and I daresay the eyes had a part in it; but what <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the <b>most</b> clearly was the way her lips were a trifle open as she turned. And whatever was the cause, I stood there staring like a fool. On her side, as she had not known there was any one so near, she looked at me a little longer, and perhaps with more surprise, than was entirely civil.|$|R
