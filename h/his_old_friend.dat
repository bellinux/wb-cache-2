5|$|Hergé {{had long}} sought to regain contact with <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> Zhang Chongren, {{with whom he}} had lost contact. He {{regularly}} asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact with <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend.</b> The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the intervening years.|$|E

The deal promised Mizoguchi complete artistic control and a large budget. Despite this, Mizoguchi was eventually pressured to make a less pessimistic ending for the film. Mizoguchi's sceenwriter and long-time collaborator Yoshikata Yoda said that originally, Mizoguchi did not envision making an anti-war film, instead wishing to capture the sensations and lucidity of Ueda's book Ugetsu Monogatari.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in India, Mauritius, and Scotland, {{this was}} Karan Johar's directorial debut. One of his {{goals for the}} film was to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema.

Scott was increasingly embittered by his own failures and <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E

Eisenhower, from November 18, 1953, to June 30, 1955, and from December 9, 1957, to December 31, 1959.

At the time, Honduras itself was a part of Spain's Kingdom of Guatemala, and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland of Central America. Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island, but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642.|$|E
5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} {{four days in}} the Hole in 2004 but says that he left after seeing <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige.

As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission in uranium by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in December 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, {{opened up the}} possibility that neutrons produced by fission could create a controlled nuclear chain reaction. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved. In August 1939, Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning {{of the possibility of}} a German nuclear weapon project, and convinced <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it. This resulted in support for research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government.|$|E

Shortly after he secured writers for the show, Davies stated {{that he had no}} intention of approaching writers from the old series; the only writer he would have wished to work with was Holmes, who died in May 1986.|$|E
