According to an article posted on Silverbird Television, Wizkid was hospitalised for a minor concussion resulting from the wreck.

Eyewitness reports also added that the car's airbag suspension system deployed on impact, shielding Wizkid and the driver instantaneously. At the time of the incident, Wizkid and other passengers in the car were returning from the Soundcity Nokia LumiaBeat Party. The accident allegedly occurred around 3:30am in front of the GET Arena. As a result of the wreck, the car was badly damaged. Pictures of the <b>damaged</b> <b>vehicle</b> surfaced on Instagram and Facebook.

500|$|Fighting {{their way}} forward, the M113s finally arrived by 18:15 and began loading the most badly wounded as {{darkness}} approached. The Viet Cong subsequently launched two successive counter-attacks, assaulting B Company {{from the east}} and south-east; however, both attacks were repulsed by the Australians, as they responded with small arms fire while Mackay called-in an airstrike. During the fighting one of the APCs was subsequently disabled by a recoilless rifle at close range, killing the driver and wounding the crew commander. A second round then struck the open cargo hatch, wounding several more men and re-wounding {{a number of the}} Australian casualties. A third round then landed nearby, as the M113s returned fire with their [...]30 and [...]50 calibre machine-guns. Under covering fire the Australians attempted to recover the <b>damaged</b> <b>vehicle,</b> yet it became stuck hard against a tree. With the Viet Cong threatening a further attack from the north-east, the Australian cavalry swept the area with a heavy volume of fire and were met by equally heavy return fire. By 18:50 the light was fading rapidly, while the bulk of 5 Platoon's more serious casualties had been evacuated by APC. However, with many of the Australian dead lying in close proximity to the Viet Cong positions, no attempt was made to recover them due to the likelihood of further casualties. Meanwhile, the damaged APC was subsequently destroyed with white phosphorus grenades to prevent its weapons and equipment from being captured.|$|E

50|$|When hit, {{a vehicle}} becomes either lightly damaged, heavily damaged, or destroyed, {{depending}} on what its state of damage was before it was attacked and how many hits it receives. An undamaged vehicle taking one or two hits would become lightly damaged; if the same vehicle takes 3 hits, it would be heavily damaged, and 4 hits would destroy it. By the rules, lightly <b>damaged</b> <b>vehicles</b> have less degradation to their capabilities than heavily damaged ones. For instance, lightly <b>damaged</b> <b>vehicles</b> can still move (-1 of normal movement), but heavily <b>damaged</b> <b>vehicles</b> are immobilized and their firing capability is cut in half, among other problems.|$|R
