5000|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>bug</b> or Red-legged Shieldbug (Pentatoma rufipes) is {{a species}} of shield bug in the family Pentatomidae.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>bug</b> {{is also an}} {{agricultural}} and garden pest, as it will not hesitate to feed on fruit and nut trees.|$|E
50|$|Phasia {{hemiptera}} is a tachinid fly {{found throughout}} Northern and Southern Europe. It is a strongly sexually dimorphic species, males being more colourful with curved patterned wings. Like most tachinid flies, the female lays her eggs on other insects, the larvae then develop inside the living host, devouring it and eventually killing it. Its main hosts are the <b>forest</b> <b>bug</b> Pentatoma rufipes in the spring, {{and the green}} shield bug Palomena prasina in the autumn.|$|E
50|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>bugs</b> are polyphagous. Their main {{food source}} is any of {{several species of}} oaks, {{but it can also}} be found on alder, hazel and other {{deciduous}} trees, including apple and cherry.|$|R
50|$|While {{walking in}} a <b>forest,</b> <b>Bugs</b> Bunny wonders aloud how {{everyone}} {{is out to}} get everyone else; this is illustrated by hostile behavior as Bugs' interacts with, among other things, {{a rock and a}} butterfly. He then sees a carrot and begins to eat it, unaware that it is a trap set by Marvin the Martian.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>forest</b> shield <b>bug</b> (Oncacontias vittatus) is {{a species}} of shield bugs endemic to New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Forest</b> shield <b>bug</b> nymphs prefer {{feeding on}} grasses, while adults will eat {{a variety of}} New Zealand plants {{including}} [...] "hard-leaved" [...] plants like rimu.|$|R
5000|$|One dark night, as {{the camera}} pans across a dark, empty <b>forest,</b> <b>Bugs</b> is heard singing a stanza of [...] "Sweet Dreams, Sweetheart" [...] (introduced in Hollywood Canteen). When the camera zooms in on Bugs' rabbit hole, he pokes up out of his hole, dressed in a {{nightshirt}} and holding up a candle, and tells the audience that he feels he's being watched ("Eh, I don't know but, Did you ever have the feeling you was being watched?") In fact, he is being watched via remote TV by an evil scientist (a caricature of Hollywood actor Peter Lorre; like Bugs, he is played by Mel Blanc), who is planning to catch a rabbit to provide dinner for his large, hairy, orange, sneaker-wearing monster, named Gossamer.|$|R
50|$|In late August 1939 the regiment, {{commanded}} by Colonel Kazimierz Burczak, was concentrated in <b>forests</b> between the <b>Bug</b> River and the Narew, {{as part of}} 1st Legions Infantry Division (General Wincenty Kowalski), Operational Group Wyszków.|$|R
5000|$|Touda (トウダ) : A giant snake {{which is}} Daki's adopted mother. She nursed Daki {{when she was}} {{abandoned}} in the <b>Bug</b> <b>Forest</b> as a baby. Yuushi manipulated her {{in an attempt to}} get rid of Qwan by telling her that Qwan kidnapped Daki.|$|R
50|$|Mazovia has a {{landscape}} without hills (in contrast to Lesser Poland) and without lakes (in contrast to Greater Poland). It is {{spread over the}} Mazovian Lowland, {{on both sides of}} the Vistula river and its confluence with Narew and <b>Bug.</b> <b>Forests</b> (mainly coniferous) cover one-fifth of the region, with the large Kampinos Forest, Puszcza Biała and Puszcza Zielona.|$|R
5000|$|Yuushi (ユウシ): Daki's foster {{father and}} utter lunatic. He treats Daki {{more like a}} tool than a {{daughter}}. Able to control bugs as his daughter can, {{he appears to be}} a sort of demon, once trying to eat Chikei's desires. Yuushi is constantly getting in Qwan's way of consuming the 'Essential Arts of Peace'. Later, it revealed that his true form is a spider demon. He took interest of Daki's power and took her from <b>Bug</b> <b>Forest</b> (by taking advantage of Touda's favor to cure Daki's illness [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|After the {{incident}} with Touda at the palace, {{her relationship with}} Qwan is getting better, as Qwan became more friendly towards her. She later returned to the <b>Bug</b> <b>Forest</b> along with Seishigaku and Hakuhiko, only to discover a shocking truth. It was found out later that Daki is Qwan's another half. She also have a symbol like Qwan, but it is located on her stomach. It was last seen by Shaga's adopted son that he saw a young girl and a young boy in the forest. The girl has many butterflies around her and the boy has a tattoo on his forehead. Qwan's wish was granted.|$|R
5000|$|Bugs emphatically {{states that}} he will report the {{animator}} to Warner Bros. and calls the animator [...] "a menace to society", while the animator draws a picket sign ("I won't work") in Bugs's left hand. When Bugs sees the sign, he throws it on the ground, off screen. Bugs asks if the animator {{is trying to get}} him fired, before explaining that he has become a good asset to the studio, which gives the animator time to draw another picket sign ("I refuse to live up to my contract"). After throwing away the last sign off-screen, Bugs returns, wiping off the yellow paint with a towel. Afterwards, Bugs agrees to work on the picture, but pauses once he sees that the animator drew a hat on his head, prompting Bugs to throw it on the ground, stating that the animator knows he's not supposed to wear a hat. In response, the animator draws a big pink women's hat, and Bugs throws it on the ground, too. This cycle continues with very ridiculous hats and wigs until Bugs gives up. The animator draws a rotated <b>forest,</b> and <b>Bugs</b> tries to get in his hole by climbing down a nearby tree. The animator draws an anvil on Bugs's tail, causing Bugs to fall on a street, later rolling into an empty area.|$|R
50|$|When a bear {{enters the}} lab {{from the nearby}} <b>forest,</b> both <b>Bugs</b> and Elmer mistake the bear for one another (Bugs seeing the bear wear Elmer's hat and Elmer later seeing the bear eat a carrot), until Elmer becomes angry at the bear (still {{thinking}} that it's Bugs Bunny) after the bear refuses the potion {{that was going to}} cure him, which was the same potion Bugs gave to the bear earlier and of which made the bear disgusted. Elmer scolds the bear until he discovers that the bear isn't Bugs Bunny when the real Bugs is at the window. Elmer realizes his mistake, and the enraged bear chases Elmer and ends up on the warpath against him, while Elmer is sobbingly panickedly begging the bear not to literally kill him. Elmer, after heeding Bugs' option, plays dead to fool the bear, and is saved by his bad odor (just as with Wabbit Twouble). Elmer thinks he's safe until he thinks he hears the bear again, but it's Bugs this time, imitating the bear (again, lifted from Wabbit Twouble). Meanwhile, the bear is standing {{on the side of the}} room watching them, convinced that both Elmer and Bugs are crazy, flashing rebus picture cards to the audience showing a , a , a , , etc. (a gag Bugs had done earlier when Elmer was freaking out after drinking the potion).|$|R
40|$|Software {{maintenance}} {{is an essential}} step in software development life cycle. Nowadays, software companies spend approximately 45 % of total cost in maintenance activities. Large software projects maintain bug repositories to collect, organize and resolve bug reports. Sometimes {{it is difficult to}} reproduce the reported bug with the information present in a bug report and thus this bug is marked with resolution non-reproducible (NR). When NR bugs are reconsidered, a few of them might get fixed (NR-to-fix) leaving the others with the same resolution (NR). To analyse the behaviour of developers towards NR-to-fix and NR bugs, the sentiment analysis of NR bug report textual contents has been conducted. The sentiment analysis of bug reports shows that NR bugs' sentiments incline towards more negativity than reproducible bugs. Also, there is a noticeable opinion drift found in the sentiments of NR-to-fix bug reports. Observations driven from this analysis were an inspiration to develop a model that can judge the fixability of NR bugs. Thus a framework, NRFixer, which predicts the probability of NR bug fixation, is proposed. NRFixer was evaluated with two dimensions. The first dimension considers meta-fields of bug reports (model- 1) and the other dimension additionally incorporates the sentiments (model- 2) of developers for prediction. Both models were compared using various machine learning classifiers (Zero-R, naive Bayes, J 48, random tree and random <b>forest).</b> The <b>bug</b> reports of Firefox and Eclipse projects were used to test NRFixer. In Firefox and Eclipse projects, J 48 and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve the best prediction accuracy, respectively. It was observed that the inclusion of sentiments in the prediction model shows a rise in the prediction accuracy ranging from 2 to 5 % for various classifiers...|$|R
40|$|Aquatic macroinvertebrates are {{affected}} by physical, chemical and biological conditions of the stream. Some of them are pollution-sensitive while others are pollution-tolerant. They are good indicators of stream health. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the status of Labo and Clarin Rivers using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators. Dip-net and kick-net methods were employed. Results showed that sampling sites in forested areas in Labo and Clarin rivers had a higher macroinvertebrate taxa richness and abundance. Mayflies (Ephemeroptera) were the dominant macroinvertebrates. Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) and %EPT indices were higher in Clarin than Labo River. Based on Family-level biotic index (FBI), the water quality of sampling site 1 in Clarin (forested site) was excellent (organic pollution is unlikely) and very good (possible slight organic pollution) for site 1 in the Labo River but decreased downstream (fair to good quality). MANOVA results revealed {{a significant difference in the}} macroinvertebrate abundance in the agricultural sites of Labo River and forest sites of Clarin River. Cluster analysis showed that among the macroinvertebrates, mayflies (Ephemeroptera) were distinct in the <b>forest</b> sites and <b>bugs</b> (Hemiptera) in agricultural sites on Clarin River. Fly larvae (Diptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) were distinct in agroforest sites of the Clarin River while abundant in agricultural sites on Labo River. Results indicate a need for monitoring and proper management of Labo an...|$|R
