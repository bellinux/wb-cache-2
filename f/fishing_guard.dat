40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} public guards {{and the role}} they have in {{environmental}} protection. Firstly, the thesis focuses on the explanation {{of the concept of}} public guards, their historical development and present legal regulation. Secondly, the thesis deals with particular public guards, which are hunting guard, forest guard, <b>fishing</b> <b>guard</b> and nature guard. Their legal regulation and evaluation of their work is discussed in separate chapters. The next part of the thesis is concerned with The Public Guards Bill 2002. Finally, the thesis deals with a critical evaluation of the role that public guards have in environmental protection and proposes several solutions for the improvement of their work. The aim of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of public guards and to suggest solutions for the improvement of their activities...|$|E

5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male <b>fish</b> <b>guarding</b> a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|R

40|$|The gobioid fish, Pterogobius zonoleucus JORDAN et SNYDER, lives a gregarious swimminglife in its habitat, near rocky {{shore in}} inlet. The autors {{collected}} the fish with a set-net, and reared {{it in the}} Shimonoseki Aquarium from early summer to next spring in every year of 1957, 1958 and 1959. The captured fish lived a individual swimming-life in a glass-aquarium (30 × 60 × 36 cm), and lived a territorial bottom-life for the spawning-period only. The oviposition and fertilization ocurred in a shell-nest, lying on the aquarium-bottom. The authors observed the spawnings 16 times in the glass-aquarium for 3 spawningseasons, and detected 3 behavior-phases: pre-spawning behavior, spawning-behavior and post spawning behavior, in a course of spawning-events. They recoginized a remarkable variation in the behavior-patterns of every behavior-phase. The effectiveness of the nest for fertilization of gobioid fish-egg is discussed in this paper, and the observations that the male parent <b>fish,</b> <b>guarding</b> the deposited egg-mass in the nest, eat the own eggs after the nest is disturbed in some gobioid fishes, including P. zonoleucus, is noted...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} was to analyse the fishing pressure, number of visits and number of catches in sport {{fisheries}} managed by Czech Angling Union (CAU). The selected data, mainly concerning the sport fisheries managed by South Bohemian Board of CAU, were graphically presented. At the trophy fishery Vltava 24, daily data were evaluated and the behaviour of fishermen was compared {{during the first two}} years of the new management (2010 and 2011). The second part of the thesis is aimed at the analysis of the united system of fishing management within the whole CAU and suggests a new system of financial flow. CAU is composed by 7 regional boards; however, it is possible to buy united fishing permit valid in all the fisheries of CAU. The financial budget coming from these permits is redistributed only according to the weight of killed and recorded fish. This system is advantageous mainly for regional boards with a big amount of fishermen and high fishing pressure at their fisheries; it is less advantageous for regional boards managing large areas. Within the thesis, a new model for redistribution of the financial budget was created. Except for the weight of killed fish, it includes other expenses connected with the management (<b>fishing</b> <b>guards,</b> lease of <b>fishing</b> waters, etc.) and the number of fishing visits. The model was provided to CAU for future negotiation...|$|R

Males are often more colorful and generally larger than females, and may develop a hump on the head as they age. Captive breeding is not too difficult to achieve; live foods, frequent water changes, and a temperature increase or decrease of 2 to 4 degrees encourages spawning. Several artificial or rock caves for fish to hide from each other are advisable.|$|R

50|$|Neosho madtoms are {{short-lived}} fish, {{only occasionally}} surviving {{more than three}} years. Little is known about their reproductive habits. They are believed to spawn in June and July. In closely related species, eggs are laid under small stones, and the eggs and sometimes young <b>fish</b> are <b>guarded</b> by a parent. Adults bury themselves in the gravel {{during the day and}} come out to feed at night. Larval, aquatic insects are the major food source of Neosho madtoms. Their preferred habitat is shallow riffles with loose, uncompacted gravel bottoms. They are occasionally found in areas with sandy bottoms covered with leaf litter. Young Neosho madtoms may be found in deeper pools, downstream from riffles.|$|R

2500|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, it was {{proposed}} to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the Nile perch to improve the fisheries in the lake. At {{the same time it}} was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done. These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O. esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as [...] "thrash fish" [...] or even a vermin by the British colonial authorities. In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it. The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the British Colonial rule) and local African <b>fish</b> <b>guards,</b> happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself. Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria. As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962—63. The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstancial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954—55 under the directive of senior officials. UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists. The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970. Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|Gobius poecilichthys Jordan et Snyder (1902), a small goby, some 80 mm {{in total}} length, {{is found in}} tide-pools on the rocky coast of Southern Japan. Though Tomiyama, I. (1936) {{regarded}} this species, together with Bathygobius soporator(Cuvier et Valencinnes) of the south western coast of U. S. A., as synonyms of Gobius fuscus Ruppell(1928), I treat here this Japanese form provisionallu as a distinct species from the forms of other districts, wishing to compare its life history with others(Fig. 1). The spawning season extends from June to September at Tomioka in the Amakusa Islands, Kumamoto Pref., Kyushu. The spawning takes place in tide-pools. The eggs are attached in one layer to the under side of a stone lying in the pool. The male parent <b>fish</b> <b>guards</b> the eggs until they hatch out, staying in the breeding-room prepared by himself under the stone. The fertilized egg is club-shaped with a shallow depression circling near its end, 1. 8 mm in length and 0. 35 mm in width. The incubation-period is about 65 hours at the water-temperature of 23 ～ 27 ℃. The egg resembles in general appearance to that of Bathygobius soporator described by Breder, C. M. (1943) with slight differences in shape of the egg-membrane, attitude of the embryo and the incubation-period(Fig. 2, A～L). The goby could be induced to spawn in a table aquarium provided with vacant shells of Pinna pectinata japonica Reeve for egg-layer. The newly hatched larva is about 2. 3 mm in total length. The larvae 6 ～ 18 mm in total length appear in the tide-pool from August to November at Tomioka, which already entered into bottom-life feeding on planctonic copepods. The fishes over 20 mm in total length live a bottom-life in the tide-pool all year round, feeding on moluscs and crustacean. The life-span of the fish seems to be over 4 years(Fig. 3). 冨山一郎（(1936 ）は，これ迄にアフリカ，紅海，印度洋，西南太平洋，ハワイ，濠洲北岸及び北米南西部等の各水域から採集された材料について，多くの著者によつて，夫々新種として報告されている．Gobius soporator Cuvier et Valenciennes, Gobius poecilichthys Jordan et Snyder 等の 10 種以上に上る類似のハゼを，総べてGobius fuscus Ruppell（ 1828 ）のSynonymとして，これにクモハゼという和名を附している．ここでは之等の種類の同異について論ずる事は出来ないが，筆者が熊本県及び鹿児島県から得た標本は総べてGobius poecilichthys Jordan et Snyder（ 1902, 模式標本は神奈川県三崎産）の記載とよく一致するので，こゝにはこの学名をクモハゼに用い，主として熊本県天草郡富岡町の海岸で 1947 年から 1952 年の間に行つた観察採集によつてここにクモハゼの生活史の概要を述べるが，Herre, A.

When paired, females remaining near and frequently contacted broods while males were vigilant- similar to parents in wild populations. Single males remained nearer offspring compared to paired males.

Paternal investment is here a state-dependent decision, and signal a condition-dependent handicap by which males inform females of how much {{they are willing to}} invest. Series of predictions are derived on female and male breeding strategies, including optimal levels of signaling and paternal investment as functions of clutch size, own condition, and residual reproductive value, as well as alternative strategies such as egg kleptoparasitism. Some predictions already have empirical support, for which the present model provides new interpretations. Other might readily be tested, e. g. by simple clutch-size manipulations...|$|R

40|$|Dispersal is a {{fundamental}} species characteristic that should directly affect both rates of gene flow among spatially distributed populations and opportunities for speciation. Yet no single trait associated with dispersal has been demonstrated to affect both micro- and macroevolutionary patterns of diversity across a diverse biological assemblage. Here, we examine patterns of genetic differentiation and species richness in reef fishes, an assemblage of over 7, 000 species comprising approximately one-third of the extant bony fishes and over one-tenth of living vertebrates. In reef fishes, dispersal occurs primarily during a planktonic larval stage. There are two major reproductive and parental investment syndromes among reef fishes, and the differences between them have implications for dispersal: (1) benthic <b>guarding</b> <b>fishes</b> lay negatively buoyant eggs, typically guarded by the male parent, and from these eggs hatch large, strongly swimming larvae; in contrast, (2) pelagic spawning fishes release small floating eggs directly into the water column, which drift unprotected before small weakly swimming larvae hatch. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that benthic guarders have significantly greater population structure than pelagic spawners and additionally that taxonomic families of benthic guarders are more species rich than families of pelagic spawners. Our findings provide a compelling case for the continuity between micro- and macroevolutionary processes of biological diversification and underscore the importance of dispersalrelated traits in influencing the mode and tempo of evolution...|$|R
