The experimental investigation {{as well as}} fatigue life predication by using Walker model were performed. The FCG specimens were prepared according to the ASTM E 647 - 08 standard. The results showed that <b>S.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>sheet</b> with 0. 05 mm thickness exhibited higher tensile strength but limited ductility with no clear evidence of yielding as compared to 0. 1 mm and 1. 5 mm thickness...|$|R
