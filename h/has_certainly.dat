At Number 2123 is Mitchells Café and Take Away, which claims to be the oldest café in Leith; while this claim is unverified, the premises <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> been operating in café format since at least 1924, when it opened its doors as an Italian ice cream parlour. Many long-time Leithers still refer to Mitchells as Lannys; so ingrained is the old ice cream cafe in their memories.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger’s {{critique}} of technology <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> inspired environmentalist and postmodernist of our time. Deep ecologists, like Heidegger, allege that certain metaphysical presuppositions {{are responsible for}} ecological destruction, and also contend that any transformation can be brought about only through a renewed awareness about the world. Then the key to environmental crisis, require an ontological shift: from an anthropocentric and utilitarian understanding of world to an understanding which lets things be. A non-anthropocentric humanity would probably initiate attitudes, practices, and institutions that would exhibit respect and care for all beings.|$|E
25|$|Here, {{where the}} poem {{rises to the}} tragic height of the ancient Greeks, this kind of form, which Bellini <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> ennobled, serves only to {{increase}} the solemn and imposing character of the whole; all the phases of passion, which are rendered in so peculiarly clear a light by his art of song, are thereby made to rest upon a majestic soil and ground, above which they do not vaguely flutter about, but resolve themselves into a grand and manifest picture, which involuntarily calls to mind the creations of Gluck and Spontini.|$|E

This mission, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), {{was sent to the}} newly created State of Israel, where a conflict between the Israelis and the Arab states over the creation of Israel had just reached a ceasefire. The UNTSO remains in operation to this day, although the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> not abated. Almost a year later, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was authorized to monitor relations between the two nations, which were split off from each other following the United Kingdom's decolonization of the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|Iraqi {{artists have}} {{consistently}} {{been at the}} forefront of new and innovative works of creative genius in the Middle East. From poets to scholar, sculptors to painters, the community of Iraqi artists, local and international, experimented with avant-garde and cutting-edge art, and found an insatiable audience that was often blind to gender, socio-economic status, or identity. However, during the past 40 years, the art of Iraq and the voices of the artists <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> paralleled the tumultuous political and social history of the country, creating an inextricable union that has been displayed in all forms of art.|$|E
25|$|The 18th {{century was}} a time of {{enlightenment}} progression occurring in all intellectual fields. However, the English language was deteriorating into a tangled mess. A group of London booksellers commissioned well-known essayist Samuel Johnson to compile a set of rules governing the English Language. After nine years and the help of six assistants the first edition of A Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755. Johnson's great knowledge of letters, words and literature brought uniqueness to his dictionary. Each word defined in detail, with descriptions of their various uses and numerous literary quotes as illustrations. This was the first dictionary of its kind, containing 40,000 words and nearly 114,000 quotes packed together with Johnson's personal touch. A warm reception greeted Johnson's Dictionary as it was the first dictionary that could be read with pleasure. The definitions full of wit and depth of thought supported by passages from beloved poets and philosophers, which a reader could be content spending an evening poring over its pages. Johnson's choice of structure and format <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> shaped future English dictionaries and lexicons and the role they play in language development.|$|E

Bingham, but Bourne failed to regain his form after returning and so was dropped in favour of his stand-in. [...] Oxford were described by the rowing correspondent for The Manchester Guardian as having [...] "a powerful, orthodox crew without a weak man in the boat" [...] while he suggested that [...] "Cambridge are not orthodox, {{and they have not}} quite the same uniformity of style". [...] The rowing correspondent for The Times agreed, stating that [...] "since 1936 Cambridge rowing <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> deteriorated, and they have produced this year as heterogeneous a crew as has ever been seen in the race." [...] The Dark Blues were considered by most to be favourites to win the race. [...] Both crews raced in boats built by George Sims Boatbuilding Company of Hammersmith.|$|E
500|$|Although he commended West's {{vulnerability}} and signature sound, Rolling Stones Jon Caramanica felt that [...] "West isn't quite MC {{enough to hold}} down the entire disc". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani observed [...] "too many guest artists, too many interludes, and just too many songs period", but stated, [...] "As chest-beatingly self-congratulatory as it may be, The College Dropout is at once laugh-out-loud funny ('The New Workout Plan'), genuinely touching ('Family Business'), and brutally honest ('All Falls Down')". Pitchfork critic Rob Mitchum called it a [...] "flawed, overlong, hypocritical, egotistical, and altogether terrific album". AllMusic editor Andy Kellman felt that it shows West as a [...] "remarkably versatile lyricist and a valuable MC". Renee Graham of The Boston Globe asserted that [...] "West <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> raised the bar on what mainstream hip-hop can and should be". In a retrospective review, Rolling Stone called it [...] "a demonstration that hip-hop—real, banging, commercial hip-hop—could be a vehicle for nuanced self-examination and musical subtlety." ...|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The Indo-Asian News Service gave the album 3.5 stars (out of 5): [...] "Bharadwaj has composed a wonderful album {{that is not}} a clone of his previous work. It exudes freshness and is worth listening. However, the songs would not have achieved zenith without Gulzar's lovely lyrics. The team has done it again". Bollywood Hungama rated the album a 3 (out of 5): [...] "7 Khoon Maaf is a good album with a couple of definite hits, couple of skip worthy ones and the remaining have the potential to grow. Since 7 Khoon Maaf is not a routine Bollywood affair, it can't be expecting a quick pick at the stands from Day One". The Hindustan Times noted that the soundtrack takes the listener through a variety of moods: [...] "Bhardwaj <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> succeeded in adding new sounds to his catalogue. He continues to evade Bollywood monotony with this soundtrack [...] an innovative effort." ...|$|E
500|$|Pistrucci is {{probably}} remembered most for his George and Dragon {{design for the}} sovereign. Not greatly liked {{at the time of}} its origin, it has come to be celebrated. The Deputy Master of the Mint who restored the design to the sovereign in 1871, Charles Fremantle, stated his view that [...] "it is hardly possible to over-rate the advantages accruing to a coinage from an artistic and well-executed design". By 1893, it was on all of Britain's gold coins; The Art Journal described Pistrucci's design as having [...] "triumphantly borne the test of time". Marsh noted, [...] "it is indeed a tribute that his wonderful design should still adorn the gold coinage of our current Queen Elizabeth II. It is one of the finest ever in our coinage history, and <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> stood the test of time. Long may it continue." [...] Pistrucci's design has also appeared on a non-circulating £20 silver coin in 2013 and on the crown in 1818–1823, 1887–1900, 1902 and 1951.|$|E
500|$|Berlin {{proved an}} {{excellent}} base for European tours. As {{in the previous}} two years in the USA Busoni had to depend for his living on exhausting but remunerative tours as a piano virtuoso; in addition at this period he was remitting substantial amounts to his parents, who continued to depend on his income. As a recitalist Busoni's programming and style initially raised concerns in some of Europe's musical centres. His first concerts in London, in 1897, met with mixed comments. [...] The Musical Times reported that he [...] "commenced in a manner to irritate the genuine amateurs [...] by playing a ridiculous travesty of one of Bach's masterly Organ Preludes and Fugues, but he made amends by an interpretation of Chopin's Studies (Op. 25) which was of course unequal but, on the whole, interesting". In Paris the critic Arthur Dandelot commented [...] "this artist <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> great qualities of technique and charm", but strongly objected to his addition of chromatic passages to parts of Liszt's St. François de Paule marchant sur les flots.|$|E

500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy {{called the}} episode [...] "a fantastic launch {{for the sixth}} series," [...] adding [...] "the Doctor Who team's US {{location}} shooting <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> paid off, lending these early scenes a grand scale that the series could scarcely have expected to achieve in 2005, let alone in 1963." [...] Commenting on the future-Doctor's death, Jeffery said [...] "seven minutes in, a nation's collective jaw dropped as The Doctor— this show's lead— is mercilessly gunned down. This plot twist is simply stunning, and it's difficult to imagine even casual viewers not sitting up to pay attention at this point." [...] Jeffery also believed that the series regulars were on [...] "top form," [...] adding [...] "the more abrasive aspects of Amy Pond's personality {{seem to have been}} toned down this year, and Karen Gillan responds with her best, most sympathetic performance to date. Arthur Darvill also lives up to his recent promotion to full-time companion. His comic timing is simply superb, but he excels too in the episode's darker moments." [...] Jeffery rated the episode five stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|... "Because of You" [...] {{received}} universal critical acclaim. Film Laureate of Blogcritics considered [...] "Because of You" [...] and [...] "Where Is Your Heart" [...] as his two {{favorite songs}} from Breakaway, writing [...] " [...] commands these two songs like a seasoned pro and directs {{herself in her}} songs the way Steven Spielberg said Barbra Streisand directs herself in her songs as if she's directing an actor in a movie." [...] Dave Donnelly of Sputnikmusic compared the song to Evanescence's [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003). (Note {{that two of the}} songwriters and producers of [...] "My Immortal" [...] were also involved in this track.) He added that Clarkson managed to take the piano-driven song in a different direction with a [...] "stormy, hard blues vocal... avoiding the typical raised-key final chorus cliché along the way". Christa L. Titus of Billboard lauded the song for its absence of schmaltz factor, [...] "only a potent, pained, grown-up anthem of gross betrayal and loss." [...] She concluded her review, writing [...] "it is time for Clarkson to return to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100; she <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> become the most consistent hope for top 40 staple status." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides". He added, [...] "Santana <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> been not-exactly-cuddly these past few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{a former}} police officer, actor David Zayas was {{immediately}} interested {{in the role of}} Sgt. Angel Batista. After appearing in Oz for a season, Erik King, was looking for a [...] "different" [...] acting chance, he [...] "loved" [...] the character of Sgt. Doakes, after reading the script. South Korean actor C.S. Lee, who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka, was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City, [...] and The Sopranos. Lee accepted the part because of the [...] "fantastic" [...] writing. By September 15, Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan. Carpenter had enough time before her audition to read the Dexter books, but admitted that she [...] "didn’t exactly see myself in the books. I knew {{that it was going to}} be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years, so I tried to make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb. I think that may have helped in the audition and it <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> helped sustain such a long run with one character." [...] She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television, but found it hard to stop it creeping into her real life. In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt. Matthews. The series stars Lauren Vélez (Maria LaGuerta), David Zayas (Angel Batista) and Erik King (James Doakes), all previously starred in the American HBO television drama series Oz.|$|E
500|$|At first, Nevermind did {{not receive}} many reviews, and many {{publications}} ignored the album. Months after its release and after [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] garnered airplay, print media organizations were [...] "scrambling" [...] to cover the phenomenon the album had become. However, by that point, much of the attention fell on Cobain rather than the album itself. The reviews that did initially appear were largely positive. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, [...] "With 'Nevermind,' Nirvana <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment." [...] Schoemer concluded, [...] "'Nevermind' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind, Nirvana [...] "never entertain the notion" [...] of wanting to sound [...] "normal," [...] compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that [...] "When Nirvana released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us figured they {{had the potential to}} make an album that would blow every other contender away. My God have they proved us right." [...] Spin gave Nevermind a favorable review stating that [...] "you'll be humming all the songs {{for the rest of your}} life—or at least until your CD-tape-album wears out." [...] Select compared the band to Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies, stating that the album [...] "proves that Nirvana truly belong in such high company." ...|$|E
500|$|Some criticised {{the visual}} allure of the character, up to {{allegations}} of sexual objectification. Mentioning [...] "the subject of unlockable gym slips for Ayane" [...] in 2002, Edge magazine stated that while it [...] "remains opposed to videogame censorship, the Dead or Alive franchise <b>has</b> <b>certainly</b> challenged the boundaries of taste in games." [...] In 2009, Joe Newman of GamesRadar ranked the series of Team Ninja's controversial Sigma 2 commercials, designed {{to draw attention to}} the fact that the [...] "notoriously big-breasted" [...] Ayane was a playable character (one of which was called by Destructoid [...] "the best and worst thing to have ever been created"), as the fourth most blatantly sexist game advertisement ever, adding: [...] "God forbid a moment goes by where any part of her body might be covered up." [...] Team Ninja's post-Itagaki head Yosuke Hayashi dismissed the criticism, stating in 2012: [...] "With the representation of female characters in the Dead or Alive franchise, we've always wanted to make the girls look as attractive as possible, and that's something that's not going to change for us at all." [...] Hayashi explained: [...] "We are a Japanese developer, and we're making the female characters with our common sense and our creative sense. When you take that to countries outside of Japan, it tends to be very misinterpreted in some cases, people considering it sexist or derogatory, etc." [...] The issue was also dismissed in 2015 by Team Ninja creative director Tom Lee, who said they as well as most of their [...] "fans around the world don’t share the same sentiments" [...] as their critics.|$|E
