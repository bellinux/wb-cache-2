50|$|According to Herodotus, {{the ropes}} {{were not only}} used as mooring ropes but also {{supported}} the wooden logs forming the bridge deck which is a rather unusual method of construction. Sailors carefully prevent ropes from chafing or from being pressed by hard objects and thus try to avoid early <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ropes.</b> The constant movement of the ships caused by waves and by the marching troops and the heavy loads of the soldiers and of the earth covering the logs putting pressure on the stretched ropes would have led to an early failure <b>of</b> the <b>ropes.</b> In addition, this setup would not have allowed to have a flat and even bridge deck. The ropes in between the ships would have sagged under the load {{of the earth and}} of the people which would have caused a constant up and down of the road. On top, the earth would have accumulated {{in the center of the}} sags and thus increased the local load on the ropes. There was no necessity for this configuration: the space between the ships being only three meters, the gap could easily have been bridged by the logs put from one ship to the next and parallel to the ropes. This would have been a better basis for the road and would not have had any bad influence on the ropes.|$|R

In spite of mushrooming design improvement the malfunctioning of brakes is reported repeatedly, caused by handling mistakes or un-optimised design. This review article provides a detailed discussion of the evolution and the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and introduces a new design classification. Design varieties are examined and addressed in detail. Subsequently, the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are reviewed and the differences between dynamic and static belaying are compared as to static and kinetic friction as well as belt and linear friction. In this critical review of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes, we discuss misconceptions as well as improvements. The issues covered in this review article aim to highlight the problems and challenges which the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and belay devices is facing in the quest for developing an optimised brake which never fails and which is ready to use without training. The shortcomings of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are mainly due to neglecting kinetic friction, which disadvantageously affects design optimisation but also opens design opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In most studies, <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> {{concrete}} due to carbonation or chloride penetration is investigated separately. However, the <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> concrete {{is normally}} {{caused by the}} combination. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the interaction between carbonation and chloride penetration and their effects on concrete. This was examined experimentally under various boundary conditions. For concrete under the double condition, the risk <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> due to carbonation was not severe. However, it was found that the carbonation of concrete could significantly accelerate chloride penetration. As a result, chloride penetration in combination with carbonation can cause harmful <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> concrete...|$|R

40|$|In acute {{coronary}} syndrome (ACS) {{patients with}} <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a scattered necrotic core pattern (SNC) is observed by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (VH-IVUS). The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the impact <b>of</b> SNC on <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow during PCI in ACS. A total of 38 ACS patients were imaged using VH-IVUS before PCI. In addition to conventional definitions of thin-cap fibroatheroma by VHIVUS (ID-TCFA), the SNC was defined as necrotic core foci with a maximum diameter of 50 % plaque burden except in the ID-TCFA frame. Patients were divided into <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow group (n = 15) and normal-reflow group (n = 23). The incidence of residual thrombus and plaque rupture, the external elastic membrane, plaque and fibrous volumes, the incidence of IDTCFA and the average number of SNC per frame was significantly greater in <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow group than in normal-reflow group (all parameters P < 0. 05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the average number of SNC per frame was independently associated with <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow in ACS patients (odds ratio 1. 18, P < 0. 05). In conclusion, an increased number of SNC is associated with <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow during PCI in ACS patients. © Springer 2011...|$|R
