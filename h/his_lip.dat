5|$|Several wrestlers {{were injured}} at the show. Abyss {{suffered}} several serious cuts {{to his left}} arm, while Sabu had cuts on his arms, legs, and face. Both wrestlers required several stitches after their match. A.J. Styles busted <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> during his title defense, requiring stitches, while Samoa Joe dislocated his jaw. Raven busted <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> but no stitches were required. Jeff Jarrett suffered a bad cut to his forehead during the main event. Lastly, James Storm {{was diagnosed with a}} neck stinger.|$|E
5|$|The Wolverines {{recorded}} 15 sides for Gennett Records between February and October 1924. The titles {{revealed a}} tough and well-formed cornet talent. <b>His</b> <b>lip</b> had toughened from earlier, more tentative years; on {{nine of the}} Wolverines' recorded titles he proceeds commandingly from lead to opening solo without any need for a respite from playing.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 2008, Drogba faced {{controversy}} after a {{clash with}} Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidić. The Serbian centre-back {{had to have}} stitches under <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> after losing a tooth in the clash. There was discussion whether Drogba had the intention or not to injure his rival. The debate also called into question an earlier incident on 26 November 2006 where Drogba elbowed Vidić. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed concerns over elbowing in the Premier League. Despite media speculation, Drogba's yellow card for the clash was deemed adequate punishment by the Football Association.|$|E

5|$|Reagan was {{in great}} pain from the bullet that struck his rib, and he {{believed}} that the rib had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood. Although the president believed that he had cut <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") left the White House for the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the year, {{near the}} ruins of Nineveh, Heraclius engaged Rhahzadh before {{reinforcements}} could reach the Persian commander. The Battle of Nineveh took place in the fog, reducing the Persian advantage in missile troops. Heraclius feigned retreat, leading the Persians to the plains, before reversing his troops to the surprise of the Persians. After eight hours of fighting, the Persians suddenly retreated to nearby foothills, but the battle did not become a rout. During the battle, approximately 6,000 Persians were killed. Patriarch Nikephoros' Brief History suggests that Rhahzadh challenged Heraclius to personal combat, and that Heraclius accepted and killed Rhahzadh in a single thrust; two other challengers fought against him and also lost. However, he received an injury to <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{left school}} to tour {{with a group}} led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods {{seven days a week}} for this job put great {{pressure}} on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. <b>His</b> <b>lip</b> eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.|$|E
6000|$|Amid these thoughts, {{he lifted}} a spoonful of coffee to <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and, sipping it, was {{astonished}} to perceive that, the instant <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> touched the liquid, it became molten gold, and, the next moment, hardened into a lump! ...|$|R

25|$|He has a {{circular}} scar {{on the right}} side of his face, just above <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b> In the early days of his film career, Hung was involved in a street fight outside a Kowloon nightclub, and was stabbed with a broken cola bottle.|$|E
25|$|In 1615 or 1616, Harriot {{wrote to}} an unknown friend with medical expertise, {{describing}} {{what would have}} been the reason for the eruption of a cancerous ulcer on <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b> This progressed until 1621, when he was living with a friend named Thomas Buckner on Threadneedle Street, where he died. Sources cited below are among several that describe his condition as a cancer of the nose. In either case, Harriot apparently died from skin cancer.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} his naval stint that Bogart may have {{received}} his trademark scar and developed his characteristic lisp, though the actual circumstances are unclear. In one account <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> {{was cut by}} shrapnel when his ship, the , was shelled, although some claim Bogart {{did not make it}} to sea until after the Armistice had been signed. Another version, which Bogart's long-time friend, author Nathaniel Benchley, holds to, is that Bogart was injured while taking a prisoner to Portsmouth Naval Prison in Kittery, Maine.|$|E

25|$|The biggest manifestation was when, Jaworski {{came back}} from the nearby Medical City with seven {{stitches}} in <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> to lead the Gins to a come-from-behind victory against NCC. Jaworski incurred this from a wayward elbow inflicted by Jeff Moore in the second quarter. But with them behind by 15 points going into the final seven minutes of the game, Jaworski re-entered the court and sparked a frenzy that to date, has yet been matched. The NCC team simply froze upon the sight of the Big J and didn't know what hit them, eventually losing to the Gins.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} such an {{approach}} is to invest the sculptures with greater psychological energy. The viewer finds it easier to gauge the state of mind of the characters and therefore understands the larger story at work: Daphne's wide open mouth in fear and astonishment, David biting <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> in determined concentration, or Proserpina desperately struggling to free herself. In addition to portraying psychological realism, they show a greater concern for representing physical details. The tousled hair of Pluto, the pliant flesh of Proserpina, or the forest of leaves beginning to envelop Daphne all demonstrate Bernini's exactitude and delight for representing complex real world textures in marble form.|$|E
500|$|Moore has {{multiple}} tattoos including {{one on the}} inside of <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> that says [...] "extinct". He also has two tattoos across his fingers saying [...] "Hard Knox" [...] and [...] "Made 1979". In 2005, he had 2BME tattooed on his stomach. He operated a tattoo shop called Gas Chamber Ink in Southern Pines, North Carolina. He also has a total of three piercings; one in each ear and one in his septum.|$|E

500|$|Another {{frequently}} debated scene includes one {{in which}} Baby Herman extends his middle finger as he passes under a woman's dress and re-emerges with drool on <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b> There is also controversy over the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are playing a piano duel, and, during his trademark ranting gibberish, it is claimed that Donald calls Daffy a [...] "goddamn stupid nigger"; however, this is a misinterpretation, with the line from the script being [...] "doggone stubborn little—." ...|$|E
500|$|The season also {{includes}} stunt work. Weeks before filming [...] "End of Nights", Heyerdahl practiced sword fighting {{to be done}} against the hybrids in the second part. Jonathon Young performed his own stunts for [...] "Sleepers", including being {{run over by a}} car and falling from a car. Both stunts involved harnesses and other safety measures. Young also participated in a fight scene with the other vampire characters, but he ended up injuring two of the actors. In one instance Young hit Chad Rook in the face, which caused a fang insert to puncture <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|E
500|$|The band's name, {{according}} to Erna's statement in a 1999 interview, [...] "I was {{making fun of}} somebody who had a cold sore on <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> {{and the next day}} I had one myself and somebody said, It looks like God smacked your face for making fun. The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn't really think much about it." [...] In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled All Wound Up. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.|$|E

500|$|Following Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, Khan {{starred in}} Sanjay Gadhvi's thriller Kidnap. He was cast as Kabir Sharma, a {{kidnapper}} who abducts {{a girl to}} settle an old score with her father, played by Minissha Lamba and Sanjay Dutt, respectively. The actor was initially hesitant to play the part (calling it [...] "tricky and tough") because he couldn't relate to the character; according to him, {{he would not have}} been able to do it without Gadhvi's support and backing. In preparation for his role, Khan listened to metal and rock music for a year to become aggressive. While the film was a critical failure, his performance was generally well received by critics. Gaurav Malani, in a review for The Economic Times, wrote: [...] "Imran Khan is effective as the intelligent abductor who's always two steps ahead of his opponent. However, the natural actor could go easy on <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> movements that appear synthetic at times." [...] Kidnap was also a commercial failure.|$|E
500|$|As a {{breeding}} stallion, Go Man Go {{continued to have}} {{a reputation as a}} scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image. She said that he liked to have <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> tugged, and would lean over the stall door waiting for people to come along and tug on it for him. However, she said of him [...] "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". Go Man Go passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in Go Man Go to Briarwood Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. Go Man Go died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in Roswell, New Mexico. His crown-shaped granite headstone is engraved: [...] "Go Man Go, The King." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{were two}} wounds {{to his right}} side, and two {{to the top of}} his head, which would {{probably}} have resulted in unconsciousness. The left side of <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> was wounded, his jaw was fractured, and his teeth, neck and larynx were damaged. The pathologist said he [...] "would {{not have been able to}} engage in purposeful talk", according to the Court of Appeal. There were gunshot wounds to his left shoulder and left elbow. The court heard that he had [...] "black eyes and a broken nose, linear bruising to the cheeks, lacerations to the head, linear type bruising to the right forearm, bruising to the left wrist and forearm and three circular burn type marks to the back. The linear marks were consistent with Mr Bamber having been struck with a long blunt object, possibly a gun." [...] One of the pillars of the prosecution case was that Sheila would not have been strong enough to inflict this beating on Nevill, who was 6ft 4in (1.93 m) tall and by all accounts in good health.|$|E
