5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built for the sport, and are unavailable for purchase by the general public because they cannot be legally ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a two-stroke or <b>four-stroke.</b> Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the phasing out of two-stroke engines.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against the new breed of 990cc <b>four-stroke</b> MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated <b>four-stroke</b> engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the MotoGP class in 2002, Roberts' team developed a five-cylinder bike called the KR5. The team was originally well-funded by Proton of Malaysia, but {{by the middle of the}} 2004 season, it became apparent that the Roberts team was not able to field an engine capable of competing with the dominant Japanese factories. Roberts turned to the KTM factory to provide engines for the 2005 season, however after ten races KTM abruptly withdrew their support on the eve of the Czech Republic Grand Prix, forcing the team to miss several races. Honda stepped in to help Roberts' team for the 2006 season by providing five-cylinder engines, as Robert's son, Kenny Roberts Jr., rode the Team Roberts KR211V bike to a sixth place in the championship including two podium results. The 2007 season saw {{the introduction}} of a new MotoGP engine formula using 800cc <b>four-stroke</b> engines. Roberts would once again secure engines from Honda for the Team Roberts KR212V race bike, but the results were not as hoped, and funding for the team faded. After the 2007 season, Roberts pulled out of MotoGP competition due to the lack of sponsorship.|$|E
25|$|The {{championship}} {{is currently}} {{divided into three}} classes: MotoGP, Moto2 and Moto3. All three classes use <b>four-stroke</b> engines. In 2010 the 250cc class {{was replaced by the}} new Moto2 600cc <b>four-stroke</b> class. In 2012 the 125cc class was replaced by the Moto3 250cc <b>four-stroke</b> class with a weight limit of 65kg with fuel, and the engine capacity for MotoGP increased from 800cc to 1,000cc.|$|E

50|$|<b>Four-stroking</b> is {{a common}} and {{expected}} behaviour with model engines, both glow fuel and diesel. These small engines rely on scavenging at their extremely high rotational speeds. When started, they run as inertially-scavenged four strokes and have a distinctive change in engine note when they accelerate past {{the point at which}} they begin to operate as two strokes. Owing to the scaling laws of such small engines, this <b>four-stroking</b> is an unavoidable consequence of limitations on their scavenging at slow speeds. However the same scaling laws also make the effects of <b>four-stroking</b> less severe and so the engines can idle satisfactorily in this mode without damage.|$|R
2500|$|... 2002: MotoGP {{replaces the}} 500cc class; <b>Four-Strokes</b> get an {{increase}} to 990cc but two-strokes stay at 500cc.|$|R
50|$|<b>Four-stroking</b> is {{less likely}} with {{compression}} ignition engines (i.e. diesel engines) than it is with spark-ignition engines (i.e. petrol engines). Diesel engines are also rare as the small two-strokes where inertial scavenging is used. When large two-stroke diesel engines are used, these have scavenging by forced induction and so are generally immune to <b>four-stroking</b> when idling at low speed or low power. These scavenge blowers may be mechanically-driven Roots blowers or turbochargers. As a turbocharger has some lag time coming up to speed, turbo-charged two-stroke diesels often display <b>four-stroking</b> when starting, or when suddenly accelerating from idle. Some large engines, such as those from EMD, minimize this by using a turbocharger with an auxiliary mechanical drive to give better scavenging at low rpm.|$|R
25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese {{motorcycle}} manufacturers {{presided over a}} boom period in motocross technology. The typical two-stroke air-cooled, twin-shock rear suspension machines gave way to machines that were water-cooled and fitted with single-shock absorber rear suspension. By 2003 increasingly stringent environmental laws in California forced some manufacturers to develop environmentally-friendly <b>four-stroke</b> technology. By 2004 all the major manufacturers had begun competing with <b>four-stroke</b> machines. European firms also experienced a resurgence with Husqvarna, Husaberg, and KTM winning world championships with <b>four-stroke</b> machinery.|$|E
25|$|Standard model {{powered by}} a Briggs & Stratton <b>four-stroke</b> engine.|$|E
25|$|While a <b>four-stroke</b> {{piston engine}} completes one {{combustion}} stroke per cylinder for every two rotations of the crankshaft (that is, one-half power stroke per crankshaft rotation per cylinder), each combustion chamber in the Wankel generates one combustion stroke per driveshaft rotation, i.e. one power stroke per rotor orbital revolution and three power strokes per rotor rotation. Thus, the power output of a Wankel engine is generally {{higher than that}} of a <b>four-stroke</b> piston engine of similar engine displacement in a similar state of tune; and {{higher than that of}} a <b>four-stroke</b> piston engine of similar physical dimensions and weight.|$|E

50|$|<b>Four-stroking</b> is {{problematic}} when a quiet, docile engine is required and also when the load on an engine suddenly changes.|$|R
5000|$|High speed {{two-stroke}} engines {{tend to be}} inefficient {{compared with}} <b>four-strokes</b> {{because some of the}} intake charge escapes unburnt with the exhaust.|$|R
25|$|Formula One {{currently}} uses 1.6 litre <b>four-stroke</b> turbocharged 90 degree V6 reciprocating engines.|$|E
25|$|National {{agencies}} that tax automobiles according to displacement and regulatory bodies in automobile racing variously consider the Wankel engine to be {{equivalent to a}} <b>four-stroke</b> piston engine of 1.5 to 2 times the displacement of one chamber per rotor, {{even though there are}} three chambers per rotor. Some racing series have banned the Wankel altogether, along with all other alternatives to the traditional reciprocating piston <b>four-stroke</b> design.|$|E
25|$|A <b>four-stroke</b> {{cylinder}} {{produces a}} power stroke only every other {{rotation of the}} crankshaft, with three strokes being pumping losses. This doubles the real surface-to-volume ratio for the <b>four-stroke</b> reciprocating piston engine and the displacement increased. The Wankel, therefore, has higher volumetric efficiency and lower pumping losses through the absence of choking valves. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, that cause the smoothness of the engine and the avoidance of the <b>four-stroke</b> cycle in a reciprocating engine, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher rpm's. This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Four-stroking</b> is {{not caused}} by an over-rich mixture, as is widely believed, {{although}} this can make it worse. Nor is it caused by excessive oil/fuel lubrication mixtures.|$|R
2500|$|... 2007: MotoGP engine {{capacity}} {{is restricted to}} 800cc <b>four-strokes.</b> Ducati wins the riders' championship with Casey Stoner and constructor title, the first European brand {{to do so in}} the premier class in 30 years.|$|R
50|$|Wave Dynamic considerations: Although <b>four-strokes</b> {{have this}} problem, {{two-stroke}}s rely much {{more heavily on}} wave action in the intake and exhaust systems. The two-stroke port design has strong effects on the wave timing and strength.|$|R
25|$|Any <b>four-stroke</b> twin {{cylinder}} motorcycle originally sold for road use with a water-cooled engine {{of up to}} 650cc engine capacity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>four-stroke</b> petrol (gasoline) {{internal}} combustion engine that still constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion was patented by Nikolaus Otto. The similar <b>four-stroke</b> diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed {{as a replacement for}} gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1838. The battery electric car owes its beginnings to Ányos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Planté, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.|$|E
25|$|Moto2 (also {{known as}} 600cc class) is the 600cc <b>four-stroke</b> class, {{launched}} in 2010 {{to replace the}} traditional 250cc two-stroke class. Engines are supplied exclusively by Honda, tyres by Dunlop and electronics are limited and supplied only by FIM sanctioned producers with a maximum cost set at 650 EUR. Carbon brake discs are banned, only steel brake discs are allowed. However, there are no chassis limitations. From 2010 onwards, only 600cc <b>four-stroke</b> Moto2 machines have been allowed.. Starting in 2019 Triumph will be the sole supplier of Moto2 engines.|$|E
5000|$|... 2007: MotoGP engine {{capacity}} {{is restricted to}} 800 cc <b>four-strokes.</b> Ducati wins the riders championship with Casey Stoner and constructor title, the first European brand {{to do so in}} the premier class in 30 years.|$|R
50|$|In {{chain saw}} operation, where natural {{fluctuation}} of chain bite during a cut can cause momentary over-revving, the full throttle mixture is adjusted for <b>four-stroking</b> to occur at a set high rpm, cutting engine speed and enriching lubrication.|$|R
50|$|<b>Four-stroking</b> is {{particularly}} noisy, {{especially as it}} occurs when the engine is otherwise relatively quiet and a vehicle potentially stationary at idle. In some cases, particularly with two-stroke engines installed in cars, extra exhaust silencing may be installed to offset this.|$|R
25|$|<b>Four-stroke</b> {{reciprocating}} {{engines are}} not very suitable for use with hydrogen fuel. The hydrogen can misfire on hot parts like the exhaust valve and spark plugs. Another problem concerns the hydrogenate attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines. In a Wankel engine, this problem is circumvented by using a ceramic apex seal against a ceramic surface, {{so that there is}} no oil film to suffer hydrogenate attack. The piston shell must be lubricated and cooled with oil. This substantially increases the lubricating oil consumption in a <b>four-stroke</b> hydrogen engine.|$|E
25|$|Triples (<b>four-stroke,</b> pushrod, three-cylinder engines) - The BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident were {{developed}} together. The Rocket 3 shares {{a majority of}} engine components and other parts with the Trident T150, but has forward-inclined cylinder barrels and a BSA frame.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1876, Maybach {{was sent}} to show Deutz's engines at the Philadelphia World's Fair (USA). On {{returning}} to Cologne in 1877, he concentrated on improving the <b>four-stroke</b> design to get it ready for its impending commercial launch.|$|E
50|$|For {{motorcycles}} with chain drives, {{the rear}} axle {{can usually be}} adjusted forward and back {{in relation to the}} swingarm, to adjust chain tension, but a few models (such as 1971/72 Triumph and BSA <b>four-strokes)</b> make the adjustment at the swingarm's pivot point.|$|R
50|$|Levis {{motorcycles}} (1911-1940), {{manufactured by}} Butterfields Ltd of Birmingham, England were {{for many years}} one of England's leading marques of two-stroke motorcycle. Levis built two-stroke machines from 1911, adding a line of <b>four-strokes</b> in 1928, which ran to 1941 when production ceased.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>four-stroking</b> engine {{eventually}} fires, {{the excess}} mixture {{from the previous}} failed combustion stroke causes an excessive cylinder pressure. This can be nearly double the normal pressure, leading to excess noise and potentially failure of overloaded bearings in the connecting rod.|$|R
