5|$|Howard and {{her husband}} were part of a circle of artists, writers and {{designers}} who were interested in visual images, <b>in</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> in the book arts. One close associate was the graphic designer Allan Fleming, whose Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight Drawings by Barbara Howard in 1970, a period when she was drawing the figure. The Canadian wood engraver Rosemary Kilbourn, a close friend since art college, taught Howard to carve images that could be printed in conjunction with text.|$|E

Later, Nikumbh reveals to Ishaan, that he too is a dyslexic and faced problems similar to Ishaan. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest <b>in</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> mathematics, and his grades improve.|$|E

5|$|Donnchadh's {{territory}} lay {{in what is}} now Scotland {{south of}} the River Forth, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland (Alba), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct or indirect control over most of the region to the south as far as the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland. Lothian and the Merse were the heartlands of {{the northern part of the}} old English Earldom of Northumbria, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of Lauderdale, Eskdale, Liddesdale, and most of Teviotdale and Annandale, were English <b>in</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> regarded themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having been under the control of the king of the Scots for at least a century.|$|E
5|$|Godwin had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> communication (as {{is evident in}} Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), {{and this was the}} topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of words and phrases also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, François Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem, all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Roman Empire was <b>in</b> <b>language</b> <b>and</b> civilization a Greek society. Linguistically, Byzantine or medieval Greek is {{situated}} between the Hellenistic (Koine) and modern {{phases of the}} language. Since {{as early as the}} Hellenistic era, Greek had been the lingua franca of the educated elites of the Eastern Mediterranean, spoken natively in the southern Balkans, the Greek islands, Asia Minor, and the ancient and Hellenistic Greek colonies of Southern Italy, the Black Sea, Western Asia and North Africa. At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium, the koine (Greek: κοινή) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings, while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he grew up}} in a {{traditional}} Jewish-Yiddish environment in Poland, Stutchkoff abandoned this way of life as an adolescent.
