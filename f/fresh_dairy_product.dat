50|$|Quark {{is a type}} of <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> made by warming soured milk to 20° - 27 °C {{until the}} desired degree of {{curdling}} is met, and then straining it. It can be classified as fresh acid-set cheese, though in some countries it is traditionally considered a distinct fermented milk product. Traditional quark is made without rennet, but in some modern dairies rennet is added. It is soft, white and unaged, and usually has no salt added.|$|E
40|$|Shelf-life {{extension}} of Ricotta cheese {{coated with a}} chitosan/whey protein edible film and stored under modified atmosphere at 4 degrees C was evaluated. The chitosan/whey protein film had 35 % and 21 % lower oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability, respectively, and about three times higher water vapor permeability than film prepared with chitosan alone. Over a 30 -day storage period, no differences in the pH of control and coated Ricotta cheeses were observed. While the titratable acidity of the control increased linearly {{during the first two}} weeks and remained constant {{for the rest of the}} storage period, the corresponding values for coated Ricotta cheese did not change significantly during the first 21 days and reached the acidity level (0. 34 +/- 0. 02 milliequivalent/ 100 g of analyzed sample) of the control only on day 30. The viable numbers of lactic acid bacteria and mesophilic and psychrotrophic microorganisms were significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in the chitosan/whey protein coated cheese, compared to the control, at each storage time. Our findings suggest a potential utility of chitosan/whey protein coatings to extend <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> shelf-life. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Proteins {{are usually}} {{considered}} to have a specific satiating effect but the differences between different protein sources are unclear. The objective was to compare the satiating effect of two isocaloric "solid" preloads containing egg or milk protein (omelette or fresh cheese), and to relate this effect to plasma metabolites and hormones variations. 30 subjects participated to 2 randomised test days, one per preload. On each test day, after consumption of the whole prelaod (322 kcal; 26 g proteins, 21 g lipids, 7. 5 g lactose), their appetite sensations were recorded until they asked for the next meal. The delay between the preload and the next meal {{as well as the}} spontaneous energy intake at the meal were measured. In 10 volunteers, blood samples were taken during the same time in order to measure plasma concentrations of energy metabolites and satiety hormones. The two products displayed no difference for the delay between the preload and the meal, but the omelette reduced significantly the energy intake at the meal by 300 kcal in comparison to the fresh cheese. Subjects reported to feel less hunger with the omelette. GIP and insulin secretions and uremia increased significantly after the fresh cheese but not the omelette, while glucagon and GLP- 1 secretions displayed delayed profiles with the omelette. We conclude that eggs present a more satiating effect than a <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> {{on the basis of a}} decreased energy intake. Uremia and hormone profiles suggest that this effect is mainly due to a slower digestion rate, caused by a different structure of the food...|$|E

40|$|Bio-plastics are {{starting}} to graduate from the 'emerging technology' stage to market acceptance as everyday materials. In the present study, nanocomposite coatings embedding copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) were developed as new active packaging for <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> In order to combine the bioactivity of CuNPs with a biodegradable polymer matrix, copper nanoparticles were satisfactorily incorporated into polylactic acid (PLA). Two different routes were carried out to prepare active films by picosecond-pulsed laser ablation. The nano-materials were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy. Copper release was also measured through atomic absorption analyses. To assess the antimicrobial effects of nanocomposite systems, both in vitro and in vivo tests were carried out. The active polylactic acid films showed good antibacterial activity. In fiordilatte samples stored at 4 C during 9 days, proliferation of main spoilage microorganisms was delayed with a consequent preservation of sensory attributes. These results represent a step forward in the possible application of copper in the food packaging industry. Industrial relevance Bio-plastics with active properties represent the most emerging technology in food packaging field. Results from the current paper demonstrate that antimicrobial films of PLA embedding copper nanoparticles could be developed and applied to <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> as fiordilatte. In fact, the in vivo test confirmed the antimicrobial effects on fiordilatte spoilage, without compromising sensory attributes.

40|$|Background and Objective: Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{is common}} among Saudi Arabian population. To evaluate {{the current status}} of vitamin D fortification and calcium content of commonly consumed food items by the Saudi population and to compare it to US data. Setting and Design: Cross-sectional market survey at markets of Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and State of Illinois, USA. Methods: A dietary survey was carried out for the content of calcium and vitamin D on the most commonly consumed food products by the Saudi population which are suppose to be fortified by vitamin D. The survey included different brands of fresh milk, yoghurt, powdered milk, cheese, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and orange juice. Vitamin D content in the products studied from the Saudi marketplace was compared with the suggested vitamin D content in the same products according to US Code of Federal Regulations recommendations. Results: The overall calcium content in the processed <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> is generally higher than the content in <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Vitamin D content in the <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> varied from 40 IU/L to 400 IU/L. None of the cereals or orange juice in Saudi Arabia contain vitamin D supplement. The vitamin D content in the food items from the Saudi marketplace is mostly lower than recommended by the US Code of Federal Regulations. Conclusion: Most commonly consumed food products by Saudi population which are suppose to be fortified by vitamin D either not fortified or contain an amount less than recommended by guidelines set for US marketplace...|$|R

While rural per capita consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> grew weakly in the late 1990 s, urban consumption of <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> has grown an average of 25 percent annually since 1997, reaching 15. 7 kg per person in 2002.

The aim of the present paper is to {{provide an overview of}} <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> consumption for French children, according to age, sex and type of <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Adequacy of <b>dairy</b> and calcium intakes in line with French national guidelines " 3 portions of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> per day" were also evaluated. Data were extracted and analyzed from the CCAF-Comportementet Consommations Alimentairesen France-study. Seven-day questionnaires were administered to free-living individuals from autumn 2009 to summer 2010. Subjects were children (n= 1171) aged 3 - 17 years. <b>Dairy</b> <b>products</b> contributed substantially to the intake of calcium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, vitamin B 2 and vitamin B 12. A general decrease in DP consumption has been observed since 2003. This is most notably due to a lower milk intake which is not compensated by increased cheese or <b>fresh</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Most of children (67 %), and up to 73 % of adolescents (15 - 17 y), did not reach the recommended " 3 servings of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> per day".
