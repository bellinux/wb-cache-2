5|$|Wichita {{continued}} to provide gunfire support {{throughout the rest}} of the month. On 27 April, a small caliber shell penetrated a <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> five feet below the waterline. After temporary repairs while still off Okinawa proved unsuccessful, Wichita returned to Kerama Retto where the damage was repaired on 29–30 April. Wichita then returned to the gun line. On 12 May, the ship was damaged by friendly fire. A 5inch round struck the port aircraft catapult; shell fragments hit the shield of an antiaircraft director, killing one man and injuring eleven others. She departed the area to rest and refit at Leyte, returning to Okinawa on 18 June. Wichita {{continued to}} provide gunfire support to the troops on Okinawa through July, as part of Task Unit 2. On 15 August, the ship's crew received word that the war with Japan was over. Wichita was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II.|$|E
500|$|Allocated {{project number}} A-102, the Nagato class was {{designed}} before Commander Yuzuru Hiraga was reassigned to the Navy Technical Department (NTD) responsible for ship design, although Hiraga is often {{credited with the}} design of these ships. In contrast to earlier designs, the Nagato class used the American [...] "all or nothing" [...] armor scheme that maximized the armor thickness protecting {{the core of the}} ship by eliminating armor elsewhere. The design had two armored decks of medium thickness rather than the single thicker deck used formerly. The ships also used a new type of underwater protection system that successfully resisted penetration by [...] torpedo warheads in full-scale trials. It consisted of a deep water-tight compartment adjacent to the hull, backed by a thick torpedo bulkhead that connected to the side and deck armor plates, with a deep <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> behind it.|$|E
500|$|The mines caused {{extensive}} {{damage to the}} ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated [...] off the port bow. A <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed {{in the bottom of}} the ship, and bulkheads in the double bottom buckled. Some [...] of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a list of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No. 1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings. The ship's two Arado Ar 196 floatplanes were thrown by the explosive concussion and completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin remarked that the successful repair effort was [...] "one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War." [...] Repairs lasted until 2 April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} of the machinery space were five liquid storage tanks: two large <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> on the centre of each wing, with two day service <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> just forward of the former, which supplied fuel to all engines by gravity feed. The fifth tank was used to store lubrication oil, and this was generally sited {{on the port side}} aft area of the space. The adjacent space on the STB side provided space for the engineer's work bench.|$|R
30|$|Background Due to high safety {{measures}} in production, {{transport and storage}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> it rarely occurs, that <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> will be released in the environment. One exception of this experience was the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> releases of private <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> during the “century flood” 2002 in Germany. By order of IWO (Institut für wirtschaftliche Oelheizung e.[*]V.), the authors investigated the environmental behaviour of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> after flood incidents.|$|R
50|$|The Switch House has eleven floors, {{numbered}} 0 to 10. Levels 0, 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Level 0 {{consists of}} the Tanks, spaces converted from the power station's original <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks,</b> while all other levels are housed in the tower extension building constructed above them. The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.|$|R

50|$|On 6 October 1978, the Spyros {{arrived in}} Singapore {{for a full}} special survey and general repairs at Jurong Shipyard. One of the items for repair was the {{replacement}} of the missing cover for the drip tray of the vent pipe leading from the aft starboard <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Air Force {{constructed}} about 24 main {{buildings in}} two LVAFS areas, the Operations and Cantonment Areas. Construction in the Operations Area consisted of four radar towers, four operational buildings, one water pump station, a power building, and five large above-ground fuel tanks. The Cantonment Area contained approximately five dormitories a dispensary, a mess hall, an administration building, an automotive shop, a maintenance shop, a storage building, a recreation building, one underground gasoline storage tank, and one large above-ground <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank.</b> Each building had a smaller day tank for storage of heating oil. Three septic tanks comprised the sewage treatment system.|$|E
50|$|The house {{underwent}} restoration between December 2005 and February 2010. The mortar {{has been}} refinished, new thermal insulated windows, rebuilt carriage house, inside re-plastered, refinished plank wooden floors, and new front porch. A new Crown Steam Boiler {{was installed in}} November 2009. A new cement basement floor was poured 4-6 inches thick; twin Roth 275 <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> installed November 2010; a widow's walk was installed in summer of 2010.|$|R
25|$|In {{the same}} report, {{it was also}} {{concluded}} that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of main engine power was sea water in the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil.</b> After the casualty, sea water contamination was found in settling tanks, day tanks, main engine primary filters and main engine injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> through overflow vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with fuel management practices onboard Aiviq.|$|R
50|$|The Electric Boat-built Porpoises {{had been}} built to an {{all-welded}} design. Conservative engineers and shipfitters at the Government yards stuck with tried and true riveting. Electric Boat's method proved superior, providing a stronger and tighter boat, as well as preventing leakage of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks</b> after depth charge attacks. Finally convinced of the efficacy of Electric Boat's innovation, Government yards finally converted wholesale to welding for their three Salmons and the Navy was entirely happy with the results.|$|R
50|$|U-234 sailed from Kiel for Kristiansand in Norway on {{the evening}} of 25 March 1945, {{accompanied}} by escort vessels and three Type XXIII coastal U-boats, arriving in Horten Naval Base two days later. The submersible spent the next eight days carrying out trials on her snorkel, during which she accidentally collided with a Type VIIC U-boat performing similar trials. Damage to both submarines was minor, and despite a diving and <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> being holed, U-234 was able to complete her trials. She then proceeded to Kristiansand, arriving on about 5 April, where she underwent repairs and topped up her provisions and fuel.|$|E
50|$|On December 6, 1917, Bagley conned {{his ship}} out of Brest harbor. At about 1621 that afternoon, the watch spied a torpedo wake. The {{destroyer}} maneuvered {{to avoid the}} torpedo, but in vain. It struck her starboard side and pierced her <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank.</b> Though Bagley and his crew worked frantically to save the ship, she went down within eight minutes carrying 64 crewmen with her. Bagley and 37 others {{made it into the}} icy water in boats and on rafts, and, thanks to the humanitarian gesture by Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose, the U-boat commander who radioed their location to Queenstown, they were all picked up by the 8th. Bagley earned the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his part in handling the situation.|$|E
5000|$|A logging engine {{comprised}} {{at least}} one powered winch around which was wound hemp rope or (later) steel cable. They were usually fitted with a boiler and usually equipped with skids, or sleds made from logs, to aid them during transit from one [...] "setting" [...] to the next. The larger steam donkeys often had a [...] "donkey house" [...] (a makeshift shelter for the crew) built either on the skids or as a separate structure. Usually, a water tank, and sometimes a <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank,</b> was mounted {{on the back of}} the sled. In rare cases, steam donkeys were also mounted on wheels. Later steam donkeys were built with multiple horizontally mounted drums/spools, on which were wound heavy steel cable instead of the original rope.|$|E
5000|$|Restricted to 30 mph {{and with}} an {{automatic}} transmission, the engine used Suzuki's CCI oil-injection lubrication system with underseat separate <b>fuel</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>tanks,</b> a <b>fuel</b> gauge and front and rear carriers.|$|R
50|$|At {{the request}} of the French government, Henri Coanda {{designed}} a single-seat armoured biplane. The forward fuselage was built as a monocoque shell built up from sheet steel, colloquially known as 'The Bath', at the Filton works. The armoured shell enclosed the engine, <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> and cockpit,with the pilot's seat being formed from the shaped rear bulkhead.|$|R
5000|$|Most large marine diesels run {{on heavy}} <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (sometimes called [...] "bunker oil"), {{which is a}} thick, viscous and almost {{flameproof}} fuel which is very safe to store and cheap to buy in bulk {{as it is a}} waste product from the petroleum refining industry. The fuel must not only be pre-heated, but must be kept heated during handling and storage in order to maintain its pumpability. This is usually accomplished by steam tracing on fuel lines and steam coils in <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanks.</b> The <b>fuel</b> is then preheated to over 100C before entering the engine in order to attain the proper viscosity for atomisation.|$|R
5000|$|Lloyd {{served in}} World War II with the Royal Marines as a Bandsman. On board the cruiser HMS Trinidad on Arctic convoys {{he was one}} of the Bandsmen manning the Transmitting Station, which was {{situated}} deep in the hull of the ship. In 1942, during an engagement, the ship fired a faulty torpedo which travelled in a circular track and hit the ship, fracturing a large <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank.</b> Many of Lloyd's shipmates were drowned in the fuel oil, and he was the last man to escape from the compartment. [...] He suffered severe mental and physical trauma from the shell shock, and was hospitalised before being discharged from the Royal Marines. After 4 years he was well enough to start composing again, through the devotion and love of his Swiss wife, Nancy.|$|E
50|$|As the North British JAs were withdrawn, {{most were}} {{stripped}} of parts {{to keep the}} South Island J and JA class locomotives running, along with the remaining North British JAs which by then were based out of Frankton Junction. Several of the tenders from JA 1287, 1288, 1290 locomotives, transferred south in November 1966, which were in relatively good condition, were rebuilt to accommodate a coal bunker {{in place of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> and attached to J class locomotives whose original 1939-built tenders were life-expired. Other parts of the surplus North Island JA were also refited,including the trailing trucks and approval was given to fit JA 1288 boiler. Most of the North Island JA were withdrawn too late in 1967 or early 1968, to be reprocessed, as A grade SI J overhauls had ceased with dieselisation.|$|E

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of diesel locomotives fuel storage and refuelling facilities were initially provided. An additional 12000 imp gal <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> was provided in 1961. In 1962 Nos.12 to 17 roads in No.2 shed were upgraded to suit servicing diesel locomotives {{at a cost of}} £98,534. The steam servicing pits on these 6 roads were removed and replaced by elevated rail service pits. These new pits were fitted with service platforms at footplate level {{on both sides of the}} pits. This new section was partitioned off from the rest of the steam shed to keep out the grime associated with steam locomotives using the rest of the shed, improved lighting and ventilation was also fitted to this section of the shed.Additional rooms for the maintenance of diesel loco components along with oil storage tanks were constructed at the rear of this new section.In 1965 a Hegenscheidt pit wheel lathe was purchased for use at the depot for turning diesel loco wheels. This lathe was housed in a new shed constructed on land to the West of No.1 Roundhouse at a cost of £90,962. This building was also fitted with a 3 LT overhead crane.|$|E

50|$|A design {{weakness}} of earlier classes solved by the Tench re-design were the ballast tank vent riser pipes that {{passed through the}} interior of the boat in the forward and after torpedo rooms. These pipes allowed #1 and #7 Main Ballast Tanks (MBT) (located in the single hull sections of the boat) to vent air during diving and allowing water to flood into them from below. The tops of these tanks formed the walking deck in the interior of both rooms and thus the normal location of the vent valves (the top of the tank) could not be used. The riser pipes allowed the tanks to vent but when the tanks were full these pipes contained water at full submergence pressure inside the torpedo rooms. If these pipes ruptured during depth charge attack, catastrophic flooding would occur. Solving this problem initially proved quite difficult, but ultimately required the complete rearrangement of the ballast tanks. #1 MBT was moved to a location forward {{of the end of the}} pressure hull, thus allowing it to vent directly into the superstructure like the rest of the MBT's. This move eliminated the riser pipes completely. #7 MBT, after stability and buoyancy calculations were run was found to be redundant and was converted to a variable <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> as mentioned above. These changes forced the rearrangement of the associated piping runs and the location of many of the other tanks. Remarkably, these changes resulted in a boat that was visually almost indistinguishable from the earlier Balao class, with the exception of a sharper angle (or knuckle) at the lower corner of the bow (only visible when the boat was drydocked).|$|E
