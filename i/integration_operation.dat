40|$|Abstract: When {{wireless}} channels undergo fast fading, non-coherent {{frequency shift}} keying (FSK) (de) modulation schemes may be considered for amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative com-munications. In this paper, we derive the bit-error-rate perfor-mance of partial non-coherent receiver as a lower bound of the optimal non-coherent receiver for FSK modulated AF cooperative communications. From the simulation and analytical results, {{it is found that}} the derived lower bound is very closed to simulation results. This result shows that knowing partial channel state infor-mation may not improve system performance significantly. On the other hand, conventional optimal non-coherent receiver involves complicated <b>integration</b> <b>operation.</b> To address the above complex-ity issue, we also propose a near optimal non-coherent receiver which does not involve <b>integration</b> <b>operation.</b> Simulation results have shown that the performance gap between the proposed near optimal receiver and the optimal receiver is small.

40|$|Long-term global {{analysis}} of lower-dimensional {{systems can be}} performed by in a computationally efficient manner by using cell mapping methods. Scaling limitations associated with higher order systems can be addressed by using the multiple degree-of-freedom cell mapping (MDCM) method. However, the MDCM algorithm consists {{of a number of}} sequential operations which limits its ability to utilize the parallel processing capabilities of modern computers. A parallelized multiple degree-of-freedom cell mapping (PMDCM) method is introduced here to address this limitation. By restructuring the MDCM algorithm to enable parallel operations, the efficiency of the algorithm is significantly enhanced. The details of the PMDCM algorithm are presented and performance is compared to the MDCM method and baseline obtained by using the grid-of-starts method. By running the PMDCM method on a workstation with a quad-core processor and by parallelizing 100 numerical <b>integration</b> <b>operations,</b> the total computation time is decreased by 93 % from the time required of the MDCM method. Parallelizing the <b>integration</b> <b>operations</b> also reduces the error which can accumulate when by using the sequential operations of the MDCM method...|$|R

30|$|The typical {{strength}} of a GNSS signal in open-sky conditions is approximately − 130  dBm, which is considered strong. If the input is a strong signal, the PRN correlation can be performed by a coherent <b>integration</b> <b>operation</b> between a full PRN sequence and an input signal from the ADC with the same signal length. The signal acquisition for strong satellite signals can typically be accomplished after one round of correlation. When satellite signals are partially blocked or shaded, the signal strengths {{may be in the}} − 150  dBm range, and such signals are considered weak. To acquire weak signals, more input data are necessary to perform a coherent or non-coherent <b>integration</b> <b>operation</b> to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [14, 15]. A more general scenario is that signals from different satellites vary in strengths, with some in the − 130  dBm range and others in the − 150  dBm range or even lower. Traditional approaches conduct searches using input data, whose length is often 1 – 10  ms, to acquire the largest number of satellite signals. Although this practice is effective in finding satellites with weak signals, it incurs unnecessary computational cost when finding satellites with strong signals.|$|E

40|$|Data {{integration}} {{is the problem}} of combining data from multiple autonomous data sources, and providing a unified view to the users. The problem has been studied extensively over the past two decades, and focused more on integrating traditional, exact relational data. Integration over uncertain data sources is a more recent problem and a more challenging one. The purpose of this thesis is to understand the semantics and techniques of uncertain data integration over multiple such data sources. We study existing proposals for uncertain and probabilistic data integration. As a basis of our work, we consider two <b>integration</b> <b>operations,</b> one in the possible worlds model, and the other in a compact model. We introduce the properties of the <b>integration</b> <b>operations</b> proposed for two sources, and consider these properties to develop a framework for integrating multiple sources. For this, we also extend and generalize a conversion algorithm from possible worlds model to the compact probabilistic relations. We define the integration procedure, the concept of probability consistency, and a probability adjustment method when the consistency is violated. We build a running prototype of the proposed framework to show its feasibility and to automate the probability calculation.
