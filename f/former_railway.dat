5|$|Highgate is a London Underground {{station and}} <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> station in Archway Road, in the London Borough of Haringey in north London.

5|$|The local {{authorities}} run cycle hire centres at Ashbourne, Parsley Hay, Middleton Top and the Upper Derwent Valley. Wheelchair access is possible at several {{places on the}} <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> trails, and cycle hire centres offer vehicles adapted to wheelchair users. There is a programme to make footpaths more accessible to less-agile walkers by replacing climbing stiles with walkers' gates.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> lines.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} stand above a {{warren of}} tunnels: previously, live animals {{were brought to}} market by hoof (from the mid-19th century onwards they arrived by rail) and were slaughtered on site. The <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> tunnels are now used for storage, parking and as basements. An impressive cobbled ramp spirals down around West Smithfield's public garden, {{on the south side}} of the Market, providing access to part of this area. Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} western boundary was {{the now-defunct}} Palace Gates Line of the Great Eastern Railway (GER), {{a short distance}} {{to the east of}} Wood Green High Road. Since the railway's closure in 1964, much of the area between the <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> line and Wood Green High Road has been occupied by the eastern section of the large The Mall Wood Green shopping, cinema and residential complex (commonly known as Shopping City).|$|E
5|$|Line B of Porto Metro links Póvoa de Varzim to Porto and {{the airport}} with two services: a {{standard}} and a shuttle (the Expresso). Through Verdes station, Metro trains link {{the city and}} the airport. This waiting station to reach Póvoa de Varzim is a small public park near the airport, and it literally means the green park station. The line operates on a <b>former</b> <b>railway,</b> which opened in 1875 and closed in 2002 to give way for the metro. The railway network was expanded and reached Famalicão in 1881, it was closed entirely in 1995 due to an accident with a bus and became a rail trail.|$|E

Shortly afterwards it crossed over the <b>former</b> Boxtel-Büderich <b>railway</b> of the <b>former</b> Noord-Brabantsch-Duitsche Spoorweg-Maatschappij (North Brabant-German Railway Company). The line ended at Kleve station on the Lower Left Rhine Railway (built by the RhE).|$|R
5|$|On the {{southern}} {{side of the}} town, on a triangle of land bounded on the east by the A37, on the north by {{the line of the}} former East Somerset Railway, and on the west by Cannard's Grave Road, is Tadley Acres, a modern housing development built on land partly belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall. The development has been praised for the quality of its design and the use of locally sourced natural building materials. North of the <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> line is Collett Park. Across Cannard's Grave Road from Tadley Acres is the Mid-Somerset Showground. Immediately to the south-west of the town centre, on a site which {{at the start of the}} 20th century had been the grounds of the former Summerleaze House and then a shoe-factory, is the Townsend Retail Park, built in 2006–7.|$|E
5|$|The port {{remained}} open {{to service}} the papermills, importing wood pulp and esparto grass from Russia and Scandinavia, using mainly East European registered vessels after World War II. Requiring a return load, {{the result was that}} Watchet became a leading UK port for the export of car parts, tractors and other industrial goods. However, with the replacement of coal with oil from the mid-1960s, the port traffic began to terminally decline. The harbour was in commercial use until 2000, the harbour has now been converted into a marina for pleasure boats. It is surrounded by renovated quaysides and narrow streets. The commercial esplanade has been refurbished with new shelters, information points, and the provision of new paving in some areas, as well as railings, lamps, curved benches, planters and new tree plantings. There are several museums in the town, including the Market House Museum, which explores the history of the town and its harbour. The building was constructed in 1820 {{on the site of the}} previous market house which had been demolished in 1805. It was converted into a museum in 1979. It houses a collection of exhibits about the natural history of Watchet and the surrounding area. The focus is on nautical and maritime history of the port. Artefacts include those relating to: Archaeology, Coins and Medals, Land Transport, Maritime, Natural Sciences, Science and Technology and Social History. At the rear of the museum building is the old town lock-up for the temporary detention of people, often drunks who were usually released the next day or to hold people being brought before the local magistrate. The Watchet Boat Museum, which is housed in the 1862 Victorian architecture <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> goods shed, displays the unusual local flatner boats and associated artefacts.|$|E

25|$|The system {{consists}} of a mix of on-street running, reserved right-of-way and <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> alignment. The Middlewood and Malin Bridge lines run mainly on the street up to the City Centre; the Meadowhall line runs totally on reserved track – from Attercliffe to Meadowhall it runs on <b>former</b> <b>railway</b> line alongside a freight line to Tinsley Yard and the main line at Rotherham Central. The inner part of the Halfway and Herdings Park lines consist of on-street running, {{with the exception of}} the railway station and the viaduct at Granville Road. The Herdings line then runs on reserved track, and the Halfway line crosses the county border into Derbyshire and out again on reserved lines in the countryside. This line also serves Crystal Peaks Shopping Centre.|$|E
