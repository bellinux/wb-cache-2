5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E

500|$|The Torre Agbar is a 38-story [...] {{skyscraper}} {{located in}} the Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes of the Poblenou neighborhood of Barcelona, Spain. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it is named after its owners, the Agbar Group, a holding company whose interests include the Barcelona water company Aigües de Barcelona. An example of high-tech architecture in the city, its design combines {{a number of different}} architectural concepts, resulting in a striking structure built with reinforced concrete, covered with a facade of glass, and over 4,500 window openings cut out of the structural concrete. The building stands out on the skyline of Barcelona; it is the third tallest building in the city, standing at 144.44m (473.88ft), with an area of over 50,000 square metres, of which 30,000 are offices. 2,500 LED bulbs cause the tower to change color at night. It was officially opened by the King of Spain on 16 September 2005. Nouvel claims it to be inspired by a geyser and the nearby mountain of Montserrat, although he does note its phallic appearance. Although many draw comparisons with the phallus, locals refer to the structure as el supositorio (the suppository), [...] a <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> that is inserted into the rectum or vagina.|$|E

2500|$|Nanotechnology {{is helpful}} in {{delivering}} drugs and other molecules across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). [...] Nanoparticles allow drugs, or other foreign molecules, to efficiently cross the BBB by camouflaging themselves and tricking the brain into {{providing them with}} the ability to cross the BBB in a process called the Trojan Horse Method. [...] Using nanotechnology is advantageous because only the engineered complex is necessary whereas in ordinary applications the active compound must carry out the reaction. This allows for maximum efficacy of the active drug. Also, the use of nanoparticles results in the attraction of proteins to the surfaces of cells, giving cell membranes a biological identity. They also use endogenous active transport where transferrin, an iron binding protein, is linked to rod-shaped semiconductor nanocrystals, in order to move across the BBB into the brain. This discovery is a promising development towards designing an efficient nanoparticle-based <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> {{particularly}} nanomaterial-based <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> {{possess a}} tremendous amount of potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of <b>drugs.</b> Controlled <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> targeted to a specific disease is designed to significantly improve the pharmaceutical effects of drugs and reduce their side effects. Unfortunately, only a few targeted <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> can achieve high targeting efficiency after intravenous injection, even with the development of numerous surface markers and targeting modalities. Thus, alternative drug and nanomedicine targeting approaches are desired. Circulating cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, and stem cells, present innate disease sensing and homing properties. Hence, using living cells as <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> carriers has gained increasing interest in recent years. This review highlights the recent advances in the design of cell-mediated <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> and targeting mechanisms. The approaches of drug encapsulation/ conjugation to cell carriers, cell-mediated targeting mechanisms, and the methods of controlled drug release are elaborated here. Cell-based “live ” targeting and delivery could be used to facilitate a more specific, robust, and smart payload distribution for the next-generation <b>drug</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
