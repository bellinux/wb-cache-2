50|$|The {{endocrine}} <b>disrupting</b> <b>activity</b> of dioxins {{is thought}} to occur as a down-stream function of AH receptor activation, with thyroid status in particular being a sensitive marker of exposure. It {{is important to note}} that TCDD, along with the other PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like coplanar PCBs are not direct agonists or antagonists of hormones, and are not active in assays which directly screen for these activities such as ER-CALUX and AR-CALUX. These compounds have also not been shown to have any direct mutagenic or genotoxic activity. Their main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion. A mixture of PCBs such as Aroclor may contain PCB compounds which are known estrogen agonists, but on the other hand are not classified as dioxin-like in terms of toxicity. Mutagenic effects have been established for some lower chlorinated chemicals such as 3-chlorodibenzofuran, which is neither persistent nor an AH receptor agonist.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{electrical}} stimulation that utilizes brief, high-voltage electric shock to activate neurons, which can potentially activate pain fibers, {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) was developed by Baker in 1985. TMS uses a magnetic wire above the scalp, which carries a sharp and high current pulse. A time variant magnetic field is induced perpendicular to the coil due to the applied pulse which consequently generates an electric field based on Maxwell's law. The electric field provides the necessary current for a non-invasive and much less painful stimulation. There are two TMS devices called single pulse TMS and repetitive pulse TMS (rTMS) while the latter has greater effect but potential to cause seizure. TMS {{can be used for}} therapy particularly in psychiatry, as a tool to measure central motor conduction and a research tool to study different aspects of human brain physiology such as motor function, vision, and language. The rTMS method has been used to treat epilepsy with rates of 8-25 Hz for 10 seconds. The other therapeutic uses of rTMS include parkinson diseases, dystonia and mood diseases. Also, TMS can be used to determine the contribution of cortical networks to specific cognitive functions by <b>disrupting</b> <b>activity</b> in the focal brain region.

5000|$|Her most cited work explores social {{rejection}} and the neural regions it activates. According to Eisenberger, the same neural regions that are activated {{in response to}} physical pain are also activated when one feels socially excluded. The feeling of social exclusion {{can be caused by}} exclusion from one person or a group of people. Her paper Does Rejection Hurt? An fMRI study of social exclusion, tested the hypothesis that the brain bases of social pain {{are similar to those of}} physical pain by examining the brain activity of participants who were excluded while playing a virtual ball tossing game. Participants were subject to FMRI scans while playing the virtual ball game and experiencing social exclusion, with analyses focusing on activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. The anterior cingulate cortex is activated when an automatic response is [...] "inappropriate". The automatic response caused by physical pain is a frequent activator of the anterior cingulate cortex. The participants' scans showed that the anterior cingulate cortex was more active during the game when they were excluded than when they were included. The study also showed that the right ventral prefrontal cortex was active during exclusion and regulated the distress of social exclusion by <b>disrupting</b> <b>activity</b> in the anterior cingulate cortex. Almost identical results were found in studying brain activity associated with self-regulation of physical pain, suggesting a correlation between the neural mechanisms underlying social pain and physical pain, in support of Eisenberger's hypothesis.|$|E

This study aimed to establish a rapid and sensitive screening assay based on TH-response gene expression analysis using Pelophylax nigromaculatus, a native frog species distributed widely in East Asia, especially in China. To achieve this, five candidate TH-response genes that were sensitive to T 3 induction were chosen as molecular markers, and T 3 induction was determined as 0. 2 nmol/L T 3 exposure for 48 hr. The developed assay can detect the agonistic activity of T 3 with a lowest observed effective concentration of 0. 001 nmol/L and EC 50 at around 0. 118 - 1. 229 nmol/L, exhibiting comparable or higher sensitivity than previously reported assays. We further validated the efficiency of the developed assay by detecting the TH signaling <b>disrupting</b> <b>activity</b> of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), a known TH signaling disruptor. In accordance with previous reports, we found a weak TH agonistic activity for TBBPA in the absence of T 3, whereas a TH antagonistic activity was found for TBBPA at higher concentrations in the presence of T 3, showing that the P. nigromaculatus assay is effective for detecting TH signaling <b>disrupting</b> <b>activity.</b> Importantly, we observed non-monotonic dose-dependent <b>disrupting</b> <b>activity</b> of TBBPA in the presence of T 3, which is difficult to detect with in vitro reporter gene assays.

We became interested in the imidazole core since the basicity of its N- 3 atom might be exploited to prepare water soluble salts having improved physico-chemical properties. On the other hand, since the 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyphenyl substituted A ring of the CA- 4 seems to be essential for the bioactivity of this natural product, we maintained this moiety in compounds 1 and 2 and evaluated the effect due to the replacement of the B-ring of CA- 4 with a variety of aryl substituents.

These protocols let us to prepare selectively compounds 1 and 2 starting from common and cheap precursors on a multigram scale. We then evaluated the vascular <b>disrupting</b> <b>activity</b> of some selected imidazole derivatives in vitro on HUVECs, and in vivo on experimental tumors.

The Gly-Ile-Gly sequence of CA-MA was deleted in CA-MA 1 and replaced with Pro and Gly-Pro-Gly in CA-MA 2 and CA-MA 3, respectively. CA-MA 1 and CA-MA 3 caused a significant decrease in the bactericidal rate against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the tumoricidal activity against four different tumor cells, and the PC/PS (4 : 1, w/w) vesicle-aggregating and <b>disrupting</b> <b>activities.</b> However, CA-MA 2 showed a similar bactericidal rate and antitumor, vesicle-aggregating and <b>disrupting</b> <b>activities,</b> as compared with CA-MA. These results suggested that the flexibility or β-turn induced by Gly-Ile-Gly or Pro in the central part of CA-MA may be important in the electrostatic interaction of the cationic short α-helical region in the N-terminus with the cell membrane surface and the hydrophobic interaction of amphipathic α-helical region in the C-terminus with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the cell membrane.

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a plasma carrier protein that binds androgens and estrogens and represents a potential target for phthalate endocrine disruptor function in the body. In the present study, the binding mechanism of the nine phthalates i. e. DMP, DBP, DIBP, BBP, DNHP, DEHP, DNOP, DINP, DIDP with human SHBG was delineated by molecular docking simulation. Docking complexes of the nine phthalates displayed interactions with 15 - 31 amino acid residues of SHBG and a commonality of 55 - 95 % interacting residues between natural ligand of SHBG, dihydrotestosterone, and the nine phthalate compounds was observed. The binding affinity values were more negative for long chain phthalates DEHP, DNOP, DINP, and DIDP compared to short chain phthalates such as DMP and DBP. The Dock score and Glide score values were also higher for long chain phthalates compared to short chain phthalates.

In both systems we could detect an altered expression of the genes involved in thyroid hormones synthesis and of thyroid specific transcriptional factors in BPA dose and time dependent manner. Our results suggest that BPA exerts a direct effect on thyroid follicular cell. We show that these cells can "sense" very low amount of BPA. Thus they, potentially, represent an ideal in vitro system to develop assays to detect BPA and other pollutants with thyroid <b>disrupting</b> <b>activity</b> at level far below the ones considered to be environmental relevant.
