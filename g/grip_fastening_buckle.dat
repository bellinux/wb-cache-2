40|$|The joining of {{different}} materials and material combinations can be occur either metallic continuity like welding, bonding and soldering or also on a form-fit and frictional continuity {{like in the}} screwing and rivets. The mechanical connection offers a large potential to join different materials without thermal loading. The lockbolt (SRB) as a high-strength friction <b>grip</b> <b>fastening</b> system represents in this regard a synthesis between full rivet and screw. They find in practice many applications. Computation references, norms and regulations for a comprehensive employment are only limited available or rather missing completely, that´s why potential users can often not use this alternative joining technology. Analysed are setting behavior and selective strength properties of lockbolts with numeric computations as a contribution to advance the determination of these properties for constructive dimensioning and to compare with experimental results...|$|R

50|$|Greaves {{were common}} until around the ninth century, when they largely disappeared. There {{is not much}} {{evidence}} of their use until {{the second quarter of}} the thirteenth century. There were a few references to the use of greaves before then, most notably the Bible’s Goliath and the Trinity College Apocalypse, but the lack of other evidence suggests that they were uncommon at the time. Almost all greaves used at this time are known as “Demi-greaves”, or greaves that only protected the shin. Early in the fourteenth century, many illustrations were found showing “closed greaves”, or greaves that protected the entire leg. Closed greaves are made of two plates joined on the outside by hinges and <b>fastening</b> with <b>buckles</b> and straps on the inside.|$|R

50|$|In New Zealand and Australia, sheep shearers' moccasins are {{constructed}} of a synthetic, cream-colored felt, with a back seam and {{gathered at the}} top of the rounded toe. These moccasins are laced in the front, and the lacing is covered with a flap <b>fastened</b> with a <b>buckle</b> at the shoe's outer side.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{of products or}} components in a manufacturing or dispatch environment {{is a process that}} does not add any value, which particularly applies to large, heavy-weight elements. On the other hand, this process is time-consuming and requires a sophisticated infrastructure. Cranes are normally used for such lifting operations. Yet they can hardly be automated, which is due, on the one hand, to the <b>gripping</b> or <b>fastening</b> process that is specific to each component, but also results from the swaying motion and the non-defined orientation of the component. A handling system that combines the advantages of a crane with the option to automate the process would open up streamlining potentials for many applications, including the {{transport of}} small products such as paving blocks or curbs, the transport of materials or semi-finished products from one station to another in the production line, and the loading of trucks from an automated storage area...|$|R
25|$|A harness gag encircles the head, with straps {{generally}} {{secured by}} <b>buckles</b> <b>fastened</b> at the back. Head harnesses are {{most commonly used}} to provide points of attachments to secure various kinds of gags, such as ball gags, bit gags, muzzle gags and ring gags; although they also have other uses, such as providing attachment points for other forms of bondage, or may be used simply for their psychological effect. Head harnesses may also function as a gag by themselves, by restricting the ability to open the mouth, or have a mouth cover as an integral part.|$|R
50|$|The vamp is sewn {{on top of}} the {{quarters}}. (A monk strap boot also <b>fastens</b> with a <b>buckle,</b> but {{the quarters}} are sewn {{on top of the}} vamp.) The strap is typically in two parts, each attached to the vamp. The buckle end is attached to the inboard side and extends halfway around the ankle, counterclockwise on the right boot. The free end is attached to the outboard side and extends entirely around the ankle, clockwise on the right boot. There is typically a loop sewn {{to the back of the}} boot that both strap ends can be passed through.|$|R
5000|$|Hawes & Curtis {{are known}} for having {{introduced}} the backless evening waistcoat. [...] It was an innovation of the ‘dress soft’ era popularised by the Duke of Windsor. The waistcoat was designed without a back and {{held in place by}} means of bands, <b>fastened</b> with a <b>buckle</b> or button across the back at the waistline. When worn, the waistcoat always remained in position under the tailcoat and was renowned for its comfort. Fred Astaire allegedly approached Hawes & Curtis to have one made, only to be regretfully refused due to the high demand for such garments from the British aristocracy.|$|R
60|$|The {{thought of}} a coming fray {{reconciled}} the men to their departure from their quiet and happy resting place.

The men were in light marching order, having left everything superfluous behind them in the wagon; and they marched briskly along over hill and through forest without a halt, till at {{three o'clock in the}} morning the little town of Mansfeld, with its castle rising above it, was visible before them in the first light of morning.|$|R
