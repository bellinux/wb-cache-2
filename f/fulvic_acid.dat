40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the study of {{dissociation}} behaviour of natural biocolloids, namely humic <b>acids</b> and <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids.</b> Humic and <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> are natural, heterogeneous, high molecular weight substances which behave as weakly acidic polyelectrolytes and they have complex not exactly described structure. They are formed by biochemical transformations of organic residues (mainly plants). They are part of the soil, water, peat, sediments and coal. Solubility of humic acids is affected by pH value. The higher the pH value is the higher the solubility is. <b>Fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> are soluble in whole range of pH values. The aim of this diploma thesis is to determine the dissociation constant for the five kinds of humic acids and four kinds of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids,</b> which have been isolated from various natural sources. These samples were purchased from IHSS. Dissociation constants were determined by the conductometric method and a combination of measurment pH and the content of acidic functional groups in Na 2 SO 4.

40|$|As {{a result}} of seriously {{polluted}} raw water sources, some water-treatment plants in China are intending to apply the biofilm process as a pretreatment prior to the traditional drinking water-treatment systems. These polluted raw waters contain higher total organic matter and ammonium than unpolluted waters. It {{has been reported that}} synthetic organic matter can cause nitrite accumulation. However, there have been few reports about the influence of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> on nitrification. <b>Fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> are {{the main part of the}} natural organic matter in waters, and nitrite is a toxic substance which has been paid attention to recently, especially in the treatment of drinking water, so it is necessary to study the effect of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> on the nitrification process. In this experiment, a so-called &# 39;attapulgas clay&# 39; biofilm reactor was set up, in which attapulgas clay was packed as the support medium for biological growth. After 40 days start-up, a multi-species biofilm developed in the reactor. The influence of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> on nitrite accumulation was investigated. Nitrite accumulation in the biofilm process was related to <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> loadings. When the <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> loading was less than 0. 002 kg (TOC) /h. m(3), no nitrite build-up appeared; but when the loading was in the range of 0. 002 - 0. 02 kg (TOC) /h. m(3), nitrite built up and the concentration of nitrite could reach as high as 11. 4 mg/l. When the loading was above 0. 07 kg (TOC) /h. m(3), the nitrification process was completely inhibited. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|This {{disease has}} been {{recognized}} for over 150 years but its cause {{has not yet been}} completely defined. Currently the accepted potential causes of KBD include mycotoxins present in grain, trace mineral deficiency in nutrition, and high levels of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acid</b> in drinking water. Selenium and iodine have been considered the most important deficiencies associated with KBD. Mycotoxins produced by fungi can contaminate grain, which may cause KBD because mycotoxins cause the production of free radicals. T-2 is the mycotoxin implicated with KBD, produced by members of several fungal genera. T-2 toxin can cause lesions in hematopoietic, lymphoid, gastrointestinal, and cartilage tissues, especially in physeal cartilage. <b>Fulvic</b> <b>acid</b> present in drinking water damages cartilage cells.

50|$|Soil is well {{developed}} in the forest {{as suggested by the}} thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acid,</b> greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.|$|E
50|$|Tropical forests (rainforests) {{receive more}} {{insolation}} and rainfall over longer growing seasons {{than any other}} environment on earth.

Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acid</b> to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of cerium (IV) oxide nanoparticles has been first investigated at different pH conditions. The point of zero charge was determined {{as well as}} the stability domains using dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis and scanning electron microscopy. A baseline hydrodynamic diameter of 180 nm was obtained indicating that individual CeO 2 nanoparticles are forming small aggregates. Then we analyzed the particle behavior at variable concentrations of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> for three different pH-electrostatic scenarios corresponding to positive, neutral and negative CeO 2 surface charges. The presence of <b>fulvic</b> <b>acids</b> was found to play a key role on the CeO 2 stability via the formation of electrostatic complexes.

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s, TOC {{has been an}} {{analytic}} technique used to measure water quality during the drinking water purification process. TOC in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. Humic acid, <b>fulvic</b> <b>acid,</b> amines, and urea are examples of NOM. Some detergents, pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, industrial chemicals, and chlorinated organics are examples of synthetic sources. Before source water is treated for disinfection, TOC provides {{an estimate of the}} amount of NOM in the water source. In water treatment facilities, source water is subject to reaction with chloride containing disinfectants. When the raw water is chlorinated, active chlorine compounds (Cl2, HOCl, ClO−) react with NOM to produce chlorinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Researchers have determined that higher levels of NOM in source water during the disinfection process will increase the amount of carcinogens in the processed drinking water.|$|E
50|$|Humic acids are a {{principal}} component of humic substances, {{which are the}} major organic constituents of soil (humus), peat and coal. It is also a major organic constituent of many upland streams, dystrophic lakes, and ocean water. It is produced by biodegradation of dead organic matter. It {{is not a single}} acid; rather, it is a complex mixture of many different acids containing carboxyl and phenolate groups so that the mixture behaves functionally as a dibasic acid or, occasionally, as a tribasic acid. Humic acids can form complexes with ions that are commonly found in the environment creating humic colloids. Humic acids are insoluble in water at acid pH, whereas fulvic acids are also derived from humic substances but are soluble in water across the full range of pH. Humic and fulvic acids are commonly used as a soil supplement in agriculture, and less commonly as a human nutritional supplement. As a nutrition supplement, <b>fulvic</b> <b>acid</b> {{can be found in a}} liquid form as a component of mineral colloids. Fulvic acids are poly-electrolytes and are unique colloids that diffuse easily through membranes whereas all other colloids do not.|$|E
50|$|Potassium humate is the {{potassium}} salt of humic acid. It is manufactured commercially by alkaline extraction of brown coal (lignite) Leonardite {{to be used}} mainly as a soil conditioner. The extraction is performed in water {{with the addition of}} potassium hydroxide (KOH), sequestering agents and hydrotropic surfactants. Heat is used to increase the solubility of humic acids and hence more potassium humate can be extracted. The resulting liquid is dried to produce the amorphous crystalline like product which can then be added as a granule to fertiliser. The potassium humate granules by way of chemical extraction lose their hydrophobic properties and are now soluble. Depending on the source material product quality varies. High quality oxidised lignite (brown coal), usually referred to as leonardite, is the best source material for extraction of large quantities of potassium humate. The less oxidised the coal the less potassium humate extracted. Sources low in ash produce the best quality. Less oxidised brown coal contains a higher proportion of the insoluble humin fraction and along with peat which is lower in humic acid content and usually high in ash content requires separation by filtration or centrifugation to remove ash, humin. Peat is also high in non humified organic matter that needs to be reduced to produce a high quality product. The benefit of peat is that it is usually 2-3 times higher in <b>fulvic</b> <b>acid</b> content, which are the low molecular weight fractions of humic acid that are high in oxygen containing functional groups and soluble at a low pH of <1. Fulvic acids have a higher cation exchange capacity and therefore have a higher chemical interaction with fertilisers and are able to form soluble chelates of trace metals.|$|E
