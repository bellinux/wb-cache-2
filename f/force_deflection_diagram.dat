40|$|Abstract [...] This study {{investigated}} the reported lack of ability of the eggcrate cushion (EC) to provide wheelchair users with adequate support necessary for comfort and tolerably low-peak sitting pressures over time. The primary parameter used to quantify {{the ability of the}} cushion to distribute load was the indention <b>force</b> <b>deflection</b> (IFD) metric. The EC was compared to a high-density planar foam cushion (HD). The IFD was measured for both cushions after successive periods of compression to simulate use. Study results failed to support the common perception that the soft EC would lose its supportive properties more rapidly than the much firmer HD cushion. Although the initial IFD of the EC was much lower than that of the HD, a smaller percentage of its IFD was lost after compression. This difference between the two cushions likely was due to differences in packaging. The EC was rolled into a cylinder, compressing it to 60 % of its original thickness; the HD was packaged without compression.

The best materials and methods for repair have not been conclusively determined. Purpose. This study investigated the fracture <b>force,</b> <b>deflection</b> at fracture, and toughness of a heat-polymerized denture base material repaired with heat-polymerized resin, autopolymerized resin alone, or autopolymerized resin with glass fiber or wire reinforcement. Material and methods. Eight groups were evaluated: 6 with autopolymerized resin repairs, 1 with heat-polymerized resin repairs, and a control group of intact specimens. The 6 autopolymerized resin groups included 1 group xvith no reinforcement, 1 treated with microwave irradiation after polymerization, 2 with monolayer or multilayer glass fiber reinforcement, and 2 with round or braided wire reinforcement. Each group consisted of 12 specimens. The experimental specimens were cut, and a 3 -mm butt joint gap was repaired {{as indicated by the}} group assignment. A 3 -point bending test was used to determine the fracture <b>force,</b> <b>deflection</b> at fracture, and toughness of the specimens. The data were analyzed with 1 -way analysis of variance and the Tukey post-hoc test (alpha=. 05). Results. The fracture force (28. 4 to 73. 4 N), deflection (1. 6 to 3. 8 mm), and toughness (0. 02 to 0. 13 J) values for all repaired groups were significantly lower than those for the control group (82. 79 N, 4. 4 mm, and 0. 16 J, respectively), with one exception: the mean fracture force of specimens reinforced with round wire (102. 9 N). Failure mode was always adhesive, meaning that fracture occurred between the denture base and repair resin. Conclusion.
