In a 1999 paper, Wakeley observed that the coalescent process associated with the finite island model can be decomposed into a scattering phase and a collecting phase. In this paper, we introduce a class of population structure models, which we refer to as G/KC models, that obey such a decomposition. In a large population, large sample limit we derive the distribution of the statistic Fst for all G/KC models under the assumptions of strong or weak mutation.

30|$|Mantel {{test for}} the {{correlation}} between Rousset’s genetic distance and the geographic distance matrices shows only {{the significance of the}} relationship; hence, slope and intercept of this relationship should be done using regression techniques (Bohonak 2002). Among the regression techniques, reduced major axis (RMA) is reportedly better for analysis of isolation by distance (Hellberg 1994). Hence, computation of intercept and slope of genetic distance of the sorghum landraces and the geographic distance of the collection sites using RMA regression resulted in a weak, but significant relationship with slope (0.003 [*]±[*]SE 0.0006). This shows that gene flow among populations follows a trend of isolation by distance (IBD) in a two <b>dimensional</b> stepping <b>stone</b> model, which indicates that the farthest the populations are located the weakest are their relationships. However, long distance seed movement as it has already happened from Wello area to Metekel by settlers could be the major force that {{played a major role in}} shaping the genetic structure of the landrace populations. Thus, we believe that the pattern of the population genetic structure of the studied landraces was strongly influenced by human migration with evidence from Figure  3. It is known that this pattern of genetic structure still observed today is the result of the history of domestication and human migrations (Sagnard et al. 2011).|$|R

Following China and Italy, Iran is in third place of world production, but only has a minor contribution in international trade. One main reason of this problem is negligence regarding the introduction of dependable mines to foreign customers. On the other hand, the frequency of fatal and non-fatal accidents in these mines implies the necessity of more attention to safety parameters. The first stage to attain this aim is identifying the major factors on safety of these mines and ranking the major mines considering these indices.
