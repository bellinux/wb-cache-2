5|$|Beryllium {{production}} saw a {{rapid increase}} during World War II, {{due to the}} rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights.</b> Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium {{was found to be}} toxic.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights,</b> or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E
40|$|Scientific Session VII: Thyroid - no. 29 Background: Because the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> {{intensity}} on an indocyanine green fluorescence angiography {{reflects the}} blood perfusion within a focused area, the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity {{in the remaining}} in situ parathyroid glands may predict postoperative hypocalcemia risk after total thyroidectomy. Methods: Seventy patients underwent intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence angiography after total thyroidectomy. Any parathyroid glands with a vascular pedicle was left in situ while any parathyroid glands without pedicle or inadvertently removed was autotransplanted. After total thyroidectomy, an intravenous 2. 5 mg indocyanine green fluorescence angiography was given and real-time fluorescent images of the thyroid bed were recorded using the SPY imaging system (Novadaq, Ontario, Canada). The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity of each indocyanine green fluorescence angiography {{as well as the}} average and greatest <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity in each patient were calculated. Postoperative hypocalcemia was defined as adjusted calcium 150 % developed postoperative hypocalcemia while 9 (81. 8 %) patients with a greatest <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity ≤ 150 % did. Similarly, no patients with an average <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity > 109 % developed PH while 9 (30 %) with an average <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity ≤ 109 % did. The greatest <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity was more predictive than day- 0 postoperative hypocalcemia (P =. 027) and % PTH drop day- 0 to 1 (P <. 001). Conclusion: Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is a promising operative adjunct in determining residual parathyroid glands function and predicting postoperative hypocalcemia risk after total thyroidectomy...|$|R
25|$|Swallowtail (Papilio) {{butterflies}} have {{complex systems}} for emitting <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> Their wings contain pigment-infused crystals that provide directed <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> These crystals function to produce <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> {{best when they}} absorb radiance from sky-blue light (wavelength about 420nm). The wavelengths of light that the butterflies see the best correspond to the absorbance of the crystals in the butterfly's wings. This likely functions to enhance the capacity for signaling.|$|R
50|$|Two general {{types of}} {{instruments}} exist: filter fluorometers that use filters to isolate the incident <b>light</b> and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> and spectrofluorometers that use a diffraction grating monochromators to isolate the incident <b>light</b> and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{distinctive}} new profile {{appeared in}} 1944, when new CME Frederick Hawksworth introduced corridor coaches with domed roof-ends, although non-corridor coaches and auto trailers retained {{a more conventional}} roof. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> were tried in new coaches built in 1946.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to general lighting, special <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> {{are often used}} in stage lighting for film and video production. They are cooler than traditional halogen light sources, and use high-frequency ballasts to prevent video flickering and high color-rendition index lamps to approximate daylight color temperatures.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Large White {{turkey breeder}} hens {{were exposed to}} either {{incandescent}} or full-spectrum (FS) <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> during two 20 -week reproductive cycles in closed confinement. Data were recorded for body weights, feed intake, and reproductive traits. Body weights and feed intake were similar between treatments in both egg laying cycles. In addition, {{there were no significant}} differences in egg production, fertility, hatchability, or poult weight between the incandescent and FS <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> treatment in either the first or second year egg laying cycle. It was concluded that exposure of breeder turkey hens to FS <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> in closed confine-ment results in reproductive performance similar to that obtained with incandescent lighting.

25|$|A. thaliana can {{complete}} its entire lifecycle in six weeks. The central stem that produces flowers grows after about three weeks, {{and the flowers}} naturally self-pollinate. In the lab, A. thaliana may be grown in Petri plates, pots, or hydroponics, under <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> or in a greenhouse.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps emit a {{small amount}} of {{ultraviolet}} (UV) light. A 1993 study in the US found that ultraviolet exposure from sitting under <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> for eight hours is equivalent to one minute of sun exposure. Ultraviolet radiation from compact fluorescent lamps may exacerbate symptoms in photosensitive individuals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, New York City Transit {{extended}} the platforms for 10 car trains, and fixed the station's structure and overall appearance by replacing the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting to 70's style wall tiles, signs and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights.</b> They also fixed staircases and platform edges.|$|E
30|$|Second, {{the output}} of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> tube is also not {{constant}} in color but has different colors within the period. Depending on the type of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light,</b> for example, when switching on, the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> is more red and yellow (Period A in Figure 13), while at the peak of its periodic interval it is white (Period B), and at the end (switching off) it turns blue (Period C). This property effectively creates various colors in image parts that are normally colorless.|$|R
5000|$|Photophobia is {{a symptom}} of {{excessive}} sensitivity to light which affects 5 to 20% of the population. No studies have been conducted into the effect of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> on sufferers of photophobia but there is the possibility for compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> to affect sufferers.|$|R
50|$|Outdoor public {{lighting}} {{was at the}} time of a very limited and pedestrian nature, perhaps consisting of simple incandescent pole lamps in a city and nothing in the country. Electrification was still very new and had not reached everywhere in the US. The fair was the first public demonstration of several lighting technologies that would become common in future decades. These technologies included the introduction of the first <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> and fixture. General Electric Corporation held the patent to the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> bulb at the time. Approximately a year later, the original three major corporations, Lightolier, Artcraft <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Lighting</b> Corporation, and Globe Lighting, located mostly in the New York City region, began wide-scale manufacturing in the US of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> fixture.|$|R
25|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> {{were first}} {{available}} to the public at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life, and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes (such as compact fluorescent lamps). Some high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps couple their even-greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps with {{magnetic}} ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable {{frequency of}} 100 or 120Hz and this flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity; they {{are listed as}} problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Newer <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> without magnetic ballasts have essentially eliminated flicker.|$|E
25|$|Although basil grows best outdoors, it can {{be grown}} indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill. It should be kept away from {{extremely}} cold drafts, and grows best in strong sunlight, therefore a greenhouse or row cover is ideal if available. It can, however, be grown even in a basement, under <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E

25|$|New Cars – Before the {{introduction}} of the single-coach tram in December 2012, this was the last new rolling stock, built by Jessop India Limited and a variation of the pivot type, introduced about 1984. Some trams were partly modified with front glass; one was modified with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights,</b> FM radio, digital advertising and route boards. These are the second-most-common trams in Kolkata.|$|E
25|$|The {{disposal}} of phosphor {{and particularly the}} toxic mercury in the tubes is an environmental issue. Governmental regulations in many areas require special {{disposal of}} fluorescent lamps separate from general and household wastes. For large commercial or industrial users of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights,</b> recycling services are available in many nations, and may be required by regulation. In some areas, recycling is also available to consumers.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{fluorescent}} tubes are the common light bars {{you find in}} commercial ceilings. Fluorescent lighting has more color temperatures available which are more suited to aquariums than those of incandescent bulbs. They are also more efficient than incandescent lighting, averaging between 90 and 95 lumens per watt. The downside to regular <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> {{is that they do}} not have the intensity to penetrate into deeper aquariums.|$|E

25|$|Many {{countries}} {{now have}} laws that require that {{household hazardous waste}} be deposited in a special location rather than sent to landfills with regular refuse. Household hazardous waste includes paints and solvents, chemicals, light bulbs, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights,</b> spray cans, and yard products such as fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and insecticides. Additionally, medical waste generated at home is considered a hazardous waste and must be disposed of properly.|$|E
25|$|House lights provide {{light on}} the theater's seats and aisles for the {{audience}} before and after performances and during intermissions. They are generally incandescent lights, however <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> or scoops {{may be used in}} some instances. House lights are often controlled by dimmers, but are sometimes on simple switches. Worklights provide general lighting backstage or in the house, and are often fluorescent fixtures. Work lights are almost always non-dimmed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{electricity}} {{is an expensive}} utility, the first step towards conservation is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights,</b> laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient. There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the Sun Frost company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market energy star-rated refrigerator.|$|E
30|$|First, {{measurements}} of intensity errors and color errors {{present in the}} short-exposure image are performed. These errors will show sinusoidal behavior {{in the presence of}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> However, motion in the scene and other light sources can significantly affect the intensity- and color-error measurements. For this reason, we have to perform filtering of these measurements and ensure more accurate and reliable results. After the filtering stage, we detect the frequency, amplitude, and temporal consistency of the error signals. The algorithm for the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> detection uses these measurements and makes a decision about the existence of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> in the scene. When <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> is detected, as a second step, we shift the corrupted short-exposure image out of the display range and apply color faders to remove any remaining color errors.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that light {{has no effect}} on the physiology of oocytes, zygotes, or early embryos. Therefore, little or no {{attention has been paid to}} lighting conditions during the handling of these cells in vitro. Here we show that cool white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light,</b> rich in short-wavelength visible light and commonly used in research and clinical laboratories, produces more reactive oxygen species in mouse and hamster zygotes than does warm white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> Mouse blastocysts that developed from zygotes shielded from light best developed to term fetuses followed by those exposed to warm white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> and then by those exposed to cool white <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> We hypothesized that light is one of the physical factors affecting embryonic environment and that its effects on cultured mammalian zygotes and embryos should not be overlooked...|$|R
