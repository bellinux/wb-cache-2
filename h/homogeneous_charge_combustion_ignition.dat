40|$|The {{origins of}} {{detailed}} and reduced kinetic {{models for the}} ignition and oxidation of alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons have been traced {{in this study and}} their development and application in the prediction of some aspects of hydrocarbon fuels have been explored. The scope and limitations for the application of certain formal model structures has been illustrated. The major objective in development and use of kinetic models has been concerned with autoignition and homogeneous combustion as a promising combustion mode for reducing emissions in reciprocating engines. Clearly, {{there is a need for}} models that can be used in conjunction with fluid dynamic codes and for this purpose brevity is pre-requisite. Comprehensive kinetic schemes can play a very important part in the validation process, but it would seem that more has yet to be achieved in validating comprehensive models as a satisfactory benchmark for hydrocarbon combustion in the low temperature region. A major objective of this work has been to develop kinetic mechanisms for model fuels in order to simulate the complex physico-chemical interactions in practical combustion systems. The mechanisms, after they have been assembled, have been validated against a wide range of combustion regimes. The latter include laminar premixed and diffusion flames as well plug flow reactors and shock tubes. In Chapter 3 a mechanism for n-heptane is presented and successfully validated against experimental data. The agreement between calculations and measurements is very well. Thereafter, a mechanism for n-decane, which has to be the aliphatic compound for surrogate fuels in representing real diesel and kerosene properties, has been extensively validated. In the mechanism only a small number of chemical species and reactions has been retained without losing in accuracy. This is of great advantage for using detailed chemistry in the flame let model for describing the chemistry-turbulence interactions when simulating autoignition, combustion or pollutant formation in internal combustion engines. The mechanism’s ability to reproduce the main experimental observations on intermediate species has been demonstrated by examining successively the main steps of the mechanism for the combustion of n-decane. The agreement between calculated and experimental mole fraction profiles is good for most species. Computed laminar burning velocities, ignition delay times and oxidation in jet-stirred reactors at moderate pressure show good agreement with experimental data. Toluene and 1, 2, 4 Trimethylbenzene have also successfully been modelled. Thereafter an extensively investigation of the autoignition in strained flow fields for all the above fuels has taken place. In Chapter 4 different methods for reducing chemical mechanisms are briefly described. An algorithm based on the CSP (Computational Singular Perturbation) method is used to derive a reduced mechanism for n-heptane. Finally in chapter 5 a new combustion mode, the so called <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Charge</b> <b>Combustion</b> <b>Ignition</b> (HCCI) has been presented. The feasibility of this concept has been analysed based on simulations performed, using simple models. The potential in reducing emissions especially Soot and NOx has been demonstrated...|$|E

To evaluate the potential of this alcohol, a comparison with pure n-heptane and ethanol/n-heptane mixtures was carried out.

40|$|We {{have used}} the HCT (Hydrodynamics, Chemistry and Transport) {{chemical}} kinetics code to simulate HCCI (<b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression <b>ignition)</b> <b>combustion</b> of methane-air mixtures. HCT is applied to explore the ignition timing, bum duration, NO x production, gross indicated efficiency and gross IMEP of a supercharged engine (3 atm. Intake pressure) with 14 : 1, 16 :l and 18 : 1 compression ratios at 1200 rpm. HCT has been modified to incorporate the effect of heat transfer and to calculate the temperature that results from mixing the recycled exhaust with the fresh mixture. This study uses a single control volume reaction zone that varies {{as a function of}} crank angle. The ignition process is controlled by adjusting the intake equivalence ratio and the residual gas trapping (RGT). RGT is internal exhaust gas recirculation which recycles both thermal energy and combustion product species. Adjustment of equivalence ratio and RGT is accomplished by varying the timing of the exhaust valve closure in either 2 -stroke or 4 -stroke engines. Inlet manifold temperature is held constant at 300 K. Results show that, for each compression ratio, there is a range of operational conditions that show promise of achieving the control necessary to vary power output while keeping indicated efficiency above 50 % and NO x levels below 100 ppm.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} outcome from a {{systematic}} investigation {{carried out on}} HCCI (<b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Charge</b> Compression <b>Ignition)</b> <b>combustion</b> of a diesel type fuel. The n heptane was chosen in this study to study the premixed diesel HCCI combustion characteristics with port fuel injection. Measurements were carried out in a single-cylinder, 4 -stroke and variable compression ratio engine. Premixed n-heptane/air/EGR mixture was introduced into the cylinder by a port fuel injector and an external EGR system. The operating regions with regard to Air/Fuel ratio and EGR rate were established for different compression ratios and intake temperatures. The effects of compression ratios, intake temperatures, Air/Fuel ratios and EGR rates on knock limit, auto-ignition timing, combustion rate, IMEP, and engine-out emissions, such as NOx, CO, and unburned HC, were analysed. The results have shown HCCI combustion of n-heptane could be implemented without intake charge heating with a typical diesel engine compression ratio. The attainable HCCI operating region was mainly limited by the knock limit, misfir, and low IMEP respectively. Higher intake temperature or compression ratio could extend the misfire limit of the HCCI operation at low load but they would reduce the maximum IMEP limit at higher load conditions. Compared with conventional diesel combustion, HCCI combustion lead to extremely low NOx emissions (less than 5 ppm) and smoke free exhaust. But HCCI diesel combustion was found to produce higher HC and CO emissions. An increase in intake temperature or compression ratio helped to reduce HC and CO emissions. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Owing {{to their}} low carbon dioxide {{emissions}} and fuel consumptions, diesel engines have gained a significant market share of passenger cars in Europe. However, gasoline engines are exclusively used to power passenger cars in the People’s Republic of China and many other countries. The introduction of diesel engines to the passenger car market in many countries is unlikely {{to take place in}} the near future because of the limited diesel fuel supply, higher cost of diesel cars, and public perception of diesel vehicles. Therefore, development of high-efficiency gasoline engines is of particular importance. As part of a State Key Project of the National Basic Research Program (the 973 Program), the present authors have carried out systematic research and development of a high-efficiency gasoline engine. The engine was equipped in production with devices for mechanically variable valve lift and timing and was operated with controlled autoignition (CAI) (<b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression <b>ignition)</b> <b>combustion</b> under part-load conditions and spark-assisted combustion between the transitional region of CAI and the normal spark <b>ignition</b> (SI) <b>combustion.</b> This paper will describe the use of devices for variable valve lift and timing in a single-cylinder engine and their control. The engine performance and emission results in the CAI operational region are presented. The ability of the engine to achieve rapid and smooth transition between CAI and SI will be illustrated. A brief discussion of the implication of the results on the calculated driving-cycle fuel consumption will be given at the end. Finally, the plan for future development of a multi-cylinder engine of variable valve actuation will be given...|$|R
40|$|The {{free piston}} {{internal}} combustion engine {{used in conjunction with}} a linear alternator offers an interesting choice for use in hybrid vehicles. The linear motion of the pistons is directly converted to electricity by the alternator, and the result is a compact and efficient energy converter that has only one moving part. The movement of the pistons is not prescribed by a crank mechanism, but {{is the result of the}} equilibrium of forces acting on the pistons, and the engine will act like a mass-spring system. This feature is one of the most prominent advantages of the FPE (Free Piston Engine), as the lack of mechanical linkage gives means of varying the compression ratio in simple manners, without changing the hardware of the engine. By varying the compression ratio, it is also it possible to run on a multitude of different fuels and to use HCCI (<b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Charge</b> Compression <b>Ignition)</b> <b>combustion.</b> Furthermore, the reduction of the number of moving parts will decrease engine friction and thus increase efficiency. In this paper, BOOST and SENKIN have been used to investigate engine performance for different fuels. A dynamic model of the complete free piston engine was created that predicts the piston motion and frequency. The gas exchange was simulated with the commercial 1 - D code BOOST, which solves the gas dynamic equations. The high-pressure cycle of the commercial 1 - D code BOOST was replaced by detailed chemistry calculations in the SENKIN code. For combustion reduced mechanisms of Diesel (n-heptane and toluene), gasoline (iso-octane, toluene and n-heptane), natural gas (methane, ethane, propane and n-butane) and hydrogen have been used. All mechanisms consisted of about 60 - 100 species. The results show that a decreased cetane number requires higher compression ratios in order to position the ignition properly. The higher compression ratios give an increase in engine speed, power and efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} influence of the molecular structure of potential biofuels on combustion in a compression ignition engine. The molecular structure of a fuel is amongst the most fundamental parameter controlling its physical and chemical characteristics, and is thus critical to the combustion process within an engine. The approach employed in this work was to study the combustion of several individual molecules in a series of experiments whilst varying a single feature of the molecular structure at a time. This yielded information about how a particular structural feature of a molecule affects the combustion process. During the course of this project, a special fuel injection system was developed, which allowed the injection of small fuel samples into the engine at high pressure. This allowed tests to be carried out on purposely synthesised fuel samples that were only obtainable in small quantities. Detailed studies on the combustion of fatty alkyl esters (commonly termed biodiesel), acetals, ethers and alcohols were conducted. The combustion chamber pressure of the engine, the energy release of combustion, the engine efficiency, the exhaust gas composition and the emission of particulate matter were measured and analysed. It was observed that in the diffusion combustion of biofuels, the emission of nitrogen oxides from the engine depend primarily on the ignition delay of the fuel, which governs the combustion stoichiometry and peak cylinder pressures and temperatures within the combustion chamber, and secondly on the adiabatic flame temperature of the biofuels. It was found that the number of double bonds present in biofuel molecules correlated with the amount of particulate mass emitted from the engine. It was further observed that oxygenated biofuels such as fatty acid alkyl esters, acetals, ethers and alcohols produced much lower levels of particulate mass from their combustion than petroleum-derived diesel fuel. The emission of particulates depended on the fuel oxygen content, {{as well as on the}} boiling point of the fuel. Combustion experiments conducted in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression <b>ignition</b> <b>combustion</b> demonstrated that ethers of low molecular mass could be amongst the most-suited liquid fuel molecules for this type of combustion method. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{new book}} {{presents}} recent developments, state-of-the-art and progresses {{in the field}} of energy where efforts are done in order to improve the usability of energy systems, reducing their environmental impact. The book aims at providing researchers, academics, engineers and advanced students information and points of discussion, a platform for future improvements in green energy. Both theoretical and applied aspects are treated in this book. Many illustrations and mathematical equations as well as practical on-the-field applications are incorporated. This book aims at contributing to the increasing interest in reducing the environmental impact of energy as well as its further development. Three parts are considered. The first part treats different energy applications and the efforts that are done in order to improve their impact on the environment. It deals with bio-energy, well-to-wheel analyses and heavy oils. Concerning bioenergy, the costs are evaluated under strict regulations imposed by a climate stabilization target, where a certain case is taken as example. The well-to-wheel energy analyses take into consideration a comprehensive study on greenhouse gases and certain criteria that concern the emissions in the case of hydrogen based fuel-cells. The second part deals with different kinds of renewable energy sources. The chapters discuss bioenergy, wind energy and solar energy. The use of biofuels is critically discussed. A real application and evaluation of wind energy is presented, by means of designing and optimalizing a wind power system. A detailed discussion about the generation of electricity by means of different kinds of solar energy is performed. The third part puts emphasis on alternative energy processes for transport utilities. In this part, is discussed, amongst others, the <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Charge</b> Compression <b>Ignition</b> <b>combustion</b> mode. Advantages and inconveniences are proposed. Wide and comprehensive studies on this combustion mode are presented. Both a large synthesis of available work and experimental results are used in an effort to discuss these advantages and inconveniences in order to propose possible solutions. Some examples are treated elaborately. Hydrogen-based combustion is discussed and its efficiency evaluated in detail. Elaborate studies and examples give a rather complete vision of the probable use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines and the different aspects that are to be examined are treated in detail. The commercialization of fuel-cells are investigated, giving trends and possible developments that can be envisaged. Finally, a philosophy of controlling the auto-ignition in an HCCI engine is presented. This philosophy is somewhat general and the outlines can also be used for the abovementioned transportation modes. A rather general overview is given in this book, starting from different visions on reducing the impact of energy on the environment (green energy) and continuing on how this can be achieved (green technology). The different results and the available literature that is treated in various chapters in this book show that many researchers are investigating the efficient use of energy whilst looking for ways to decrease its impact on the environment. This shows the importance of such research and the work that remains to be done...|$|R
40|$|HCCI (<b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Charge</b> Compression <b>Ignition)</b> <b>combustion</b> {{takes place}} in {{homogeneous}} mixtures once that spontaneous combustion temperature and latency time are exceeded. However, differently from simultaneous combustion, the reactions take place gradually, since lean mixture is used and thanks to suitable solutions, commonly consisting in high levels of charge dilution by exhaust gas. The most important advantage of HCCI combustion in respect to the diffusive one {{is the possibility of}} minimizing soot and NOx emissions. This occurs because HCCI combustion avoids the presence, in combustion chamber, both of excessively fuel-rich zones and of local temperature peaks, responsible of soot and NOx formation respectively. However, this combustion strategy still does not cover the whole engine operating field, thus the engine must be built to operate basically as a conventional engine in transient operations and with high engine loads. The <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> formation represents a critical factor for the obtaining of HCCI combustion. Another limitation is that, being triggered by homogenous charge spontaneous ignition during compression, HCCI combustion timing control and optimization are not easy. The research activity can be divided in three sections, in which possible solutions to HCCI combustion limitations have been analyzed. In the first section a numerical and experimental analysis of gasoline HCCI and PCCI (partially Premixed <b>Charge</b> Compression <b>Ignition)</b> <b>combustion</b> has been made, to understand the influence of some operating parameter on combustion behavior and emission production. After a first spray model validation, CFD simulations of HCCI and PCCI combustion have been performed with various engine speed, injection timings and equivalence ratios. Two combustion models (Shell-CTC and CHEMKIN) have been adopted to evaluate the importance of detailed chemical kinetics on low temperature combustions. From the results it emerges that increasing the in-cylinder in-homogeneity at <b>ignition</b> time the <b>combustion</b> efficiency improves. However, due to the higher temperatures, NOx emissions increase as well. In the second section of this activity a numerical analysis of dual fuel combustion through advanced combustion models has been performed, to avoid ignition phasing control uncertainties of gasoline HCCI. A small amount of diesel fuel is injected as a pilot injection to ignite a pre-mixture of gasoline (or other high-octane fuel) and air. Several injection timings and mixture compositions have been evaluated in two engine operating points using two different injectors and four different combustion strategies. Initially a validation for a newly proposed combustion strategy was necessary. From the results it emerges that even a very small injection of diesel fuel plays a successful role as an ignition source for the pre-mixed gasoline, and the combustion initially takes place by a flame propagation mechanism. Then, due to the high in-cylinder pressure and temperature conditions, auto-ignition spreads in the whole combustion chamber. In the last part of this research activity a preliminary study of an innovative concept to control HCCI combustion in diesel-fuelled engines is proposed. The main purpose of the research is the obtaining of diesel HCCI combustion also with high mean effective pressures rendering the combustion behavior more controllable as well. The concept consists in forming a pre-compressed homogenous charge outside the cylinder and in gradually admitting it into the cylinder during the combustion process. In this way, combustion can be controlled by the flow rate transfer and high pressure gradients, typical of common HCCI combustion, can be limited as well. A first analysis has been done, only to test the validity of the concept then constructive two and four stroke solutions have been proposed. Results have been compared with a conventional diesel application in terms of pressure, temperature, heat release rate and emissions. Finally an injection process optimization has been performed. From the results it emerges the validity of the concept even though successive mixture formation process optimizations are recommended...|$|R
40|$|A Direct Injection (DI) {{technique}} has promoted the overall performances of a gasoline engine, since the technique offers opportunities {{to run the}} engine in the stratified <b>charge</b> <b>combustion</b> mode and the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> <b>combustion</b> mode.

The experiments are divided into two parts, in which the measurement of the spray characteristics under the atmospheric and high pressure ambient conditions are taken coinciding to the two modes.

40|$|Combustion of {{hydrocarbons}} {{in internal}} combustion engines results in emissions {{that can be}} harmful both to human health and to the environment. Although the engine technology is improving, the emissions of NO x, PM and UHC are still challenging. Besides, the overall consumption of fossil fuel and hence the emissions of CO 2 are increasing because of {{the increasing number of}} vehicles. This has lead to a focus on finding alternative fuels and alternative technologies that may result in lower emissions of harmful gases and lower CO 2 emissions. This thesis treats various topics that are relevant when using blends of fuels in different internal combustion engine technologies, with a particular focus on using hydrogen as a fuel additive. The topics addressed are especially the ones that impact the environment, such as emissions of harmful gases and thermal efficiency (fuel consumption). The thesis is based on experimental work performed at four different test rigs: 1. A dynamic combustion rig with optical access to the combustion chamber where spark ignited premixed combustion could be studied by means of a Schlieren optical setup and a high speed video camera. 2. A spark ignition natural gas engine rig with an optional exhaust gas recycling system. 3. A 1 -cylinder diesel engine prepared for <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression <b>ignition</b> <b>combustion.</b> 4. A 6 -cylinder standard diesel engine The engine rigs were equipped with cylinder pressure sensors, engine dynamometers, exhaust gas analyzers etc. to enable analyses of the effects of different fuels. The effect of hydrogen blended with methane and natural gas in spark ignited premixed combustion was investigated in the dynamic combustion rig and in a natural gas engine. In the dynamic combustion rig, the effect of hydrogen added to methane on the flame speed and the flame structure was investigated at elevated pressure and temperature. A considerable increase in the flame speed was observed when adding 30 vol% hydrogen to the methane, but 5 vol% hydrogen also resulted in a noticeable increase. The flame structure was also influenced by the hydrogen addition as the flame front had a higher tendency to become wrinkled or cellular. The effect is believed to mainly be caused by a reduction in the effective Lewis number of the mixture. In the gas engine experiments, the effect of adding 25 vol% hydrogen to natural gas was investigated when the engine was run on lean air/fuel mixtures and on stoichiometric mixtures with exhaust gas recirculation. The hydrogen addition was found to extend the lean limit of stable combustion and hence caused lower NOx emissions. The brake thermal efficiency increased with the hydrogen addition, both for the fuel lean and the stoichiometric mixtures with exhaust gas recirculation. This is mainly because of shorter combustion durations when the hydrogen mixture was used, leading to thermodynamically improved cycles. Two types of experiments were performed in compression ignition engines. First, homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) experiments were performed in a single cylinder engine fueled with natural gas and diesel oil. As HCCI engines have high thermal efficiency and low NO x and PM emissions it may be more favorable to use natural gas in HCCI engines than in spark ignition engines. The mixture of natural gas, diesel oil and air was partly premixed before combustion. The natural gas/diesel ratio was used to control the ignition timing as the fuels have very different ignition properties. The natural gas was also replaced by a 20 vol% hydrogen/natural gas mixture to study the effect of hydrogen on the <b>ignition</b> and <b>combustion</b> process. Also, rape seed methyl ester (RME) was tested instead of the diesel oil. The combustion phasing was found to mainly be controlled by the amount of liquid fuel injected. The presence or absence of hydrogen resulted in only marginal changes on the combustion. Because the diesel oil and RME have much lower autoignition temperatures than both hydrogen and natural gas, the properties of the liquid fuel may overshadow the effect of the hydrogen addition. A large difference however, was found between the RME and the diesel oil with the necessity to inject much more RME than diesel oil to obtain the same combustion phasing. The last experiments with compression ignition were performed by using a standard Scania diesel engine where the possibilities to reduce particulate matter (PM) and other emissions by introduction of combustible gas to the inlet air (named fumigation) were investigated. Hydrogen, methane and propane were introduced at different rates replacing up to 40 % of the total fuel energy. Also, a biodiesel consisting of mainly RME was tested instead of the diesel oil. Because of the low density of hydrogen gas, less of the fuel energy could be replaced by hydrogen than by the two other gases. Higher rates of hydrogen would sacrifice the safety by exceeding the lower flammability limit in the inlet air. Only moderate reductions in PM were achieved at high gas rates, and because of the limitation in the practical achievable hydrogen rate {{it was not possible to}} obtain considerable reductions in PM emission by hydrogen addition. The NOx emissions were found to be little influenced by the fumigation, but the THC emissions strongly increased with increased methane and propane rates, especially at a low engine load. Propane fumigation resulted in considerably less THC emissions than methane fumigation. The biodiesel resulted in higher PM emissions than the diesel fuel at low load, but was considerably lower at the higher loads. This is believed to be because of the low volatility of the biodiesel which may lead to emissions of un-burned fuel at low load when the temperature is low. At higher loads this is believed to be less of a problem because the temperature is higher, and the oxygen content of biodiesel is believed to increase the PM oxidation and/or reduce the formation of PM.

The engine speed was varied at 1500 rpm, 1800 rpm and 2100 rpm, and the ignition timing was set at a 38. 5 ° crank angle (CA) after top dead center (TDC) for all conditions. The engine was operated in a partial-load mode and a <b>homogeneous</b> air/fuel <b>charge</b> was achieved by injecting the fuel early (before the intake valve closure), while late injection during the compression stroke was used to produce a stratified charge.

40|$|Lean ethanol-water/air {{mixtures}} {{have potential}} for reducing NOx and CO emissions in internal combustion engines. Igniting such mixtures {{is not possible}} with conventional ignition sources. An improved catalytic ignition source is being developed {{to aid in the}} combustion of aqueous ethanol. The operating principle is <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression ignition in a catalytic pre-chamber, followed by torch ignition of the main chamber.

A multi-zone energy balance model has been developed to understand ignition timing of ethanol-water mixtures. Model predictions agree with pressure versus crank angle data obtained from a 15 kW Yanmar diesel engine converted for catalytic operation on ethanol-water fuel. Comparing the converted Yanmar to the stock engine shows an increase in torque and power, with improvements in CO and NOx emissions.

In-cylinder pressure, heat release analysis and exhaust emission measurements were employed for combustion diagnostics. In this study, effect of intake air temperature on combustion parameters, thermal efficiency, combustion efficiency and emissions in HCCI combustion engine is analyzed and discussed in detail. The experimental results indicate that the air-fuel ratio and intake air temperature have significant effect on the maximum in-cylinder pressure and its position, gas exchange efficiency, thermal efficiency, combustion efficiency, maximum rate of pressure rise and the heat release rate. Results show that for all stable operation points, NOx emissions are lower than 10 Â ppm however HC and CO emissions are higher. <b>Combustion</b> Emission <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression <b>ignition</b> (HCCI) Controlled auto-ignition Ethanol Port fuel injection (PFI) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{oncoming}} stringent emission regulations require {{development or}} improvement of land vehicle engine combustion systems. In this research activity {{two of the}} most promising combustion systems were studied. The first one is Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) in spark ignition engines; the second is <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Charge</b> Compression <b>Ignition</b> (HCCI) <b>combustion</b> in Diesel engines. The first part of the research activity involved both 2 and 4 stroke GDI engines. In the 2 stroke activity, a numerical and experimental research was conducted on the influence of throttling in stratified charge operation, in a single-cylinder 50 cm 3 engine. The research proved that some throttling lessens HC and NOx emissions. Besides, throttling decreases pumping loss and increases exhaust gas temperature at light loads, with evident advantage for catalytic converter efficiency. The 4 stroke activity concerned the applicability of Gasoline Direct Injection in a high performance engine. By means of a 3 -dimensional CFD code, indirect and direct injections were compared and the benefits coming from the GDI system were quantitatively predicted. The second part of the research activity pertained homogenous combustion in Diesel engines. A new combustion concept called HCPC (<b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Charge</b> Progressive <b>Combustion)</b> was studied by means of a CFD code with detailed chemistry. This study demonstrated the validity of the idea and identified the key parameters which control and influence HCPC combustion. With the aim of improving the calculation methodology in Diesel and HCCI engine, a study on the effects of initialization and geometrical details on the results of CFD engine simulations was conducted. The study pointed out that the swirl number decreases when the piston and head geometrical details are included in the CFD model, affecting combustion and pollutant emission numerical predictions...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{concerns}} regarding pollutant and CO 2 emissions, advanced combustion modes that can simultaneously reduce exhaust emissions and improve thermal efficiency {{have been widely}} investigated. The main characteristic of the new combustion strategies, such as HCCI and LTC, is that {{the formation of a}} homogenous mixture or a controllable stratified mixture is required prior to ignition. The major issue with these approaches is the lack of a direct method for the control of <b>ignition</b> timing and <b>combustion</b> rate, which can be only indirectly controlled using high EGR rates and/or lean mixtures. <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>Charge</b> Progressive <b>Combustion</b> (HCPC) is based on the split-cycle principle. Intake and compression phases are performed in a reciprocating external compressor, which drives the air into the combustor cylinder during the combustion process, through a transfer duct. A transfer valve is positioned between the compressor cylinder and the transfer duct. The compressor runs with a fixed phase delay with respect to the combustor. As a consequence, during the combustion process, air moves from the compressor cylinder to the combustor cylinder. Contemporary with the air transfer, fuel is injected into the transfer duct, evaporates and mixes with the air, bringing about the conditions needed for homogeneous combustion. This paper relates to CFD study of a Heavy Duty HCPC engine that provides ultra-clean combustion and diesel-like indicated thermal efficiency. As a matter of fact the HCPC Heavy Duty engine can comply with EURO 6 regulations without complicated and expensive aftertreatment systems...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] with <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression <b>ignition,</b> HCCI, <b>combustion</b> offers a number of benefits over conventional SI and CI, such as much lower NOx emission, negligible cycle-to-cycle variation, higher combustion efficiency at part load than its SI counterpart, and low soot emissions. Unlike conventional SI and CI engines, where the combustion is directly controlled by the engine management system, the combustion in HCCI engines is controlled by its chemical kinetics only. Trapping hot internal EGR appears to be a potential technology for a practical application of this potential technology. In this paper, by using the advanced combustion simulation package SENKIN, both thermal and chemical effects of the hot EGR on HCCI combustion were calculated and analysed.

40|$|A {{widely held}} {{belief in the}} {{combustion}} community is that the chemical and hydrodynamic structure of a stretched laminar premixed flame can be preserved in a turbulent flow field over a range of conditions collectively known as the flamelet regime, and the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> spark-ignition engine <b>combustion</b> falls within the domain of this regime. The major assumption in the laminar flamelet concept as applied to the turbulent premixed flames is that the flame front behaves as a constant-property passive scalar surface, {{and an increase in}} the wrinkled flame surface area with increasing turbulence intensity is the dominant mechanism for the observed flame velocity enhancement. The two approaches that have been recently used for estimating a measure of the wrinkled flame surface area in spark-ignition engines and other premixed flames are the flame surface density concept and fractal geometry. A critical assessment of the experimental fractal parameters reported in literature indicated that these are not capable of correctly predicting the turbulent burning velocity using the available fractal area closure model. A similar conclusion has been reached after examining the surface density data from flames of different geometries including spark-ignition engine flame fronts. The assumption made in fractal and surface density approaches that the turbulent flame front is a passive scalar surface can not be justified, and the applicability of the flamelet approach may be limited to a much smaller range of conditions than presently believed.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the mixture preparation and combustion characteristics of a direct injection gasoline (G-DI) engine operating in both spark ignition (SI) and controlled-auto ignition with spark assistance (SA-CAl) is presented. The air motion, fuel distribution and combustion performance in the engine are described by the application of advanced Laser-based experimental methods and high-speed data acquisition. Determining the correct operation of the engine for spark ignition and compression ignition formed {{an important part of}} the research study. The series of experimental studies were conducted on a Ricardo Hydra singlecylinder research engine modified for optical access through the top 20 mm section of the cylinder bore, as well as via a 45 Ã‚Â° mirror and flat window inserted in the crown of the Bowditch piston arrangement. The cylinder head used was based on the Ricardo Flagship concept engine with reverse tumble geometry. Two different interchangeable camshaft sets permitted both high and low valve lift configurations to be utilised. Spark ignition (SI) and controlled-auto ignition with spark assistance (SA-CAl) were achieved in the test programme. Laser-induced fluorescence (L 1 F), combined with simultaneous flame imaging and Particle Image Velocity (PIV) enabled qualitative in-cylinder fuel concentration measurement during fired operation and quantitative motored air motion characteristics to be determined. Simultaneous acquisition of pressure-based data during the fired studies provided a record of the in-cylinder, intake and exhaust manifold pressures. The addition of K-type thermocouples provided additional temperature information in the engine. The results attained using the above techniques showed that rates of heat release in the SA-CAl combustion mode were considerably slower than those observed in a parallel SI combustion study. This suggested that a key indicator of controlled-auto ignition (CAl) was not present in this study; it is widely considered that CAl heat release rates are of the order of those encountered in SI, when considering 4 stroke operation. This result implied that flame-front propagation was the governing mechanism of fuel oxidisation in the SA-CAl mode. However, the results of the PIV studies in the SA-CAl mode suggested that the turbulence intensity was too low to support flame-front propagation in spark-initiated combustion. High-speed photography (HSP) applied in addition to the previously mentioned techniques showed that a hybrid mode of combustion exists in the SA-CAl reaction where flame front propagation could be seen to develop alongside individual sites of autoignition within the cylinder, albeit at a considerably lower rate. Images of fuel distribution in the combustion chamber acquired from the previous studies were correlated to pressure-based combustion stability data. A statistical analysis was conducted of both the SI and SA-CAl sets of data in order to determine cyclic variability within the in-cylinder fuel concentration. The results indicated higher than expected cycle-to-cycle and in-cycle variations in fuel distribution for an early injection, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge,</b> <b>combustion</b> mode when compared to those based upon the coefficient of variation in the measured indicated mean effective pressure. The L 1 F data. from the SA-CAl studies was found to be of far lower intensity, suggesting that the presence of high levels of exhaust residuals acted to attenuate the fluorescence signal. These findings were of particular importance to the application of the L 1 F technique in this manner. From the findings of the experimental techniques applied it was possible to determine from the mode of combustion encountered, SA-CAl, that a hybrid mode of fuel oxidation was occurring. It was clear that flame-front propagation was taking place, albeit at a far slower rate than in the corresponding Sl mode, as both high EGR rates and lower turbulence intensity was found to attenuate flame propagation, with further heat release occurring through diffusion burning and numerous autoignition points throughout the cylinder through the thermal energy supplied from the resident internal EGR.

40|$|We study {{selected}} {{examples of}} previously published cyclic heat-release measurements from a single-cylinder gasoline engine as stepwise valve timing adjustments {{were made to}} shift from spark ignited (SI) <b>combustion</b> to <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression <b>ignition</b> (HCCI). Wavelet analysis of the time series, combined with conventional statistics and multifractal analysis, revealed previously undocumented features in the combustion variability as the shift occurred. In the spark-ignition combustion mode, the heat-release variations were very small in amplitude and exhibited more persistent low-frequency oscillations with intermittent high-frequency bursts. In the HCCI combustion mode, the amplitude of the heat-release variations again was small and involved mainly low-frequency oscillations. At intermediate states between SI and HCCI, {{a wide range of}} very large-amplitude oscillations occurred, including both persistent low-frequency periodicities and intermittent high-frequency bursts. It appears from these results that real-time wavelet decomposition of engine cylinder pressure measurements may be useful for on-board tracking of SI-HCCI combustion regime shifts.

40|$|Two-dimensional direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNSs) of ignition of lean primary {{reference fuel}} (PRF) /air mixtures at high pressure and intermediate temperature near the {{negative temperature coefficient}} (NTC) regime were performed with a 116 species-reduced mechanism to elucidate the effects of fuel composition, thermal stratification, and turbulence on PRF <b>homogeneous</b> <b>charge</b> compression-ignition (HCCI) <b>combustion.</b> In the DNSs, temperature and velocity fluctuations are superimposed on the initial scalar fields with different PRF compositions. In general, {{it was found that}} the mean heat release rate increases slowly and the overall combustion occurs rapidly with increasing thermal stratification regardless of the fuel composition. In addition, the effect of the fuel composition on the ignition characteristics of PRF/air mixtures was found to be significantly reduced with increasing thermal stratification. Chemical explosive mode (CEM) and displacement speed analyses verified that nascent ignition kernels induced by hot spots due to a high degree of thermal stratification usually develop into deflagration waves rather than spontaneous auto-ignition at reaction fronts and as such, the mean heat release rate becomes more distributed over time. These analyses also revealed that the fuel composition effect vanishes as the degree of thermal stratification is increased because the deflagration mode of combustion, of which propagation characteristics are nearly identical for different PRF/air mixtures, becomes more prevailing with increasing degree of thermal stratification. Ignition Damköhler number was proposed to quantify the successful development of deflagration waves from nascent ignition kernels; for cases with large ignition Damköhler number, turbulence with high intensity and short timescale can advance the overall combustion by increasing the overall turbulent flame area instead of homogenizing initial mixture inhomogeneities. close...|$|R
