40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the rapid {{development}} of fish <b>farming</b> <b>cage</b> system activities at Lake Rawapening {{has led to}} the emergence of organic enrichment that may impact on changes in environmental quality. This study aims to determine the environmental quality and level of disturbance in the area of fish farming cages using macrobenthic community structure. Sampling was done in July, October, and December 2009 in three locations: Location I is at area of cages that are no longer in operation (fallowed site), Location II is at a new cage area actively operating and Location III as a reference/control is an area that is not used as a place of fish farming. Random sampling technique was employed in this study. Data were analyzed using ANOVA analysis, the index of species diversity (H'), the similarity type (J'), and multivariate analysis. The results show the variation of physical-chemical conditions over time, but not significantly different between sites. The composition of sediment in both the farming area as well as the reference/control site was dominated by coarse sand (42 - 47...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} nutrient concentrations in the vicinity of fish <b>farm</b> <b>cages</b> to maximise potential utilization by cultured macroalgae. At 4 m depth, nitrate and phosphate concentrations did not vary significantly with distance from fish <b>farm</b> <b>cages.</b> Elevated levels of ammonium were detected for extended periods of time during the day for distances that exceed 200 m. Principal enhancements were within 50 m in the direction of currents, and no increases were detected in the direction from which the current impacted the cages. Ammonium concentrations measured at 4 m depth within 50 m of the cages reached a maximum of 8 μM but most ranged from 2 to 4 μM and 2 – 3 μM above background. While current measurements gave an indication of ammonium distributions, the geography of the site and the physical presence of the fish <b>farm</b> <b>cages</b> were influencing factors. The highest concentrations of ammonium found at these fish farm sites were on the lee sides of cages in shallow water. Concentrations of ammonium throughout a relatively small-enclosed bay with fish farms were higher than in a similar bay without fish farms consistent with broader scale effects of nutrient enhancement. Multiple drogues used to follow currents were found to be a valuable tool for prediction of enhanced ammonium concentrations. The data suggest that there are elevated levels of ammonium at appropriate depths for potential utilization by marine macroalgae (i. e. in the photic zone) for an extended period of time at distances from the fish <b>farm</b> <b>cages</b> greater than 50 m. Careful assessment of current patterns around <b>farm</b> <b>cages</b> should be made if the objective is to maximise exposure of cultured algae to farm-derived nutrients...|$|R

50|$|Ashanti {{region has}} a {{significant}} aquaculture industry and fishing industry. Products for local consumption and export include Western Cuttlefish, tilapia, rock lobsters, prawns, crabs, smoked catfish (smoked fish) and tuna. Processing is conducted along the Crater Lake of Lake Bosumtwi and Ashanti region's eastern Lake Volta coast. The main fish species cultivated in Ashanti region are Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Tilapia species represent over 90 percent of farmed fish production. Pond aquaculture is the main production system in terms of number of farms, and is mainly small scale and semi-intensive. However, {{in the last five}} to seven years the dominant culture system for tilapia production has changed, {{and the vast majority of}} tilapia is now <b>farmed</b> intensively in <b>cages</b> in Lake Volta. Aquaculture production increased from 950 metric tons in 2004 to over 27,000 metric tons in 2012. This growth is due mainly to increased production from a small number of large-scale <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> (battery <b>cages).</b> Overall, <b>cage</b> <b>farms</b> currently account for less than 2 percent of farms by number but much more by production. In 2012, for example, aquaculture production from cages was over 24,000 metric tons compared to less than 2,000 metric tons from ponds and tanks. The growth in aquaculture production is also attributed to increased availability of quality fingerlings and feed for fish production. The number of private hatcheries, which currently produce the majority of fingerlings in Ashanti region, has increased in recent years as a result of the rapid growth of <b>cage</b> <b>farming</b> (battery <b>cage).</b> The establishment of a feed mills in Ashanti region in 2011, has greatly improved the reliability and availability of feed supply to fish farmers in Ashanti region.|$|R
