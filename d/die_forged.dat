40|$|Open <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> 7050 {{aluminum}} alloy has residual stresses {{that can be}} measured by the hole-drilling method following standard ASTM E 837 - 01. Weber Metals (Paramount, CA) assumes that the stress is uniform throughout the thickness of an open <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> plate. Four different stress relieved 7050 aluminum samples were tested to confirm if the measurements by the hole-drilling method at {{the surface of a}} plate is indicative of the stress throughout. The different stress relief methods included: two water quenched samples at temperature ranges of 60 °- 90 °F and 120 °- 130 °F and two samples plastically deformed by forging at room temperature 1 % and 3 %. For accurate measurements, a strain gauge rosette, CEA- 06 - 062 UL- 120, was applied to the samples and drilled with a RS- 200 Milling Guide by Micro-Measurements. The final three microstrain values at the depth of 0. 100 inches were tabulated by the P 3 Strain Indicator and Recorder. The strains were then converted into stresses following equations provided by the standard. Before drilling into samples, the method was calibrated with a plate that had a known low level of residual stress between 0 - 2 ksi. Testing confirmed the residual stress to be 0. 65 ksi. Each sample was tested and results confirmed the residual stress to be non-uniform through the cross-section of the forged plates. The two water quenched samples had residual stress in tension at the surface; the two plastically deformed samples had residual stress in compression at the surface. There were no trends for either type of sample for residual stress variation from the surface to the center. Overall, the 3 % plastically deformed sample would be the recommended residual stress reducing method before machining...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of grain orientation on the high cycle fatigue properties of 7050 -T 7452 aerospace grade aluminum, rotating-bending fatigue tests were performed on longitudinal (LG) and short transverse (ST) specimens taken from two sample sets (Method A and Method B) of open <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> 7050 aluminum. The fatigue specimens were machined to a 0. 22 ̆ 2 gage diameter and 42 ̆ 2 length and subsequently hand polished to a mirror finish to minimize potential crack initiation sites. The tests were conducted on a Fatigue Dynamics RBF- 300 HT tester in the fully reversed loading condition, with stress levels varying from 20 ksi - 45 ksi in 5 ksi increments, except the 25 ksi stress level. The applied stress amplitude and number of cycles to failure for each specimen were plotted to generate S-N curves comparing both Method A and B. The fatigue life was comparable between Method A and Method B sample sets and the fatigue life of longitudinal samples was greater than the fatigue life of short transverse samples. Runout tests were stopped at 107 cycles and set as 20 ksi for both orientations. There was no significant statistical difference between Method A and Method B on fatigue life of 7050 -T 7452 aluminum. There was a significant statistical difference between LG and ST specimen orientations on fatigue life due to the precipitate alignment and grain flow from forging...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} the thesis concerns phase transformations and fatigue properties in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The need to weld the alloy for certain engine components can expose the alloy locally to non-optimum thermal cycles and it is therefore of importance to {{gain an understanding of}} the kinetics involved in the phase transformations during heating and cooling. Moreover, for the purpose of modelling and computer simulations of heat treatments and welding processes, quantitative descriptions of the transformation are necessary. One focus in this work has been to examine the feasibility of using high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) to study the phase transformation kinetics. In addition, two components of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V produced by ring-rolling and closed die forging, respectively, showed unexpected differences in low cycle fatigue (LCF) under certain loading conditions. Quantitative metallographic studies and texture examinations were conducted in order to find possibly reasons for the observed difference in fatigue properties. The HT-XRD technique was successfully used to monitor the alpha-to-beta transition during heating and the beta-to-alpha transition during cooling and including the transformation kinetics during isothermal hold. From the recorded spectra the thermal expansion properties for the alpha and beta phases could be extracted up to a temperature of 1050 °C, enabling the determination of the overall thermal expansion for the alloy by using rule of mixture (ROM) calculations. Quantitative metallographic studies revealed that the closed <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> material exhibited a finer primary alpha grain size and a finer Widmanstätten platelet colony size which would be expected to provide a superior resistance to fatigue crack initiation. Observed differences in the texture of the two materials as determined by electron back-scattered diffraction might also have contributed to the difference in fatigue properties.

The closed <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process of Metal Matrix Material (MMC) is presented as possible solution, since it produces parts with good mechanical properties and lighter weight. A computational modeling of closed <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process using finite element method and optimization techniques makes the design optimization faster and more efficient, decreasing the use of conventional trial and error methods. In this study, the application of commercial finite element software (ANSYS) has been used to model cold closed <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process.

The material used is AlMgSi matrix with 15 % SiC particles. Its flow curve and fractural strain are obtained from the literature.

Normally design variables are geometrical parameters such as, rib height to width ratio, web height to rib height ratio, fillet radii, draft angle and billet radius. State Variables (SV) are some parameters that depend on the design variables such as, the equivalent strain which must be below the fracture strain of the MMC material, and an acceptable contact gap (within the allowable tolerances range).
