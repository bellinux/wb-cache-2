40|$|Counts of <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> (Phyllocoptruta oleivora (Ashm.)) on {{leaves and}} fruit of citrus {{rose to a}} peak in the two dry seasons, the build up taking 4 - 5 weeks. It then {{decreased}} partly through infection by the entomogenous fungus Hirsutellathompsonii Fisher and partly through a decline in feed quality. The low counts in the wet seasons were associated with rain rather than humidity, temperature or infections by H. thompsonii. Spraying with suspensions of fragmented mycelium of H. thompsonii (mass concentration 0. 5 - 1. 0 g litre - 1 ) prevented the build up of <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite.</b> The severity of greasy spot (Stenella sp.) {{was positively correlated with}} counts of <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite.</b> Defoliation of <b>citrus</b> trees after greasy spot infection was associated with high counts of <b>mite.</b> Control of <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> (with chlorobenzilate: mass concentration of a. i. 2 g litre - 1 at 500 litre ha - 1 ) was warranted when 25 % of fruit or 15 % of leaves bore at least one mite per lens field (1. 5 cm 2 ).

Identifications to genus {{were made from}} adults reared in the laboratory. The two species had {{distinctive}} larval coloration. One larval type was completely yellow and was identified as Feltiella n. sp., while the second larval type had an orange color with a transverse white band close to the mouthparts. The latter cecidomyiid was identified as belonging to a genus near Lestodiplosis in the broad sense. Feltiella n. sp. (n = 17) and the species near the genus Lestodiplosis (n = 12) consumed 33. 8 ± 4. 6 (mean ± SEM) and 43. 0 ± 6. 4 <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> eggs; 14. 2 ± 1. 4 and 15. 0 ± 2. 0 <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> nymphs, and 3. 0 ± 0. 4 and 5. 6 ± 0. 9 <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> adults/ 10 min., respectively.

40|$|For {{studying}} the bioefficacy of six isolates of Hirsutella thompsonii Fisher a fungal pathogen of eriophyid mites collected from different agro-climatic regions of India, fungal suspension was sprayed on fruits and leaves infested with healthy <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> Phyllocoptruta oleivora Ashmead and two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. The {{results revealed that}} all isolates of H. thompsonii were effective against <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite.</b> HtEMC isolate of H. thompsonii brought about maximum mortality of 48. 05 % ten days after treatment followed by HtCRMB (46. 87 %), HtCRMK (44. 27 %), HtCRMC (42. 09 %), HtPMG (39. 82 %) and HtPDBC (31. 22 %), however, this difference was not significant statistically. These isolates were also found to be effective against adult two spotted spider mite. HtEMC isolate of H. thompsonii brought about maximum mortality of 83. 33 % after eight days of treatment, followed by HtCRMB (70. 85), HtCRMK (39. 48), HtPMG (33. 05), HtCRMC (31. 86) and HtPDBC (19. 64). The HtCRMB isolate of H. thompsonii {{was found to be}} effective against nymphal stage of the two spotted spider mite with 88. 85 % mortality six days after treatment.

The body of this mite was spindle-shaped with {{a length of}} 100 - 150 μ m. The propodosoma lines were irregularly arranged and the hysterosoma possessed 30 - 40 rings. The legs originated from the ventral portion of gnathosoma and extended forward. The first, second and third coxa possessed seta on their surface. Genital organ {{and a pair of}} setae were observed bellow the coxal base. The cover flap of the genital organ had 12 muscles on its surface. The tubercle of the flagellate ventral seta was cone-shaped and had a length of 15 μ m. The first and second legs were six segmented where the tarsus had a single claw and a branched feathered claw. The gnathosoma was appended under the propodosoma and was extended forwardly. The palpi were segmented and smoothly surfaced.

Foliar applications of oxamyl reduced nematode populations and increased fruit growth rate slightly the first year, {{but not in the}} second. Foliar applications of oxamyl did not improve control attained by DBCP alone. Soil {{application of}} aldicarb [2 -methyl- 2 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde-O-(methylcarbamoyl) oxime] or DBCP to an orange (C. sinensis) orchard reduced T. semipenetrans populations in the 3 years tested and increased yield in 1 of 3 years. Aldicarb treatment reduced fruit damage caused by the <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> Phyllocoptruta oleivora. Aldicarb, applied at 5. 7 or 11. 4 kg/ha, by disk incorporation or chisel injection, was equally effective in controlling nematodes, improving yields, fruit size, and external quality. In a grapefruit orchard, chisel-applied aldicarb reduced nematode populations and <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> damage and increased yields in both years and increased fruit size in one year. The 11. 4 -kg/ha rate was slightly more effective than the 5. 7 -kg/ha rate.

40|$|Israeli {{citriculture}} occupies 18, 000 ha. Annual citrus {{production in}} Israel totals 600, 000 mt with 31 % exported fresh. Citrus is Israel’s number one fresh fruit export {{and must be}} free of pests and blemishes. Pest management in citrus groves in Israel is more-or-less satisfactory biological control of most aphids, scales, whiteflies, and mites [1]. Insecticides are used to control four primary pest species for which biological controls are insufficient: Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), <b>citrus</b> mealybug, <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> and California red scale. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Israel’s citrus groves {{has been based on}} the judicious use of relatively selective insecticides, in combination with biological control. It has been estimated that 100 % of the citrus in Israel is managed with IPM [2]. Cottony-cushion scale had a devastating effect on citrus groves in Israel in the early 1900 s and has been kept under effective control by the predatory vedalia beetle introduced in 1912. When Green’s mealybug appeared as a serious pest of citrus in the 1930 ’s it was controlled by a parasite introduced in 1940 from Japan [3]. Another parasite introduced in 1952 from the USA controlled the long-tailed mealybug. The Florida red scale, considered the most important pest of Israel in the 1950 s, was brought under complete control in most areas by a parasite imported from Hong Kong [3]. Four species of very damaging whiteflies have been introduced into Israel in the last few decades. The introductio...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} the apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa), on net CO 2 exchange, {{transpiration}} rate, and leaf color of field-grown Jonagold and Golden Delicious apples was investigated. Apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> feeding causes leaf browning. Changes in leaf color were measured to assess the cumulative leaf damage. Significant negative relationships were found between cumulative leaf damage and single-leaf net CO 2 exchange as well as transpiration rate. The same trends were observed on both varieties, but the effect of apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> feeding was more severe on Jonagold than on Golden Delicious. Leaf tissue injury was analyzed by cryoscanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. The pictures show that apple <b>rust</b> <b>mites</b> penetrate epidermal cells with their stylets, causing multiple puncture wounds.

50|$|Abacarus hystrix (cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> or grain <b>rust</b> <b>mite)</b> {{belongs to}} the family Eriophyidae. They are {{extremely}} small with adults measuring up to one millimeter in length and only have four legs {{at the front of}} the body. Viewing by the human eye requires, a 10 - 20X lens. The adult mites are usually yellow but also have been seen to be white or orange. The cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> was first found on Elymus repens (couch grass), a very common perennial grass species. It has now been found on more than 60 grass species including oats, barley, wheat and ryegrass, found in Europe, North America, South Africa and Australia. Mites migrate primarily through wind movement and are usually found on the highest basal sections of the top two leaf blades. Abacarus hystrix produces up to twenty overlapping generations per year in South Australian perennial pastures, indicating that the species breeds quite rapidly.

50|$|Cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> {{eggs are}} {{exceptionally}} small and {{are placed in}} leaf vein grooves by the mite. The eggs usually begin hatching {{at the beginning of}} spring (March in the Northern Hemisphere and September in the Southern Hemisphere) and once they have reached the juvenile stage, the mites mature very quickly (16-18 days). Once the mites are at the adult stage they often travel to the lower section of the plant where they feed on young tissues. Mites are always present for the full growing season of the plant, but activity has been seen to decrease as the temperature begins to rise, this is because unlike other mite species the cereal <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> favors much cooler temperatures.|$|R
