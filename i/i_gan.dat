However, it remains unknown whether cells within single genetic clones are functionally equivalent. By combining DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling, sequencing, and lentiviral lineage tracking, we followed the repopulation dynamics of 150 single lentivirus-marked lineages from 10 human colorectal cancers through serial xenograft passages in mice. CNA and mutational analysis distinguished individual clones and showed that clones remained stable upon serial transplantation. Despite this stability, the proliferation, persistence, and chemotherapy tolerance of lentivirally marked lineages were variable within each clone. Chemotherapy promoted the dominance of previously minor or dormant lineages. Thus, apart from genetic diversity, tumor cells display inherent functional variability in tumor propagation potential, which contributes to both cancer growth and therapy tolerance.

40|$|Ultrasound imaging {{makes use}} of {{backscattering}} of waves during their interaction with scatterers present in biological tissues. Simulation of synthetic ultrasound images is a challenging problem on account of inability to accurately model various factors of which some include intra-/inter scanline interference, transducer to surface coupling, artifacts on transducer elements, inhomogeneous shadowing and nonlinear attenuation. Current approaches typically solve wave space equations making them computationally expensive and slow to operate. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) inspired approach for fast simulation of patho-realistic ultrasound images. We apply the framework to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) simulation. A stage 0 simulation performed using pseudo B-mode ultrasound image simulator yields speckle mapping of a digitally defined phantom. The stage <b>I</b> <b>GAN</b> subsequently refines them to preserve tissue specific speckle intensities. The stage II GAN further refines them to generate high resolution images with patho-realistic speckle profiles. We evaluate patho-realism of simulated images with a visual Turing test indicating an equivocal confusion in discriminating simulated from real. We also quantify the shift in tissue specific intensity distributions of the real and simulated images to prove their similarity.

International audienceThe {{growth of}} {{spontaneous}} (catalist-free) self-assembled and ordered (localized) III-Nitride nanocolumns by Molecular Beam Epitaxy is addressed. A {{description of the}} nucleation process and the nanocolumn growth is given {{in relation to the}} growth conditions and the substrate/buffer used. Nucleation proceeds via Volmer-Weber or Stranski-Krastanov mechanisms depending on the initial lattice mismatch between the nanocolumns material and substrate. It is experimentally observed that a high initial mismatch (<b>i.</b> e. <b>GaN</b> on bare Si) leads to isolated, well defined nanocolumns, whereas a smaller one (<b>i.</b> e. <b>GaN</b> on AlN buffered Si) produces a mixture of nanocolumns and a "faceted matrix" of continuous, rough material. Polar wurtzite InN nanocolumns have been grown along the c-plane, on Si(111) and Si(100) substrates. In addition, non-polar InN nanocolumns have also been grown along the a-plane on m-plane GaN/r-plane Al 2 O 3 templates. In this case case, a well defined a-plane orientation is determined by HR-TEM and from the dependence of the E 2 Raman mode with the polarization angle. HR-SEM pictures reveal top nanocolumn surfaces showing a- and m- plane facets. PL measurements at low temperature give a emission energy of 0. 69 eV, a typical signature of a very high quality material. Though self-assembled nanocolumns are quite useful to understand the basic growth mechanisms and material properties, the growth of ordered arrays of nanocolumns is essential to fabricate real devices, like LEDs and detectors, because of the need of homogeneous geometry and characteristics of individual nanodevices. Details will be given on the use of thin Ti masks with nanoholes of different diameter and pitch and on the specific conditions for localized growth, far from those to grow self-assembled nanocolumns.

A lattice mismatched system (<b>i.</b> e. <b>GaN</b> nanostructure/ AlN) was utilized with S-K mode mechanism, whereas, metallic droplet method (i. e. Vapor-Liquid-Solid method) was {{employed in the}} lattice matched system (<b>i.</b> e. <b>GaN</b> nanostructure / AlGaN). The nanostructure size is adjustable by changing growth parameters (height: 2 ~ 15 nm and diameter: 10 ~ 100 nm). It {{has been found that}} the photon emission energy is tunable relative to the nanostructure size, and smaller nanostructures have larger photon energy. However, a numerical modeling was performed to investigate the relationship between quantum confinement (and/or piezoelectric polarization) and the dot size. For dot height < 4. 1 nm, the confinement effect is larger than the piezoelectric effect, otherwise the piezoelectric effect is more dominant. In addition, GaN nanostructures grown on Al 0. 15 Ga 0. 85 N have smaller lattice mismatch (less than 0. 5 %) than the GaN nanostructures grown on AlN. Therefore, the quantum confinement in a GaN/Al 0. 15 Ga 0. 85 N system is more dominant in determining photon emission energy than in a GaN/AlN system. The nanostructure advantages of quantum confinement and high thermal stability have been studied for the achievement of room temperature ferromagnetism using TM (transition metal; Mn or Fe). The transition metal (Mn or Fe) enhances nucleation of islands, resulting in size and density improvements. The magnetization measurements revealed magnetic properties of ferromagnetic nanostructure. Especially, room temperature ferromagnetism was observed in GaFeN nanostructures, which can contribute to ferromagnetic semiconductors operating above room temperature. Ph. D.

In self-assembled NCs growth, nucleation proceeds via Volmer-Weber or Stranski-Krastanov mechanisms depending on the initial lattice mismatch between the NCs material and substrate. It is experimentally observed that a high initial mismatch (<b>i.</b> e. <b>GaN</b> on bare Si) leads to isolated, well defined NCs, whereas a smaller one (<b>i.</b> e. <b>GaN</b> on AlN buffered Si) produces a mixture of NCs and a "faceted matrix" of continuous, rough material. A successful localized growth on patterned or masked (nanoholes) substrates depends critically on a balance between metal atoms diffusion and desorption, that are both strongly influenced by the growth temperature and the III/V ratio. A proper selection of the growth conditions leads to a reasonable growth rate within the nanoholes (mask) whereas avoiding NCs nucleation on the mask (selectivity). Self-assembled III-Nitride polar GaN and InN NCs have been successfully grown by many researchers, though little {{work has been done}} on non-polar NCs. Here we present results on the self-assembled growth of non-polar (a-plane) InN NCs on m-plane GaN/r-plane Al 2 O 3 templates.

However, getting the maximum benefit from GaN diode-based PV and LEDs will require wide-scale adoption. A key bottleneck for this is the device cost, which is currently dominated by the substrate (i. e. sapphire) and the epitaxy (<b>i.</b> e. <b>GaN).</b> This work investigates two schemes for reducing such costs. First, we investigated the integration of Zinc Oxide (ZnO) in InGaN-based diodes. (Successful growth of GaN on ZnO template layers (on sapphire) was illustrated. These templates can then be used as sacrificial release layers for chemical lift-off. Such an approach provides an alternative to laser lift-off for the transfer of GaN to substrates with a superior cost-performance profile, plus an added advantage of reclaiming the expensive single-crystal sapphire. It was also illustrated that substitution of low temperature n-type ZnO for n-GaN layers can combat indium leakage from InGaN quantum well active layers in inverted p-n junction structures. The ZnO overlayers can also double as transparent contacts with a nanostructured surface which enhances light in/out coupling. Thus ZnO was confirmed to be an effective GaN substitute which offers added flexibility in device design and can be used in order to simultaneously reduce the epitaxial cost and boost the device performance...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) is {{established}} treatment for muscle, autonomic nerve terminal overactivity. BTA is primarily presynaptic neuromuscular blocking agent inducing selective. reversible muscle weakness lasting several months when injected intramuscu 1 arly. The toxin in therapeutic doses is safe. Generalizcd weakness of distant muscles is seldom reported. BTA is digested ingastrointestinal tract as it forms complex with proteins that protect and stabilize ncurotoximit considered treatment option for gastrointestinal achalasia. Methods: A 75 year old diabetic woman developed functional obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms due to esophageal achalasia. She received endoscopically epicardial BTA injection (Botox Aller- <b>gan</b> <b>I</b> 00 U). By day 3 patient developed shortness of breath, dysarthria, dysphagia, nasal regurgitation. By day 7 she exhibited respiratory distress. When admitted to ICU (day 8) patient was alert; eye movements were full with normally reactive pupils. There was neck ﬂexor, upper, lower limb weakness graded Z/ 5 - 3 / 5 respectively (MRC scale). Deep jerks were brisk throughout. Results: Blood tests showed anemia; tumor marker titer, autoim- mune screenings, antibody scarch of muscle tyrosin kinase, acetilcholine receptors, voltage gated calcium channels were negative. Brain,total body computed tomography was inconclusive. Three Hz repetitive nerve stimulation(RS) on day 8 showed 25...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{sharing in}} the public sector is mostly {{regulated}} through rules, a clear sense of hierarchy with fi xed reporting structures, standard oper-ating procedures, and laws that tend to restrict the free fl ow of information across or <b>gan</b> <b>i</b> za tion al boundaries. The result is that information produced in one agency might not be available to entities in other corners of the overall system. This can and often does lead to reinventing the wheel and the fact that innovative knowledge is detained within knowledge silos (Noveck 2009). Con-sequently, ideas that might meet the knowledge needs of several similar stake-holders in government are prevented from spreading through the whole system. Social media tools are challenging this traditional “need to know” information- sharing paradigm (Dawes, Cresswell, and Pardo 2009) and are increasing the degree of participation of all stakeholders in the pro cess of cre-ating, maintaining, sourcing, and sharing knowledge. The resulting — partially informal — emerging interactions between the public and government itself are creating opportunities for increased transparency, accountability, participation, and collaboration (Orszag 2009). Moreover, social media tools are potentially disruptive and might have transformative effects on knowledge sharing that have not been fully covered in the public administration literature (Mergel...|$|R
40|$|The {{mismatch}} of the {{lattice constants}} {{and of the}} thermal expansion coefficients between gallium nitride (GaN) and its substrates like sapphire, silicon and silicon carbide is responsible for {{a high concentration of}} defects in AlGaN/GaN layers. The influence of these electrically active centres (traps) and their respective trapping effects are investigated using four different measurement methods. With photoionisation spectroscopy on layers grown on sapphire and silicon substrates two resp. three different traps responsible for the current collapse were found. Current collapse is assigned to traps in the GaN buffer layer. Using backgating current deep level transient spectroscopy the activation energies of a minority and a majority trap in the GaN buffer on silicon substrate were determined. For pulse measurements the drain current is measured at pulsed gate voltages. These measurements are used to investigate the influence of the "gate lag", i. e. trapping in surface states. This effect was suppressed largely by passivating the surface with a silicon nitride layer. Finally with admittance spectroscopy the activation energy of a GaN buffer anti-site, which is caused by sputtering during the processing of transistors, could be determined. Thus it was shown that surface states of AlGaN as well as defects in <b>GaN,</b> <b>i.</b> e. lattice defects and impurities, are responsible for trapping effects in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors. These traps could be confirmed in literature...|$|R
40|$|Conference on Noise in Devices and Circuits, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, 1 - 4 June 2003 We {{report the}} growth of high-mobility Si-doped GaN epilayers {{utilizing}} unique double buffer layer (DBL) structures, which consist of a thin buffer layer (TBL) and a thick GaN intermediate-temperature buffer layer (ITBL). In this study, three types of DBL were investigated: (<b>i)</b> thin low-temperature <b>GaN</b> buffer layer (LTBL) /GaN ITBL (type I); (ii) nitridated Ga metal film/GaN ITBL (type II); and (iii) AlN high-temperature buffer layer (HTBL) /GaN ITBL (type III). It is found that the electron mobilities of the GaN films are substantially improved {{with the use of}} DBLs. The sample grown using type II DBL has the highest room temperature electron mobility of 450 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, yet the sample grown with type III DBL exhibit the highest overall electron mobility of 520 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 at around 200 K. The PL results show that the sample deposited on type III DBL exhibit the highest compressive stress at room temperature. The data suggest that the use of type III DBL leads to the relaxation tensile stress at the growth temperature resulting in the improvements in the crystallinity and defect properties. Due to the mismatch in the coefficients of expansion between GaN and sapphire the sample with the highest compressive stress at room temperature corresponds to the one with the lowest tensile stress at the growth temperature. It was shown that low tensile stress facilitates two-dimensional growth leading to improvements in the crystallinity and defect properties. This is supported by the experimental results of low-frequency noise measurements, which indicated substantial reduction in the flicker noise level as well as the elimination of deep-levels with the use of type III DBL.
