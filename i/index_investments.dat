40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the price impact of financial <b>index</b> <b>investments</b> in grain futures markets during bubble and non-bubble periods. Corn, soybeans, and wheat traded at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and wheat traded at the Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT) are examined over January 2004 -June 2013. A recursive bubble-testing procedure {{is used to}} detect and date-stamp bubble periods in the four grain futures markets. Findings indicate that all four markets experienced multiple bubbles during the sample period, but bubbles represent only a limited portion of the price behavior, and their magnitude is relatively small. Granger causality tests are used to investigate the lead-lag dynamics between index trader positions and weekly returns (price changes). We find no evidence that <b>index</b> <b>investments</b> lead returns {{in any of the}} four markets in either bubble or non-bubble periods. In addition, there is evidence that index investment may have a small price-dampening effect during negative bubble periods in the soybean market. Overall, the findings provide little support for the dual claim that: i) grain futures prices experienced large and long-lasting bubbles during recent years; and ii) index investment was a primary driver of the large bubbles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between futures prices and financial investments in derivatives of the main agricultural commodities. We first provide a broad picture of how these markets function and how they have evolved, showing that traders who deal mostly in commodity <b>index</b> <b>investments</b> (swap dealers) have gained importance since the mid- 2000 s. However, traditional financial market participants (money managers) still show the stronger (simultaneous) correlation with price movements. Our main empirical analysis aims to gauge the influence of financial investors’ positions on both the level and the volatility of futures prices. The Granger-causality tests suggest that speculative investments usually follow – rather than precede - variations in futures returns. Employing a GARCH model, {{we find that the}} activity of money managers tends to be associated with lower volatility of futures returns, while that of swap dealers is sometimes followed by higher price variations. futures markets, commodities, speculation, GARCH, volatility...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{time series}} data are {{predicted}} using various methods. The main technique currently {{used to identify}} a time series has been adjusting the coefficient parameter {{in order to minimize}} the disparity between predicted data values. This is a logical method from the viewpoint of time series data prediction, but it does not suit the needs of economic time series prediction. With economic time series, like stock index data, the final goal of prediction is to invest more efficiently. To accomplish efficient investment, {{it is more important to}} raise the hit ratio in predicting the direction of price changes rather than to minimize the incongruity in data trends. This research uses Support Vector Machines (SVM), a method of pattern recognition, and the direction-of-price-change hit ratio, as an index for evaluating economic time series data prediction. The empirical results detailed in this thesis reveal that short term or midterm predictions by SVM are useful for <b>index</b> <b>investments.</b> This method can be generalized for investing in many different financial institutions. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2008 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(情報理工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|E

40|$|Much {{academic}} {{research has been}} completed {{on the use of}} portfolio optimizers in an international setting. Many optimizers use historical data and almost all allow for short sales. Some researchers have begun to question the output from such strategies. While some papers have tackled the problem of finding reasonable estimates for risk, the focus in this paper is on the inherent risk of investing in the tangency portfolio while allowing short sales. To test this theory, I first used historical data to test the validity of the theory that diversifying into international stock and bond <b>index</b> <b>investments</b> can provide gains to a US investor. Second, I performed the same test but with quarterly portfolio revision based on four separate strategies, two with short sales and two without. Last, I compared the results to those of an investor who followed two passive strategies. I found that while there was evidence that international diversification did provide US investors with an opportunity to increase returns, the risk adjusted return was not superior to that of the passive strategies.

40|$|Investments in {{commodity}} index instruments {{have grown}} considerably since their popularity exploded—along with commodity prices—in the mid- 2000 s. Numerous individuals and institutions have embraced alternative investments for their purported diversification benefits and equity-like returns; yet, real-time performance has been disappointing. The puzzling {{aspect of this}} poor performance is that it occurred {{at a time when}} the overall trend in commodity prices was generally upward. In this paper, we explicitly show that the disappointing returns of commodity <b>index</b> <b>investments</b> were not directly caused by the futures market term structure, i. e., contango. Rather, contango indicates that spot prices are likely to rise as compensation for the implicit—and unavoidable—cost of holding physical commodities. Futures price changes include no such compensation because the holder of a futures contract does not incur storage costs. Comparing commodity futures investment performance to a spot price benchmark for a market with a contango term structure will always be frustrating to investors as the spot price performance represents an unattainable strategy of buying-and-holding the spot without paying storage. We also find little evidence that risk premiums across commodity futures markets declined in a systematic fashio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{finds that}} {{concurrent}} {{with the rapid}} growing <b>index</b> <b>investment</b> in commodities markets since early 2000 s, futures prices of non-energy commodities in the US became increasingly correlated with oil and this trend was significantly more pronounced for commodities in the two popular SP-GSCI and DJ-UBS commodity indices. This finding reflects a financialization process of commodities markets and helps explain the largely increased price volatility of non-energy commodities around 2008. Since early 2000 s, commodity futures have emerged as a popular asset class for many financial institutions.
