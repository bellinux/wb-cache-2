In particular, an <b>inflationary</b> <b>factor</b> is {{incorporated into the}} period-dependent cost function element of the model. Some computational experimentation on the new model is tested. This work is perhaps the first to advance {{the extension of the}} Optimal Gantt Charting (OGC) model in terms of inflation. The work presents a wealth of research opportunities and has at least the modest potential to evaluate maintenance scheduling theory into the ranks of major theories of maintenance.

Significant shortcomings are inherent to this method, its failure to consider the time value of money and <b>inflationary</b> <b>factors</b> being two. The problem of including the time value of money (to the firm) has been conquered by introducing the concept of discounted payback analysis. Recognizing the need of incorporating <b>inflationary</b> <b>factors</b> into economic analysis and the fact that the energy inflation rate often exceeds the inflation rate of the general economy, this paper develops a technique for including these parameters into payback {{analysis of}} energy investments. Included in the development of this method are examples of its correct and incorrect application with regard to energy (savings) related projects.

40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{designed}} {{as an attempt to}} estimate the magnitude of the influence of relative price shifts on the overall price level in Poland during the transition period 1989 - 1997. For that purpose, the theoretical model has been found that builds on menu costs and trend inflation to derive a positive relationship between variance and skewness of the distribution of relative price changes and the general inflation. The model allowed to estimate the effect of relative price shifts within the framework controlling for nominal and real shocks. Using Polish data, a set of three versions of the model were estimated. All of them yielded high explanatory power and statistically significant coefficients on most variance and skewness variables thus giving a strong empirical support to the theoretical relationship. Larger shifts in relative prices accompanying the adjustment process and detected by higher va riance in the equation were proven to exert substantial upward pressure on inflation that persists over time. On the other hand, high positive skewness reflecting the domination of the adjustment process by few large increases was confirmed to produce contemporaneous upward impulse that tends to wear off after one quarter but is stronger in magnitude than that coming from higher variance. Including other explanatory variables like real exchange rate, wages and/or money allowed for observing the relative importance of <b>inflationary</b> <b>factors.</b> The analysis revealed that money and wages remain to be the main factors fueling inflation and can jointly account for almost three quarters of quarterly inflation. If their impact is evaluated separately, wages contribute about one half of inflation and domestic credit almost one third. On the other hand, real exchange rate appreciation was confirmed to significantly lower inflation. The measure based on different paces of inflation between tradables and non-tradables {{has proven to be a}} substantial dampening factor with an average elasticity of about minus three quarters. inflation, relative price variability, Poland, transition...|$|R
40|$|During {{inflation}} explicit perturbative computations {{of quantum}} field theories which contain massless, nonconformal fields exhibit secular effects that grow as {{powers of the}} logarithm of the <b>inflationary</b> scale <b>factor.</b> Starobinskiĭ’s technique of stochastic inflation not only reproduces the leading infrared logarithms at each order in perturbation theory, it can sometimes be summed to reveal what happens when inflation has proceeded so long that the large logarithms overwhelm even very small coupling constants. It is thus a cosmological analogue of what the renormalization group does for the ultraviolet logarithms of quantum field theory, and generalizing this technique to quantum gravity {{is a problem of}} great importance. There are two significant differences between gravity and the scalar models for which stochastic formulations have so far been given: derivative interactions and the presence of constrained fields. We use explicit perturbative computations in two simple scalar models to infer a set of rules for stochastically formulating theories with these features. 1. Overvie...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{probability}} distributions for {{the cosmological}} constant Lambda and the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations Q in models where they both are anthropic variables. With mild {{assumptions about the}} prior probabilities, the distribution P(Lambda,Q) factorizes into two independent distributions for the variables Q and y ∝Λ/Q^ 3. The distribution for y is largely model-independent and is in a good agreement with the observed value of y. The form of P(Q) depends {{on the origin of}} density perturbations. If the perturbations are due to quantum fluctuations of the inflaton, then P(Q) tends to have an exponential dependence on Q, {{due to the fact that}} in such models Q is correlated with the amount of inflationary expansion. For simple models with a power-law potential, P(Q) is peaked at very small values of Q, far smaller than the observed value of 10 ^- 5. This problem does not arise in curvaton-type models, where the <b>inflationary</b> expansion <b>factor</b> is not correlated with Q. Comment: 20 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} that the scale of gravity, parameterized by the apparent Planck mass, may obtain different values within different universes in an encompassing multiverse. We investigate the range over which the Planck mass may scan while still satisfying anthropic constraints. The window for anthropically allowed values of the Planck mass may have important consequences for landscape predictions. For example, if the likelihood to observe some value of the Planck mass is weighted by the <b>inflationary</b> expansion <b>factors</b> of the universes that contain that value, then it appears extremely unlikely to observe the value of the Planck mass that is measured within our universe. This is another example of the runaway inflation problem discussed in recent literature. We also show that the window for the Planck mass significantly weakens the anthropic constraint upon the cosmological constant when both are allowed to vary over a landscape.

40|$|A quantum {{expansion}} parameter, {{analogous to}} the Hubble parameter in cosmology, is defined for a free particle quantum wavefunction. By considering the universe as an initial single Gaussian quantum wavepacket whose mass is that of present-day observable universe and whose size {{is that of the}} Planck Length at the Planck Time, it is demonstrated that this quantum expansion parameter has a value at the present epoch of the same order as the value of the Hubble constant. The coincidence suggests examining the effect of including this type of quantum wave expansion in traditional general relativistic cosmology and a sample model illustrating this is presented here. Using standard Einstein-de Sitter cosmology (Ωm = 1) it is found that cosmic acceleration (aka dark energy) arises naturally during cosmic history. The time at which the universe switched from deceleration to acceleration (observationally 7 Gyr before the present epoch) yields a value for the mass of the wavepacket representing the universe at the Planck Time and its present age. This same mass may then be used to obtain a curve for the cosmic expansion rate versus z. This curve is well fit to observational data. The model is used also to obtain an estimate of the <b>inflationary</b> expansion <b>factor.</b> Comment: 18 pages, 3 figures, based on a presentation at the Australian National Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics Workshop, Melbourne, 13 th- 14 th February, 201...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{an exact}} f(T) gravity {{in the absence}} of {{ordinary}} matter in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, where T is the teleparallel torsion scalar. We show that vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor T^μν of matter does not imply vanishing of the teleparallel torsion scalar, in contrast to general relativity, where the Ricci scalar vanishes. The theory provides an exponential (<b>inflationary)</b> scale <b>factor</b> independent of the choice of the sectional curvature. In addition, the obtained f(T) acts just like cosmological constant in the flat space model. Nevertheless, it is dynamical in non-flat models. In particular, the open universe provides a decaying pattern of the f(T) contributing directly to solve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant. The equation of state (EoS) of the torsion vacuum fluid has been studied in positive and negative Hubble regimes. We study the case when the torsion is made of a scalar field (tlaplon) which acts as torsion potential. This treatment enables to induce a tlaplon field sensitive to the symmetry of the spacetime in addition to the reconstruction of its effective potential from the f(T) theory. The theory provides six different versions of inflationary models. The real solutions are mainly quadratic, the complex solutions, remarkably, provide Higgs-like potential.

40|$|We {{present some}} {{features}} of early universe cosmology {{in terms of}} Hankel functions index (ν). Actually, the recent data from observational cosmology indicate that our universe was nearly de Sitter space-time in the early times which results in an approximate scale-invariant spectrum. This imposes some constrains on index ν [1]. These constrains stimulate us to use general solution of inflaton field equation for ν≠ 3 / 2. To obtain the general solution for the inflationary background, we use asymptotic expansion of Hankel functions up to non-linear order of 1 /kη. We consider the non-linear modes as the fundamental modes for early universe during the inflation. In this paper, we obtain the general form of the <b>inflationary</b> modes, scale <b>factor</b> expansion, equation of state and some non-linear corrections of power spectrum in terms of index ν.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that after brane-antibrane inflation in a Klebanov-Strassler (KS) warped throat, metastable Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations can be formed due to nearly-conserved angular momenta along isometric directions in the throat. If sufficiently long-lived, these relics could conflict with big bang nucleosynthesis or baryogenesis by dominating the energy density of the universe. We make a detailed estimate of the decay rate of such relics using the low energy effective action of type IIB string theory compactified on the throat geometry, with attention to powers of the warp factor. We find {{that it is necessary to}} turn on SUSY-breaking deformations of the KS background in order to ensure that the most dangerous relics will decay fast enough. The decay rate is found to be much larger than the naive guess based on the dimension of the operators which break the angular isometries of the throat. For an <b>inflationary</b> warp <b>factor</b> of order w∼ 10 ^- 4, we obtain the bound M_ 3 / 2 10 ^ 9 GeV on the scale of SUSY breaking to avoid cosmological problems from the relics, which is satisfied in the KKLT construction assumed to stabilize the compactification. Given the requirement that the relics decay before nucleosynthesis or baryogenesis, we place bounds on the mass of the relic as a function of the warp factor in the throat for more general warped backgrounds.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{sheds light}} on the Turkish {{experience}} of capital account liberalization {{and its effect on}} key macroeconomic variables, using quarterly data in a multivariate VAR model. We also take into consideration the crisis breakpoint in 2001 and estimate the effect of shocks attributed to capital flows, using quarterly data during the sub-periods 1989 : 01 – 2001 : 01 and 2001 : 02 – 2009 : 03. The findings indicate that capital flows have varying effects on the Turkish economy before and after the crisis in 2001 and the evidence supports significant effects of liberalizing financial flows on macroeconomic performance, especially during the post-crisis period (2001 : 02 – 2009 : 03). Moreover, this latter period exhibited evidence of sterilization policy that has helped mopping up excess liquidity and containing <b>inflationary</b> pressures.

40|$|There {{is a long}} {{standing}} debate over how to objectively compare the career achievements of professional athletes from different historical eras. Developing an objective approach will be of particular importance {{over the next decade}} as Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the "steroids era" become eligible for Hall of Fame induction. Here we address this issue, as well as the general problem of comparing statistics from distinct eras, by detrending the seasonal statistics of professional baseball players. We detrend player statistics by normalizing achievements to seasonal averages, which accounts for changes in relative player ability resulting from both exogenous and endogenous factors, such as talent dilution from expansion, equipment and training improvements, as well as performance enhancing drugs (PED). In this paper we compare the probability density function (pdf) of detrended career statistics to the pdf of raw career statistics for five statistical categories [...] hits (H), home runs (HR), runs batted in (RBI), wins (W) and strikeouts (K) [...] over the 90 -year period 1920 - 2009. We find that the functional form of these pdfs are stationary under detrending. This stationarity implies that the statistical regularity observed in the right-skewed distributions for longevity and success in professional baseball arises from both the wide range of intrinsic talent among athletes and the underlying nature of competition. Using this simple detrending technique, we examine the top 50 all-time careers for H, HR, RBI, W and K. We fit the pdfs for career success by the Gamma distribution in order to calculate objective benchmarks based on extreme statistics which can be used for the identification of extraordinary careers.
