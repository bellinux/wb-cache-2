The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the concurrent validity of a comprehensive driving simulator evaluation in 29 persons with Huntington disease (HD). The Test Ride for Investigating Practical fitness to drive (TRIP) checklist was administered after a 15 km simulator drive and 20 km on-road drive. The total driving simulator TRIP score and each of its item scores were compared with the on-road TRIP scores using Spearman rho correlation statistics. We found significant correlations for 9 of the 12 items. Correlations ranged between 0. 12 for the item gap distance at speed below 50 km/h and 0. 72 for the total TRIP score, indicating variable strength of the associations. Items assessing operational skills correlated better with on-road driving performance than tactical or higher-order visual items.
