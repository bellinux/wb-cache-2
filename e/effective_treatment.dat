5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an <b>effective</b> <b>treatment</b> for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an <b>effective</b> <b>treatment</b> for acne.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss tobacco use and {{dependence}}, <b>effective</b> <b>treatments,</b> and the role of the dental professional. Tobacco dependence is discussed as a chronic condition characterized by a vulnerability to relapse that persists for perhaps years. The need for ongoing rather than just acute care is highlighted. <b>Effective</b> <b>treatments</b> for tobacco dependence exist. Brief clinical intervention makes a difference. It is recommended that every dental patient who uses tobacco be offered at least one of the <b>effective</b> <b>treatments</b> available. In so doing, dental professionals can play an important role in primary prevention of adverse health effects and can have an important public health impact by helping to counter tobacco use...|$|R
5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While <b>effective</b> <b>treatment</b> of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease.

5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth.

Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is an <b>effective</b> <b>treatment</b> for acne.|$|E

5|$|Fly larvae {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} wound care and treatment. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and <b>effective</b> <b>treatment</b> for chronic wounds.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an <b>effective</b> <b>treatment</b> that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E

5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain.

5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen.

40|$|Experimental {{treatments}} for Ebola virus disease (EVD) might reduce EVD mortality. There is {{uncertainty about the}} ability of different clinical trial designs to identify <b>effective</b> <b>treatments,</b> and about the feasibility of implementing individually randomised controlled trials during an Ebola epidemic. A treatment evaluation programme for use in EVD was devised using a multi-stage approach (MSA) with two or three stages, including both non-randomised and randomised elements. The probabilities of rightly or wrongly recommending the experimental treatment, the required sample size, and the consequences for epidemic outcomes over 100 d under two epidemic scenarios were compared for the MSA, a sequential randomised controlled trial (SRCT) with up to 20 interim analyses, and, as a reference case, a conventional randomised controlled trial (RCT) without interim analyses. Assuming 50 % 14 -d survival in the population treated with the current standard of supportive care, all designs had similar probabilities of identifying <b>effective</b> <b>treatments</b> correctly, while the MSA was less likely to recommend treatments that were ineffective. The MSA led to a smaller number of cases receiving ineffective treatments and faster roll-out of highly <b>effective</b> <b>treatments.</b> For less <b>effective</b> <b>treatments,</b> the MSA had a high probability of including an RCT component, leading to a somewhat longer time to roll-out or rejection. Assuming 100 new EVD cases per day, the MSA led to between 6 % and 15 % greater reductions in epidemic mortality over the first 100 d for highly <b>effective</b> <b>treatments</b> compared to the SRCT. Both the MSA and SRCT led to substantially fewer deaths than a conventional RCT if the tested interventions were either highly effective or harmful. In the proposed MSA, the major threat to the validity {{of the results of the}} non-randomised components is that referral patterns, standard of care, or the virus itself may change during the study period in ways that affect mortality. Adverse events are also harder to quantify without a concurrent control group. The MSA discards ineffective treatments quickly, while reliably providing evidence concerning <b>effective</b> <b>treatments.</b> The MSA is appropriate for the clinical evaluation of EVD treatments...|$|R
