5|$|It {{has long}} been presumed {{that there is a}} common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's {{characteristic}} triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.|$|E
5|$|Other poems may be {{organized}} into verse paragraphs, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> established by {{a collection of}} rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form. Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.|$|E

5|$|The major {{producers}} of calcium are China (about 10000 to 12000 tonnes per year), Russia (about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year), and the United States (about 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year). Canada and France are {{also among the}} minor producers. In 2005, about 24000 tonnes of calcium were produced; {{about half of the}} world's extracted calcium is used by the United States, with about 80% of the output used each year. In Russia and China, Davy's method of electrolysis is still used, but <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> applied to molten calcium chloride. Since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium, the oxide–nitride coating that results in air is stable and lathe machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium. In the United States and Canada, calcium <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> produced by reducing lime with aluminium metal at high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun. This {{may be caused by}} the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface. Energy transfer <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.|$|E

5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E
5|$|All birds lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Captain Kirk, {{the episode}} {{introduced}} two other regular characters to the show: James Doohan, {{a friend of}} director James Goldstone, was cast as the Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (the name chosen after Doohan had tried various accents, and had decided that an engineer ought to be Scottish) and George Takei was cast as Ship's Physicist Sulu, who would become the helmsman in the regular series. Lieutenant Uhura and Dr. Leonard McCoy do not feature; the ship's doctor <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> Mark Piper (Paul Fix). Piper {{was intended as a}} regular; DeForest Kelley, who played McCoy in the series proper, had been considered for the role.|$|E

The brigade's Headquarters and Headquarters Company is located in Gaithersburg, and it commands two other reserve military police battalions. These are the 336th Military Police Battalion and the 400th Military Police Battalion. The brigade commands numerous smaller company sized reserve military police units throughout the country.

5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, {{the animal is}} not known to eat fish. The name <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> related to the word fitch, meaning a European polecat (Mustela putorius) or pelt thereof, due to the {{resemblance}} to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent fisse or visse. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called fiche or fichet.|$|E
5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} another {{significant}} difference in Napoleon himself, {{in the way he}} holds himself. David's Napoleon is flamboyant, confident in his leadership of the French army, and in his ability to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon <b>is</b> <b>instead</b> downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long and unstable trek.|$|E
