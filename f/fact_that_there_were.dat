5|$|Some sources, such as Claxton, {{state that}} there was only a single boiler, but others, such as Fletcher and Maginnis, state that there were three side by side. This {{apparent}} discrepancy is explained by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> three separate boilers or boiler compartments sharing a common housing.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also burned through and collapsed. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, WCBS {{announced}} {{that for the}} 2003–04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People's Court after WNBC, which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut, dropped it from its lineup. WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local newscast once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were compounded by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E

5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been kept in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, and despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry and}} {{subsequent}} compensation cases found that Rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after the {{incidents in the}} 1960s. The disaster also highlighted, however, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no established safety standards that should be adhered to, let alone any means of enforcing such standards. This had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier, after the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973, and legislation was enacted with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This law cut the capacity of Ibrox to 65,000. In the short term, Rangers took the stopgap measure of installing benches in the North Stand, which was renamed the Centenary Stand.|$|E

5|$|Having {{broken through}} {{for his first}} century {{at the end of}} the {{previous}} season, Harvey played consistently in 1953–54, and was selected for each of Victoria's matches for the season for the first time. He did so despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no Tests scheduled for the Australian season, meaning that the international representatives would be available for all of Victoria's matches. Ray and Neil played together in every match of the summer. In the opening match of the season against Queensland, Ray Harvey made 82 and 8 in a 254-run win. He followed this with 2 and 91 in the next match against New South Wales over the Christmas holiday period. Harvey was one of the few batsmen to make an impact in the second innings, as the New South Wales bowlers, including the likes of Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Richie Benaud and Davidson, all members of Australia's Test bowling attack, dismissed Victoria for only 222 to set up a nine-wicket win. A week later, he started the new year by scoring 110 as Victoria batted first and took a 117-run first innings lead against South Australia. He made only 10 in the second innings but his state completed a 290-run win nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Zoroastrians {{moved to}} India in {{successive}} migrations in the Islamic period. The initial migration following the conquest {{has been characterized}} as a religious persecution by invading Muslims. According to the account, the Zoroastrians suffered at their hands {{and in order to}} protect themselves and safeguard their religion, fled first to northern Iran, then to the island of Hormuz and finally to India. This generally accepted narrative of migration emphasises Muslim persecution while identifying Parsis as religious refugees. Recently, scholars have questioned this explanation of Iranian origins. There is a scarcity of sources about the migration. Historians are forced to rely exclusively on Qissa-i Sanjan written in 1599 by a Parsi Priest and Qissah-ye Zartushtian-e Hindustan written more than 200 years later. This is complicated by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> already Zoroastrians in India in the Sasanian period. According to the legend, {{at the beginning of the}} 10th century a small group of Zoroastrians living around the town of Nyshapour and Fort of Sanjan in the province of (greater) Khorasan, decided that Iran was no longer safe for Zoroastrians and their religion.The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of Sanjan (Gujarat), which is said to have been named after the city of their origin (Sanjan, near Merv, in present-day Turkmenistan).|$|E

25|$|The {{reduction}} of {{power of the}} great families helped to improve the empire. This was because previously, each great family ruled {{a large chunk of}} land and each had their own king. The name Shahanshah, meaning King of Kings, derived from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> many feudal kings in Sasanian Persia with the Shahanshah as the ruler of them all. Their fall from power meant their control was redirected to the central government and all taxes now came to the central government rather than to the local nobility.|$|E
25|$|King {{notes that}} the {{eighteenth-century}} definition for “publisher” could also mean “bookseller.” King is uncertain whether Haywood produced the books and pamphlets that she sold (as Spedding indicates) or {{if she was a}} bookseller, especially for Haywood’s early productions. Haywood sometimes collaborated on publishing matters in order to share the costs, as she did when she collaborated with Cogan on the publication of The Virtuous Villager. In any case, Haywood was most certainly a bookseller due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a great number and variety of works “to be had” at the Sign of Fame that did not bare her imprint.|$|E
25|$|Nationwide, Ivo Josipović {{obtained}} 32% and Milan Bandić 14%, {{meaning the}} two of them combined achieved less support than Stjepan Mesić did in 2005 in the first round only. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only three actual left-leaning candidates meant the left was relatively united under Josipović, while the votes of the right were spread out on several prominent candidates, including Bandić, {{which was one of the}} reasons why no right wing candidate managed to qualify for a run-off. As such, this election became historic as a run-off would feature two candidates once in the same party, Josipović, who rejoined SDP a year before the election, and Bandić, who left SDP a month before the election so he could run as an independent.|$|E
