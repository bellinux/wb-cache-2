40|$|As {{a method}} of {{combining}} holography and photoinduced polymerization techniques, holographic lithography (HL) has been extensively applied in fabricating mesoscale structures such as photonic crystals recently because {{of the advantages of}} flexibility, convenience and high efficiency over some other conventional techniques [...] In this contribution, we demonstrate the fabrication of visible photonic band gap structures using SU 8 resin or <b>dichromate</b> <b>gelatin</b> (DCG) holographic materials.

40|$|We {{report on}} the optical {{activities}} of left- and right-handed micro-spirals fabricated in <b>dichromate</b> <b>gelatin</b> emulsions using a holographic interference technique involving six linearly polarized side beams and one circularly polarized central beam. Photonic bandgaps in the visible range are observed. More importantly, opposite optical activities-a polarization rotation of a few degrees and a circular dichroism (CD) of about 20 % at the photonic band edges-are observed for the left-and right-handed spirals. Furthermore, the transmittance of circularly polarized light obeys the Lorentz reciprocity lemma for forward and backward incidence. However neither polarization rotation nor CD is observed for achiral split rings and hollow rods fabricated using all linearly polarized beams and six side beams without the central beam, respectively; this indicates that the chiral nature of the spirals {{is essential for the}} observed optical activities...|$|E
40|$|Lasing {{requires}} an active gain medium and a feedback mechanism. In conventional lasers the feedback is provided externally, e. g. by mirrors. An alternate approach is through Bloch waves in photonic crystals composed of periodic dielectric materials in which propagation {{of light in}} certain frequency ranges, known as photonic bandgaps, is forbidden. Compared to periodic crystals, quasicrystals have higher symmetry and are more favorable {{for the formation of}} photonic bandgaps. Hence quasicrystals are more efficient in providing the feedback mechanism for lasing. Here we report observation of lasing at visible wavelengths from dye-doped three-dimensional icosahedral quasicrystals fabricated in <b>dichromate</b> <b>gelatin</b> emulsions using a novel seven-beam optical interference holographic method. Multi-directional lasing exhibiting the icosahedral symmetry was observed.

A theoretical simulation of simultaneous {{second harmonic generation}} (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) in 1 D nonlinear PC is used to design appropriate PC structures to realize phase-matched SHG and THG using ZnS as the nonlinear layer. Dramatic simultaneous enhancement of SHG and THG in forward and backward directions from a 1 D ZnS/YF 3 PC structure have been observed. The conversion efficiencies of SHG and THG in forward and backward directions are in good agreement between the experimental results and theoretical simulations. Gold nanoparticle doped glass thin film ((SiO 2) 1 -x-Au-(TiO 2) x) was fabricated by the sputtering and thermal annealing process.
