As these bioassays are often technically complex and require considerable experience, careful technology transfer between laboratories is critical if high quality, reproducible data that allows comparison between sites, is to be generated. The aim of this study, funded by the European Union Framework Program 7 -funded TRANSVAC project, was to optimise Standard Operating Procedures and the technology transfer process to maximise the reproducibility of three bioassays for interferon-gamma responses: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ex-vivo enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining. We found that the initial variability in results generated across three different laboratories reduced following a combination of Standard Operating Procedure harmonisation and the undertaking of side-by-side training sessions in which assay operators performed each assay {{in the presence of}} an assay 'lead' operator. Mean inter-site coefficients of variance reduced following this training session when compared with the pre-training values, most notably for the ELISA assay. There was a trend for increased inter-site variability at lower response magnitudes for the ELISA and intracellular cytokine staining assays. In conclusion, we recommend that on-site operator training is an essential component of the assay technology transfer process and combined with <b>harmonised</b> <b>Standard</b> Operating Procedures will improve the quality, reproducibility and comparability of data produced across different laboratories.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sheffield NARCOS (National Adverse Reactions Advisory Service) investigates {{suspected}} perioperative anaesthetic reactions using serial tryptase, urinary methylhistamine {{and clinical}} information. Further recommendations for additional allergy clinic assessment are provided. OBJECTIVE: To establish a robustly measurable protocol for identifying mast cell mediator (MMR) release in this cohort. To compare these thresholds with previous suggested thresholds and algorithms. METHOD: A review of 3, 455 NARCOS cases referred with a suspected peri-operative allergic reaction. Tryptase, Urinary methylhistamine (UMH) and clinical details were analysed. 1746 cases were graded using the Ring and Messmer scale. Reaction grade, tryptase and UMH changes {{were compared with}} statistical and graphical presentations appropriate to non-normally distributed measurements using Analyse-IT software. RESULTS: Sensitive strategies such as 3 μg/l or 20 % are measurable, translatable and would substantially increase detection of potentially relevant changes in tryptases. Adequate quality assurance for low level measurement is needed. An incremental threshold of 20 % would identify potential MMR in an additional 14 % of cases with peak tryptase (Tp) between 5 and 14 μg/L and a further 15 % with Tp below 5 μg/L. Further work is required to establish the diagnostic performance characteristics of this more sensitive approach. UMH also identified up to 120 further cases of potential MMR in absence of tryptase increments. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Future studies should establish and compare the predictive performance characteristics of each strategy against clinical phenotypes. A single agreed definition of positive serial tryptases is needed to enable robust evaluation of diagnostic strategies.

40|$|Bioassays are {{particularly}} useful tools {{to link the}} chemical and ecological assessments in water quality monitoring. Different methods cover {{a broad range of}} toxicity mechanisms in diverse organisms, and account for risks posed by non-target compounds and mixtures. Many tests are already applied in chemical and waste assessments, and stakeholders from the science-police interface have recommended their integration in regulatory water quality monitoring. Still, {{there is a need to}} address bioassay suitability to evaluate water samples containing emerging pollutants, which are a current priority in water quality monitoring. The presented interlaboratory study (ILS) verified whether a battery of miniaturized bioassays, conducted in 11 different laboratories following their own protocols, would produce comparable results when applied to evaluate blinded samples consisting of a pristine water extract spiked with four emerging pollutants as single chemicals or mixtures, i. e. triclosan, acridine, 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) and 3 -nitrobenzanthrone (3 -NBA). Assays evaluated effects on aquatic organisms from three different trophic levels (algae, daphnids, zebrafish embryos) and mechanism-specific effects using in vitro estrogenicity (ER-Luc, YES) and mutagenicity (Ames fluctuation) assays. The test battery presented complementary sensitivity and specificity to evaluate the different blinded water extract spikes. Aquatic organisms differed in terms of sensitivity to triclosan (algae > daphnids > FET) and acridine (FET > daphnids > algae) spikes, confirming the complementary role of the three taxa for water quality assessment. Estrogenicity and mutagenicity assays identified with high precision the respective mechanism-specific effects of spikes even when non-specific toxicity occurred in mixture. For estrogenicity, although differences were observed between assays and models, EE 2 -spike relative induction EC 50 values were comparable to the literature, and E 2 /EE 2 equivalency factors reliably reflected the sample content. In the Ames, strong revertant induction occurred following 3 -NBA-spike incubation with the TA 98 strain, which was of lower magnitude after metabolic transformation and when compared to TA 100. Differences in experimental protocols, model organisms, and data analysis can be sources of variation, indicating that respective <b>harmonised</b> <b>standard</b> procedures should be followed when implementing bioassays in water monitoring. Together with other ongoing activities for the validation of a basic bioassay battery, the present study is an important step towards the implementation of bioanalytical monitoring tools in water quality assessment and monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Between July 2005 and February 2008, ten Catch Assessment Surveys (CASs) were {{conducted}} at 54 pre-selected fish landing {{sites in the}} Ugandan part of Lake Victoria comprising approximately 10 % of all landing sites {{in each of the}} 11 districts sharing the lake. The CASs {{were conducted}} following regionally <b>harmonised</b> <b>Standard</b> Operating Procedures (SOPs). This report covers the CAS conducted in February 2008 and puts into context the trends generated by results of the previous surveys. The catch rates of Nile perch in gillnetting boats with motor/sail, reduced from 26. 9 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in August 2007 to 22. 8 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in February 2008. Whereas the catch rates of paddle Sesse boats remained {{more or less the same}} as in August 2007. The Nile perch catch rates of the long line fishery of the boats using motor/sail was similar, 35 and 36 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in August 2007 and February 2008 respectively but the catch rates of paddle Sesse boats using long lines showed some more increase from 19 to 22 kg boat (- 1) day (- 1). In the tilapia fishery, the catch rates of the parachute boats using gillnets showed further decrease in a row from 12. 6 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in December 2006, 11. 6 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in March 2007, 11. 2 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in August 2007 and 10. 0 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in February 2008. The overall impact of reduced catch rates in the predominant effort groups, e. g. gillnetting boats using motor/sail in the Nile perch fishery and Parachute boats using gillnets in the tilapia fishery overshadowed the increases in less dominant effort groups and resulted in the lowest monthly catch estimates recorded in the surveys conducted since 2005. Whereas there was a clear downward trend in the Nile perch catch rates of boats using gillnets, which corroborates with the information of declining stocks from the recent Acoustics surveys, the catch rates in the long line fishery remained stable and even somewhat increasing in the last four surveys. The factors that maintain high catches against reduction of fish biomass in the long line fishery and their effects on sustainability of the Nile perch fishery should be investigated further. The Mukene fishery, characterised by large fluctuations in the catch rates did not show much change in the last two surveys in August 2007 and February 2008 and the annual catch estimates showed an overall increase of 7 % from 2005 to 2007.

40|$|The {{reinforcement}} of timber using fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) rods or plates is widely accepted {{as an effective}} method of increasing the strength and stiffness of members. Across Europe, this technology has been used, not only in new structures, but in the upgrading and repair of existing structures. When retrofitting these structures, changes in use of the building or, indeed, changes in building regulations often require a higher load capacity {{than that of the}} existing members. The additional capacity requirements can be successfully achieved in a timely and cost-effective manner through the use of FRP reinforcement. More widespread use of this technology has been hampered by the lack of a <b>harmonised</b> <b>standard</b> governing their design. Currently, design rules for FRP reinforcement are not included in Eurocode 5, which is the European standard governing the design of timber structures. The reasons for this are partly {{due to a lack of}} knowledge, particularly related to the long-term performance. This body of research aims to help researchers and design engineers to better understand the long-term or creep performance of FRP reinforced timber elements and to contribute to the development of design approaches, which account for the influence of reinforcement on this behaviour. This requires an examination of the main mechanical responses that are commonly observed in timber members under long-term loading, namely, the elastic, viscoelastic, mechano-sorptive and swelling/shrinkage responses. An experimental programme was designed to identify and characterise these individual responses on matched groups of glued laminated beams having statistically equal bending stiffness. This experimental programme involved the simultaneous loading of an equal proportion of unreinforced and reinforced beams to a common bending stress on the compression face in constant and variable climates for a period of 75 weeks. In the constant climate condition, the unreinforced and reinforced beams were subject to elastic and viscoelastic creep behaviour. In the variable climate condition, the beams were subject to elastic and viscoelastic creep behaviour and also, as a result of the variable climate condition, were subject to hygro-mechanical behaviour, which includes mechano-sorptive and swelling/shrinkage behaviour. The mid-span vertical deflection and longitudinal strain on the tension and compression faces were continuously monitored. No statistically significant difference was found between the creep deflection of unreinforced and reinforced beams in the constant climate condition. A key conclusion is that the viscoelastic creep deflection is governed by the stress level in the timber and is independent of the reinforcement. In the variable climate, the total deflection dramatically increased due to the variable moisture content conditions. In this case, there was a statically significant difference between the creep deflection of the unreinforced and reinforced beams with a reduction in deflection due to the reinforcement. By analysing the strain measurements from beams in the constant and variable climates together with separate swelling/shrinkage measurements on matched groups, it was possible to separate and characterise each individual strain component. The test methodology was specifically designed for this purpose. Significantly, the mechano-sorptive creep component has been separately quantified unlike in previous work where the mechano-sorptive and swelling/shrinkage effects have been combined. This separation has led to a significant finding in relation the influence of these components on the response. No statistically significant difference in the mechano-sorptive strain behaviour due to the reinforcement was observed. It was found that the main difference in the hygro-mechanical response is due to the different swelling/shrinkage behaviour of unreinforced and reinforced beams. The reinforcement restrains the swelling/shrinkage behaviour in the timber resulting in less relative creep deflection in reinforced members. This means that the influence of the reinforcement on hygro-mechanical response may be characterised through short-term swelling/shrinkage tests. A hygro-mechanical creep model was developed to predict the interaction between stress and moisture content change in timber elements when simultaneously loaded under a constant dead load and subject to a variable relative humidity condition with time. User-defined UMAT and DFLUX subroutines were utilised to define the material behaviour and variable relative humidity boundary conditions, respectively. Material characterisation tests were performed on Irish-grown Sitka spruce and BFRP rod reinforcement to provide the necessary material data for the numerical models. The numerical deflection and strain results have shown good agreement when compared to the experimental creep test results. Using this calibrated model, numerical studies to investigate a wide variety of reinforcement configurations and beam geometry are possible without having to undertake time-consuming and expensive experimental studies. To illustrate this, a parametric study was performed to examine the effect of different types of FRP reinforcement on the creep behaviour of reinforced Irish Sitka spruce beams over a 10 year period. The results of this parametric study showed that this modelling tool can be used to predict the long-term relative creep behaviour of such beams, and it can easily be adapted to account for different timber and reinforcement types and geometry once the relevant material characteristics are available. Application of the model to a wide variety of reinforced beam configurations will enable the development of reliable modification factors for implementation in the design of FRP reinforced beams. 2017 - 09 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Annual Population Survey (APS) is a major survey series, which aims to provide data that can produce reliable estimates at local authority level. Key topics covered in the survey include education, employment, health and ethnicity. The APS comprises key variables from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33246), all its associated LFS boosts and the APS boost. Thus, the APS combines results from five different sources: the LFS (waves 1 and 5); the English Local Labour Force Survey (LLFS), the Welsh Labour Force Survey (WLFS), the Scottish Labour Force Survey (SLFS) and the Annual Population Survey Boost Sample (APS(B) - however, this ceased to exist {{at the end of}} December 2005, so APS data from January 2006 onwards will contain all the above data apart from APS(B)). Users should note that the LLFS, WLFS, SLFS and APS(B) are not held separately at the Archive. For further detailed information about methodology, users should consult the Labour Force Survey User Guide, selected volumes of which have been included with the APS documentation for reference purposes (see 'Documentation' table below). The APS aims to provide enhanced annual data for England, covering a target sample of at least 510 economically active persons for each Unitary Authority (UA) /Local Authority District (LAD) and at least 450 in each Greater London Borough. In combination with local LFS boost samples such as the WLFS and SLFS, the survey provides estimates for a range of indicators down to Local Education Authority (LEA) level across the United Kingdom. End User Licence and Special Licence APS data Users should note that there are two versions of each APS dataset. One is available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement, and the other is a Special Licence (SL) version. The SL version contains more detailed variables relating to: age: including single year of age, year and month of birth, age completed full-time education and age obtained highest qualification, age of oldest dependent child and age of youngest dependent child family unit and household: including a number of variables concerning the number of dependent children in the family according to their ages, relationship to head of household and relationship to head of family nationality and country of origin geography: including county, unitary/local authority, place of work, Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS 2) and NUTS 3 regions, and whether lives and works in same local authority district health: including main health problem, and current and past health problems education and apprenticeship: including numbers and subjects of various qualifications and variables concerning apprenticeships industry: including industry, industry class and industry group for main, second and last job, and industry made redundant from occupation: including 4 -digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) for main, second and last job and job made redundant from system variables: including week number when interview took place and number of households at address The EUL version contains less detailed variables. For example, the lowest geography is Government Office Region, only banded age is available, only 3 -digit SOC is available for main, second and last job, and only industry sector for main, second and last job. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for the research requirements. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version. Therefore, users are strongly advised to order the standard version of the data. In order to help users choose the correct dataset, 'Special Licence Access' has been added to the dataset titles for the SL versions of the data. Documentation and coding frames The APS is compiled from variables present in the LFS. For variable and value labelling and coding frames that are not included either in the data or in the current APS documentation (e. g. coding frames for education, industrial and geographic variables, which are held in LFS User Guide Vol. 5, Classifications), users are advised to consult the latest versions of the LFS User Guides, which are available from the ONS Labour Force Survey - User Guidance webpages. APS Well-Being Datasets From 2012 - 2015, the ONS published separate APS datasets aimed at providing initial estimates of subjective well-being, based on the Integrated Household Survey. In 2015 these were discontinued. A separate set of well-being variables and a corresponding weighting variable {{have been added to the}} April-March APS person datasets from A 11 M 12 onwards. Users should no longer use the bespoke well-being datasets (SNs 6994, 6999, 7091, 7092, 7364, 7365, 7565 and 7566, but should now use the variables included on the April-March APS person datasets instead. Further information on the transition can be found on the Personal well-being in the UK: 2015 to 2016 Disability variables from 2013 onwards - LFS and APS ONS have provided some information on changes since 2013 to the disability variables available on the LFS and APS. The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) disabled (current disability) category within the historic DISCURR variable no longer corresponds with the advised legal definition of 'current disability'. DISCURR should only be available on LFS microdata from Spring 1998 to January-March 2013 (JM 13); beyond that point users should ignore or delete it. In addition, the same 'DDA disabled (current disability) ' category within variable DISCURR 13 is also not the most appropriate variable to use because a) it is not comparable to the corresponding category in variable DISCURR due to question changes, and b) it no longer measures either the DDA definition of disability or the latest Equality Act definition of disability. However, DISCURR 13 is available from the April-March 2013 quarter (AJ 13) onwards and was introduced to demonstrate that the variables used to compile DISCURR had also changed from that quarter. Therefore, users are advised to use the disability variable DISEA from AJ 13 onwards, which reflects the Equality Act 2010 legal definition of 'disabled', measured according to the GSS <b>Harmonised</b> <b>Standard</b> on health conditions and illnesses. The harmonised disability variables DISEA and DISCURR 13 should both be present on the APS person microdata from April 2013 -March 2014 (A 13 M 14) onwards. This ensures that APS users have a complete 12 months' data on which to base analysis of the variables. DISCURR should only be present on APS microdata up to and including April 2012 -March 2013 (A 12 M 13). For the second edition (July 2015) an updated version of the data was deposited, weighted to 2014 population figures (based on Census 2013). The new weighting variable is PHHWTA 14. An updated APS user guide is also available. Main Topics : Topics covered include: household composition and relationships, housing tenure, nationality, ethnicity and residential history, employment and training (including government schemes), workplace and location, job hunting, educational background and qualifications. Many of the variables included in the survey are the same as those in the LFS. <br...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Annual Population Survey (APS) is a major survey series, which aims to provide data that can produce reliable estimates at local authority level. Key topics covered in the survey include education, employment, health and ethnicity. The APS comprises key variables from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33246), all of its associated LFS boosts and the APS boost. Thus, the APS combines results from five different sources: the LFS (waves 1 and 5); the English Local Labour Force Survey (LLFS), the Welsh Labour Force Survey (WLFS), the Scottish Labour Force Survey (SLFS) and the Annual Population Survey Boost Sample (APS(B) - however, this ceased to exist {{at the end of}} December 2005, so APS data from January 2006 onwards will contain all the above data apart from APS(B)). Users should note that the LLFS, WLFS, SLFS and APS(B) are not held separately at the UK Data Archive. For further detailed information about methodology, users should consult the Labour Force Survey User Guide, selected volumes of which have been included with the APS documentation for reference purposes (see 'Documentation' table below). The APS aims to provide enhanced annual data for England, covering a target sample of at least 510 economically active persons for each Unitary Authority (UA) /Local Authority District (LAD) and at least 450 in each Greater London Borough. In combination with local LFS boost samples such as the WLFS and SLFS, the survey provides estimates for a range of indicators down to Local Education Authority (LEA) level across the United Kingdom. Secure Access APS data Secure Access datasets for the APS include additional variables not included in either the standard End User Licence (EUL) versions (see under GN 33357) or the Special Licence (SL) access versions (see under GN 33376). Extra variables that typically {{can be found in the}} Secure Access version but not in the EUL or SL versions relate to: geography, including: Census Area Statistical and electoral wards Parliamentary Constituency Areas Census Output Areas Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (NUTS) level 4 areas Lower and Middle Layer Super Output Areas urban/rural indicators Learning and Skills Council areas Training and Enterprise Councils Scottish Enterprise Regions (from January-December 2008) Community Consortium for Education and Training areas (Wales) Travel to Work Areas Scottish Data Zones types of benefits claimed qualifications, education and training, including level of highest qualification, qualifications below highest level, class of first degree, single subject of degree, qualifications from Government schemes, number of O-levels/GCSEs etc passed, type of 'other qualification', type of other work-related or vocational qualifications, qualifications related to work, sources of qualifications, qualifications from school, level of Welsh baccalaureate frequency of Welsh speaking casual/holiday work regular/normal work pattern reasons not in work or for leaving work, reasons not looking for work payment of own National Insurance and tax smoking habits day of birth health issues learning difficulty/disability number of bedrooms serving in armed forces marital status main reason for coming to the UK Prospective users of the Secure Access version of the APS will need to fulfil additional requirements, commencing with the completion of an extra application form to demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the extra, more detailed variables, in order to obtain permission to use that version. Secure Access data users must also complete face-to-face training and agree to the Secure Access User Agreement and Licence Compliance Policy (see 'Access' section below). Therefore, users are encouraged to download and inspect the EUL version of the data prior to ordering the Secure Access (or SL) version. Further details and links to all APS studies available from the UK Data Archive can be found via the APS Key Data series webpage. Special Licence access APS data SL access versions of the APS data contain extra variables not found in the standard EUL versions, and therefore are subject to more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the EUL (but less stringent than Secure Access versions). The SL version of each APS dataset contains more detailed variables relating to: age: including single year of age, year and month of birth, age completed full-time education and age obtained highest qualification, age of oldest dependent child and age of youngest dependent child family unit and household: including a number of variables concerning the number of dependent children in the family according to their ages, relationship to head of household and relationship to head of family nationality and country of origin geography: including county, unitary/local authority, place of work, Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS 2) and NUTS 3 regions, and whether lives and works in same local authority district health: including main health problem, and current and past health problems education and apprenticeship: including numbers and subjects of various qualifications and variables concerning apprenticeships industry: including industry, industry class and industry group for main, second and last job, and industry made redundant from occupation: including 4 -digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) for main, second and last job and job made redundant from system variables: including week number when interview took place and number of households at address The EUL version contains less detailed variables. For example, the lowest geography is Government Office Region, only banded age is available, only 3 -digit SOC is available for main, second and last job, and only industry division for main, second and last job. Documentation and coding frames The APS is compiled from variables present in the LFS. For variable and value labelling and coding frames that are not included either in the data or in the current APS documentation (e. g. coding frames for education, industrial and geographic variables, which are held in LFS User Guide Vol. 5, Classifications), users are advised to consult the latest versions of the LFS User Guides, which are available from the ONS Labour Force Survey - User Guidance webpages. APS Well-Being data Since April 2011, the APS has included questions about personal and subjective well-being. The responses to these questions have been made available as annual sub-sets to the APS Person level files. Annual datasets and three-year pooled datasets are available under Secure Access from SN 7961. Disability variables from 2013 onwards - LFS and APS ONS have provided some information on changes since 2013 to the disability variables available on the LFS and APS. The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) disabled (current disability) category within the historic DISCURR variable no longer corresponds with the advised legal definition of 'current disability'. DISCURR should only be available on LFS microdata from Spring 1998 to January-March 2013 (JM 13); beyond that point users should ignore or delete it. In addition, the same 'DDA disabled (current disability) ' category within variable DISCURR 13 is also not the most appropriate variable to use because a) it is not comparable to the corresponding category in variable DISCURR due to question changes, and b) it no longer measures either the DDA definition of disability or the latest Equality Act definition of disability. However, DISCURR 13 is available from the April-March 2013 quarter (AJ 13) onwards and was introduced to demonstrate that the variables used to compile DISCURR had also changed from that quarter. Therefore, users are advised to use the disability variable DISEA from AJ 13 onwards, which reflects the Equality Act 2010 legal definition of 'disabled', measured according to the GSS <b>Harmonised</b> <b>Standard</b> on health conditions and illnesses. The harmonised disability variables DISEA and DISCURR 13 should both be present on the APS person microdata from April 2013 -March 2014 (A 13 M 14) onwards. This ensures that APS users have a complete 12 months' data on which to base analysis of the variables. DISCURR should only be present on APS microdata up to and including April 2012 -March 2013 (A 12 M 13). Note on Fifth Edition For the fifth edition (May 2016), all data and documentation have been enhanced and a revised version of the 2015 data file was deposited. Main Topics : Topics covered include: household composition and relationships, housing tenure, nationality, ethnicity and residential history, employment and training (including government schemes), workplace and location, job hunting, educational background and qualifications.

40|$|The {{interference}} {{of radio}} amateurs {{and other equipment}} sensitive to electromagnetic fields from broadband communication on telecommunication lines (xDSL) is investigated. The work {{is focused on the}} interference of radio amateurs since they seem to be most sensitive for this kind of interference. The regulations in this area have been studied, primarily the EMC-directive and the <b>harmonised</b> <b>standards.</b> The EMC-directive states that radio amateurs and sensitive equipment must not be disturbed. The current <b>harmonised</b> <b>standards</b> deal with the topic but does not yet contain any limits. Electromagnetic field theory, transmission line theory and antenna theory have been combined to build models of different paths for interfering signals which were sustained by measurements. Measurements are performed with the purpose to verify the theory and to investigate how electrical and geometrical variables and other factors influence the interference on radio amateurs from an aerial telecommunication line.

50|$|The {{best way}} to {{demonstrate}} that these essential requirements have been met is by meeting the requirements of an applicable ‘harmonised standard,’ which offer a presumption of conformity to the essential requirements, although the use of standards usually remains voluntary. <b>Harmonised</b> <b>standards</b> can be identified by searching the ‘Official Journal’ on the European Commission’s website, or by visiting the New Approach website established by the European Commission and EFTA with the European Standardisation Organisations.|$|R
