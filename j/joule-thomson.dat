5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its <b>Joule–Thomson</b> inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficients from the more easily measured isothermal <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient. It is used in the following to obtain a mathematical expression for the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient in terms of the volumetric properties of a fluid.|$|E
25|$|In thermodynamics, the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect (also {{known as}} the Joule–Kelvin effect, Kelvin–Joule effect, or <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion) {{describes}} the temperature change of a real gas or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is forced through a valve or porous plug while kept insulated so that no heat is exchanged with the environment. This procedure is called a throttling process or <b>Joule–Thomson</b> process. At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium and neon cool upon expansion by the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> process; these three gases experience the same effect but only at lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|It is easy {{to verify}} that for an ideal gas defined by {{suitable}} microscopic postulates that αT = 1, so the temperature change of such an ideal gas at a <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion is zero.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} mechanism {{associated with}} the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect {{is closely related to}} that of a shock wave, although a shock wave differs in that the change in bulk kinetic energy of the gas flow is not negligible.|$|E
25|$|The cooling {{produced}} in the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion makes it a valuable tool in refrigeration. The effect is applied in the Linde technique as a standard process in the petrochemical industry, where the cooling effect is used to liquefy gases, and also in many cryogenic applications (e.g. {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon. However, the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect can be used to liquefy even helium, provided that the helium gas is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> {{effect is}} {{achieved}} by allowing the gas to expand through a throttling device (usually a valve) which must be very well insulated to prevent any heat transfer to or from the gas. No external work is extracted from the gas during the expansion (the gas must not be expanded through a turbine, for example).|$|E
25|$|As soon as Joule {{read the}} paper he wrote to Thomson with his {{comments}} and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect, and the published results did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the kinetic theory.|$|E

25|$|A {{teaching}} laboratory demonstration for {{the production}} of dry ice is to use a 15 lb aluminum carbon dioxide fire extinguisher with a porous fabric collecting bag over the nozzle. The <b>Joule-Thomson</b> expansion of the gas lowers the temperature enough to produce an approximate 50/50 mixture of CO2 gas and dry ice snow also called dust that is collected in the bag. This is an inefficient process, and unsuitable for even lab-scale production. The expansion is inefficient, fire extinguishers are an expensive way to buy carbon dioxide, especially when a signed and dated fire extinguisher certification is required.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{expansion}} {{discussed in this}} article, in which a gas or liquid at pressure P1 flows into a region of lower pressure P2 without significant change in kinetic energy, is called the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion. The expansion is inherently irreversible. During this expansion, enthalpy remains unchanged (see proof below). Unlike a free expansion, work is done, causing a change in internal energy. Whether the internal energy increases or decreases is determined by whether work is done on or by the fluid; that {{is determined by the}} initial and final states of the expansion and the properties of the fluid.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{refrigeration}} include the {{air cycle machine}} used in aircraft; the vortex tube used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and thermoacoustic refrigeration using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; steam jet cooling popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many Stirling cycle heat engines can be run backwards {{to act as a}} refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, <b>Joule-Thomson</b> coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.|$|E
25|$|James Dewar {{initiated}} {{research into}} electrical resistance at low temperatures. Dewar and John Ambrose Fleming predicted that at absolute zero, pure metals would become perfect electromagnetic conductors (though, later, Dewar altered his {{opinion on the}} disappearance of resistance, believing that {{there would always be}} some resistance). Walther Hermann Nernst developed the third law of thermodynamics and stated that absolute zero was unattainable. Carl von Linde and William Hampson, both commercial researchers, nearly at the same time filed for patents on the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect for the liquefaction of gases. Linde's patent was the climax of 20 years of systematic investigation of established facts, using a regenerative counterflow method. Hampson's designs was also of a regenerative method. The combined process became known as the Hampson–Linde liquefaction process.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two factors}} that can change the {{temperature}} of a fluid during an adiabatic expansion: a change in internal energy or the conversion between potential and kinetic internal energy. Temperature is the measure of thermal kinetic energy (energy associated with molecular motion); so a change in temperature indicates a change in thermal kinetic energy. The internal energy {{is the sum of}} thermal kinetic energy and thermal potential energy. Thus, even if the internal energy does not change, the temperature can change due to conversion between kinetic and potential energy; this is what happens in a free expansion and typically produces a decrease in temperature as the fluid expands. If work is done on or by the fluid as it expands, then the total internal energy changes. This is what happens in a <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion and can produce larger heating or cooling than observed in a free expansion.|$|E
25|$|Kelvin and Clausius {{also stated}} the second law of thermodynamics, which was {{originally}} formulated {{in terms of}} the fact that heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter. Other formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in Thomson and Peter Guthrie Tait's influential work Treatise on Natural Philosophy) and Kelvin in particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second Law was the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion had been discussed in some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault measured the speed of light in water and find that it is slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect or Joule–Kelvin effect. Hermann von Helmholtz puts forward the idea of the heat death of the universe in 1854, the same year that Clausius established the importance of dQ/T (Clausius's theorem) (though he did not yet name the quantity).|$|E
2500|$|This {{provides}} an expression for the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient {{in terms of}} the commonly available properties heat capacity, molar volume, and thermal expansion coefficient. It shows that the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> inversion temperature, at which [...] is zero, occurs when the coefficient of thermal expansion is equal to the inverse of the temperature. Since this is true at all temperatures for ideal gases (see expansion in gases), the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient of an ideal gas is zero at all temperatures.|$|E

2500|$|... where [...] is {{internal}} energy, [...] is pressure, and [...] is volume. Under {{the conditions}} of a <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion, the change in [...] represents the work done by the fluid (see the proof below). If [...] increases, with [...] constant, then [...] must decrease {{as a result of}} the fluid doing work on its surroundings. This produces a decrease in temperature and results in a positive <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient. Conversely, a decrease in [...] means that work is done on the fluid and the internal energy increases. If the increase in internal energy exceeds the increase in potential energy, there will be an increase in the temperature of the fluid and the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient will be negative.|$|E
2500|$|Helium and {{hydrogen}} are two gases whose <b>Joule–Thomson</b> inversion temperatures at a pressure of one atmosphere are very low (e.g., about 45 K (−228°C) for helium). [...] Thus, helium {{and hydrogen}} warm when expanded at constant enthalpy at typical room temperatures. [...] On the other hand, nitrogen and oxygen, {{the two most}} abundant gases in air, have inversion temperatures of 621 K (348°C) and 764 K (491°C) respectively: these gases can be cooled from room temperature by the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect.|$|E
2500|$|All real gases have an {{inversion}} {{point at}} which the value of [...] changes sign. The temperature of this point, the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> inversion temperature, depends on the pressure of the gas before expansion.|$|E
2500|$|In a gas {{expansion}} {{the pressure}} decreases, so {{the sign of}} [...] is negative by definition. With that in mind, the following table explains when the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect cools or warms a real gas: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{temperature}} change produced during a <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion is quantified by the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient, [...] This [...] coefficient may be either positive (corresponding to cooling) or negative (heating); the regions where each occurs for molecular nitrogen, N2, {{are shown in}} the figure. Note that most conditions in the figure correspond to N2 being a supercritical fluid, where it has some properties of a gas and some of a liquid, but can not be really described as being either. The coefficient is negative at both very high and very low temperatures; at very high pressure it is negative at all temperatures. The maximum inversion temperature (621 K for N2) occurs as zero pressure is approached. For N2 gas at low pressures, [...] is negative at high temperatures and positive at low temperatures. At temperatures below the gas-liquid coexistence curve, N2 condenses to form a liquid and the coefficient again becomes negative. Thus, for N2 gas below 621 K, a <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion {{can be used to}} cool the gas until liquid N2 forms.|$|E
2500|$|The partial {{derivative}} {{on the left}} is the isothermal <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient, , and the one on the right can be expressed in terms of the coefficient of thermal expansion via a Maxwell relation. The appropriate relation is ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ratio of}} the value of [...] to that {{expected}} for an ideal gas at the same temperature is called the compressibility factor, [...] For a gas, this is typically less than unity at low temperature and greater than unity at high temperature (see the discussion in compressibility factor). At low pressure, the value of [...] always moves towards unity as a gas expands. Thus at low temperature, [...] and [...] will increase as the gas expands, resulting in a positive <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient. At high temperature, [...] and [...] decrease as the gas expands; if the decrease is large enough, the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient will be negative.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first step}} in obtaining these results is {{to note that the}} <b>Joule–Thomson</b> {{coefficient}} involves the three variables T, P, and H. A useful result is immediately obtained by applying the cyclic rule; in terms of these three variables that rule may be written ...|$|E
2500|$|For liquids, and for {{supercritical}} fluids under high pressure, [...] {{increases as}} pressure increases. This {{is due to}} molecules being forced together, so that the volume can barely decrease due to higher pressure. Under such conditions, the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient is negative, {{as seen in the}} figure above.|$|E
2500|$|For {{an ideal}} gas, [...] {{does not change}} during a <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion. As a result, there is no change in {{internal}} energy; since {{there is also no}} change in thermal potential energy, there can be no change in thermal kinetic energy and, therefore, no change in temperature. In real gases, [...] does change.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to think physically about what the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> coefficient, [...] , represents. Also, modern determinations of [...] do not use the original method used by Joule and Thomson, but instead measure a different, closely related quantity.

2500|$|See the Derivation of the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> (Kelvin) {{coefficient}} {{below for}} {{the proof of}} this relation. The value of [...] is typically expressed in °C/bar (SI units: K/Pa) and depends {{on the type of}} gas and on the temperature and pressure of the gas before expansion. Its pressure dependence is usually only a few percent for pressures up to 100 bar.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{processes}} for liquefying natural gas in large quantities. The {{first is the}} cascade process, in which the natural gas is cooled by another gas {{which in turn has}} been cooled by still another gas, hence named the [...] "cascade" [...] process. There are usually two cascade cycles prior to the liquid natural gas cycle. The other method is the Linde process, with a variation of the Linde process, called the Claude process, being sometimes used. In this process, the gas is cooled regeneratively by continually passing it through an orifice until it is cooled to temperatures at which it liquefies. The cooling of gas by expanding it through an orifice was developed by James Joule and William Thomson and is known as the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> effect. Lee Twomey used the cascade process for his patents.|$|E
2500|$|In {{thermodynamics}} so-called [...] "specific" [...] quantities are quantities {{per unit}} mass (kg) and are denoted by lower-case characters. So h, u, and v are the specific enthalpy, specific internal energy, and specific volume (volume per unit mass, or reciprocal density), respectively. In a <b>Joule–Thomson</b> process the specific enthalpy h remains constant. To prove this, {{the first step}} is to compute the net work done when a mass m of the gas moves through the plug. This amount of gas has a volume of V1 = m v1 in the region at pressure P1 (region 1) and a volume V2 = m v2 when in the region at pressure P2 (region 2). Then in region 1, the [...] "flow work" [...] done on the amount of gas by the rest of the gas is: W1 = m P1v1. In region 2, the work done by the amount of gas on the rest of the gas is: W2 = m P2v2.
