5|$|The {{history of}} {{observations}} of Mars {{is marked by}} the oppositions of Mars, when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making it <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Earth.|$|E

It is close to the Luna Park (formerly Astroland) amusement park; the Scream Zone area, operated by Luna Park; Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park; the Cyclone roller coaster, the Thunderbolt roller coaster; and the amusement area that replaced the former Steeplechase Park. Other nearby attractions include the original Nathan's Famous store and the world-famous Riegelmann Boardwalk.

5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (often given the name Vulcan) <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E

5|$|The {{first shot}} on goal was {{registered}} by Bonaventure Kalou, who forced a save out of Jens Lehmann. After 10 minutes, Shinji Ono spotted Lehmann off his line but sent his lofted shot wide of the target. This sparked Dortmund into life; they were thwarted when Patrick Paauwe intercepted Jan Koller {{just as he}} was looking to get his shot away. On 15 minutes, they came <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> breaking the deadlock, when Amoroso picked out Tomáš Rosický; however, he shot straight at Edwin Zoetebier. On 19 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk came close to scoring with a free kick, which hit the right-hand post. Feyenoord's Tomasz Rząsa was then booked for dissent on 23 minutes, and following the resulting free kick, Evanílson came close to scoring, though his shot went over the crossbar after Ewerthon's pass had sent him through.|$|E

25|$|The raised voltage opened {{many more}} {{potassium}} channels than usual, {{and some of}} these do not close right away when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage. In addition, further potassium channels open in response to the influx of calcium ions during the action potential. The potassium permeability of the membrane is transiently unusually high, driving the membrane voltage Vm <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the potassium equilibrium voltage EK. Hence, there is an undershoot or hyperpolarization, termed an afterhyperpolarization in technical language, that persists until the membrane potassium permeability returns to its usual value.|$|E

25|$|After his education, Raja bin Haiwah who {{was also}} a scholar and an advisor to some of the Umayyad rulers took Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz to Syria.

Ibn Katheer wrote in his book the Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah that during the time of Abdul Malik, Raja bin Haiwah also managed the finances for the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, that stands to this day. Later the future Umayyad ruler Sulaiman would also consult Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz. Hajjaj opposed Sulaiman from becoming Caliph, even though his father had written in his will that after his brother, Sulaiman would be Caliph.

25|$|Ownership of {{the airport}} passed to the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997. The runway was {{extended}} in both directions in the early 2000s. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Hovden saw 51,000 passengers in 2008. With {{the opening of the}} Eiksund Tunnel that year Ulstein, Herøy and Hareid were all given a fixed link to the airport. This gave a large increase in use {{of the airport}}, hitting 100,000 passengers in 2011. The 2012 opening of the Kviv Tunnel brought the airport <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Nordfjord and Hovden started capturing patronage from Sandane Airport, Anda. This has been sufficient for Avinor to consider the closing of Anda. Combined these two road projects have tripled the airport's catchment area.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology succeeded in extracting DNA from two fossil hominin fragments from Okladnikov Cave: the humeral diaphysis of a juvenile and a separate femur fragment. mtDNA sequencing confirmed that both fragments most likely belonged the same individual, dubbed Okladnikov 2. The mtDNA sequences of the HVR I (hypervariable region I) from Okladnikov 2 confirmed that the individual was Neanderthal. On the basis of mtDNA analysis, Okladnikov 2 {{was found to be}} more related to European and western Asian Neanderthals. A 2014 re-analysis teasing out ancient DNA from contaminated sequences allowed researchers to complete the mtDNA sequence from Okladnikov 2. The completed sequence shows that the Okladnikov 2 mtDNA is basal to that sequenced from Mezmaiskaya 1 from Mezmaiskaya Cave and is <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> western Neanderthals than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|In late November, the {{division}} {{was transferred to}} the 43rd Army in the 1st Baltic Front (former Kalinin Front), and it remained under those commands until August, 1944. A new offensive towards Vitebsk began on December 23. By this time the 334th was in 92nd Rifle Corps, alongside the 332nd. On the second day, {{the division}}, along with the 358th of the same Corps, succeeded in biting a chunk out of German 14th Infantry Division's defenses north of the Surazh - Vitebsk road. This pressure helped to compel the Germans to withdraw their LIII Corps to new defenses <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the city. Despite these marginal successes, and others, the offensive was shut down on January 5, 1944, due to excessive losses. During that month the 334th was reassigned to 60th Rifle Corps, in the same Army, and it would remain in this Corps for the duration, while being reassigned to several other armies.|$|E

Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.|$|E
25|$|Palme {{presented}} his report on November 12, 1959. The report suggests that Sweden should chose {{to maintain its}} freedom of action, i.e. not to commit to any views in the issue of nuclear weapons acquisition. As a concession to the nuclear opponents, Palme suggested to postpone the final decision on the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Freedom of action should be maintained through continued nuclear weapons research and a clear demonstration to the nuclear weapons supporters that the research would not imply any real delay as the civil nuclear program had been pursued in parallel to the military program for several years. The research was not explicitly promoted {{as a replacement for}} L-program, rather it was promoted as “expanded defense research”. This report implied that the drafted 1958 S-program could be continued and in fact moved <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the L-program in scope. The leadership of the Social Democratic party adopted the working group's line on December 14, 1959, so did the Party Congress in 1960. The Government Directive to FOA was issued on June 17, 1960. As a result, in 1958, the Swedish government prohibited research and development (R) of nuclear weapons. Regardless, research activities related to how best to defend against a nuclear weapons attack were continued.|$|E
