5000|$|The {{transition}} from traditional agriculture, in which inputs were generated on-farm, to Green Revolution agriculture, which required {{the purchase of}} inputs, led to the widespread establishment of rural credit institutions. Smaller farmers often went into debt, which in many cases results {{in a loss of}} their farmland. [...] The increased level of mechanization on larger farms made possible by the Green Revolution removed a large source of employment from the rural economy. [...] Because wealthier farmers had better access to credit and land, the Green Revolution increased class disparities, with the rich-poor gap widening as a result. Because some regions were able to adopt Green Revolution agriculture more readily than others (for political or geographical reasons), interregional economic disparities increased as well. Many small farmers are hurt by the dropping prices resulting from increased production overall. However, large-scale farming companies only account for less than 10% of the total <b>farming</b> <b>capacity.</b> This is a criticism held by many small producers in the food sovereignty movement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Server farms today often over-provision {{resources}} to handle peak demand, {{resulting in an}} excessive waste of power. Ideally, server <b>farm</b> <b>capacity</b> should be dynamically adjusted based on the incoming demand. However, the unpredictable and time-varying nature of customer demands makes {{it very difficult to}} efficiently scale <b>capacity</b> in server <b>farms.</b> The problem is further exacerbated by the large setup time needed to increase capacity, which can adversely impact response times as well as utilize additional power. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a class of Distributed and Robust Auto-Scaling policies (DRAS policies), for power management in compute intensive server farms. Results indicate that the DRAS policies dynamically adjust server <b>farm</b> <b>capacity</b> without requiring any prediction of the future load, or any feedback control. Implementation results on a 21 server test-bed show that the DRAS policies provide near-optimal response time while lowering power consumption by about 30 % when compared to static provisioning policies that employ a fixed number of servers.

The main objective of this study was to introduce a comparative analysis of different broiler <b>farm</b> <b>capacities</b> in Jordan to determine the best viable capacity to be adopted. A total of 21, 72, and 7 producers were interviewed representing small, medium, and large farms respectively. A structured questionnaire was designed to obtain information from respondents. The Net Present Value (NPV), the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the Benefits-Costs ratio (B/C) were the discounted financial indicators used to achieve the goals of the study. The results of the study revealed that all the financial indicators used were economically acceptable in the medium and large size broiler production capacities. The NPV for these two capacities was positive and acceptable (23437 and 55880 JDs respectively). The benefits of these two capacities outweighed the actual costs that went in the project. For small farms, the NPV value was negative indicating non viable type of business compared to the other two capacities. Each money unit invested in small farms will cause a loss of 12. 8 units (IRR = - 12. 8 %). On the other hand, each money unit invested in medium and large farms will provide returns higher of about 22 % than the costs paid (IRR = almost 22 % for both). The payback for these two capacities was 1. 06 times the costs meaning that for every unit of cost the project will get 1. 06 units of gain. Adoption of medium to large broiler <b>farm</b> <b>capacities</b> in Jordan is recommended by this study...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a wind farm is affected by several key factors that can be classified into two cate-gories: the natural factors and the design factors. Hence, the planning of a wind farm requires a clear quantitative {{understanding of how the}} balance between the concerned objectives (e. g., socia-economic, engineering, and environmental objectives) is affected by these key factors. This understanding is lacking {{in the state of the}} art in wind farm design. The wind <b>farm</b> <b>capacity</b> factor is one of the primary perfor-mance criteria of a wind energy project. For a given land (or sea area) and wind resource, the maximum capacity factor of a particular number of wind turbines can be reached by optimally adjusting the layout of turbines. However, this layout adjustment is constrained owing to the limited land resource. This paper proposes a Bi-level Multi-objective Wind Farm Optimization (BMWFO) framework for planning effective wind energy projects. Two important performance objectives considered in this paper are: (i) wind <b>farm</b> <b>Capacity</b> Factor (CF) and (ii) Land Area per MW Installed (LAMI). Turbine locations, land area, and nameplate capacity are treated as design variables in this work. In the proposed framework, the Capacity Factor- Land Area per MW Installed (CF- LAMI) trade-off is parametrically represented as a function of the nameplate capacity. Such a helpful parameterization of trade-offs is unique in the win...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} wind <b>farm</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{addressed}} through {{study of a}} simple but generic system. Wind-farm size is {{defined in terms of}} its rating relative to system fault level at the wind-farm terminals. The voltage rise for a wind <b>farm</b> whose <b>capacity</b> is 20 % of system fault rating is determined for various utility network reactance-to-resistance ratios (X/R). The focus is on a network with an X/R ratio of unity, typical of 33 kV networks in the UK. It is shown that capacitive compensation for a fixed-speed wind turbine generator can contribute to the voltage rise problem. A typical compensation scheme, with extra capacitance being switched in as active power increases, results in the maximum allowed voltage rise for a wind-farm capacity of 13 % of system fault rating. A modified scheme, with capacitive compensation being reduced at greater active power outputs, enables the capacity to be increased to 20 % of system fault rating. The modified scheme leads to slightly increased network losses. It has the advantage that the reduced capacitive compensation is below the level required for self excitation. An analogous study for a wind farm based on doubly-fed induction generators results in the same capacity limitation, but with slightly reduced losses...|$|R

40|$|Rice is a main {{food for}} Iranian people {{and has an}} {{important}} role in providing food security. Regarding the population growth, increase of rice production and reduction of losses have special importance in prevention of rice import. Rice losses in the harvest stage are the highest through the whole production period of this crop and hence the reduction of these losses is necessary. Provision of this purpose depends on on-time harvesting and separation of grains from chaff with the least grain losses, and choosing a suitable harvesting method. The choice of harvesting method depends on various factors in each region; thus, different harvest methods in each region must be compared while conducted in the same conditions. In order to recommend the beast harvest method in Shivan-Chardavol region, three harvesting methods (manually, rice-specific combine harvester and conventional cereals combine harvester) were considered as three experimental treatments and four different parts of this region considered as experimental blocks. The experimental design was randomized complete block design. This study was carried out on Anbarboo variety and the measured factors were: effective <b>farm</b> <b>capacity,</b> percent of total losses, percent of harvesting losses, number of workers and harvesting cost. The results of this study indicated that the total difference of factors was significant at the 1 % error level among all treatments. The effective <b>farm</b> <b>capacity</b> in harvesting by cereals combine harvester was more than other treatments. The lowest percent of loss was observed for harvesting by rice-specific combine harvester (2. 32 %) and the highest percent of loss was obtained for cereals combine harvester (3. 816 %).
