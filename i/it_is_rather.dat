5|$|In {{the town}} hall, {{the members of}} the town council decide that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> hasty to come to a {{decision}} about creating a new post after just ten years of discussion. They continue agreeing to pass no resolutions on other matters. They discuss Ox's request for a meeting.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Nicholas lies in {{the centre}} of Sapareva Banya. Its {{architecture}} is rather simple, with a single nave, a single apse and no narthex present. The church follows the Byzantine cross-in-square design, with unusually short arms of equal size. The dome has twelve sides and is of no particular height, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> large for the church's size. The apse is situated on the church's eastern side; its shape is semicircular and it features a window. The entrance {{is located on the}} west wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} for starfish is ancient, {{dating back to}} the Ordovician around 450 million years ago, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> poor, as starfish tend to {{disintegrate}} after death. Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.|$|E
5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
5|$|Superficially, the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{resembles the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> robust in build, with a short and blunt snout. The large {{nostrils}} are preceded by well-developed, triangular flaps of skin. The small, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a wide arch and has very short furrows at the corners. There are 16 upper and 14–15 lower tooth rows on either side, along with two to three small teeth at the symphysis (center) of either jaw. The teeth are distinctive in shape, having narrow, upright cusps without serrations; finetooth sharks and juvenile spinner sharks are the only other members of Carcharhinus with similar teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
50|$|There were {{numerous}} Vietnamese invasions and occupation of Cambodia, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> short-lived.|$|R

5|$|With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark {{specializes in}} wriggling into narrow crevices and {{holes in the}} reef and extracting prey {{inaccessible}} to other reef sharks. Alternatively, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency sounds in the 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.|$|E
25|$|Such corruption, {{according}} to Lindsey, contributed to Argentina's financial crisis. He noted that while many blame the free markey for Argentina's woes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> the control economics {{in place that}} have caused such problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{histories}} {{say that}} the Huang Song coin was cast in Baoyuan 2 – 1039. As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> common, {{and there are no}} bronze small cash from the next three periods, it appears to have been issued for longer than one year.|$|E

25|$|Mikvah's (Jewish ritual baths) are {{scattered}} across the neighborhood, as it is considered {{a vital part of}} Orthodox Jewish life. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> difficult to identify, as it is not usually explicitly advertised to promote privacy among its users.|$|E
25|$|Between 1864 and 1874 Sir George Gilbert Scott did {{extensive}} work in Worcester cathedral, {{mainly in}} the choir. Part of this was to commission a screen from Skidmore, installed in 1873 and still in place. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> less elaborate than the ones at Hereford and Lichfield.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} named star in Hydra is Sigma, σ, Hydrae, {{which also has}} the name of Minaruja, from the Arabic for snake's nose. At {{magnitude}} 4.54, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> dim. The head of the snake corresponds to the Āshleshā nakshatra, the lunar zodiacal constellation in Indian astronomy.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> a big admission, but {{she said}} nothing else, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Weston who broke the silence.|$|R
60|$|She {{was really}} quite indignant; though, as she had {{distinctly}} refused Jim's offer, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> hard to see why.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rather</b> {{a silent}} drive, for Will obediently kept his muffler up, and Tom {{fell into a}} brown study.|$|R
25|$|Some {{of these}} {{examples}} are, like the Tipler cylinder, rather artificial, but the exterior {{part of the}} Kerr solution {{is thought to be}} in some sense generic, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> unnerving to learn that its interior contains CTCs. Most physicists feel that CTCs in such solutions are artifacts.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface water}} {{temperature}} varies {{on the south}} of the sea from 19°C in August to 24°C in February. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> warm and stable at 27–28 °С in the north all through the year. Water salinity is 34.5–35.5‰ (parts per thousand). The water is mostly very clear, with the visibility of about 30 metres (100ft) near the reefs.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{simplicity}} of the above proof, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> difficult for an automated theorem prover to produce it. The main difficulty lies in an automated discovery of the Cantor diagonal set. Lawrence Paulson noted in 1992 that Otter could not do it, whereas Isabelle could, albeit {{with a certain amount of}} direction in terms of tactics that might perhaps be considered cheating.|$|E

25|$|This snail {{lives in}} wetlands, springs, and seeps, {{and only two}} of its natural {{habitats}} are known to exist: Three Lakes, a meadow near Kanab, Utah, and Vasey's Paradise, a spring along the Colorado River within Grand Canyon National Park. In its natural habitat <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> polyphagous, feeding mainly on bacteria, plants and fungi, and reproduces during the summer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} the Old Lady finally agrees {{to sit for}} George, losing herself in fond {{memories}} of his childhood that George repeatedly disputes. She bemoans Paris's changing skyline, and he encourages her to see the beauty {{in the world as}} <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>rather</b> than how it has been ("Beautiful"). The American Tourists arrive with Louis and Dot, who holds her newborn daughter, Marie. George refuses to acknowledge her or his child, able to offer only a feeble apology as Dot departs sadly.|$|E
25|$|In this {{district}} nearly every ancient site is associated in tradition with either Sarah Curran or Robert Emmet {{and it is}} not surprising therefore to find that this burial place has been suggested as the last resting place of Robert Emmet. This tradition goes back for well over a century and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> surprising that this site was not investigated when the search for Emmet's remains was being made at places a great deal less accessible and no less improbable.|$|E
