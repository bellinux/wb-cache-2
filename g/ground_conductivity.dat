2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high <b>ground</b> <b>conductivity.</b> If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|E

Previous regional geophysical studies and water quality data showed high <b>ground</b> <b>conductivities</b> associated with seawater intrusion (increased chloride concentrations) and other processes near the canal. New electromagnetic and resistivity surveys demonstrate the shallow high-conductivity zone associated with seawater mixing extends 150 – 200 m perpendicular to the canal along the westernmost 7 km of the canal. <b>Ground</b> <b>conductivities</b> show no significant deviations from background values along the eastern 6 km of the canal.

Superimposed on this general trend are considerable local variations which probably reflect spatial variability in the fracturing of carbonate rocks {{and the impact of}} gravel mining operations. Comparison of vertical electrical soundings made in 1994 and in 1986 (Hagemeyer and Stewart, 1991) suggests that the saline water zone around the canal was stable during this period.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{borehole}} heat exchangers for ground source {{heat pump system}} applications requires thermal properties, like <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> and borehole thermal resistance, as inputs. These properties are often determined from an in-situ thermal response test of a pilot borehole. For groundwater-filled boreholes, the <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> and borehole resistance estimations are affected by the heat-injection rates used during the test. Most existing methods for evaluating thermal response tests were not originally developed to analyze tests on groundwater-filled boreholes, and these methods can sometimes give erroneous results in such situations. This paper presents a new method for the evaluation of thermal response tests on grouted and groundwater-filled boreholes. The method is based on an analytical solution, which considers the thermal capacities, thermal resistances, and thermal properties of all borehole elements. The proposed method simplifies the evaluation of thermal response tests on groundwater-filled boreholes and provides accurate estimations of <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> and borehole thermal resistance...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} {{the influence of the}} frequency-dependent behavior of the <b>ground</b> electrical parameters (<b>conductivity</b> and <b>ground</b> permittivity) on the electromagnetic field radiated by a cloud-to-ground lightning return stroke. Both radiation in air (over the conducting ground plane) and underground are considered in the analysis. The adopted method is based on the classical Sommerfeld’s theory and takes advantage of an efficient ad hoc numerical procedure to face with the slow converging Sommerfeld’s integrals. This feature allows the electromagnetic field to be computed without any sort of mathematical approximation and, since it is carried out in the frequency domain, can be used either if the <b>ground</b> permittivity and <b>conductivity</b> are considered constant or if they vary with the working frequency with any functional law. Simulations have been performed to identify the cases in which the approximation of constant <b>ground</b> permittivity and <b>conductivity</b> leads to satisfactory results. It is shown that for soils with water contents of 2 % to 10 % (<b>ground</b> <b>conductivities</b> in the order of 0. 001 to 0. 01 S/m), the assumption of constant electrical parameters appears to be reasonable. However, for either very poorly conducting soils (104 S/m or so) or highly conducting soils (101 S/m), the electromagnetic field components appear to be significantly affected by the frequency dependence of the ground electrical parameters...|$|R

The results are used to interpret the areal distribution of near-surface (upper 2 m) salinities. <b>Ground</b> <b>conductivities</b> are correlated with average interstitial pore water salinities within the active layer.

Low salinities in spit sediments may be attributed to percolation of freshwater through the active layer.

40|$|Thermal {{response}} test (TRT) is {{an established}} method to determine design parameters for borehole heat exchanger (BHE) systems; borehole thermal resistance and effective <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity.</b> Most commonly, these tests are performed with heat injection, {{using the same}} assumed power level as the planned BHE system.

30|$|Particularly, in this paper, a geostatistical {{approach}} was proposed {{to get the}} best image of a <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> for shallow geothermal applications. In practice, an inverse approach is applied on the case of a thermal response test (which {{can be seen as a}} production test in the oil field) in order to get the image of thermal conductivity of the area involved in the test. As the case considered was a very simple one, with homogeneous ground geology, we were only able to verify that there is a good reconstruction of the shape of the thermal response test curve, with all the geostatistical models. Knowing that, a sensitivity study was developed in order to understand which parameter is the one that most influenced the test and how it changes the results. It was seen that one of the most influential parameters is the grout thermal conductivity of the borehole, which can change the results up to a 10 % of the <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> from one simulation to another. This leads to a 5 % difference in the borehole length.|$|R

30|$|The real {{groundwater}} {{velocity and}} the real <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> for the two analyzed TRT are actually unknown. Therefore, the considerations on {{the applicability of the}} MLS analysis to the case studies analyzed in this paper cannot be based on the capability of such model to estimate ground and groundwater properties correctly. Indeed performing quantitative hydro-geological investigations in situ like pumping tests (Wagner et al. 2014) is an expensive procedure, often requiring the drilling of more than one test borehole. The average <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> in situ can in principle be derived from laboratory measurements of homogeneous portions of the core sample extracted. However, especially in case of non-consolidated soils, preserving the sample density and humidity content in laboratory is not straightforward. In turn, a comprehensive validation of the MLS approach to TRT analysis can only come from laboratory tests. To this purpose, the authors are developing a physical model at reduced scale to study TRT procedure and interpretation in the presence of groundwater flow, under controlled and parametric conditions, namely ground composition, Darcy velocity, and source heat rate.|$|R
30|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, TRT data can be {{considered}} as a thermal production test on the studied area. As there is a well-known parallelism between the oil and gas case and groundwater production wells (Raymond et al. 2011) and as it is clear the parallelism between the geothermal heat exchanger and groundwater production wells, we can therefore find a similarity between the oil and gas tests and the thermal response test. In fact, in both cases, we have a sort of production test, which is, for the former, a well test, while for the latter, the TRT. Through these tests, we want to obtain the most important parameters for our cases: hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and saturations for the oil and gas case; and <b>ground</b> thermal <b>conductivity,</b> <b>ground</b> volumetric heat capacity, borehole thermal resistance, and undisturbed ground temperature for the geothermal problem.|$|R
