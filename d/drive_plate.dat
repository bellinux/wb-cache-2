25|$|A large {{satellite}} {{also increases}} the likelihood of plate tectonics through the effect of tidal forces on the planet's crust. The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the continental crust would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for oceanic crust. It is possible that the large scale mantle convection needed to <b>drive</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity.|$|E
25|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to <b>drive</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. The current view, though still {{a matter of some}} debate, asserts that as a consequence, a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is thought to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted. The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate. The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists. One of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movement itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement, as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism. In short, the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement: mantle dynamics related, gravity related (mostly secondary forces), and earth rotation related.|$|E
500|$|Arnold Judas Rimmer Bsc Ssc ("Bronze {{swimming}} certificate" [...] and [...] "Silver swimming certificate"), {{played by}} Chris Barrie, was the second-lowest ranking {{member of the}} crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, bureaucratic, neurotic coward who, by failing to replace a <b>drive</b> <b>plate</b> properly, is responsible for the Red Dwarf cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself). Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane. From the Series III episode [...] "Timeslides" [...] onwards, the timeline of the crew is adjusted and Rimmer's death is newly attributed to a moment in which he hits a cardboard box filled with explosives. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become the new Ace Rimmer. Along with the Red Dwarf ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with Death {{at the end of the}} series, whom he kicks in the groin. From the Back to Earth specials onwards, he is once again the original hologram Rimmer, with no explanation as to why he returned from being Ace or what happened to the human Rimmer from series VIII.|$|E

2500|$|Rimmer's poor {{repair work}} on the <b>drive</b> <b>plate</b> was {{responsible}} for the radiation leak that killed the crew, and Rimmer bore the guilt of this (although he also partly blamed Lister for the accident, as he was unable to help repair the <b>drive</b> <b>plate</b> due to being in stasis at the time). However, in [...] "Justice" [...] (1991), after Rimmer is jailed for over 9000 years for the accident, Kryten successfully argues at his appeal that Rimmer's guilt is misplaced – as a second technician (and one who [...] "couldn't outwit a used teabag"), he could not possibly have been responsible for (and indeed would not have been trusted with) work that might endanger the crew if not performed correctly. Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment. In keeping with his defective personality, Rimmer continually objects to his own defence (despite its effectiveness) on the grounds that he believes he is being portrayed unfairly.|$|E
2500|$|Rimmer first {{appeared}} in Red Dwarfs first episode [...] "The End" [...] (1988), where he is characterised as second technician on board the mining ship Red Dwarf, ranking above Dave Lister (Craig Charles), the lowest ranked crew member on board the ship with whom he shares quarters, and below {{all four of the}} service robots. As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on chicken soup vending machines that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his [...] "engineer's exam" [...] which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from stasis, where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer Holly (Norman Lovett) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a <b>drive</b> <b>plate</b> Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a hologram, having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything. The only other survivor on board Red Dwarf is a creature called [...] "Cat" [...] (Danny John-Jules), a descendant of Lister's pregnant cat who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens during the radioactive crisis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Dry-type Dual Clutch {{system is}} {{designed}} for a certain Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT), and transient analysis is performed to investigate the thermal influence on <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> in sophisticated slip conditions, which is determined by control strategy of DCT. First, a clutch engagement model is developed to obtain transient friction power corresponding to selected control strategy, {{and the distribution of}} time-varying heat flux is derived. On that basis, the thermal effects on the <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> are simulated by finite element method. Finally, the temperature and thermal stress distributions on the frictional surfaces are acquired, which shows that the previously designed clutch system agrees with thermo requirements. This new approach which is more superior to the traditional clutch analysis, can adjust to different control strategies, thus it can be applied to facilitate the thermo analysis and practical design of DCT system...|$|R
